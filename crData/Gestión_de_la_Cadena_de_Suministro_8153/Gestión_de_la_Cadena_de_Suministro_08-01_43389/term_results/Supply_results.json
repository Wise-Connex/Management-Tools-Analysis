      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the first phase of the authors’ Design for Supply Chain research that seeks to address supply chain excellence the product design process. In a global economy, companies must address supply chain issues beyond the traditional viewpoint of logistics, trucking, warehousing and include other considerations that affects design and manufacturing decisions. To include supply chain perspectives in the design of products and manufacturing processes, supply chain performance data play a critical role. This paper examines the source of data pertinent to design for supply chain using methods such as Customer Value Chain Analysis and Quality Function Deployment. A multi-industry benchmarking study also highlights the different approaches to Design for Supply Chain and emerging challenges of Social and Environmentally Responsible Supply Chains. The study revealed that lead time, quality and social/environmental metrics are the most important metrics for design for supply chain. Future research will address the refinement of metrics, the definition of the relevant data for product design, and effective approaches to incorporate the information into the product definition process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A key issue for strategic supply chain management research is whether purchasing can be a source of long‐term competitive advantage. Recent resource‐based works in strategic management suggest that purchasing <jats:italic>cannot</jats:italic> be a source of long‐term competitive advantage. In contrast, recent works in supply chain management suggest that purchasing <jats:italic>can</jats:italic> be such a source. This article explains why works in strategic management and supply chain management come to such radically different conclusions on purchasing strategy. Specifically, this article points out that the negative conclusion concerning purchasing strategy is derived from theories of competition based on the neoclassical, equilibrium economics research tradition. Therefore, the positive case for strategic purchasing needs to be grounded in a research tradition that provides a clean break from the neoclassical, equilibrium economics research tradition. The authors discuss the characteristics of what has come to be labeled “the resource‐advantage research tradition” and offer it as an appropriate grounding for purchasing strategy, in particular, and supply chain management, in general.</jats:p>",

These are theoretically interesting and informative for understanding and managing supply chains. Next, the chapter explores the power of dynamic simulations for managing and understanding the workings and complex interactions in supply chains. Dynamic simulation grew out of the work of Forrester on Systems Dynamics. While general influences of the differing players and levels can be qualitatively described, the use of dynamic simulations permits exploration of the processes by which small changes and interactions of variables and parameters can have surprisingly large impacts on supply chain performance. As revealed by the literature survey in Chapter III, the short life-cycle case is increasingly important in practice. At the same time, the intrinsic dynamics of supply chains are especially problematical and potentially catastrophic in the short life-cycle case. The history of the well-known Tamagotchi? toy is used to provide an illustration both for the technique of dynamic simulation and for the difficulties that can occur in such supply chains.</jats:p>"

When organizations source via multilayered supply chains with poor visibility they are particularly vulnerable. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework called the “Six Ts” of supply chain quality management — traceability, transparency, testability, time, trust and training — which are relevant for any product but are especially critical to the preservation of public welfare through a safe food supply. We describe the globalization of food supply chains and present data on the trends of U.S. food import volumes, both in aggregate and specifically from China. We also highlight the inherent difficulties and risks posed by global food supply chains, using those originating in China as an example. Finally, we provide a research agenda and questions to be addressed regarding the application of the six Ts in global food supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Senior managers from purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics were targeted in the mail survey. The break down by channel category interviews is as follows: 14 retailers, 13 finished goods assemblers, 12 first‐tier suppliers, three lower‐tier suppliers, and nine service providers. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold></jats:bold> – Customer satisfaction and service is perceived as more enduring than cost savings. All managers recognize technology, information, and measurement systems as major barriers to successful supply chain collaboration. However, the people issues – such as culture, trust, aversion to change, and willingness to collaborate – are more intractable. People are the key bridge to successful collaborative innovation and should therefore not be overlooked as companies invest in supply chain enablers such as technology, information, and measurement systems. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Research limitations/implications</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The average mail‐survey response rate was relatively low: 23.5 percent. The case study analyses were not consistent in frequency across channel functions. Although the majority of companies interviewed and surveyed were international, all surveys and interviews were managers based in the US. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Practical implications</jats:bold></jats:bold> – This study provides new insight into understanding the success and hindering factors of supply chain management. The extensive literature review, the cross‐channel analysis, and case studies provide academics and managers a macro picture of the goals, challenges, and strategies for implementing supply chain management. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Originality/value</jats:bold></jats:bold> – This paper uses triangulation methodology for examining key issues of supply chain management at multiple levels within the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) is believed to change how supply chains operate today. While RFID’s promise for improved inventory visibility and automation in inventory management is making many supply chain players hopeful for increased sales and reduced operating costs, these benefits do come at a cost and involve risks. This article presents a financial returns analysis that captures RFID’s costs and benefits, and quantifies the financial risks of implementing RFID for various business sizes and products with different unit profits to understand when RFID makes business sense. More precisely, the returns analysis is performed using an econometric model to understand how break-even sales volumes, unit profits, tag prices, return on investment, and risks vary between a manufacturer and a retailer in a supply chain. The results are extended to multiproduct cases as well. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to understand the returns in pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.</p>",

This paper aims to present and test the proposition that this dichotomy is less useful in complex, one‐off project environments, such as shipbuilding or construction, because projects typically require the assembly of many different, largely functional, products in a unique or innovative configuration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper reports a case study focusing on one of the supply chains serving a major UK shipyard.

He examines the battle plan against our food supplies and provides a blueprint for defense. Readers will examine what the federal government is doing to protect our food supply, from the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act to the USDA's Homeland Security Council to the Food and Drug Administration's 10-point plan. They'll also examine actual cases of domestic food-related contamination and terrorism and identify potential targets. Using an easy-to-understand approach, the author provides detailed overviews of 46 foodborne pathogenic microorganisms and natural toxins, what the USDA calls 'Bad Bugs.' Each listing includes the size and shape, source, symptoms, causes, diagnoses, associated foods, and more, for each 'bad bug.' The author also provides detailed guidelines for taking security measures at each link in the food supply chain. From the farm to the highways, addressing imported, exported, and intracountry food shipments, he identifies everything from the pros and cons of using crash beam barriers on farmlands to the various types of alarms and sensors.</p>"

The primary obstacles to growth are the large number of participants in the upstream partners and the lack of coordination between them. Over the last decade significant advances have been made in information technologies. Many new companies have been founded to promote these technical advances. This research looks at the upstream participants, primarily the buyer agencies and principles between the cow-calf producers and the meat packing companies, to determine the degree to which information technologies are currently being utilized and the degree to which these new technologies have driven improvements within the beef industry’s supply chain. We find through our survey that, by and large, the beef industry does not use information technologies to their benefit and that the U.S. beef supply chain is not yet strategically poised to enable the use of these technologies.</p>",

Prior studies generally assume that cooperative norms are pre‐existing and utilize norms as an antecedent to other constructs. Little attention has been paid to the antecedents of the decision to develop cooperative norms. In this paper, we draw upon transaction cost economics and resource dependence theory to develop a model that depicts the key factors that determine cooperative norms. Based on the results derived from an empirical study of 278 Chinese companies, we find that these factors significantly impact cooperative norms. The study also reveals that cooperative norms positively influence suppliers' performance, which subsequently affects buyers' satisfaction.</jats:p>",

GSCMS providers, according to the requirements of the supplier network leader, trained the representatives of suppliers. All suppliers of two sample vendors (manufacturers of electronic products) were surveyed. Five putative influencing factors were considered: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, training, computer anxiety, and computer self-efficacy. We find four factors significantly affect user satisfaction. The results show that the training provided by focal vendors will influence the satisfaction of users. Next, the anxiety and uncertainty experienced by users decreases when they acquire more knowledge about the operation of the new GSCMS. Finally, user satisfaction can be increased by designing the functions and interfaces of a GSCMS in accordance with the user perceptions of usefulness and ease of use, moreover, implications and suggestions are also discussed.</p>",

The purpose of this study is to explore how contingency factors affect the timing and level of supplier integration into NPD, and how varying levels of integration affect project performance. The study uses structural equation modeling to analyze data on 116 NPD projects employing supplier integration sampled from international organizations representing a wide variety of industries. Results suggest that newer products signify the need for earlier supplier integration, while positive prior experience with the supplier and the procurement of highly strategic items indicate the need for tighter integration. When employed, these patterns of activity result in high levels of perceived NPD performance.</jats:p>",

The basic idea of RFID is a tiny computer chip placed on pallets, cases, or items. The data on the chip can be read using a radio beam. RFID is a newer technology than bar codes, which are read using a laser beam. RFID is also more effective than bar codes at tracking moving objects in environments where bar code labels would be suboptimal or could not be used as no direct line of sight is available, or where information needs to be automatically updated. RFID is based on wireless (radio) systems, which allows for noncontact reading of data about products, places, times, or transactions, thereby giving retailers and manufacturers alike timely and accurate data about the flow of products through their factories, warehouses, and stores. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Total Quality Management (TQM) is widely adopted in industry and well studied in academe. It includes a philosophy and set of practices for supply management. However, these elements evolved before widespread adoption of the Internet, which transforms the supply management landscape by presenting various tools for organizations to select and manage suppliers. Therefore an important research undertaking today is to understand how the Internet has affected manufacturers that embrace TQM. As part of this undertaking, we examine the relationship between TQM orientation and the adoption of eight supplier‐facing e‐commerce applications. We propose that certain supplier‐facing e‐commerce applications enhance competition among suppliers, while others enhance supplier relationships. Drawing upon strategic contingency theory, we hypothesize that TQM orientation is negatively associated with the adoption of the first category of application and is positively associated with the adoption of the second category. Logistic regression was used to test hypotheses using survey data collected from manufacturers located in six countries and three industries. The results show that organizations which have heavily embraced TQM do use e‐commerce somewhat differently from other organizations. However, the results also point out potentially troubling inconsistencies between e‐commerce adoption and other elements of strategy.</jats:p>",

The basic idea of RFID is a tiny computer chip placed on pallets, cases, or items. The data on the chip can be read using a radio beam. RFID is a newer technology than bar codes, which are read using a laser beam. RFID is also more effective than bar codes at tracking moving objects in environments where bar code labels would be suboptimal or could not be used as no direct line of sight is available, or where information needs to be automatically updated. RFID is based on wireless (radio) systems, which allows for noncontact reading of data about products, places, times, or transactions, thereby giving retailers and manufacturers alike timely and accurate data about the flow of products through their factories, warehouses, and stores. </jats:p>"

Business continuity has focused on the business processes of individual organizations. A business process in a supply chain can involve multiple discrete organizations. This chapter draws on the approaches used by individual organizations to implement continuity and apply them to a supply chain. Typically, supply chains are dependent on IT and workplace for staff. Both can be impacted in a disaster. If one member of a supply chain is affected, this will affect other organizations in the supply chain, magnifying the impact of the initial disaster. The chapter also examines the issues of service supply chains as well as physical goods. A practical outline plan for the development, auditing, and testing of a continuity plan for a supply chain and its management within an overall supply chain governance is proposed as a starting point for supply chain managers. </jats:p>"

An information modeling formalism is presented that captures different aspects of SC information system support (ISS) as follows: (1) system taxonomy, tackling the problem of information standardization and unified presentation, (2) problem taxonomy, aiming to capture SC operational specifics, such as problem classification and modeling, (3) ontology, for representing problem specific knowledge in a computational language, and (4) ontology-driven information system, accumulating the above components in a collaborative environment, where SC members work on common problems. A SC-ISS reference model is introduced covering components of the above groupings. An industrial case study is presented.</jats:p>"

Knowledge management is the organizational process for acquiring, organizing, and communicating the knowledge of individual employees so that the work of the organization becomes more effective (Alavi &amp; Leidner, 1999). Knowledge management is an increasingly important process in business organizations because “managing human intellect—and converting it into useful products and services—is fast becoming the critical executive skill of the age” (Quinn, Anderson &amp; Finkelstein, 1998). Grover and Davenport (2001) state that KM becomes “an integral business function” when organizations “realize that competitiveness hinges on effective management of intellectual resources.” Grover and Davenport also argue that knowledge management works best when it is carried out by all the employees of the organization and not just KM specialists. Business organizations frequently partner with other firms to complement their core competencies. To collaborate effectively, partner firms have to communicate with each other information about business processes as well as share ideas of how to design or improve business processes. This phenomenon of knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries is called inter-organizational learning (Argote, 1999). Knowledge management, we posit, is necessary to facilitate inter-organizational learning and direct it in a way that supports the organization’s overall objectives. Supply chain systems are an example of business networks. Supply chains involve not only multiple corporate entities but also organizational units within a single organization. We present practices used in business organizations and networks of businesses to manage the information and knowledge sharing processes using the context of supply chain systems. </jats:p>"

In supply chain behavior there are inefficiencies. Coordination and cooperation can significantly improve the efficiency of supply networks. There are some approaches to model and analyze the supply dynamics. Important features of this environment are established in the proposed approach. The combination of network structure modeling and simulation of dynamic behavior of units in supply network can be a powerful instrument of performance analysis of supply networks. The problem of coordination in dynamic supply networks involves multiple units with multiple goals. Multicriteria analysis of supply network performance includes such criteria as quantity, quality, time, cost, and profit. Simulation approach is an appropriate tool for prediction of real supply situation.</jats:p>"

It contends that in order to successfully utilize a reverse without alienating their suppliers’ buyers need to classify their product as innovative or standardized. An innovative product is one that is undergoing rapid changes in functionality or specifications. A standardized or functional product is one that has stabilized its specifications and functionality. It also argues that the buyer must consider if their supply chain is responsive or efficient. A responsive supply chain is one that rapidly adapts to changes in product characteristics without placing undue financial burdens on any members of the supply chain. An efficient supply chain being one that has reduced costs to their minimum but has a reduced flexibility when compared with a responsive supply chain. It is hoped that an understanding of this relationship will allow purchasers to better evaluate their use of reverse auctions as a purchasing tool in the context of buyer supplier relations.</jats:p>"

A supply chain involves a number of tiers of suppliers and customers that extends from the initial source of raw materials through to the final consumer of the finished product. Supply chain management involves the coordination of a number of functional areas in multiple organisations. Large amounts of information can be captured describing the activities in these organisations. It is possible to use this information in order to assist in decision making at strategic, tactical, and operational levels of the supply chain. The large volume of information available and the interdependencies between the activities within these multiple organisations means that it is necessary to employ computerized decision support systems to optimize supply chain activities.</jats:p>"

It is better to locate most suppliers and manufacturers in close proximity at the beginning of the life cycle. However, as time passes, companies start locating assembly facilities in the other advanced countries for sales promotion and, sometimes, cost cutting. It becomes desirable for the manufacturers to avoid trade friction and to penetrate foreign markets quickly. The standardization of the product including the modularity of the parts makes it possible to do so. The partial dispersion at the standardized stage of the VCR industry is demonstrated in the latter part of this chapter.</jats:p>"

In addition, supply chain processes are so long and complex that unexpected results might be happened for supply chains. The information distortion within the supply chains is the one of the major obstacles to control the supply chain effi- ciently and effectively. As a result, supply chains would be damaged by the bullwhip effect and the boom and bust. To highlight the character of SCM, a comparison is also made among the similar concepts, the business logistics, the physical distribution and Keiretsu.</jats:p>"

However, the dynamics of the organization and the market make this challenging. In particular, the procurement function is a crucial link between the sources of supply and the organization. With most organizations spending at least one-third of their overall budget to purchase goods and services, procurement holds significant business value. Emerging technologies, especially e-procurement, are promising to change the picture of traditional procurement processes. However, the implementation of e-procurement is facing significant reengineering and change management challenges. This study identifies four main challenges in e-procurement implementation: business process integration, technological issues, value creation, and change management. The major challenge among them is change management. Critically, leadership is one of the primary requirements to make the change successfully. </jats:p>"

Many new generation products appeared in the market with innovative functions to spur sales. Some of them became popular and others did not. In the VCR case, most consumers bought a monaural VHS machine and, then later, a HiFi VHS machine. On the other hand, most consumers did not purchase S-VHS, D-VHS, and other advanced machines because those were too expensive in comparison with their performance.

Apart from the operational difficulty associated with conversion from a traditional, functional based operation, adoption of Lean manufacturing involves significant organizational transformations. It requires formation of work teams, comprised of multi-skilled workers. The work teams are preferably self directed and need to continuously improve performance and production processes. Such changes can be challenging for organizations. This paper reviews studies of human related and organizational factors in the context of Lean manufacturing, and identifies gaps in research in this area. The paper presents the principles of lean manufacturing, the organizational shifts required, and presents studies relevant to each of these shifts. The paper concludes with implications for practitioners and suggestions for further studies.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, first, the time until the emergence of the dominant design is separated into three parts: the embryo period, the fetus period, and the birth period. Next, the basic requirements for achieving commercial success are discussed. It is very important for any new category of products to satisfy all the minimum consumer requirements rather than to improve a critical factor because those products which can not satisfy some minimum requirements are defective and will not diffuse widely. To complement the discussion in this chapter, the movement of Sony and JVC in this period and the emergence of the video software industry are explained.</jats:p>"

The Product Life Cycle (PLC) is the most well-known one, in which the time is divided into four stages based on the change of sales. It is expanded by combining it with the study of the various consumer types. Other life cycles have been developed from the viewpoint of the innovation and manufacturing facility location. The advancement of technology is the driver for the diffusion of a new product. Sometimes it obsoletes a category of products. The location of manufacturing facilities changes according to the market and technology condition as Product Cycle Theory demonstrates. A concept of the industrial life cycle and a linkage between the life cycle and SCM also are argued in this chapter.</jats:p>"

Hopefully the results will be a helpful reference guide to the related literature to date for both practicing managers and researchers. In the second part of the chapter, we introduce the standard quantitative methods and models used for mathematical life-cycle models. These have been developed under the label of diffusion models and most of the work has been carried out by marketing scientists. This topic should be useful to practitioners in making forecasts, constructing estimates related to capacity, and other supply chain management forecast and planning issues.

On the other hand, manufacturers should expand their manufacturing facilities quickly because the demand starts growing dramatically. The early adopters (13.6 percent) are almost six times as many as innovators (2.3 percent) and the early majority (34.1 percent) is about 2.5 times as many as early adopters.

However, VHS (a magnetic recording system) remained the de facto standard until the DVD and HDD recorders replaced the VHS around 2000.

In the middle of the 1970s, Sony and JVC introduced Betamax and VHS, both of which satisfied minimum requirements for commercialization. Although Sony had a first mover advantage in the market, JVC and VHS group turned the face about by 1980. The capabilities for the first Betamax and VHS, SL-6300 and HR-3300, were almost equal. The first VHS excelled the first Betamax in the lighter weight, the longer recording time, the compatibility. The consumers preferred HR- 3300 because of the longer maximal recording time to videotape the movies, the baseball games, and the football games. Most videotaped programs by all VHS machines can playback except for a few models. On the other hand, Sony made a disconnection to the first Betamax when they launched Beta II in 1977. In addition, JVC formed the VHS group to catch up with Sony. This group worked effectively to enhance the product capability and the sales promotion.</jats:p>"

Firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks.

We show that agents’ decisions depend on potential cost reduction, pressure from members of their communication network, and implementation costs of their communication standards. Besides focusing on process-specific market power distributions, the impact of relationship stability and process connectivity is analyzed as determinants of the diffusion of communication standards within different supply network topologies. In this context, two real-world scenarios from the automotive and paper/publishing industries are used as examples for different network topologies. The results support the thesis that increasing relationship dynamics and process connectivity lead to decreasing competition of communication standards. In certain circumstances, local communication clusters appear along the value chain, enabling these clusters to preserve their globally inferior standardization decision. </jats:p>"

Unfortunately, these fiscally important sectors remain inherently vulnerable to deliberate disruption and sabotage. The impact of a major strike against agriculture and related food products could be significant, politically and, especially, economically. Although agro‐terrorism is unlikely to constitute a principal mode of terrorist aggression, it could well emerge as a favored secondary tactic that is designed to disrupt rather than physically destroy. Agro‐terrorism is also a tactic that would seem to have salience to the strategic calculus of the post‐9/11 militant international jihadist movement, both in terms of ease of management and the imposition of asymmetric cost‐burden effects.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article expands the debate on domestic homeland security by assessing the vulnerabilities of the agricultural and related food processing industries to a deliberate act of biological terrorism.

In traditional supply chain management, business processes are disconnected from stock control and, as a result, inventory is the direct output of incomplete information. The focus of contemporary supply chain management is to organize, plan, and implement these flows. First, at the organizational level, products are manufactured, transported, and stored based on the customers’ needs. Second, planning and control of component production, storage, and transport are managed using central supply management and replenished through centralized procurement. Third, the implementation of the supply chain involves the entire cycle from the order-entry process to order fulfillment and delivery. Data mining can create a better match between supply and demand, reducing or sometimes even eliminating the stocks. </jats:p>"

This chapter scrutinizes these practices and discusses the pivotal relationship between the information and communication technologies and its local organizational context within the region. The chapter also exemplifies challenges and opportunities of the Marmara as an emerging information and communication technology-supported region by illustrating the specific information and communication technology supply instruments. The chapter reveals that the particular success in supply side does not guarantee the sustainable information and communication technology implementation. There are other concerns including demand side that are strongly linked to a realistic understanding of end user demand, the institutional capacity of respected organizations, public-private partnership, and the joined-up policy efforts at both national and local levels.</jats:p>"

These decisions take on an additional level of complexity for food SMEs, where the products have finite shelf lives and are subject to strict traceability requirements. Nevertheless, some of the smaller SMEs have proven successful in using IS to facilitate critical decisions to minimise inventory and therefore operating costs, while still retaining the ability to cope with demand fluctuation.</jats:p>"

It is obviously that result of theoretical analysis is conservative because attenuation of water hammer is ignored, but theoretical analysis provide an proper approach for setting one-way surge tank. Based on result of theoretical analysis, optimization setting is obtained through numerical simulation.</jats:p>",

Various software industry studies indicate that over the next five to seven years, interenterprise business relationships, information structures, and processes will evolve dramatically. Enterprises will blend internal production and supply chain processes with those of their external trading partners. Currently, organizations are finding creative ways to mitigate supply chain costs while maintaining operational efficiency. New approaches, technologies, and methodologies are aiding with these cost-cutting measures to drastically reduce supply chain costs and increase customer satisfaction. This chapter discusses the background of supply chain planning and execution systems, their role in an organization, and how they are aiding in collaboration. The chapter concludes with a case study on how a supply chain management system could help an organization be more effective.</jats:p>"

By conceptualizing virtual integration as an efficient and effective vertical coordination mechanism, the study discussed in this chapter developed a model to examine the role virtual integration plays in improving manufacturing performance and the antecedent factors that can lead supply chain members to rely on virtual integration to govern supply chain integration. Based on the resource-based view and transaction costs theory, the suppliers’ specific investments and environmental uncertainty are identified as critical antecedents to virtual integration. The results show that the suppliers’ specific investments can significantly improve the manufacturers’ achievement of manufacturing goals, thereby motivating the manufacturer to rely on virtual integration to better coordinate with the suppliers who made significant idiosyncratic investments for enhancing transaction value while controlling the potential hazards. </jats:p>"

This field is still in its academic and practical infancy, and there is a need for more empirical research to build a robust theoretical foundation, which advances our knowledge and understanding. Here, the main aims and objectives are to highlight the importance of information flows in e-supply chains/networks, and the need for their standardisation to facilitate integration, legality, security, and efficiency of operations. This chapter contributes to the field by recommending a three-stage framework enabling this process through the development of standardised Internet technology platforms (e-platforms), integration requirements and classification of information flows.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the development of gas turbines the prevention of thermoacoustic instabilities plays an important role. The present study analyzes the influence of the acoustic impedance of the fuel supply system on combustion stability in a generic configuration representative of practical lean-premix combustors. Transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of turbulent reacting flow and system identification (SI) are combined to obtain a description of the combustion dynamics in terms of two flame transfer functions, which describe the response of heat release rate to fluctuations of velocity and equivalence ratio, respectively. In this way, the mixing and transport of the fuel from the injector to the flame, the kinematic response of the flame to upstream flow fluctuations, and combined effects like the perturbation of flame speed and position due to equivalence ratio perturbations are all captured. The flame transfer functions obtained are combined with a network model for the system acoustics in such a way that results from a single CFD simulation can be used to investigate a wide variety of combustor and fuel supply configurations in a quantitative and very efficient manner. It is demonstrated that a change of the fuel supply impedance can significantly influence the amplitude of equivalence ratio fluctuations as well as the relative phase of the two transfer functions, and thereby provide a means for control of combustion instabilities.</jats:p>",

The emergence of new external challenges—from agroterrorism and bioterrorism to relatively new social considerations—challenge the normal functioning of the global food supply chain. China—a salient example of a geographically vast, rapidly developing country—illustrates the challenges of adopting elements (e.g. traceability and transparency) necessary for ensuring the security of the food supply chain. A broad understanding of food security requires an appreciation of multiple academic perspectives, from economics to public health; cross‐border trade flows both ensure food security through the provision of food imports and, potentially, can threaten food security through the introduction of accidentally introduced or deliberately introduced hazards. New risk‐management systems instituted by, for example, the 2002<jats:italic>Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act</jats:italic>seek to help regulatory agencies better ensure the safety and security of food imports. Elsewhere, novel approaches to cross‐border cooperation signal models for enhanced trade cooperation that will ensure security in the global food supply chain.</jats:p>",

Glass production seems to have been organised on a hierarchical basis. The primary workshops, mainly concentrated on the Syro-Palestinian coast, prepared the raw material by fusing sand from the river Belus with natron from Egypt. The product was then sent in blocks to all secondary workshops, the organisation of which was less elaborate. Here work was limited to re-fusing material that had already been worked. The widespread commercial movement of raw glass from East to West seems to have only come to a halt in the 9th c., when the export of natron from Egypt stopped. Consequently, a different flux was used, which was incompatible with the oriental sand. The adoption of local raw materials in the place of natron meant that the management of the entire production cycle became gradually autonomous, at different speeds and in different ways, during the course of the Middle Ages.</jats:p>"

To complement the functional paradigm of business development, a business process paradigm has evolved allowing a holistic view of the business as an entity focused on specific outcomes achieved through a sequence of tasks (Keller &amp; Teufel; Klaus et al.). Existing common understanding of the concept of business process being “a continuous series of enterprise tasks, undertaken for the purpose of creating output” (Scheer, 1999) laid the foundation for several successful attempts by major business process modeling and ERP (enterprise resource planning) vendors, such as ARIS (Davis, 2001; Scheer, 1999, 2000) and SAP (Keller &amp; Teufel), to link business process modeling and enterprise resource planning.</jats:p>"

Second, with an eye toward information that may be useful for supply chain planners, we detail the motivation for global integration of the supply chain. Our third aim is to address global supply-chain issues that may be at odds with cost-minimizing strategies. Specifically, in this time of political debate regarding trade legislation, these issues involve the consideration of country of origin when sourcing, and the disparate demands of customers when marketing. A country offering inexpensive components may be associated with poor quality. Thus, despite inexpensive inputs, the overall profitability of the supply chain may suffer as perceived quality deteriorates. Similarly, a largely standardized product across multiple markets may present the lowest cost alternative from a production standpoint, but a high degree of standardization may reduce the attractiveness of the product in the eyes of the end consumer, and reduce overall profitability. </jats:p>"

I find that the quasi-random assignment to a tax schedule without an age-eligible dependent corresponds to a decrease in mothers&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27; labor supply by about 40 hours per year and to no discernible effect for fathers. While having an age-ineligible dependent results in a 0.5 percentage point, or 0.3%, average decrease in a household&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27;s net-of-tax rate, further analysis of average tax rates suggests that the variation in marginal tax rates does not fully explain mothers&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x27; labor supply responses.

There are also a number of laws that relate to protection and access to sensitive information. More recently, a number of Presidential Directives relative to homeland security have been issued, and the SDWA has been amended by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. This article briefly describes these laws and highlights those aspects that offer potential benefits to avoiding or mitigating the consequences of intentional acts of terror.</jats:p>",

As part of the design methodology, a computer simulation provides expected cash flows resulting from alternative supply chain investments. These cash flows are discounted at a risk-adjusted required rate of return. The analysis represents a process to measure the risk inherent in supply chain investments. The logistics and supply chain literature has not addressed this problem of the risk inherent in a specific supply chain project. A corporate-wide hurdle rate applied to usually conservative supply chain investments may result in less than adequate investments in supply chain infrastructure. Prior studies have determined risk-adjusted required rate of return for the entire firm, an enterprise's entire supply chain network, but not an individual project within the supply chain. This study calculates a required rate of return for a specific supply chain investment project using a discrete simulation model rather than the more common mathematical model. Individual supply chain investment projects may have less risk or possibly more risk than reflected by a corporate hurdle rate or a supply chain hurdle rate. Using a standard required rate of return could result in too little or too much investment in supply chain facilities. In this study, when the risk-adjusted rate was employed to discount expected cash flows, only two of eleven alternatives evaluated were acceptable investments. The best investment with the highest return was a 12 percent increase in ship loading rate combined with a 33 percent increase in rail unloading capacity. It provided a benefit-cost ratio of 1.25. The limited availability of publicly traded firms that invest in supply chain projects represents a constraint, limiting the accuracy of estimating the market risk factor. Nevertheless, the practical implication is that, when making supply chain infrastructure investment decisions, it is advisable to adjust risk factors in evaluating such capital investments. This approach is preferable to using a corporate-wide hurdle rate, typically too high for such conservative investments. A firm-wide hurdle rate might result in under investment in supply chain facilities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water hammer induced by abrupt velocity change of fluid flow is inevitable for nuclear power plant systems because of the sudden opening or closing of valves, the sudden startup or shutdown of the pumps and the rupture of pipes. The water hammer pressure wave can damage the pipes and cause the abnormal shutdown of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The object of this study is a Parallel Pumps Water Supply system (PPWS) adopted in a NPP. The PPWS is composed of two parallel mixed-flow pumps connected with a check valve separately, a container, a throttle flap and pipe lines. The Method of Characteristic line (MOC) was adopted to evaluate the water hammer behaviors of the PPWS during the alternate startup and shutoff conditions of two parallel pumps. A code was developed using Fortran language to compute the transient behaviors including he peak pressure, the flow velocity and the movement of the valve plate. The results indicate that the water hammer behaviors under low speed startup condition differ from that of high speed startup condition. The maximum pressure vibration amplitude is up to 5.0MPa occurring under high-high speed startup condition. The computation results are instructive for the optimization design of the PPWS so as to minimize the damage potential induced by water hammer.</jats:p>",

Via system’s thinking, key mechanisms leading to such effects are investigated by analyzing the stability of an inventory, departing from a commonly studied model. On this model, two distinct delays and a PI controller to remove offset in inventory, are incorporated. On the plane of delays, stable and unstable operational behavior of inventory level are identified on so-called stability maps. Next, effects of PI controller to stability are revealed and this controller is optimized for avoiding oscillatory nature of inventory level. Case studies are provided to demonstrate counter-intuitive effects of delay presence to supply chain management and how stability maps may serve as decision-making tools for managers in achieving better control on inventory behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the benefits and costs of selected policy options for increasing fuelwood supplies or decreasing fuelwood demand in Hoima district, Uganda. On the supply side, a benefit-cost analysis is done on a government sponsored tree farming project. In order to reduce the demand for fuelwood, two demand-side options are considered, namely, introduction of an improved energy-efficient woodstove, and the substitution of a kerosene stove for a traditional woodstove. Greater understanding of the linkages among these factors requires a systems approach. We have proposed such an approach using a non-linear dynamic programming model to explore the system behaviour of forest degradation. Our results show that tree-farming is one of the possible approaches to increase the supply of fuelwood (energy), while the woodstoves and kerosene substitution are policies that reduce the demand for fuelwood. This helps to alleviate the rural energy shortage and take some pressure off existing protected forest areas. The tree cover in the forest areas declined by 6% in the BASE scenario, 4.8 % in POPG scenario and 4.7% in TECH scenario, indicating an overall trend of forest degradation in the Hoima district under each of these scenarios. Reductions in the population growth rate, introduction of improved agricultural technology and increase in the prices of major agricultural crops can help slow down the rates of forest decline. This study does not attempt to analyse the wider energy planning program that would be needed to understand accurately the various alternatives available in Uganda. </jats:p>"

Although autonomous intelligent-agents, or electronic robots (e-bots), can be used to inform this endeavor, the paper advocates the development of e-sensors, i.e., software based units with capabilities beyond intelligent-agent’s functionality. E-sensors are hardware-software capable of perceiving, reacting and learning from its interactive experience thorough the supply chain, rather than just searching for data and information through the network and reacting to it. E-sensors can help avoid the ‘bullwhip’ effect. The paper briefly reviews the related intelligent-agent and supply-chain literature and the technological gap between fields. It articulates a demand-driven, sense-and-response system for sustaining e-collaboration and e-business operations as well as monitoring products and processes. As a proof of concept, this research aimed a test solution at a single supply-chain partner within one stage of the process.</jats:p>"

The demands and dynamics of this sector differ markedly from those of the supermarket, which is the dominant channel for beef produce and which forms the focus of the existing literature. This is a challenging environment for the application of collaborative supply chain improvement principles because of its high level of regulatory control, power relationships and low profit margins. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Design/methodology/approach</jats:bold></jats:bold> – This is an applied research project that was case study based and employed the value chain analysis method. Empirical work was conducted over an 11‐month period and included a one‐week whole‐team study tour to Argentina. Informants encompassed UK and Argentine livestock producers, an Argentine meat processor, a UK meat import operation, a UK meat processor, a UK foodservice distribution centre and two foodservice restaurants. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold></jats:bold> – The paper concentrates on the key findings pertinent to the upstream members of the above chain. It highlights specific supply chain waste elimination opportunities at both producer and processor level. It also establishes valuable learning points for the UK beef industry as a whole. <jats:bold><jats:bold>Originality/value</jats:bold></jats:bold> – This study represents the first holistic and non‐partisan study of its type within the UK beef industry. This paper adds to the limited body of knowledge on supply chain management within the foodservice sector. It also provides the first explanation and analysis of its kind on supply chain operations within the Argentine beef industry. It quantifies the magnitude and nature of the cost advantage afforded the Argentine producer over its best practice counterpart. Finally, it presents a number of reflections upon the implications of this study for the concept of best practice and also the Lean paradigm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In an ideal e-business environment, when a customer order is scheduled and a ship date is computed, the availability should immediately be reserved and not be available for future orders. However, in reality the availability data that are used for the scheduling the orders are not real time availability (physical availability), but they are availability information stored in an IT system (system availability). The availability data in the IT system (static view of availability) is typically refreshed (synchronized with real time availability) only periodically since it is very expensive to update the database in real time. Due to this potentially inaccurate view of the availability, some orders cannot be shipped on the promised ship date. Therefore, for certain customer orders, products are shipped later than the promised ship date resulting in customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, one of key decisions in order fulfillment process is to properly balance IT system (e.g., IT expense) and accuracy of promised ship date. In this work, we study how availability fresh rate (IT system) impacts customer service level. The simulation model we develop helps making critical business decision on refresh rate of availability, and avoiding expensive IT investment.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>These days, the majority of management literature stresses the concept of “learning organizations”, i.e., an organization’s capacity to change. However, it is not easy for people to accept this fundamental aspect especially when it comes to the Internet and technologies’ growing importance in business operations. They claim it’s a temporary trend that will leave little visible change in the way business is conducted. For these businessmen, the philosophy seems to be “keep making better products and offering new services, and the customers will keep buying”. They ignore changes occurring in the buying habits of customers and impact of technology. There are some businesses who are happy to follow the leader and adopt tools like supply chain management. Supply chain management is a recognized discipline to shorten cycle times, reduce inventories, decrease logistics costs and streamline communication process across the business network. On the other hand are the businessmen who understand the learning organization concept and develop a forward orientation. They are prepared to ride the technology wave to new heights and accomplishments by using technology as a defining element in business operations. This chapter suggests a new approach to this new breed of entrepreneurs. In this chapter, we are trying to give supply chain management a customer orientation and to study its results. We highlight the synergistic advantage of linking supply chain management with customer relationship management into a tightly knit network using technology. The main focus is on finding a solution to deal with Internet empowered customers and to learn how to apply technologies demanded in the new digital economy. </jats:p>"

Examples of failure in the current food safety system point to a supply system that is extremely vulnerable at many points, with contamination prevention methods that are only minimally effective and lax enforcement by inspectors. Balancing this is the fact that the food processing system is intrinsically a hazard‐reduction system that seeks to minimize hazards, risk and liabilities. Packaging is designed to be inexpensive, easy to manufacture and fill, and carry both marketing and information functions, but tamper prevention is often not designed into packages. Tamper evidence often relies on stock systems and components that are easily bypassed. Examples are taken from the more stringent pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution system. Recommendations for systemic improvement in contamination prevention include improvements in responsiveness, resilience and transparency in the food safety system, design method improvements for packages, and continued work on inexpensive, rapid and accurate pathogen and toxin detection methods. The overlap of malicious manufacturing and malicious tampering or contamination is discussed.</jats:p>",

A successful design is strongly dependent on optimized column structural arrangement. The columns are constituted of longitudinal stiffened panels having their ultimate strength characterized by buckling under compressive loads. A structural damage which may occur in these columns is the effect caused by supply vessel collision. Normally, such damage is in the form of local dents. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the ultimate buckling residual strength of typical column of semi-submersible platforms damaged by a supply vessel collision. The buckling analysis was validated using a finite element model considering geometric and material nonlinearities considered in previous correlation studies with small scale experiments. Residual strength results from the damaged column are compared with the ultimate strength of equivalent intact column to estimate the safety margin associated with the column structural capability after supply vessel collision.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer must fill the entire order. The manufacturer incurs costs of overtime and undertime if the order deviates from the planned production capacity. We determine the optimal capacity for the manufacturer in case there is no coordination with the retailer as well as in case there is full coordination with the retailer. When there is no coordination the optimal capacity for the manufacturer is found by solving a newsvendor problem. When there is coordination, we present a dynamic programming formulation and establish that the optimal ordering policy for the retailer is characterized by two parameters. The optimal coordinated capacity for the manufacturer can then be obtained by solving a nonlinear programming problem. We present an efficient exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm for computing the manufacturer's capacity. We discuss the impact of coordination on the supply chain cost as well as on the manufacturer's capacity. We also identify the situations in which coordination is most beneficial. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2008</jats:p>",

Although factors affecting business performance in manufacturing firms have been explored in the past, focuses are on financial performance and measurement, neglecting intangible and nonfinancial factors in the decision-making planning process. This study presents development of an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model. This model aids in allocating outsourcing and supply-chain resources pertinent to strategic planning by providing a satisfying solution. The model was developed based on the data obtained from a business firm producing intelligent home system devices. This developed model will reinforce a firm’s ongoing outsourcing strategies to meet defined requirements while positioning the supply-chain system to respond to a new growth and innovation. </jats:p>"

It finds that nationalization and protection policies have resulted in two kinds of instability. By increasing the cost of compliance, the government's new forestry strategy has led to non-compliance and increased livelihood risk. There is adequate policy space to address these instabilities, and doing so will certainly increase the probability of both biological and social sustainability of rural livelihoods.</jats:p>",

I call this project “old Keynesian economics” to distinguish it from new‐Keynesian economics, a theory that is based on the idea that to make sense of Keynes we must assume that prices are sticky. I describe a multi‐good model in which I interpret the definitions of aggregate demand and supply found in the <jats:italic>General Theory</jats:italic> through the lens of a search theory of the labor market. I argue that Keynes' aggregate supply curve can be interpreted as the aggregate of a set of first‐order conditions for the optimal choice of labor and, using this interpretation, I reintroduce a diagram that was central to the textbook teaching of Keynesian economics in the immediate post‐war period.</jats:p>",

We compare the equilibrium under a dynamic contract, where the decisions are made at the beginning of each period, and a commitment contract, where the decisions for both periods are made at the beginning of the first period. We show that there is a critical capacity level below which the outcomes under both types of contracts are identical. When the first period capacity is above the critical level, the retailer holds inventory in equilibrium and the inventory is carried due to purely strategic reasons; as capacity increases, so does the strategic role of inventory. The supplier always prefers lower capacity than the retailer, and the difference between supplier‐optimal and supply‐chain optimal capacities, and the corresponding profits, can be significant. Finally, we find that the retailer's flexibility to hold inventory is not always good for the participants or for the channel. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

A new methodology for the integrated evaluation of the energy supply system’s feasibility is presented, which adopts the grey relational analysis method. As an example, three energy supply systems to provide cooling, heating and power to users are synthetically evaluated and compared in multi-criteria. The weights, used in multi-criteria evaluation, is discussed and suggested. The results prove that the grey relational analysis is an effective tool for decision making compared to single criteria evaluation.</jats:p>",

The literature, however, lacks theoretical support to facilitate an understanding of the magnitude of information system integration required to support the scope of relational and supply chain strategies an organization may have in place. This article uses the strategy-structure-performance paradigm to position information integration relative to the nature of relationships within the broader supply chain strategies a firm employs. The framework presented is a first step towards a more holistic and theory-based approach to understanding the link between information integration and supply chain performance, and is designed to serve as a basis for future research in this area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reverse logistics is a critical topic that has captured the attention of government, private entities and researchers in recent years. This increase in the concern was driven by current set of government regulations, increase of public awareness, and the attractive economic opportunities. Also, environmentalists have always demanded Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to be more involved and be responsible of their products at the end of its life cycle. However, the uncertainty in quality of items returned, and its quantity discourage OEMs from participating in such programs. Because of the unique problems associated and the complex nature of the reverse logistics activities, numerous studies have been carried out in this field. One of those crucial areas is inventory management of End-of-Life (EOL) products. The take back program could possibly bring financial burden to OEM if it is not managed well. Thus, an efficient yet cost effective system should be implemented to appropriately manage the overwhelming number of returns. Previously, we have analyzed the problem based on the assumption that the number of core products returned and disassembled parts and subassemblies are known in advance. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic approach where different quality levels of for every component disassembled are considered and different probabilities of these qualities given the quality of the returned product. The model utilizes a multi-period stochastic dynamic programming in a disassembly line context to solve the problem, and generate the best option that will maximize the system total profit. A numerical example is given to illustrate the approach. Finally, directions for future research are suggested.</jats:p>",

Notably, the Appellate Body took the position that an apparant internal regulatory measure, which, nonetheless, had equivalent effect to a zero quota, violated Article XVI GATS. A similar measure in the area of goods would have been examined under Article III GATT and require a showing of discrimination. The facts of the case would have allowed the decision to be based on Article XVII GATS. Most of this paper deals with this issue. We agree with this interpretation of Article XVI by the Appellate Body but are critical of its hermeneutics, suffering from a textual fetish and a policy phobia. Some other elements in the decision are also examined critically.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study was carried out to investigate whether intranodular blood supply in histologically proven well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) correlates with tumor growth rates. A total of 52 well-differentiated HCCs were enrolled in this study. Ultrasound angiography with intra-arterial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microbubble injection was performed in all 52 HCCs and computed tomography during arterial portography was performed in 21 of the 52 HCCs. Tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was measured in all 52 nodules by B-mode ultrasonography performed at 2- to 3-month intervals for a follow-up period of at least 6 months (range: 6 months to 8 years) with respect to arterial vascularity. In the hypervascular (n = 27), isovascular (n = 9), and hypovascular nodules (n = 16), the mean values of TVDT (mean ± SD) were 79 ± 131, 98 ± 227, and 782 ± 324 days, respectively (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.722, p &lt; 0.0001). Concerning portal blood supply, the mean TVDT in nodules in which the portal supply was reduced (n = 5) was 178 ± 78 days compared with 592 ± 211 days in nodules in which the portal supply was preserved (n = 11), with a significant difference (p &lt; 0.01). Five nodules in which the portal supply was preserved did not enlarge during the follow-up period of 3–5 years. There was a significant correlation among the three groups (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.804, p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, intranodular blood flow dynamics in patients with well-differentiated HCC reflect the biological malignancy or cancer progression in the process of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting the importance of this parameter in deciding on a treatment strategy. In other words, nodules in which arterial vascularity is present and those in which the portal blood flow is reduced should be treated for reasons such as a short doubling time and the risk of rapid progression to artery-dominant classical HCC.</jats:p>"

Producers from agricultural commodity‐exporting countries are particularly vulnerable to the fluctuations of world prices: they are widely exposed to price shocks and have little ability to cope with them. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of risk‐coping strategies is conditioned by the influence of macroeconomic factors (infrastructure, inflation and financial deepening). Thus country‐specific price indices are established, and the response of production indices to price instability indices is estimated by using a panel model including macroeconomic variables which interact with price instability. Such analysis is based on a sample of 25 countries between 1961 and 2002. The results highlight a significant negative effect of the world price instability on supply, and further show that high inflation, weak infrastructure and a poorly developed financial system exacerbate this effect.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to guarantee future supplies, PETROBRAS is deploying the Gas Production Anticipation Plan – PLANGAS which will increase domestic gas supply to the South-South East regions. Mexilha˜o Field is considered strategically for the Brazilian market gas supply chain, as it is one of the five production complexes to be installed at Santos Basin and have production forecast for up to 15 million m3 of gas per day and twenty thousand barrels per day of natural gas condensate. Mexilha˜o platform - PMXL-1 will be installed at 172 meters water, will export the gas production through 34 inches pipeline with 146 kilometers of extension from the off-shore unit up to an on-shore gas treatment facility, called Unidade de Tratamento de Gas Monteiro Lobato - UTGCA at Caraguatatuba, Sa˜o Paulo. The Gas Treatment Plant will have a processing capacity of 15 million m 3 per day of gas on its first stage, and will produce, as end products specified natural gas for consuming, liquefied natural gas (LGN) and the condensates, such as C5+. After processed in the UTGCA, the natural gas will be dispatched through a 26 inches pipeline up to a future Taubate´ Compression Station at Taubate´, SP, to be connected to a main gas pipeline called GASTAU. This 26″ pipeline is about 100 kilometers long, from Caraguatatuba to Taubate´. This paper intent to present the implementation of such enterprise, where it is affecting at least three different segments within PETROBRAS. The main challenge will be to integrate different requirements and specifications from those three segments and their supply chain, in ways that the overall figure does not impact the enterprise and the time schedules, requirements and operation wise work. Those three segments E&amp;P, Gas and Energy BU, Transport, will also interact with a fourth player, PETROBRAS Engineering department, responsible to contract the engineering design, construction and assembly of all parts, following each segment standards. The main goal of such work is to achieve a process data real time collection, visualization and operation, coming from different sources as gas pipelines, process operations and measurement, with efficiency and reliability to fulfill each segment requirements in an integrated way that no duplication or waste of money and time occurs.</jats:p>",

Refinements in tissue transfer, from pedicled to free flaps and musculocutaneous to perforator flaps, have required increasing understanding of finer levels of this vascular anatomy. The widespread utilization of the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator flap, particularly for breast reconstruction, has rekindled clinical interest in further levels of anatomical detail, in particular the location and course of the musculocutaneous perforators of the DIEA. Advances in operative techniques, and anatomical and imaging technologies, have facilitated an increase in this understanding. The current review comprises an appraisal of both the anatomical and clinical literature, with a view to highlighting the key anatomical features of the abdominal wall vasculature as related to reconstructive flaps.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nCurrent State government guidelines attempt to ensure that the supply of plant available nitrogen (PAN) from land-applied biosolids does not exceed the crop’s requirement for mineral nitrogen (N), in order to minimise the risk of excess nitrate contaminating surface and groundwater. In estimating a suitable application rate, current guideline methodology assumes a fixed proportion of the organic N in the biosolids will be mineralised in the first year following the application for all situations. Our study included a field trial and a field incubation study to assess N mineralisation for both a granulated biosolid and a dewatered biosolid product, together with an additional laboratory incubation study for the granulated biosolid product. The application rates were 12, 24, and 48 dry t/ha for the granulated biosolids and 22 dry t/ha for the dewatered biosolids.\nOur results showed that the guideline procedure underestimated the supply of mineral N from the biosolid-treated soils, with more than 3 times the predicted amount being supplied by the biosolids at all application rates. The excess supply of mineral N was due to a much larger proportion of the biosolid organic N being mineralised than the assumed 25%, as well as a significant contribution of mineral N from the soil itself (which is ignored in the estimation calculation). The proportion of biosolid organic N mineralised in the 12-month field incubation study for the 3 granulated biosolid treatments (12, 24, and 48 dry t/ha) and the dewatered biosolid treatment (22 dry t/ha) were estimated to be 54%, 48%, 45%, and 53%, respectively, in our field incubation study. Both the laboratory and field incubation studies found that most of the biosolid mineralisable organic N was mineralised rapidly during the early stages of the incubation. In the field incubation, the 24 dry t/ha granulated biosolid treatment had 35% of its organic N mineralised within the first 2 months following application, while all granulated biosolid treatments in the laboratory incubations had by, day 29, supplied &gt;50% of the mineral N they would supply for the whole 216-day incubation. This release pattern for the supply of PAN from biosolid organic N should be factored into fertiliser application strategies. Our study reveals some of the shortcomings of the currently recommended ‘one size fits all’ approach for estimating the PAN supply from land-applied biosolids. Further research on the development of an effective rapid assessment for the mineralisable N content in organic wastes and soils, in combination with modelling, may improve our capacity to predict PAN supply from land-applied organic wastes in the future.\n</jats:p>"

This paper extends the previous model by solving the problem in multiple periods. Lingo 11.0 and spreadsheet analysis are used to solve the problem under stochastic yields, limited supply, and quantity discount. The main objective of the model is to determine the optimal number of take-back end-of-life (EOL) products for the DTO system that maximizes the total profit. In order to meet the customer’s demand for the different components, a wide variety of products and subassemblies are considered for disassembly. Our model is further complicated because the operating conditions of the take-back EOL products are unknown. As a result, heuristic approach is used to transform the stochastic yields into deterministic equivalents. Additionally, several factors are considered before disassembling any product. When solved, the model provides an optimal ordering policy for the multi-period DTO system. An example is considered to illustrate the use of the model.</jats:p>",

Magma from the Hawai‘iian hot spot continuously moves upward to summit storage and drives seaward spreading of Kīlauea's south flank on a 10–12 km deep décollement. Spreading creates dilation in Kīlauea's rift zones and provides room to store magma at depths extending to the décollement surface. During the period of study three types of eruptions – normal (short-lived), episodic and sustained – and three types of intrusions – traditional (summit to rift), inflationary and slow – are classified. Rates of sustained eruption are governed by the geometry of the magmatic plumbing. Swarms of earthquakes beneath the south flank signal increased pressure from magma entering Kīlauea's adjacent rift zone. Magma supply rates are obtained by combining the volume of magma transferred to sites of eruption or intrusion with the volume opened by seaward spreading over the same increment of time. In our interpretation the varying character of eruptions and intrusions requires a gradual increase in magma supply rate throughout the period augmented by incremental increases in spreading rate. The three types of eruptions result from different combinations of magma supply and spreading rate.</jats:p>",

Empirical evidence shows that, in transition and developing countries, public operators are capable of undergoing successful reform. One explanatory factor is proposed to be the creation through the public sphere of highly interconnected networks among stakeholders. Such accountability networks act as vehicles for the generation and distribution of public knowledge among stakeholders, which in turn inform rational decision making on the reform and management of operations. </jats:p>",

To effectively identify appropriate physical protection measures and systems, a systematic methodology is necessary.

In this fashion, a balanced security program can be developed with the most appropriate resources allocated where they are most needed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter investigates opportunities to integrate mobile technologies within an organization’s enterprise architecture (EA), with an emphasis on supply chain management (SCM) systems. These SCM systems exist within the overall EA of the business. SCM systems are further influenced by the increasing modern-day need for information and communications technologies (ICTs) within a business, to bring together all of its disparate applications. The resultant enterprise application integration (EAI) also stands to benefit immensely from the incorporation of mobile technologies within it. Traditionally, supply chain management systems have involved management of the flows of material, information, and finances in a complex web of networks that include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Thus, these traditional supply chain management systems have a great need for integration under the umbrella of EAI. Mobile technologies can provide time and location independence to these EAIs in terms of information in the supply chain systems, creating the possibility of multiple business processes that traverse diverse geographical regions. This chapter, based on the research conducted by the authors at the University of Western Sydney, discusses the opportunities that arise in supply chain management systems due to the time and location independence offered by mobility, and the resultant advantages and limitations of such integration to the business.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Component reuse in multiple products has become a popular way to take advantage of the economies of scale across a family of products. Amongst electronic system developers there is a desire to use common electronic parts (chips, passive components, and other parts) in multiple products for all the economy of scale reasons generally attributed to platform design. However, the parts in electronic systems (especially those manufactured and supported over significant periods of time), are subject to an array of long-term lifecycle supply chain disruptions that can offset savings due to part commonality depending on the availability of finite resources to resolve problems on multiple products concurrently. In this paper we address the application of product platform design concepts to determine the best reuse of electronic components in products that are subject to long-term supply chain disruptions such as reliability and obsolescence issues. A detailed total cost of ownership model for electronic parts is coupled with a finite resource model to demonstrate that, from a lifecycle cost viewpoint, there is an optimum quantity of products that can use the same part beyond which costs increase. The analysis indicates that the optimum part usage is not volume dependent, but is dependent on the timing of the supply chain disruptions. This work indicates that the risk and timing of supply chain disruptions should be considered in product platform design.</jats:p>",

This paper traces the emergence of the brownfield regeneration policy agenda across the UK and examines how the Barker review connects with this brownfield policy focus. The paper compares housing and brownfield policies and practices in England and Scotland, places them in an international context and elicits wider lessons for devolved governance in relation to housing policy, in terms of `centrist—local' tensions. Estimates based on published data suggest that Barker's emphasis on increased housing supply cannot easily be reconciled with the current emphasis on brownfield development and is likely to require a return to greenfield development in both countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Although there is a substantial literature on the determinants of demand for primary care, few studies have been able to examine how these determinants respond to higher supply. Some demand studies include supply variables or regional dummy variables to allow for different supply conditions. A few have tested for marginal effects of supply variables attributed at a highly aggregated geographic level. However, relatively little is known about whether there is a supply constraint and how demand responses differ across population groups. We used information from a household survey of 60,806 individuals for whom we had detailed information on supply and access conditions. As in many surveys, the annual measure of utilisation is a grouped count and we estimate a grouped negative binomial model (NegBin2) of the determinants of demand for general practitioner (GP) visits by Maximum Likelihood. We exploit a variable on which respondents were asked to report the convenience with which they were able to access GP services. We demonstrate the significance of this variable in determining the number of GP visits. We then examine which demand determinants are correlated with reported convenience. Finally, we compare the demand equations for respondents reporting unconstrained access to GPs with respondents reporting constrained access. We find that being unemployed has a significant positive effect on GP visits for individuals who reported poor access. People who own a car and reported a good access to GPs have significantly higher visits.</jats:p>",

The endophyte strains differed in their alkaloid profiles. Plants were grown at two different levels of nitrogen (N) supply in a controlled environment. Metabolic profiles of blades were analyzed using a variety of analytical methods. A total of 66 response variables were subjected to a principle components analysis and factor rotation. The first three rotated factors (46% of the total variance) were subsequently analyzed by analysis of variance. At high N supply nitrogenous compounds, organic acids and lipids were increased; WSCs, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and fibers were decreased. The high-sugar cultivar ‘AberDove’ had reduced levels of nitrate, most minor amino acids, sulfur, and fibers compared to the control cultivar ‘Fennema’, whereas WSCs, CGA, and methionine were increased. In plants infected with endophytes, nitrate, several amino acids, and, magnesium were decreased; WSCs, lipids, some organic acids, and CGA were increased. Regrowth of blades was stimulated at high N, and there was a significant endophyte × cultivar interaction on regrowth. Mannitol, a fungal specific sugar alcohol, was significantly correlated with fungal biomass. Our findings suggest that effects of endophytes on metabolic profiles of L. perenne can be considerable, depending on host plant characteristics and nutrient supply, and we propose that a shift in carbon/N ratios and in secondary metabolite production as seen in our study is likely to have impacts on herbivore responses.</jats:p>",

However, a historical perspective is needed in order to achieve sustainable improvements that will also benefit the urban poor. This article seeks to provide such a perspective, applying a cross-disciplinary and socio-technical approach to urban water supply over the last century, in which institutions, organisations and technology are seen to interact with political, economic and demographic processes. Despite a series of reforms over the years, the socio-technical structure of the urban water sector in Kenya has shown a remarkable stability since the 1920s, and into the 1980s. However, the sustainability of the public service systems has been eroded since independence, due to changes in the institutional framework surrounding the systems, while exclusive standards and technological choices have essentially been preserved from the colonial era. Current sector reform must create incentives for addressing technology choices and service standards in order to provide public water services also for the urban poor.</jats:p>",

In particular, I attempt to address the issue of whether an increase in the mother's work intensity is associated with an increase in the risk of the child's becoming overweight or obese. I also attempt to evaluate the causality of this relationship and the mechanisms that might facilitate this link. The results suggest that an increase in the mother's work intensity when she first returned to work in the period after the child's birth and before the child started school is associated with an increase in the risk of the child's becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. Conditional on the mother returning to work in the period between the child's birth and the start of school for the child, a 10‐hour increase in the number of hours worked per week when the mother first returned to work is associated with an increase in the probability that the child later becomes overweight or obese that is in the range of 2.5 to 4 percentage points.</jats:p>",

Conventional electroporation has been based on the application of short electrical pulses (electropulsation). Electropulsation requires specialized equipment and cannot be integrated easily with techniques such as electrophoresis which is based on constant voltage. Here we demonstrate the delivery of small molecules and genes into cells, using a microfluidic electroporation technique based on constant direct current (DC) voltage that we developed earlier. We demonstrate the delivery of two molecules into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO‐K1) cells: a membrane impermeable nucleic acid dye (SYTOX® Green) and a plasmid vector carrying the gene for green fluorescent protein (pEGFP‐C1). Our devices can exert field variations to flowing cells that are analogous to the application of single or multiple pulses by having different geometries. We investigate the effects of the electrical parameters and different geometries of the device on the transfection efficiency and cell viability. Our technique provides a simple solution to electroporation‐based drug and gene delivery by eliminating the need for a pulse generator. We envision that these simple microscale electroporation devices will have the potential to work in parallel on a microchip platform and such technology will allow high‐throughput functional screening of drugs and genes.

The high product variety from mass customization increases the complexity of assembly supply chains. The paper identifies the factors causing supply chain complexity and defines a complexity measure of an assembly supply chain based on these factors and the information entropy theory. Algorithms that determine the optimal supply chain configuration are developed to minimize the supply chain complexity (without and with assembly constraints). This analytical study of supply chain complexity will generate new insights on the influence of product variety on supply chains performance in mass customization. The model and algorithms developed in this paper can assist in making decisions such as when and how to implement a modular assembly supply chain and how much variety should be economically offered.</jats:p>",

This sudden collapse has been attributed to an increasing supply of shares from lockup expirations and equity offerings. I show that Internet stocks collapsed in this period regardless of whether their lockups expired. Furthermore, daily Internet stock portfolio returns were almost unaffected by the number or dollar amount of lockup expirations that day, or by the amount of stock offered in IPOs or SEOs. Most of the Internet stock decline is explained by poor marketwide returns, particularly for growth stocks.</jats:p>",

The cost functions are assumed non‐decreasing and their arguments are assumed continuously divisible. In this note, we give a motivation for considering the case of non‐monotone cost functions with continuously divisible or discrete arguments. For this more general case, we suggest a modification of the FPTAS in [Chauhan et al., <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib6\"><jats:italic>Oper Res Lett</jats:italic> 33 (2005), 249–254</jats:ext-link>].

We confirm that earnings mobility in the Nordic countries is typically greater than in the US and in the UK, but find that, in contrast to all other groups, for married women mobility is approximately uniform across countries when estimates are based on women's own earnings. Defining offspring outcomes in terms of family earnings, on the other hand, leads to estimates of intergenerational mobility in the Nordic countries which exceed those for the US and the UK for both men and women, single and married. Unlike in the Nordic countries, we find that married women with children and with husbands from affluent backgrounds tend to exhibit reduced labor supply in the US and the UK. In these countries, it is the combination of assortative mating and labor supply responses which weakens the association between married women's own earnings and their parents' earnings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Micro-turbomachinery (MTM) implements gas bearings in compact units of enhanced mechanical reliability. Gas bearings, however, have little damping and wear quickly during transient rub events. Flexure pivot tilting pad bearings offer little or no cross-coupled stiffnesses with enhanced rotordynamic stability; and when modified for hydrostatic pressurization, demonstrate superior rotordynamic performance over other bearing types. External pressurization stiffens gas bearings thus increasing system critical speeds, albeit reducing system damping. Most importantly, measurements demonstrate that external pressurization is not needed for rotor super critical speed operation. In practice, the supply pressure could be shut off at high rotor speeds with substantial gains in efficiency. The paper introduces a simple strategy, employing an inexpensive air pressure regulator to control the supply pressure into the hybrid bearings, to reduce or even eliminate high amplitudes of rotor motion while crossing the system critical speeds. Rotor speed coast-down tests with the pressure controller demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A simple on-off supply pressure control, i.e. a sudden increase in pressure while approaching a critical speed, is the best since it changes abruptly the bearing stiffness coefficients and moves the system critical speed to a higher speed. A rotordynamic analysis integrating predicted bearing force coefficients forwards critical speeds in agreement with the test results. Predicted rotor responses for the controlled supply conditions show an excellent correlation with measured data. The experiments validate the predictive tools and demonstrate the controllable rotordynamic characteristics of flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings.</jats:p>",

Irrespective of canopy height, additional N increased the light-harvesting capacity through greater contents of chlorophyll, neoxanthin and lutein, but did not affect light-utilisation processes, such as effective quantum yield of PSII or rates of net CO2 assimilation. Additional N fertiliser did not affect the concentrations of the measured photoprotective carotenoids (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, α-carotene and β-carotene) or antioxidants (ascorbic acid, glutathione and α-tocopherol); however, carotenoids and antioxidants were strongly affected by canopy height and increased in concentration with increasing canopy height. The present study found that pools of photoprotective carotenoids and antioxidants were not driven by imbalances in light-harvesting and light-utilisation processes, but rather by gradients in light.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nA field experiment located in NE Victoria compared the productivity of cereals sown into mature lucerne (companion crop) with cereals and lucerne grown as monocultures. Additional nitrogen (N) and water was applied to investigate if increased resource supply could alleviate competition and improve cereal performance in the presence of lucerne. Cereal plant populations, lucerne and cereal biomass, and cereal grain yields and protein were measured throughout the experiment. Soil water content was also monitored over time to determine whether companion cropping compromised the ability of lucerne to extract deep soil water. While companion cropping depressed both lucerne and cereal production, the combined annual biomass production was greater than cereal and lucerne when grown alone. Averaged over the three seasons, companion cropping resulted in a 31% increase (P &lt; 0.05) in total annual biomass compared with the lucerne monoculture, and an 18% increase compared with the cereal monoculture in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. Cereals growing with lucerne produced fewer tillers, spikes and consequently cereal biomass compared with cereals growing as a monoculture. Therefore, companion crops yielded 25% less (P &lt; 0.05) grain compared with the cereal monoculture over the 3-year study. Competition for N and light in the pre-cereal stem elongation period, were likely causes. Increasing the supply of N and water did not result in a main treatment (monoculture v. companion crop) by additional resource interaction, indicating that cereal responses were the same irrespective of lucerne’s presence. The application of N, water and these combined inputs, resulted in a 13–40%, 35% and 49% increase (P &lt; 0.05) in cereal grain yields, respectively. While companion cropping compromised lucerne’s capacity to extract water from deep soil layers to a degree, this practice was still able to maintain drier subsoil in comparison to the cereal monoculture.\n</jats:p>"

The distal end of the tibia and the entire talus were cleared in methyl salicylate and perfused vessels studied in the intact bones. Slabs with a thickness of 4–5 mm from 3 predilection sites for OC were examined in the stereomicroscope and with light microscopy.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Cartilage canals were present for a limited period of growth. Perfused vessels initially entered canals from the perichondrium. Vessels in the proximal portion of canals retained their perichondrial arterial source throughout. With time, the ossification front advanced to incorporate the mid‐portion of canals; and anastomoses formed between canal vessels and subchondral vessels. A shift occurred and vessels in the distal terminus of canals came to use subchondral vessels as their arterial source. Twelve histological lesions were found in 7 foals. All contained necrotic vessels surrounded by necrotic growth cartilage and 3 caused macroscopically visible delay in endochondral ossification. Lesions were located where vessels traversed the ossification front to enter the distal terminus of canals.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>: Cartilage canal vessels are particularly susceptible to failure at the point where they cross the ossification front, with consequences for the viability of those chondrocytes that depend on them.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Potential relevance</jats:italic>: A better understanding of how lesions of OC arise may improve the ability to identify, monitor, prevent and treat this disorder. Involvement of cartilage canals in the pathogenesis of equine tarsal OC plausibly explains several clinical features of this disease.</jats:p>",

Given the current high performance of impellers, the design strategy uses a computational method, which is capable of predicting flow separation and vortex-dominated flow fields, enabling a detailed comparison of all aerodynamic losses. The design method, assuming a weak interaction between the impeller and the volute, employs a blade optimization procedure and several effective flow path modifications. Simplified CFD calculations were performed on fans with two existing impellers and the newly designed impeller to evaluate the impeller design criterion. The calculation was made with the impeller/volute coupling calculation and a frozen impeller assumption. Further refined CFD calculations, including the gap between the stationary bellmouth and the rotating shroud, revealed a reduction in the new impeller’s gain in efficiency due to the gap. The calculations also further supported the necessity of matching the volute and the impeller to improve the fan’s overall efficiency. Measured data of three fans validated CFD predictions in pressure rise at design and off-design conditions. CFD calculations also demonstrated the Reynolds number effect between the model- and full-scale fans. Power reduction data were compared between the measurements and the predictions along with the original design requirements.</jats:p>",

The diameters of the pump chamber are 31 mm and 23mm, and the depths of the chamber are 1 mm and 2 mm. When the piezoelectric device actuates for changing pump chamber volume, the valves will be opened/closed, and the ethanol will be delivered into SOFC system due to its pressure variation. The dimensions of the injector chamber, vibration frequencies of piezoelectric (PZT) device, input voltages, and valve thickness and shape, are used as important parameters for the performance of the novel ethanol injection system. The experimental results show that the ethanol flow rate can reach 170ml/min at a piezoelectric device frequency of 75Hz.

The &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; isolates were subsequently typed by serology and RAPD-PCR using serotype-specific sera and arbitrary primers, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Of the 70 clinical samples, culture yielded 2 (2.9%) whereas genus-specific PCR detected &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; in 20 (28.6%) samples. The 2 culture-positive specimens were also positive for &lt;i&gt;L.-pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;-specific PCR. Testing of swab and water samples by culture and genus-specific PCR yielded 61 (21.6%) and 67 (23.7%) positive samples, respectively. All of the 61 culture-positive samples were also positive by genus-specific PCR and 45 of them were positive for &lt;i&gt;L.-pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;-specific PCR. Serological typing of 43 &lt;i&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/i&gt; isolates showed that 8 of these belonged to serotype 1 and 35 to serotype 3; however, RAPD-PCR analyses demonstrated polymorphisms among the isolates of both serotypes. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; A higher association between PCR and culture was observed for the environmental samples than for the clinical samples. The application of genus- and species-specific PCRs and RAPD is useful in the detection and typing of &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; in clinical and environmental samples.</jats:p>"

The models are formulated as mixed integer linear programs that are solved using a mathematical programming solver. To compare the performance of the two stochastic‐demand and two deterministic‐demand planning models under the stochastic demands that occur in actual operations, we further develop a simulation‐based evaluation method. Finally, we perform numerical tests using real operating data from a Taiwan air cargo terminal. The preliminary results show that the stochastic models could be useful for planning air cargo terminal manpower supply. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic results from five cores collected in the basin of the Adriatic Sea. Four cores (PRAD2-4; KS02-246; CSS00-23 and CSS00-07) were collected along a shore-parallel transect whereas the fifth core (AMC99-01) was retrieved in the central Adriatic in 250 m water depth, on the floor of the Meso-Adriatic Depression. After alternating field demagnetization, the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) directions show a characteristic and primary magnetization of the sediments that is representative of secular variation of the geomagnetic field. By combining <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C dating and the ages of magnetic inclination features, it has been possible to establish an age—depth model for all of the cores. Precise identification of the secular variation features provides a refined chronology that allows us to quantify short-term changes in sediment flux from the Adriatic catchment as well as changes in sediment routing within the basin. Rock magnetic parameters indicate a homogeneous magnetic mineralogy dominated by fine-grained magnetite. Variations in both concentration and grain-size related magnetic parameters reflect changes in sediment supply between glacial and interglacial stages, as well as changes in environmental conditions. Selective dissolution of magnetic grains is associated with the formation of sapropel S1 during the first part of the Holocene, although the duration of the anoxic interval varies between cores. A significant modification in sediment supply characterizes the late-Holocene deposits with a marked increase in sedimentation rate occurring during the last few centuries. We interpret this as a far-reaching response to the rapid construction of the modern Po delta under increasing anthropogenic impact. </jats:p>",

We find that income and wealth impact the decision to participate in different ways. Households with more wealth, measured by ownership of assets, were more likely to attend meetings but were less likely to have a voice in decision making. In terms of income, we find that middle-class households had more input into decision making than lower-income households. Household-level measures of social capital positively affected participation both in terms of attending meetings and in the number of decisions in which households were involved. </jats:p>",

This focusing event spurred modeling efforts to frame alternatives for managing the reservoir system during prolonged droughts. This paper addresses the management challenges that arise when using modeling tools to manage water scarcity under variable hydroclimatology, shifting use patterns, and institutional complexity. Assumptions specified in modeling simulations are an integral feature of public processes. The policymaking and management implications of assumptions are examined by analyzing four interacting sources of physical and institutional uncertainty: inflow (runoff), depletion (water use), operating rules, and initial reservoir conditions. A review of planning documents and model reports generated during two recent processes to plan for surplus and shortage in the Colorado River demonstrates that modeling tools become useful to stakeholders by clarifying the impacts of modeling assumptions at several temporal and spatial scales. A high reservoir storage‐to‐runoff ratio elevates the importance of assumptions regarding initial reservoir conditions over the three‐year outlook used to assess the likelihood of reaching surplus and shortage triggers. An ensemble of initial condition predictions can provide more robust initial conditions estimates. This paper concludes that water managers require model outputs that encompass a full range of future potential outcomes, including best and worst cases. Further research into methods of representing and communicating about hydrologic and institutional uncertainty in model outputs will help water managers and other stakeholders to assess tradeoffs when planning for water supply variability.</jats:p>",

Companies must either build more time into their schedules than is necessary, and therefore underutilize their equipment, or risk missing delivery windows or exceeding hours of service regulations, actions that can result in fines, lost business opportunities, or other logistical costs. Border crossing times are examined at Blaine, Washington, between Whatcom County, Washington, and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada, to assess the variability in crossing times at this border crossing and the impact of this variability on regional supply chains. Variability data collected for bidirectional trade are presented. Directional, daily, hourly, and seasonal variations are examined, and interviews are conducted with regional carriers to better understand the current response to variability, the benefit of a reduction in variability, and how that is related to the goods moved or to other business operating characteristics. This paper describes the level of variability in border crossing times and carriers’ responses to this variability and shows that the primary strategy used, increasing buffer times, reduces carrier productivity. However, this cost is negligible because of the current nature of the industry. </jats:p>",

FER activity is controlled by iron supply. To analyse to what extent FER influences Fe‐regulated protein expression, we investigated the root proteome of wild‐type tomato, the <jats:italic>fer</jats:italic> mutant and a transgenic <jats:italic>FER</jats:italic> overexpression line under low‐iron conditions versus sufficient and generous iron supply. The root proteomes were analysed by two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis with three technical and three biological replicates. Statistical analysis identified 39 protein spots that were differentially regulated in selected pairwise comparisons of experimental conditions. Of these, 24 were correlated with expression clusters revealed by principal component analysis. The 39 protein spots were analysed by MALDI‐TOF and nanoLC‐MS/MS to deduce their possible functions. We investigated the functional representation in the identified expression clusters, and found that loss of FER function in iron‐cultured plants mimicked an iron‐deficiency status. The largest identified protein expression cluster was upregulated by iron deficiency and in the <jats:italic>fer</jats:italic> mutant. Two iron‐regulated proteins required FER activity for induction by iron deficiency. Few proteins were suppressed by iron deficiency. The differentially expressed proteins belonged predominantly to the functional categories ‘stress’, ‘redox regulation’ and ‘miscellaneous peroxidases’. Hence, we were able to identify distinct expression clusters of proteins with distinct functions.</jats:p>",

A new concept retail store was established whereby a mix of raw beef products and pre-cooked meals were merchandised under an eating quality grade defined by MSA palatability scores. Products were presented fully prepared within cooking method with pricing based on the predicted cooked results. Large price differentials were established between the three grades offered, with 5-star product priced at more than double the 3-star product.\nThe principle of pricing being directly related to eating quality was extended from the retail store sales to fabrication and the purchase of source cattle from producers. This encouraged considerable innovation to optimise eating quality and returns, demonstrating the potential for truly transparent value-based pricing systems to achieve change.\nNovel systems were developed to break down and fabricate the carcass into ‘retail-ready’ product with extensive software development to trace the eating quality, value and location of individual cuts and products. Detailed feedback provided the producer with an accurate measure of value and sufficient data to evaluate possible alternative production strategies.\nResults at each level of the supply chain were encouraging with compound annual growth in sales exceeding 12% at retail level and continued innovation through fabrication and on-farm areas combining to improve eating quality and financial outcomes. It was demonstrated that the consumer focus delivered by MSA grades could be applied at a commercial level providing an opportunity to reposition beef as a contemporary consumer product and to implement a value-based system across all sectors.\n</jats:p>"

To clarify the influence of the III/N supply ratio during the InGaN layer growth, the nitrogen flow rate was changed from 1.0 to 2.0 sccm. Since metallic‐indium droplets and phase separation were observed for the samples grown by low nitrogen flow rate, it was found that these have been grown under a group‐III‐rich condition. With increasing nitrogen flow rate, the indium content in InGaN films increased. The estimated non‐radiative recombination edges determined from PPTS method (PPT edge) red‐shifted with increasing the nitrogen flow rate. The energy difference between estimated band edge and the PPT edges increased with increasing flow rate under group‐III rich condition, and became saturated under the N‐rich condition. It is considered that the existence of the phase separation is related to this behavior. (© 2008 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that an increased entry rate of butyrate into the cecal lumen would have similar effects <jats:italic>in vivo. Methods:</jats:italic> We used frozen cecal tissue and data from previous studies, one showing that lactulose supplementation caused an increased rate of cecal synthesis of butyrate and decreased cecal cell proliferation and density of clostridia and the other showing that cecal cell proliferation was increased by an exogenous cecal butyrate infusion at a comparable rate. The ratio of acetylated to total histones (AH ratio) and cyclin D1 mRNA expression were measured in cecal tissue. <jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> Lactulose supplementation caused a 189% increase in the AH ratio (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .004), which inversely correlated with cecal cell proliferation (r = –0.782; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .008). With cecal butyrate infusion, we observed a significant decrease in histone acetylation (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .02), which also inversely correlated with cecal cell proliferation (r = –0.797; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .002). Cyclin D1 expression was increased 6.5‐fold by lactulose feeding (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .02) but decreased 50% with cecal butyrate infusion (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .004). <jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> The effects on histone acetylation of increased“ endogenous” butyrate production produced by lactulose feeding, but not exogenous cecal infusion of butyrate, mirror those <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>. Thus, bacterial production and exogenous infusion of butyrate have opposite effects on histone acetylation and cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that the composition of bacterial flora may play a role in butyrate's <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> effects on the cell cycle.</jats:p>",
