Choosing the best location for a watershed and reservoir, locating reservoir intakes, algae, and weed control are also covered. Factors to consider when using streams as water sources include the location of stream intakes and the use of infiltration galleries to remove debris and turbidity. Treatment of surface water is addressed. This article is adapted from the AWWA publication, Design and Construction of Small Water Systems – A Guide for Managers.</jats:p>",

In addition the statistical profile of such uncertainties in supply or shelf life may not be completely known. For perishable items, we incorporate these departures from the standard inventory model to allow for variable supply or random shelf life, having NBUE distributions with given mean but which are otherwise unknown. The NBUE hypothesis, which is a nonparametric specification only, is invoked as a description of the relative scarcity of supply and deterioration in quality of aging items. Minimax inventory policies under these assumptions are developed. The relationship of our findings to the earlier results of Silver and Panda, stability properties of the minimax solution as the shelf life increases and an approach when both supply and shelf life are random are indicated. </jats:p>",
