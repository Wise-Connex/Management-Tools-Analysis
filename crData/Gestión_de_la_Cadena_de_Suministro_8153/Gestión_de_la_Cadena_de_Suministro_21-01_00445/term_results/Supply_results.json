SCMP was classified as strategic supplier partnership (SSP), customer relationship (CR), information sharing level (IS), information quality level (IQ), and postponement (POS). &#x0D;\nMethods: It is a quantitative research based on a survey questionnaire. Supply chain management practices were measured by items adapted from Li, Nathan, and Rao (2006), while supply chain performance was measured by using key supply chain performance indicators suggested by Ambe (2013). Using convenience sampling technique, data were collected from 203 executives involved in supply chain activities working in different manufacturing organizations in two major cities of Bangladesh (Dhaka and Chittagong). Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation, and regression analysis were used to analyze the data. &#x0D;\nResults: Results demonstrated a positive correlation between supply chain management practices and supply chain performance (r=0.67**). However, strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, and postponement are more strongly related to improving supply chain performance than information sharing level and information quality level. &#x0D;\nImplications: A significant implication of the study is that manufacturing organizations should develop supply chain management capabilities to improve supply chain performance and they should begin with developing their level of information sharing and level of information quality.&#x0D;\nLimitations: The use of the convenience sampling technique limits the generalizability of the findings. The small sample size (n=203) also warrant caution in interpreting the results.  </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID‐19 crisis quickly drew attention to shortages of critical supplies in complex, global healthcare, and food supply chains, despite emergency and pandemic plans existing in many countries. Borders and factories closed through lockdowns and slowly reopened under different working arrangements, causing supply chains to struggle to respond to this global crisis, with severe impact on GDPs internationally. Ironically, despite global communications technologies, global political structures, and the immense capability of humans, the only true global actor in this crisis is a virus, one of the simplest, most dependent forms of life. Supply chain management research and practice contains threads of knowledge and understanding that are vital to mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery in global crises; we just have not woven them together yet. This essay proposes a more interconnected approach to supply chain management to tackle these current and future global crises, weaving together understanding of supply markets, public procurement, humanitarian aid supply chain management, network and systems thinking, and global stewardship, with the more traditional conceptualizations of firm‐based supply chain management. Questions are posed to illustrate current discontinuous wefts of knowledge to explore how weaving a more interconnected, systems thinking‐based approach to supply chain management might stimulate research to support coordination of future global supply preparedness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large companies were concerned about their supply chains with environmental and social sustainability and disruption from natural disasters, conflict, and trade disagreements even before the advent of COVID‐19. The additional challenges presented by COVID‐19 in 2020 are “extreme” in being distinct from supply chain risk in that not just particular companies, but also entire societies are affected. Therefore, it is appropriate to rethink supply chain management (SCM) for research and practice to cope with extreme conditions, now and in the future, whether due to pandemics, war, climate change, or biodiversity collapse. In this essay, we first present the widespread challenges, along with some of the responses. We then list research opportunities for supply chain management in extreme conditions. These opportunities pertain to retailers' survival in the face of highly successful e‐commerce giants and the mixed use of robots and human workers. There are also opportunities to share supply chain capacity in distribution and coopetition regarding medically necessary items such as anti‐virals or vaccines. The growing role of government in supporting business, including the creation of industry commons, also presents avenues for further research.</jats:p>",

Environmental phenomena of climate change or global warming are the result of human practice. Global warming causes an increase in ocean temperatures and surface of the book, causing melting of polar ice caps and rising sea levels. Another phenomenon of waste and sewage problems has become a national and international problem. Every supply chain activity in a series of production activities has an impact on the environment.

Yet, relatively little is known about how companies define their approach to managing outsourced RSC operations and how outcomes vary across different approaches. This paper responds to numerous calls in the literature for research that delves deeply into the “how” and “when” (mechanisms and contexts) of RSC operations. Based on within‐ and cross‐case analysis of four manufacturer–3PL dyads, this paper develops a framework and detailed middle‐range theory that explains and predicts the way in which different approaches to managing outsourced RSC operations yield different results. By exploring the approach used in each dyad, this research offers managers a rich description of some of the ways that forward thinking on RSC operations can open the door to different potential benefits. The research also contributes to the development of a theory of outsourced RSC operations. Theoretical arguments combined with research propositions provide a wealth of opportunity for future researchers to engage in this topic area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID‐19 pandemic has illustrated the broad and diverse challenges that supply networks face in preparing for and adapting to significant supply and demand disruptions. While much has been written about resilience strategies, few consider resiliency from a network level perspective. In this essay, we explain a typology of resiliency strategies linked to different types of collaboration within and between supply networks. Existing literature focuses on two of these types, micro‐ and macro‐level supply network resilience. Micro‐level resilience occurs when buyers and suppliers coordinate directly on supply risk prevention and recovery. Macro‐level resilience occurs when corporations, including competitors, collaborate with institutions such as government or trade associations to manage or regulate longer‐term supply risks. This essay identifies a third type, meso‐level resilience. Meso‐level resilience emerges when multiple supply networks collaborate on short‐ to medium‐term supply risks. These collaborations tend to be more opportunistic and ad hoc than micro‐ or macro‐level collaborations, and we argue that they can be viewed as complex adaptive systems, exhibiting self‐organization and dynamism. We identify a number of novel characteristics of meso‐level resilience and discuss research implications.</jats:p>",

Our main purpose was to provide additional useful guidance on how scholars can approach the method of metaphoric transfer. To do this, we build on previous work on the metaphoric transfer method and develop the Metaphoric Transfer Pathways framework. The framework offers two novel approaches to working with metaphors that will help theorists to best leverage the theorizing potential of metaphors in their work. We also develop a set of evaluation criteria which can help scholars to choose which approach to metaphoric transfer to adopt and to maximize the productivity of metaphors used within their theorizing efforts. Our paper synthesizes the existing literature on metaphorical imagination in a novel way to provide accessible guidance for those looking to work with metaphor and to maximize their contribution toward developing novel supply chain theory.</jats:p>",

As a potential contribution to such change, we introduce the concept of <jats:italic>supply chain entrepreneurial embeddedness</jats:italic> (SCEE), which we define as the degree to which a large firm integrates small entrepreneurial business capabilities (e.g., creativity, ingenuity, resourcefulness, rapid decision‐making, and swift execution) within its supply chain. We theorize that SCEE can be realized via at least three mechanisms—<jats:italic>acquiring</jats:italic> (i.e., purchasing one or more small entrepreneurial firms), <jats:italic>allying</jats:italic> (i.e., building cooperative alliances with such firms), and <jats:italic>assimilating</jats:italic> (i.e., mimicking how such firms behave). We suggest that SCEE is valuable under normal conditions, but its value increases under duress. Grounded in the concepts of structural inertia, requisite variety, mutualism, and real options, our core premise is that SCEE enables large firms to better navigate multiple and multidirectional concurrent changes in supply and demand, which in turn enhances firm performance. We contextualize this core premise by theorizing that greater <jats:italic>end‐user proximity</jats:italic> (wherein SCEE is located close to the final customer) and <jats:italic>service centricity</jats:italic> (wherein competition is primarily based on the service dimension of product–service bundles) enhance SCEE’s positive effects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak affects not just populations but also global and local economies and supply chains. The outbreak itself has impacted on production lines and manufacturing capacities. In response to the outbreak, policies have been put in place that blocks the movement of people and materials, causing supply chain disruptions. Mainstream supply chain management has been at a loss in responding to these disruptions, mostly due to a dominant focus on minimizing costs for stable operations, while following lean, just‐in‐time, and zero‐inventory approaches. On the other hand, pandemic response supply chains, and their related supply chain disruptions, share many characteristics with disaster response and thereby with humanitarian supply chains. Much can thus be learned from humanitarian supply chains for managing pandemic‐related supply chain disruptions. What is more, facing, and managing, supply chain disruptions can be considered the new norm also in light of other disruptive forces such as climate change, or financial or political crises. This article therefore presents lessons learned from humanitarian supply chains that help mitigate and overcome supply chain disruptions. These lessons not only relate to preparedness and mobilization, but also relate to standardization, innovation, and collaboration. Together, they brace organizations, supply chains, and societies, to manage current and future disruptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increased competitiveness with other transport systems and declining operation margins have motivated freight forwarders in the air cargo transport industry to look into horizontal collaboration. This paper focuses on developing a fully integrated five-phase auction-based coopetition model, a form of horizontal collaboration where competition is preserved. A combinatorial auction is used to exchange transportation requests without having to reveal critical company information. Freight forwarders submit requests into an auction pool, where they are grouped into attractive bundles by a central planner and offered for auction. The request selection and bundling procedures are based on the time windows of the request deliveries. A freight forwarder’s bid on each bundle is equal to the marginal profit of that bundle, which is obtained by solving two NP-hard routing problems with a simulated annealing and large neighborhood search meta-heuristic. A unique aspect of the auction is that the dock capacity of the ground handlers is taken into account, which helps to alleviate truck congestion at the ground handlers. The potential of the auction-based coopetition model is shown for an air cargo supply chain scenario. There is a clear increase in profitability for the collaborating freight forwarders because the auction model decreases the transportation costs for the entire coalition. This cost reduction is achieved by an increase in transport efficiency, while the collaboration disadvantages, as seen in the literature, are limited.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Responsible Supply Chain (RSC) has become an important issue in the agricultural supply chain, along with the development of the sustainable agriculture concept. Furthermore, responsible agriculture helps to ensure the availability of food and maintain land quality, enabling the land to last for a long time. However, in practice, creating a responsible agricultural supply chain is rather difficult, especially in developing countries, where numerous barriers hinder the implementation of RSCs. This study therefore is an exploratory research aimed at finding the barrier factors to implementing responsible action in the agricultural supply chain. Multiple Case study research methods were conducted to provide answers to the research question. Meanwhile, data collection was performed through in-depth interviews with two agribusiness companies, and interpretive Structural Modelling was used to analyse the data obtained. The results showed the barrier factors faced in implementing responsible action within the agricultural supply chain include poor organizational capabilities, external actor involvement, and lack of supply chain integration. Organizational capabilities, including cost management, knowledge management, and organizational policy, play a significant role in implementing a responsible agriculture supply chain. This Implementation is also highly dependent on external involvement by government or non-government organizations (NGOs), as some supply chains take responsible action because of obligations or pressure from these organizations. Another barrier is inadequate supply chain integration, including integration, information sharing, and incentive alignment among supply chain members. Meanwhile, inadequate budget management, as part of organizational capabilities, is the major barrier giving rise to other challenges. The results of this study serve as a reference for supply chains, especially in the agriculture industry, while creating programs in a bid to reduce these inhibiting factors, to ensure responsible actions are well implemented well and able to provide a competitive advantage for all supply chain members.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain-based applications can enhance the sharing of information in processes involving multiple types of stakeholders, as in Supply Chain Management (SCM). A supply chain network can benefit from the visibility of the flow of goods, money, and information enabled by blockchain technology. So far, only limited evidence is available on the perspective of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) on the adoption of blockchain-based applications in their business processes. This may lead to a heavily diminished role for SMEs in SCM if large consortia unilaterally decide to adopt a blockchain-based architecture to improve the performance of the entire supply chain. Therefore, we conducted a study to explore which factors influence SMEs’ intention to adopt blockchain technology. Based on a literature review into technology adoption frameworks, we derived the technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) factors that can play a role in their decision-making process. We distributed a survey amongst European SMEs using the multi-criteria decision-making method of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to elicit the relative weights of these factors. The data analyses show that in contrast to other studies into technology adoption, the SMEs’ intention to adopt blockchain-based applications is primarily influenced by organizational rather than by technological and environmental factors. This implies that SMEs are best supported by showing blockchain’s organizational benefits and by training senior executives at their company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This book focusses on the concept of supply chain disruptions and how supply chain resilience can contribute to both preparing for and reacting to the event causing disruption. For building a digital twin of a supply chain, a software named Supply Chain Guru has been used. The software is a supply chain design tool which can be used for different kinds of supply chain network optimisation. The book outlines four scenarios: Covid-19 lockdown, Brexit without deal, Conflagration at a dairy and Political regulations on transport. The scenarios all contain a problem that needs to be solved. This problem is considered as the main disruption for the supply chain. Running the scenario in Supply Chain Guru, constraints are added to the AS-IS model. The constraints are identified as implications of the event in the scenarios. By adding the constraints and running the model, Supply Chain Guru identifies suggestions to solve the problems which were described. The solutions within the scenarios are held up against the theory of supply chain resilience, to describe how the scenario planning can be used to enhance supply chain resilience. Finally, the book discuss how scenario planning can be related to supply chain resilience as well as how scenario planning can be used to increase supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

A panel regression in terms of pooled OLS, fixed and random effects, and panel GMM is estimated to report the empirical results. The results report a negative and significant effect between the financial performance variables and supply chain finance, specifically with ROA with pooled OLS and fixed and random effects models. The results of panel GMM also show a negative and significant effect between all the financial performance variables and financing supply chain. The results are useful to academicians and the managers in the materials, inventory, and sales sections, and supply chain managers to integrate finance and SCM to achieve corporate benefits.</jats:p>"

This systematic review studies 281 research papers published in peer-reviewed journals between the year 1994-2020 and uses content analysis and network visualization of major themes and keywords. Thematic analysis was conducted to examine growing discussion in the literature and to identify research gaps. The findings of this review highlight the component of power structure across business-to-business (B2B) relationships, including its impact on companies’ decision-making. Past literature indicates that power, originating from various sources, could be deliberately exploited and exercised by a company to influence the process and outcome of supply chain decisions. The findings demonstrate the mechanics of power and the prevalent domains of decision that are discussed in the organizational power literature: pricing, quality management, sustainability, alliance building, sourcing, investment, inventory, product development and power shifting efforts. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides a critical synthesis of the role of power structure in supply chain decision-making, identifying 7 novel themes and related future research avenues. For managers and decision-makers, this study helps to raise situational awareness to comprehend power structures among supply chain collaborators. This awareness may help managers to identify threats to and opportunities for future supply chain decisions.</jats:p>"

There is an immense change in climate change, population growth, and environment, thereby increasing pressures on water resources. Due to future uncertainty and availability of resources, many priorities should be taken into account in the drinking-water system such as environmental impacts, distribution costs and fixed costs. This paper proposes a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for planning and designing a water supply chain network in order to optimize multi-objective problems. The model considers costs which include fixed and variable costs, in addition, it considers sustainability in terms of environmental viewpoint. The applicability of the model is appraised through a case study whose data gathered from related articles and water and waste company reports in Iran, which consists of five candidate reservoir nodes and four dam nodes besides eleven candidate locations for treatment plants. Thereafter, the proposed model has been coded in GAMS® optimization software. The model could be an expedient tool in order to manage urban water supply chains in a cost-effective and sustainable manner to satisfy water demand at every time period.</jats:p>"

The results show that Supply chain risk has a statistically significant negative impact on supply chain integration. Moreover, Supply chain Integration has a statistically significant positive impact on Supply chain risk Resilience and firm performance. Finally, we find that Firm performance is a good foundation for business operations and supply chain risk resilience. Therefore, we make recommendations to Vietnamese pharmaceutical enterprises that: Supply chain Integration is extremely necessary to ensure performance and Supply chain risk resilience in the context of the current covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

This competition must be able to create a good network in order to create competitive advantage and company performance in the formation of good Supply Chain Management. This study aims to determine the effect of supply chain management on competitive advantage and company performance. This study will examine supply chain management on competitive advantage and company performance in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bandung City, West Java. In this study, there are several differences from previous research, namely the indicators that will be used in this study. Namely, the measured supply chain management variables are indicators of technology use, supply chain speed, customer satisfaction, supply chain integration and inventory management. The variables of competitive advantage that are measured are the indicators of Price, Quality, and Time to market, and sales growth. Meanwhile, the measured company performance variables are indicators of financial performance and operational performance. The analytical method used in testing the hypothesis is to use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the help of AMOS software version 20. Respondents in this study were 150 respondents in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bandung, West Java. The results of this study indicate that supply chain management has a positive and significant effect on the company's competitive advantage. Competitive advantage has a positive and significant effect on company performance. Supply chain management has a positive and significant effect on company performance. Supply chain management has a positive and significant effect on company performance through competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

In this paper we study the location of 3DPR in the supply chain. We present and compare three models of supply chains: Traditional supply chain; 3DPR at warehouse; 3DPR at shop. The semodels are compared by the equipment installation cost, the production cost,and inventory cost for safety-stock. The study presents a practical case study motivated from a real-world apparel company, discusses the three models under various parameter settings, comparing the obtained total cost and discovers the advantages and disadvantages.</jats:p>"

Method of analysis was both descriptive statistical analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study also used Sobel test to determine significance level of mediation role in the model. The results show that supply chain practices could give a positive impact on operational performance. Supply chain practices also gave a positive impact and significant on company competitiveness. Then, company competitiveness had a positive impact and significant on operational performance. Additionally, supply chain practices also had a positive impact on operational performance indirectly through the role of company competitiveness as mediation variable. Hence, supply chain practice was the most important variable to increase both company competitiveness and operational performance. Each company is recommended to implement this variable as competitive weapon in order to get a better operational performance and competitiveness as well.</jats:p>"

However, the studies available on its efficient design are limited. Water demand estimation continues to be an important issue in water supply systems' design because of its multifaceted nature. Hunter's curve, or Fixture Unit method, is widely used for estimating the load on plumbing. Regardless of its popularity, it has a few drawbacks and is arbitrarily modified in some plumbing codes. Fixture-use probability, a basic entity in the Fixture Unit and some other methods, is a difficult parameter to estimate. Commonly, high-resolution field data is used for stochastic modelling of residential water demand which may not be always available. The paper reviews important residential water demand models in view of their applicability in building water supply system design. The irregular nature of water demand in buildings is due to uncertainty in water-use behaviour of users at fixture level. Use of soft-computing techniques can provide an advantage over the other methods in modelling such behaviour. The paper also discusses reliability of building water supply systems and applicability of some common indices for estimating reliability of building water supply systems.</jats:p>",

The main aim of this study is to identify the major critical success factors (CSF) that have been identified previously by academics and researchers during their research on the topics related to the discipline of supply chain management. The literature survey technique has been applied for the present research. This research is based on a critical review of seventy-three published studies on supply chain structures obtained from most important research databases by using the keywords related to supply chain structures such as barriers in the supply chain, critical success factors in supply chain structures. This study will not only contribute towards the existing literature on supply chain structures but will also help researchers to acknowledge the importance of critical success factors in supply chain structures. One of the major aspects of research regarding the supply chain is to reduce cost and that can only be done via effectiveness and efficiency in the processes, which depend on different variables at every level. The researchers have identified many critical success (CSF) factors in designing effective and efficient supply chain structures are a mutual partnership, executing communication and information expertise, support from senior management, human resource management, environmental uncertainty, value-addition process, business management, generating business culture, developing relationships between customer and supplier, logistics. The present research will also highlight the importance of different factors in achieving the effective and efficient in supply chain structures which enable organizations to not only reduce cost but also help them to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. This study will also be beneficial for managers as it will enable them to identify the critical success factors for their supply chain structures, keeping in view the nature and business environment of their organization.</jats:p>"

This research method uses a research approach by reviewing the previous literature that was selected deliberately during the last 10 years; journal papers, conferences, working papers, and Ph.D. thesis. Using three steps, the first step found 189 articles. The second step was to get 96 articles that match the topics raised. Finally, the third step, determined 39 articles selected as important topics focusing on fresh production areas and they were categorized and analyzed. This study is considered to be our best knowledge to examine the success factors influencing CPS in FPSC, such as; knowledge of the benefits of collaborative performance systems, reluctance to change, collaborative culture, trust, technology and information, social relations, environmental friendliness, and sustainability security and safety. The theoretical framework, was also developed incorporating the principles of supply chain network collaboration, taking into account the importance of business strategy and inter-organizational network theory, to strengthen the evidence for the relationship between the collaborative planning levels in usable information flow, at both the strategic, operational and tactical levels in the supply chain collaboration. The implication of this research is intended to examine the success factors that influence it, so that it can be developed and become the basis for improvement models that are still rarely applied in this field, from the influencing factors that exist in the collaboration structure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent coronavirus pandemic has now unleashed a global supply chain crisis across a huge number of organizations, stemming from a lack of understanding and flexibility of the multiple layers of their global supply chains and a lack of diversification in their sourcing strategies. One of the technical options to mitigate the pandemic is to automate business processes by which heterogeneous data integration is encouraged. The convergence of Semantic Web with service-oriented computing is manifested by Semantic Web services technology. It addresses the major challenge of automated, interoperable, and meaningful coordination of web service composition in industrial applications – such as apparel business. Automatic service composition may dramatically improve the development efficiency of web service applications. This chapter proposes an approach to automatically process semantic service composition (SSC) using description logics (DLs) to provide well-defined semantics. Also, this chapter explains the role of ontologies in the architecture of the Semantic Web.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rice industry policy must be comprehensive with a scope of policy from upstream to downstream. In other words, it must cover all supply chains of the rice industry consisting of five levels, such as, the level of farmers who process rice, grain traders, rice traders, rice traders in production areas and rice traders in urban markets.The purposes of this research are (1) to identify and model the current supply chain system of the rice industry; (2) analyze the simulation of the rice industry supply chain system policy; and (3) recommend rice industry policies which provide incentives for all rice industry supply chain actors. The research method used is the case study method. The aim is to understand a phenomenon in the rice industry supply chain system in depth in West Java Province – Indonesia. The results show that the rice industry supply chain system model is a closed cycle consisting of material flow feedback in the form of grain, rice, money and information flow in the form of demand that occurs in the interaction of actors from farmers, grain traders, rice milling units (RMU), rice traders in production centers to rice traders in urban wholesale markets in Bandung and Jakarta. Every businessman in the rice industry has the same goal, which is to maximize the profits. Thus, it can potentially lead to a conflict of interest which is manifested in the desire of every businessman to sell as much as they produce at the highest possible price but this will not happen because of the limited resources they have, such as capital and the market demand they receive. The strategy of increasing production is often carried out by the government at this time which it cannot be done partially without considering other rice industry supply chain instruments. The impacts of this partial policies are farmers, collectors, rice traders and rice mills gain unstable profits and the benefits received are lower than before the production strategy and policy were implemented. The recommended policy strategy is the rice industry supply chain system should be able to guarantee the availability of sufficient rice and capable of guaranting the welfare of farmers with a policy that integrates rice farming and agro-industry production strategies, financing strategies and accessible to all levels of actors in the rice industry supply chain, human resource development strategies and rice business risk management strategies, simultaneously. The integrated policy strategy needs to be carried out since rice supply chain management is a coordinating system of material flow in the form of grain, rice, money, facilities and information flow in the form of orders or requests, knowledge and innovation.</jats:p>"

Questionnaire was developed and was circulated to more than 600 organizations out of which 158 organizations responded and were useful. Hypotheses were formulated on studying the impact of these aspects on SC resilience and were tested using structural equation modelling. The study and the analysis support the hypothesis on the positive impact of supply chain human capability on SC collaboration and SC responsive design. Similarly, the hypothesis on SC collaboration and responsive design have tested positive impact on supply chain resilience which in turn has positive influence on organizations' performance that gives competitive edge.</jats:p>",

From a supply chain perspective, market uncertainty, which in this study is proxied by the Covid-19 pandemic, has great potential to reduce performance and disrupt production and distribution lines as well as consumer demand. This encourages affected SMEs, such as SMEs that focus on providing tourism products, such as fashion and merchandise, to maintain their performance with product innovation, and minimize the use of non-environmentally friendly products. The object of research is Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) producing tourism souvenirs in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Using the analysis technique of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with 150 respondents, the findings indicate that market uncertainty serves as a catalyst for SMEs to maintain performance through marketing innovation and product reorientation. Specifically, the results show that there is a positive and significant influence between innovation and green orientation on SME performance, and the mediating effect of market uncertainty to increase marketing innovation and environmentally friendly orientation. These findings theoretically contribute to explaining the relationship between supply chain management in the context of market uncertainty. In practical terms, this study confirms the need for support by stakeholders to support limited domestic tourism, according to health protocols, as well as digitalization of marketing for tourism SMEs.</jats:p>"

During This pandemic, supply chains (SCs) have witnessed disruptions, and this has inspired the interest of this paper. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to address two research questions pertaining to exploring the emerging SC aspects in the age of COVID-19 and future directions of SCs. To achieve this objective, a methodology is developed entailing three steps as follows. First, data is collected and included documents are identified through PRISMA strategy. Second, document analytics is performed using the web-interface of bibliometrix package in R software,the shiny app. Third, the research questions are addressed accordingly. The results showed that the most prominent terms related to SCs include supply chain disruptions, supply chain management,supply chain resilience, viability, and flexibility. Consequently, the first research question is approached in which the aspects of SC disruptions, resilient SC, viable SC,Sustainable SC, and SC management, are addressed. With more focus on building resilient SC in the short-term to recover from disruptions, viable SC can be created in the long-term perspective, which eventually build sustainable SC accordingly. Subsequently, considering these aspects enable successful SC management. Additionally, the future directions are explored including the transformation from globalization to regionalization perspective, focus on digitalization, need for holding more inventory, managing SCs for high resilience, more dependence on operations research and business analytics, and reconsideration of food SCs. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by providing insightful research agenda to scholars and practitioners concerned in exploring more of the influences of the current pandemic on SCs.</jats:p>"

The finding of this study reveals that government regulations and information technology significantly influence the operational performance of local television stations with service supply chain management (SCM) practices as the mediator variable, which means that better government regulations and better information technology are analogous with the importance for the improvement of local television stations operational performance. Capital owner intervention weakens service SCM practices on operating performance and has a direct and immediate effect on reducing the operational performance of local television stations. The practical implications of this study signify the understanding that service SCM practices is an important concept in enhancing the operational performance. Capital owner’s intervention weakens service SCM practices on operating performance of local television stations.</jats:p>"

Conventional measures of financial performance cannot reflect the proposed effect since green management is long-term oriented and not limited to financial performance only. This research explores the potentials of using balanced scorecard to measure the effect of green marketing, green supply chain and green human resources on the performance of the firms. Simple random sampling technique was followed in this research, and data were collected from 113 managers from different companies in service and manufacturing sectors in UAE. The findings indicate that green marketing was the major determinant of customers’ performance, green human resources was the major factor affecting learning and growth, and that green supply chain was the main influencer on financial performance and internal processes.</jats:p>"

For that reason, our study aims to determine the primary indicators used to assess the performance of sustainable supply chain management to improve the palm oil industry's performance immediately. The F-AHP method is used to rank which indicators are focused on the COVID-19 situation and thereafter. The findings of this study designate that there are three main indicators, namely from the economic side (adaptability), the social side (improving employee health and safety), and the environmental side (sustainable supplier management).

On green innovation, green supply chain management was shown to impart a significant impact. However, green supply chain management has little to do with green innovation. Furthermore, green innovation was found to contribute to both green supply chain management and firm performance.

The study is a survey with a cross-sectional design to measure the influence of stakeholders' role on the performance of occupational health efforts. The study sample was 80 people, namely all OHS officers from the community health center (CHC) in the city of Medan. The independent variables in this study are the role of government (X1), the role of micro and small business (X2), the role of the workers (X3) and the performance of OHS officers is the dependent variable. Data collection is perfomed using a questionnaire that has been validated with interval scales 1 - 5. Hypothesis testing is based on using structural equation modeling path analysis and analysis is performed using PLS-SEM, Smart PLS 3.0. Direct test results show that the government has not played a significant role in Micro &amp; Small Business and the role of workers. The government only plays a significant role in the performance of OHS officers. Micro &amp; Small businesses significantly influence workers' role, but it has not significantly affected OHS officers' performance. The role of workers significantly influences the performance of OHS officers. Test results indirectly show the critical role of collaboration between stakeholders. Although it has not shown a significant effect, there is an increase in the significant value on the performance of officers. The finding confirms the need for seriousness and the importance of collaboration among stakeholders. The research needs to be expanded by involving all OHS officers up to sub-health centers, and other districts/cities with the same characteristics.

While crisis management has focused on a few organizations involved in supply chain operations (manufacturers, governments, carriers, and the consuming public), it has primarily received a functional focus. Due to their decentralized network structure, supply chains are prone to suffer from disruptive events solved by supply chain crisis management. This chapter presents the blockchain technologies' possibilities and limits used in an integrated IoT-based information system architecture. The chapter describes how the scalability limits of blockchain technology affect the proposed architecture performance that uses it. Also, the chapter presents a review of the academic literature, pointing out how some solutions use a centralization process to improve response time and security of the blockchain-based architecture. Finally, the chapter provides security threat models, which consider by blockchain protocols in IoT networks. </jats:p>"

In this study, a memetic algorithm is proposed to solve the integrated production-distribution problem. The objective of the problem is to find optimal production quantity, customer delivery quantity, and schedule to minimize the total system cost, which is composed of production setup cost and variable production cost, inventory holding costs, and distribution cost. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested on the existing data sets.

Data analysis is operated using the theory of path analysis to determine the magnitude of the value of each construct calculated in the test equipment. From the results of the tests that have been conducted, only the supply network has no significant effect on efficiency. At the same time, other variables have a close and meaningful relationship. The study concluded that only one construct of the five hypotheses had an insignificant influence on bound variables.

This research provides insight to leaders that to create a green work supply chain environment requires the role of green behavior as an intervening variable. However, the finding does not show the effect of individual green values as a moderating variable, so that green organizational culture can affect the green work supply chain environment.

The object of the study is a PV converter - based stand-alone power supply system. Energy storage units, which are widely used in the designing of power supply systems for power supply of technical security equipment are presented. A methodology for designing a power supply system is used, which takes into account the integral effect of solar insolation, ambient temperature in the range from - 40°C to +50°C, temperature of a PV module and a storage battery; PV module capacity; requirements for independent operation of technical security equipment; electrical characteristics of the solar charge controller (rated open-circuit voltage and rated charge current). To calculate the total solar insolation arriving at the surface of a photovoltaic module, the Kastrov model is used for calculating direct solar radiation; the Berlage model is used for calculating the scattered solar energy and the Berland model is used for calculating insolation in cloudy conditions. The studies of lithium-titanate storage batteries have been carried out in the climate chamber and a corresponding mathematical model has been developed for the temperature-dependent capacity of the battery. To determine solar insolation falling on the tilted surface of the PV module the software has been developed in the C# programming language. The designed PV module-based power supply system provides an independent uninterrupted continuous power supply of equipment under constant consumption of no more than 115.2 Wh per day by technical security equipment. The results of the work can be used in the development of a stand-alone power supply system for power supply of technical security equipment, security and control.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of inventory management systems on supply chain performance of fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers in KenyaMethodology: The study adopted descriptive research design. The unit of observation was the operations manager of the 51 FMCG manufacturers located in Nairobi. The sampling frame of the current study consisted of operations managers in the manufacturers of the FMCGs in Nairobi. The study used the census method to select 51 manufacturers of the FMCGs in Nairobi, thus the sample of the study was 51 respondents. Primary data was used in the study. The study used questionnaires to collect data. Mixed methods technique of analyzing data was used where both descriptive and inferential analysis were used. The data collected from the field was analyzed using SPSS 23 program. The questionnaires were referenced and the items in them coded for easier data entry. The presentation of the findings was done using tables.Results: The study found that inventory management systems positively and significantly influences Supply chain performance of FMCG in Kenya. The study found that respondents agreed that inventory management systems promotes improved supplier, vendor, and partner relationships; inventory management systems enables the company to maintain a centralized record of every asset; inventory management systems helps in reduction in storage costs; inventory management systems helps to keep track on current stock levels which enables the company to reorder with greater accuracy; and that inventory management systems promotes better reporting and forecasting capabilities.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that the recommends the company to adopt new technology (updated inventory management system) to ensure that the processes in the company are efficient; this can be achieved by upgrading operation standards and implementation of new technology and software. Because of technological itches, it is possible for the company to lose data, therefore it is recommended that the company should always have backup of inventory data.</jats:p>"

The research shows that the main links in the activity should be harmonized for quality and quick optimization of polymer waste supply chains, including the processes of collecting, sorting, treatment, processing, and recycling of resources for maintaining the quality by total cost reduction. The research argues that the circular economy that stipulates the easy processing, recycling, disassembling, and restoring of products replaced the traditional linear model “take, produce, and throw out” that has dominated the economy by now. The study shows that the transformation of supply chains in production ecosystems forms competitive advantages at the enterprises that allow them to be more productive through efficient use of resources.</jats:p>"

Then, the decision models of dual-channel supply chain under different contracts are constructed, and how manufacturers can optimize the profits of both sides through an effective coordination mechanism is analyzed. The research results show that the improved advertising costs and revenue sharing contract can perfectly coordinate the dual-channel supply chain system. Numerical experiments illustrate the impacts of parameters on the optimal decision results.</p>",

Although China, Europe and the US are the main markets, 80 percent of the modules are manufactured in Asia. In Vietnam, modules are manufactured in collaboration with Chinese and American manufacturers. In 2017, there were 5 GW of solar panels produced in Vietnam, accounting for 7% of the global market. The domestic solar market is expected to peak at around 1.8 GW/year according to the targets set out in the revised PDP 7. The domestic module production capacity, currently devoted entirely to export, is around 5.2 GW/year, three times the expected maximum capacity of the domestic market. In that context, due to the normal size of factories, only a few parts factories can sell to the domestic market, while the majority still must rely on exports. But it is important to map out a clear roadmap for 12 GW of solar power that will encourage the formation of EPC companies and other domestic service companies in Vietnam to build factories according to the plan. Construction, operation, maintenance, and production for the domestic market has the potential to increase Vietnam's GDP by about 0.25% by 2030 and create more than 25,000 jobs.</jats:p>"

This research was conducted at Andir Market, Bandung City, Indonesia. The research sample consisted of 100 Andir market traders. The research method used was a quantitative method with survey research that uses a questionnaire as the main instrument in data collection. The results of the analysis and discussion of the researchers have identified factors that can be used to strengthen the food supply chain network in the Public-Private-Community Partnership in traditional markets, namely management, empowerment, physical market conditions, and competitive strategies. Simultaneously, the four traders' performance factors have a significant effect on the food supply chain network with an R-square value of 0.658 (65.8%) with tcount greater than 1.96 or (3.817&gt; 1.96). This means that if the changes that occur are good in the performance of traders, the food supply chain network in traditional markets will also be good, while the remaining 0.342 (34.2%) is explained by factors other than these variables. The expected implication is that the success of the supply chain network that is built due to strong interactions within the Public-Private-Community Partnership and other supply chain actors is able to face challenges during and after the pandemic. So that the quality of traditional market products, especially products that are quickly damaged or rotten, can be superior and well guaranteed for the food needs of people throughout Indonesia.</jats:p>"

This research conducted a case study in the Tampa Bay Regional Surface Water Treatment Plant and Tampa Bay Seawater Desalination Plant in Florida, U.S. It analysed the performance and environmental impacts of conventional and desalination water supply systems on three sides: energy consumption, carbon footprint, and solid waste. Potential negative effects of both water supply systems are generally associated with surface water ecology, groundwater aquifers, coastal environment, and marine organisms. Various environmental impact mitigation plans have been proposed to prevent or restore the detriments caused by carbon dioxide emissions, plant construction, and concentrated brine discharge. Due to the deficiency in freshwater resources, desalination technology is more promising through proper regulations and regional sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The products needed to handle the spread of the virus are in high order, and there is even a product shortage. Products that are not required to prevent a pandemic have stagnated so that the manufacturing industry suddenly reduces capacity. Manufacturing companies need to coordinate quickly to be able to adjust the disruption. Manufacturing companies already have an integrated information technology system that has been the primary process in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP). Manufacturing companies make ERP their primary system, so they need to be updated and adjusted as needed. This study obtains a questionnaire from Indonesia's manufacturing industry using the google form link and distributed through social media WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Data processing was carried out by using the partial least square of 285 manufacturing company respondents. The results showed that ERP sustainability was able to influence supply chain integration (internal and external). External integration has an impact on information quality, while internal integration does not affect. Supply chain integration and information quality affect increasing firm performance. Research makes a practical contribution to the industry in optimizing ERP systems in Pandemic conditions and a theoretical contribution to ERP sustainability as a mainstay in supply chain integration.</jats:p>"

Dynamic and complex supply chain environments have constantly led companies to modern management approaches such as resilience to address disruptions. Besides, the sustainability approach enhances the strength of the supply chain in disruptions by considering economic, social, and environmental aspects. This paper develops a mathematical model for designing a supply chain network considering resilience and sustainability. In this model, suppliers were exposed to disruption with different probabilities. The model has three objectives: minimizing total costs and maximizing suppliers’ social and environmental scores. A robust scenario‐based stochastic programming approach has been used for potential disruption scenarios. The multiobjective model is solved by the<jats:italic>ε</jats:italic>‐constraint method in GAMS software. The numerical results show the performance of the model in a different situation. Also, the robust scenario‐based stochastic programming approach allows the average performance of the supply chain in each objective to improve.</jats:p>",

Marketing effort exerted by the retailer is employed to enhance the final market demand. We first establish a performance benchmark, and show that the wholesale price contract fails to coordinate the supply chain due to the effects of double marginalization and loss aversion. Then we propose a revenue-cost-sharing contract in order to achieve supply chain coordination. It is verified that a properly designed revenue-cost-sharing contract can achieve perfect coordination and a win-win outcome synchronously. Our results reveal that it is simple to implement and arbitrarily allocate the total channel profit between the retailer and the supplier. In addition, we examine the effect of the retailer's loss aversion degree on contract parameters and profit allocation, and we show that both the retailer and the supplier can benefit from marketing effort.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The existing problems of the traction power-supply system (i.e., the existence of the neutral section and the power quality problems) limit the development of railways, especially high-speed railways, which are developing rapidly worldwide. The existence of the neutral section leads to the speed loss and traction loss as well as mechanical failures, all of which threaten the fast and safe operation of the train and the system. Meanwhile, the power quality problems (e.g., the negative sequence current, the reactive power, and the harmonic) can bring a series of problems that cannot be ignored on the three-phase grid side. In response, many researchers have proposed co-phase power-supply schemes to solve these two problems simultaneously. Given that the auto-transformer (AT) power-supply mode has become the main power-supply mode for the high-speed railway traction power-supply system, it has a bright future following the rapid development of the high-speed railway. In addition, there is no co-phase power-supply scheme designed for AT power-supply mode in the existing schemes. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a specifically designed power-supply mode more suitable for the AT, as well as to establish the control systems for the rectifier side and the inverter side. In addition, for the proposed scheme, the operation principle is analyzed, the mathematical model is built, and the control system is created, and its functionality is verified by simulation, and its advantages are compared and summarized finally. The result proves that it can meet functional requirements. At the same time, compared with the existing co-phase power-supply scheme, it saves an auto-transformer in terms of topology, reduces the current stress by 10.9% in terms of the current stress of the switching device, and reduces the power loss by 0.25% in terms of the entire system power loss, which will result in a larger amount of electricity being saved. All of this makes it a more suitable co-phase power-supply scheme for the AT power-supply mode.</jats:p>"

This work examines the link between information technology (IT) capability with the firm performance by adopting a lean production approach, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. The study has surveyed the population of the manufacturing company in East Java, Indonesia, using a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale. A total of 111 manufacturing companies (medium and large) were selected from 5420 manufacturing companies listed in the Industrial Department of East Java. The partial least square (PLS) technique was used to analyze the data, using the SmartPLS software version 3.3. Thirteen hypotheses in this study were developed to investigate. The result revealed that all hypotheses of direct relationship were supported. IT capability directly affects lean production, vendor managed inventory, and supply chain practices. Moreover, lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices improve firm performance. Further analysis also indicated that all hypotheses of indirect hypotheses were supported except hypothesis one hypothesis (H9). IT capability indirectly improves firm performance through lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. The result provides insight for managers and policymakers on enhancing firm performance by improving its IT capability, adopting lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. This research contributes to reinforcing the supply chain management theory.</jats:p>"

Hence, this study sought to test the impact of mediation of the competitive advantage of relations between SCMP and Reperform the point of view of Kenya's dairy supply chain. The study examined four estimates that were tested using partial minimum square structural equation modeling (PLS-SAME) techniques to work out the purpose of the study. Across-departmental survey design has been used to collect preliminary data from109 dairy cooperatives in thirteen major dairy producing counties in Kenya. The results reveal that SCM practice has a positive and significant effect on CA(P=0.730) and ORGPER (P=0.237). In addition, THERE is a positive, statistically significant effect on THECAORGPER (P=0.522). Further results show that CA mediates the relationship between SCMP and ORGPER. Consequently, the study concludes that SCMPs first generate CA, which in turn enhances ORGPER in a logistic sense. Theoretically, the study provides insights on the resource-based view theory as well as a conceptual framework for its validation. Similarly, the study informs managers and policymakers in knowing specific SCMPs to focus on to enhance CA and ORGPER of the dairy cooperatives in Kenya.</jats:p>"

This study hypothesized that the fluctuation of observed number of A. purpurea at Bung Khong Long Lake (Ramsar Site) has influenced by local fishing since the maximum number was observed decreasing to 6 individuals between 2009/ 10 and 2010/ 11 even though the status is least concern for the country. Due to its feeding behavior on not specific preys, all possible food sources was sampled following the feeding route of Purple Heron and then was compared with fish-caught by local fishing per day, as well as observed fishing activities to cross check with feeding time of Purple Heron. Field investigation was conducted in early (EP), middle (MP), and late (LP) period of migratory season 2009/ 10 and 2010/ 11 and cross check with the official recorded number of Purple Heron obtained from the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Bangkok. Size and type of preys (seven fish species; medium size ~5- 15 cm) appeared to be the priority preference for Purple Heron’s feeding that was sampled higher in 2010/11 compared to 2009/10 migratory season (p = 0.003) and also seemed to be the common fish caught by local anglers. In addition, fish biomass has more or less influenced on the frequency of feeding rather than the number of fish and it showed significant highest in EP (p = 0.002) and less in LP as well as higher observed-number of Purple Heron in EP than LP. Based on daily required 200g/ day/individual, all food sources (mainly fish) sampling in the field insufficiently played a role as the hypothesized-realized niche for the maximum number of A. purpurea (606.08 g m-2 day-1; EP, 256.75 g m-2 day-1; MP, and 343.37 g m-2 day-1 ; LP, respectively). Whereas, fish caught on the seven species by local anglers resulted around 66,707 g m 2 day-1, which is higher than the hypothesized-realized niche that might push the birds to move out and shift to the better foraging places.</jats:p>"

To answer an investigative question through other forecasting methods, the authors use the weighted moving average (WMA) method, whose weights are determined in this work thanks to the Newton's optimization of the upstream average inventory level. Starting from a two-level supply chain, the simulation results confirm the ability of the approach to reduce the mean squared error and the average inventory level, compared to a decentralized approach. However, the bullwhip effect is only improved after a certain threshold of the parameter of the forecasting method.

Structural equation modeling reveals that in the absence of a risk mitigation strategy (behavior-based management, buffer-based management, and traceability-based management), operational risk consequences are significantly influenced by operational supply risk. The analysis also showed the mitigation strategies reduce risk events by its interaction between operational supply risk and risk consequences.

This study analyzes the suitability of the overall model through causal relationships using Partial Least Square-Path Modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the BMT predominantly influences the growth of ICT companies. The BMT is predominantly built by the environmental uncertainty (ET) strategy rather than by integrative capability. Thus, companies need to improve their ability and creativity to anticipate and adapt to any uncertainty that unexpectedly results in dynamic competition.</jats:p>"

To have a reliable forecast, some advanced methods such as deep learning techniques are helpful. The main goal of this chapter is to forecast the unit sales of thousands of items sold at different chain stores located in Ecuador with holistic techniques. Three deep learning approaches including artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are adopted here for predictions from the Corporación Favorita grocery sales forecasting dataset collected from Kaggle website. Finally, the performances of the applied models are evaluated and compared. The results show that LSTM network tends to outperform the other two approaches in terms of performance. All experiments are conducted using Python's deep learning library and Keras and Tensorflow packages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While negotiation within ongoing buyer–supplier relationships is a key element in supply chain management, the emphasis in the literature has been on one‐time, isolated event negotiations. This research, through three scenario‐based experiments with supply chain managers, considers how buyers’ perceptions of past negotiation strategies help to develop future negotiation strategy expectations of their suppliers. If the buyers’ strategy expectations are not met (violated) by the suppliers, these buyers will seek to understand why. Using the combination of expectancy violation theory and attribution theory, this research examines the relational impact of a negotiation strategy expectation violation and the role of extra‐relational factors. The results suggest that relationship history does influence how buyers respond to negotiation strategy expectation violations and that the relational impact of a negative violation is tempered by the history as opposed to a single event reaction. While the findings support that extra‐relational factors can also have a relational impact, buyers perceive differences based on the type of extra‐relational factor (organizational or external) and the type of relational outcome (commitment and relationship value). The results of the interaction of the strategy expectation violation and extra‐relational factor may stretch the boundary conditions of attribution theory. The findings suggest that suppliers should consider how their buying partners may perceive their negotiation behavior and determine the potential relational ramifications of behavior outside of the buyers’ expectations based on previous exchanges.</jats:p>",

Drawing on the Kano model and organization's theory this paper investigates the effect of fog computing-based LSCM on organizational agility. And the role of user satisfaction as mediator between fog computing-based LSCM and organizational agility. A quantitative approach was used, a questionnaire was designed for data collection, Cronbach's Alpha test was performed on a pilot study to examine the internal consistency of questionnaire items. Fog computing-based LSCM was studied based on Supply chain awareness, Connectivity and Logistics, Integration Process, Seamless Supply Chain, Integration of Processes. Data was collected from a random sample of 550 employees of Al-Hassan industrial city‎ in Jordan. Building on the proposed model, Researchers show that fog computing-based LSCM has a positive impact on organizational agility, fog computing-based LSCM has a positive impact on user satisfaction and finally user satisfaction mediates the relationship between fog computing-based LSCM and organizational agility. Implications for the model are discussed.</jats:p>"

Based on such input, we present a list of major challenges/opportunities in relation to the design and operations of Supply Chains (SCs) in the near future. The preliminary list is calibrated and validated based on the input from industry stakeholders (to account for the perspectives of different supply chain actors such as buyers, suppliers, policy makers, and supply chain facilitators) in order to make sure that these challenges are indeed of practical relevance and grounded in reality. The aforementioned challenges are aggregated into several clusters aiming at providing decision makers with a tool that would enable them to quickly and easily spot the relevant challenges and take proper actions to mitigate any potential risk.</jats:p>"

It consists of nine hypotheses concerning the relationships of the aforementioned factors that have been verified throughout reviewed literature and examined via employing the structural equation modelling technique. This research used data taken from floated questionnaires at three manufacturing companies in the Kingdom of Bahrain. An inclusive review of the literature to retrieve the four most common supply chain management practices has been undertaken and has identified limitations in the research techniques applied. This research has discovered the significant influences of the supplier partnership, the information sharing, and the lean system of the three most common supply chain management practices and the net trade cycle on the financial performance. Although this is the first research that combines the critical relationships among those four most common supply chain management practices, the net trade cycle, and the financial performance in one model, it is important to note that this study was unsuccessful in demonstrating whether there is a significant influence between customer relationship of the most common supply chain management practices and the net trade cycle on the financial performance. Researchers can employ the outcomes of this research to discover several related hypotheses in more details and increase the accuracy of forthcoming empirical relationships among those factors. This research offers particular suggestions for such further research. The outcomes of this research can be utilized by managers to highlight the execution of those four most common supply chain management practices and the net trade cycle in their respective ventures. Moreover, almost all of those relationships are found to have significant influences on the financial performance. Furthermore, the outcomes can be recommended to production managers who may well assign resources to enhance these practices to achieve the greatest outcomes.</jats:p>"

Currently, adequate storage facilities do not exist at strategic locations which incur very substantial post-harvest losses. The idea of solar-powered storage systems with a modular configuration has also been proposed. There are two principal reasons for this: (1) Pakistan has enormous solar power potential, and (2) there are rampant load-shedding problems in the country. While tomatoes have been selected as a typical product to develop the entire discourse, the resulting integrated model may be just as conveniently applied to any other agricultural product. </jats:p>"

The data are collected from case study executives and operators using in-depth interviews and observation. The main problems are price markdown due to the overestimation of slow-moving products and food loss and low productivity, no standard operations in receiving and distribution, and lack of proper metrics to measure the supply chain performance. Finally, the suggestions of improvement include establish demand planning and forecasting, implement supply chain optimization and inventory monitoring, develop a lot tracking system, standard operating procedures for receiving process, enhance worker efficiency, use the sensor with the Internet of Things (IoT) solution, implement supply chain risk monitoring, and online marketing.

Technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous transport systems, data science, and additive manufacturing are gradually becoming part of people’s and companies’ daily lives and are changing the manufacturing, process industry and logistics sectors. Although recent attempts have been made to understand the implications of these technologies on supply chain management, the relevance of the different technologies in future scenarios is still unknown. Using a technology scouting approach, the most important enabling technologies for supply chains until 2030 are identified and selected and their implications on future supply chains are evaluated using an assessment methodology with different evaluation criteria.</jats:p>"

Consequently, it is paramount to understand the supply chain characteristics for possible future scenarios, in order to know how to respond to threats and take advantage of the opportunities that the next years will bring. This chapter focuses on describing the characteristics of the supply chain in each of the six macro-scenarios presented in Sardesai et al. (2020b), as final stage of the scenario building methodology. Supply chains for each scenario are characterized in eight dimensions: Products and Services, Supply Chain Paradigm, Sourcing and Distribution, Technology Level, Supply Chain Configuration, Manufacturing Systems, Sales Channel, and Sustainability.</jats:p>"

This work investigates the effects of two typical behaviors, free riding behavior and consumer switching behavior, on inventory, ordering, and sales effort decisions in decentralized and centralized decision situations with stochastic demand. In order to achieve the optimal performance in the centralized system, this research designs a partial buyback contract to coordinate the supply chain. Furthermore, numerical analysis is provided to test the feasibility of the model. The results indicate that in the dual‐channel supply chain with the above two behaviors, (1) the optimal sales effort level, optimal order quantity, the optimal offline, and online profits under the centralized decision‐making are more than those under decentralized scenario, except for the optimal inventory level; (2) the increase of the offline consumer switching rate will lead to the reduction of the offline order quantity and the offline expected profit and raise the online inventory level and the online expected profit; (3) the increase of the online consumer switching rate will raise the offline order quantity and the offline expected profit but has no significant impact on the online inventory level and the online expected profit; (4) the increase of the free riding coefficient of the supplier, no matter whether in decentralized or centralized systems, will reduce the offline sales effort level, the offline expected profit, and the online expected profit and raise the inventory level. Finally, this work provides some managerial implication.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Deutschland werden zahlreiche Infrastrukturprojekte durch eine Zusammenarbeit der öffentlichen Hand mit einem privaten Unternehmen umgesetzt. Dies geschieht im Rahmen einer Öffentlich-Privaten-Partnerschaft kurz ÖPP bzw. PPP (Public Private Partnership). Auch im Bereich der Verkehrsinfrastruktur erfolgt die Umsetzung vieler Projekte als ÖPP. Privatunternehmen übernehmen den Ausbau, ggfs. Neubau, Erhalt und Betrieb eines vertraglich festgelegten Autobahnabschnittes, mit zumeist einer Vertragslaufzeit von 25-30 Jahren. Erfüllt das Unternehmen die zuvor definierten Leistungen, erhält es von der öffentlichen Hand ein Entgelt. Laut aktuellen Planungen des Bundes sollen ca. 1.280 km des deutschen Autobahnnetzes durch ÖPP-Projekte erneuert werden. Jedoch existiert eine kontroverse Diskussion dieser Projekte sowohl in der Theorie als auch in der Praxis. Zum einen sind, laut Bundesrechnungshof, solche Projekte teurer als eine konventionelle Umsetzung und zum anderen profitieren, gemäß Untersuchung der TU Braunschweig, hiervon besonders große Baukonzerne. Die mittelständischen, regionalen Bauunternehmer haben kaum Möglichkeiten sich bei ÖPP zu beteiligen.  Ziel des Forschungsvorhabens war die Analyse einer Verkehrsinfrastrukturgenossenschaft, welche eine Alternative zu den bisherigen ÖPP-Projekten darstellt. Die Grundidee dieser Genossenschaft ist es, sowohl den Baumittelstand zu berücksichtigen, als auch eine regionale Wertschöpfung herbei zu führen. In Germany, numerous infrastructure projects are implemented through cooperation between the public sector and a private company. This is done within the framework of a public-private partnership (short: PPP). In the area of transportation infrastructure, too, many projects are implemented as PPPs. Private companies take over the responsibilities of expansion, new construction (if necessary), maintenance and operation of a contractually defined highway section, usually with a contract term of 25-30 years. If the company fulfills the previously defined services, it receives a payment from the public sector. According to current plans of the federal government, approximately 1,280 km of the German highway network are to be renewed through PPP projects. However, there is a controversial discussion of these projects both in theory and in practice. On the one hand, according to the Federal Audit Office, such projects are more expensive than conventional implementation. On the other hand, according to a study by the Technical University of Braunschweig, large contractors in particular benefit from this. Medium-sized, regional construction companies have hardly any opportunities to participate in PPPs. Goal of the research project was the analysis of a transport infrastructure cooperative, which shows an alternative to the existing PPP projects. The basic idea of this cooperative is the consideration of the midsize contractors sector and to create a regional added value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Proper development and functioning of the mammary gland depends not only on hormones, but also on the nervous system. The aim of this paper was to summarize the existing knowledge on the innervation of the mammary gland in various mammalian species, including domestic animals. In general, the pattern of innervation of this gland is similar in all studied species, i.e. large farm animals, rodents, dogs and beavers, as well as humans. Using the pan-neuronal marker of neural structures PGP-9.5, it was found that the mammary gland is well supplied with nerve fibres. Very rich innervation was discovered in the nipple, and less numerous nerve endings were found in the parenchyma. Nerve fibres supply the skin, especially the nipple, and many nerve terminals are associated with blood vessels and smooth muscles throughout the organ. Immunohistochemical investigations have made it possible to distinguish two major subpopulations of nerve fibres supplying the mammary gland. One of them consists of putative sensory fibres expressing CGRP, SP, GAL and/or PACAP, and the other is presumably composed of adrenergic axons containing TH, DBH, SOM and/or VIP. Studies on the sources of innervation of the mammary gland have confirmed assumptions about the nature of the nerve fibres and have revealed that they derive from the spinal ganglia (DRG) and sympathetic trunk ganglia (SChG). In the rat, mammary gland-projecting (MGP) neurons were also found in the nodose ganglion. So far, the rat and the pig have been tested most comprehensively for the sources of the mammary gland innervation. The MGP sensory neurons were observed ipsilaterally in several consecutive DRG, suggesting that the same neurons supply several successive glands. In the case of the SChG, it was found that MGP neurons are located, among others, in the L1-L4 ganglia, which constitute a specific „mammary gland nerve centre”. Previous studies on the sources of nerve supply to female reproductive organs have revealed that the SChG L1-L4 ganglia also contain nerve cells that project to the ovary, fallopian tube and uterus. Some clinical implications of the mammary gland innervation are also discussed.</jats:p>"

A sampling of red chili farmers was carried out in stages, obtaining 80 people. Meanwhile, the sampling of chain actors after farmers used the snowball sampling technique, resulting in 68 people. The supply chain relationship structure of red chili was analyzed descriptively, whereas supply chain management of red chili was analyzed using an FSCN approach. The results revealed that the red chili supply chain structure was formed by three chains consisting of eight actors. All chain actors entered into an unwritten agreement, except for actors in the auction markets. The transaction system employed the scale and payment methods with a delay system. In addition, government support was only provided in the upstream sub-system. Supply chain collaboration that occurred was the mutual openness and reciprocal relationship. The majority of chain actors had utilized communication media of mobile phones, although few of them made transactions by coming directly to the purchase location. The material communicated was related to price, quality, quantity, and time of payment.</jats:p>"

The definition of the Key Horizontal Issues (KHI) is the basis for developing 12 policy recommendations regarding infrastructure requirements, technological and organisational improvements and regulatory developments needed to set the stage for the European SCs for the future. Specifically, the policy recommendations entail assuring appropriate standards and legislation for European SCs; educating and training professionals for the future SCs; drafting of international agreements aiming at future European SCs; supporting and fostering incentives and funding schemes; promoting reference bodies for European SCs; and establishing infrastructure for fostering of future European SCs.</jats:p>"

This is evident by the business uncertainties growing in supply chain management, which pose threats to the entire network flow and economy. This paper aims to review the existing literature on risk factors in supply chain management in an uncertain and competitive business environment. Papers that contained the word “risk” in their titles, keywords, or abstracts were selected for conducting the theoretical analyses. Supply chain risk management is an integral function of the supply network. It faces unpredictable challenges due to nations’ economic policies and globalization, which have raised uncertainty and challenges for supply chain organizations. These significantly affect the financial performance of the organizations and the economy of a nation. Debate on supply chain risk management may promote competitiveness in business. Risk mitigation strategies will reduce the impact caused due to natural and human-made disasters.</jats:p>"

From the numerical results, we observe that it would be optimal to over-utilize the backup supplier and under-utilize the main supplier if the maximum growth in supply risk results from supply disruption. On the other hand, when the growth in supply risk occurs mainly due to increase in yield risk, the optimal risk mitigation strategy would be to increase the use of the backup supplier and decrease the use of the main supplier. We propose the price only contract and a new revenue sharing contract to mitigate demand and supply uncertainties in the decentralized model, and observe that the revenue sharing contract can fully coordinate the supply chain with win–win outcome for all entities involved in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

It is known that the nominal heat capacity of HP of air split-conditioners is given in catalogs or reference literature under standard outdoor temperature conditions, namely: outdoor air temperature +7oС, indoor air temperature +21oС.  At the same time, manufacturers of air split-conditioners do not ensure that, regardless of the size of heating capacity, all air split-conditioners have the same internal temperature conditions, namely: the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant and its condensation temperature.  In this case, the thermodynamic efficiency, which can be best assessed by the exergetic output-input ratio (OIR) of different heating capacity of HP of air split-conditioners, is different; this, in our opinion, is incorrect.  However, today there is a lack of mathematical models of bringing the operation of air split-conditioners HP to the similar internal temperature conditions, which will allow us to obtain the same exergetic OIR for different heating capacity of HP.  To create the mathematical model of bringing the operation of HP of air split-conditioners to the equal internal temperature conditions, we have proposed them, namely: the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant +0.7oC and its condensation temperature +40oC. Taking these temperatures on the basis of the heat balances of the HP evaporator and HP condenser of air split-conditioners, we obtained the dependences for calculating air flow rates on the evaporator and condenser, which respectively maintain the proposed temperatures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supplier Segmentation is one of the key activities of supplier relationship management (SRM) for companies with a large number of suppliers. It involves dividing the suppliers into a manageable number of segments, to formulate SRM strategies for the various segments, rather than for each individual supplier. In recent years, supplier segmentation has drawn the attention of a number of researchers. The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of existing literature on supplier segmentation and identify the future trend in this research area using a combination of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Citation Network Analysis (CNA). After determining the search protocol and paper selection indexes, 52 papers were eventually selected, and analyzed, in accordance with the steps proposed in the SLR and CNA methods. The results show that researchers tend to favor the portfolio-involvement approach and decision-making techniques in supplier segmentation research domain. A comprehensive analysis of the studies made it possible to distill the future research trend. This research area requires further study involving the supply chain paradigms, the impact of supplier segmentation on performance, and the analysis of the supplier relationship management as a whole, with supplier segmentation being one of its components.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, in order to adapt to the situation of rapid economic and social development, my country’s power supply companies have invested large-scale funds to build distribution networks, and upgraded urban and rural power grids, effectively supporting the rapid growth of power demand and the reliability of power supply. Continuous improvement of power quality. While the scale of investment in the distribution network continues to remain high, problems such as focusing on investment and neglecting revenue, focusing on project establishment and neglecting management also exist to varying degrees. Therefore, reasonably predicting the scale of investment in the distribution network and improving the lean management level of the investment and construction of the distribution network have become key issues that power supply companies need to solve. This paper takes my country’s municipal power supply companies as the research object, combines the actual business development of the company’s distribution network investment planning, and fully considers the impact of the company’s power supply district management and the level of cost differences on the investment scale of the distribution network, and builds a fit on this basis. The distribution network investment planning forecast model of the actual business work of the enterprise guides the municipal power supply enterprises to improve the lean management level of the distribution network investment and construction.</jats:p>"

In this view, this study attempts to explore four key factors influencing the adoption of SCF, which, in turn, impacts SCE in Chinese manufacturing firms. Therefore, this study aims to propose that how information sharing, external collaboration, digitization and financial institutions enable manufacturing firms’ to adopt SCF that subsequently enhances SCE.

At the same time, the functional focus of the company's interaction with partners in supply logistics is to perform tasks aimed at minimizing logistics costs. Minimization of logistics costs, as well as the introduction into management practice of other principles of logistics (timeliness of deliveries, assurance of quality and declared deadlines) creates additional competitive advantages of the enterprise and optimizes its entire business process.\nUnder these conditions, the issue of management approaches is actualized, which makes it possible to increase production flexibility, adapt the enterprise to competitive conditions, optimize flow processes, integrate elements of the production management system, ensure maximum capacity of production facilities, optimize basic and auxiliary operations, manufacture products in accordance with existing orders and fully meet the expectations of the main stakeholders of the enterprise. The vector of application of management approaches should be based on definite, specific for a particular business unit, measurable parameters of operating activities, which would be indicators of overall performance of the enterprise and informationally integrate the effectiveness of logistics and operating systems as a whole.\nThe article proposes a methodical approach to the formation of a system of indicators for a comprehensive assessment of raw material procurement (cost of the procurement process; quality of raw materials; the degree of satisfaction of final users) as well as an algorithm for their calculation. The practical significance of calculating such indicators is the synthesized application of indicators of efficiency of logistic and production systems of the enterprise as a whole, as well as the application of differentiated assessment of significance of indicators according to the established rating scale depending on the functional orientation of purchased products for the production process.</jats:p>"

In economics, mobility is the ability of an individual or a group to improve their economic status in relation to income and wealth within their lifetime or between generations. In information systems and computer science, mobility is used for the concept of mobile computing, in which a computer is transported by a person during normal use. Logistics creates by the design of logistics networks the infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods. Electric mobility is one of today’s solutions from an engineering perspective to reduce the need of energy resources and environmental impact. Moreover, for urban planning, mobility is the crunch question about how to optimize the different needs for mobility and how to link different transportation systems. In this publication we collected the ideas of practitioners, researchers, and government officials regarding the different modes of mobility in a globalised world, focusing on both domestic and international issues.</jats:p>"

The article reviews a mathematical model that is based on the principle of maximum utility. The proposed model is founded on the stage-by-stage determination of the production output and consumption of end products, as well as corresponding prices depending on the prices of used raw materials and semi-finished products. The prices for intermediate products and raw materials are formed depending on the need for end products output with their optimization by demand. The article provides the basic mathematical ration with regards to using principle of maximum utility applicable to the demand-supply model and its implementation in multi-stage production. The acquired results indicate weak dependence of production output and prices for end products on the cost of raw material in terms of advanced refining. With limited production capacity of raw materials, the dynamics of prices is well predicted. The results of modeling, compared to the available statistical data, indicate the adequacy of the proposed model to the unfolding economic processes. It is determined that the accuracy of price prediction for raw products with a significant volume of its subsequent processing is limited.\n\t</jats:p>"

Such information, however, is needed to determine contemporaneous changes in consumer and producer well-being. To address these issues, this paper derives supply and demand indices, links the indices to structural parameters in equilibrium displacement models, and shows how the measures can be used to calculate welfare changes over time. Empirical applications are presented for the US cattle, hog, and chicken sectors and for county-level corn supply. We show that supply and demand improvements have led to significant gains in beef producer and consumer welfare over time. Hog, and especially chicken, supply indices have increased markedly over the past four decades, reflecting significant productivity gains, whereas growth in cattle supply index has stagnated in recent years. We test the validity of the supply and demand indices for livestock, and find they correlate in hypothesized directions with factors such as corn prices, drought, aggregate agricultural total factor productivity, gross national product, and exchange rates. Trends in disaggregate corn supply indices reveal marked heterogeneity across US counties with the largest gains since 1980 being observed in the Dakotas, Kansas, Missouri, and the Mississippi Delta. Many areas of Ohio and Indiana have experienced negative corn supply shocks in 2016–8 relative to 2000. The approaches illustrated in this paper potentially have wide application in the study of many agricultural markets. For example, the supply index is an easy to calculate commodity- and geography-specific alternative to commonly used aggregate total factor productivity measures. The demand, supply, and welfare indices can provide timely information about the economic fundamentals in a market that can be coupled with other data to analyze structural adjustment patterns and rapidly determine changes in the well-being of producers and consumers.</jats:p>",

To formulate RL issues, multi-objective decision-making (MODM) techniques are of the most practical approaches. MODM methods refer to an optimization problem with multiple objectives that usually conflict with each other and must be satisfied simultaneously. However, no literature review had yet undertaken a comprehensive systematic review of the utilization of MODM methods in RL. Therefore, 205 relevant papers published in scientific journals are considered and investigated from descriptive and technical content dimensions in this paper. The results clearly illustrate the quantitative increase in the number of papers published in this field over the last 20 years. This increase depicts that the researchers' focus on this field has been increasing in the last decade. Content analysis on the main focus areas, case study sector, solution methodology, uncertainty modeling, period(s), product(s), and numerous objectives that these 205 papers considered in their study helped to visualize the current state of this field and reveal research gaps and introduce future directions. Finally, some potential topics are provided based on the results that cover all reverse logistics activities and also content analysis categories.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Relief organizations, especially the Red Crescent, lack any specific entrepreneurial strategy and program for production, identification, and distribution of relief supplies. These organizations mainly focus on the preparation and distribution of supplies in times of crisis. In this regard, the present study aimed to design an entrepreneurial supply chain model with an emphasis on technology in 2020 in Iran.\nMETHODS: The present study was conducted based on a qualitative and quantitative design. In the first phase, some indicators were obtained by observing the current situation and interviewing 30 experts. Following that, the final model was achieved by considering all indicators and categorizing the topics. In the Delphi process, experts' interviews and theoretical consensus suggested some hypotheses. In other words, in the second phase, structural equation modeling was used to finalize the model. In the next stage, the final questionnaire was provided to 186 Red Crescent employees.\nFINDINGS: After the analysis and extraction of the criteria from the interviews, components of the model were retrieved, and two questionnaires were designed. The first questionnaire was about supply chain management encompassing four main components of customer integrity, supplier integrity, internal integrity, and innovative orientation. The second questionnaire was related to technology, including seven components: personal characteristics, attitudinal factors, educational factors, technical factors, economic factors, environmental factors, as well as human and managerial factors. Considering the KMO value (˃0.7) and the significant value of the Bartlett Sphericity test, it can be concluded that the data are suitable for factor analysis. The model fit values all exceeded 0.9, indicating that the model has a “good fit. The path coefficients were significant for seven relationships at the level of 0.05.\nCONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the supply chain in disasters requires experts' comprehensive approach and innovative perspectives. The tendency of countries to take innovative measures in disasters requires macro-policies at the national and regional levels. Therefore, all dimensions and aspects of the entrepreneurial supply chain in disasters must be considered in order to attain the final goal which is effective and efficient disaster management.</jats:p>",

Data on intermittent water supply in South Africa was collated by considering the following four sources: a targeted water services provider survey; published databases and related reports; open-access publications, such as online media articles; and field visits by the project team to selected areas. The data were spatially and temporally analysed to determine the prevalence of intermittent water supply. The population affected by intermittent water supply increased by ~26% between 2008 and 2017, which exceeds the population increase of ~12% over the same period. Moreover, 22 million people in South Africa were affected by intermittent water supply in 2017. Results from this study confirm an increased prevalence of intermittent water supply over time and show that 65 of the 231 municipalities in South Africa supplied water intermittently, 32 had continuous water supply and 134 had no data. Fundamentally, the outcomes highlight the widespread occurrence of intermittent water supply in South Africa, which is in line with the poor state of water services delivery in South Africa, as portrayed in the 2018 National Water and Sanitation Master Plan by the national Department of Water and Sanitation.</jats:p>"

This emphasis presents specialty coffee as a socially progressive form of consumption that is often represented as superior to mass-produced coffee. Discourses that emphasize relationships between baristas and professionals at other levels of the supply chain serve as a tool in marketing specialty coffee, with baristas serving as an interface between consumers and other levels of the supply chain. The somewhat recent elevation of baristas to professional status is due, in part, to the growth of barista competitions. This article takes barista competitions as a context for analysis, highlighting how baristas incorporate voices from across the supply chain into their competition performances. I argue that in voicing individuals from across the supply chain, baristas draw on the expertise and authority represented by coffee farmers and roasters to support the development of their own authentic professional persona. This article also shows that, by voicing the supply chain, baristas respond to consumer desires for more ethical forms of consumption through these narratives, providing the moral and emotional experience of coffee that consumers crave.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water is a natural resource, with limited quantities and unevenly distributed in space and time. All forms of human life and activity are dependent on water. As is known today, one of the main challenges in the region and the world is the preservation and development of water resources as a basic element for life to cover the basic requirements for drinking, then for agriculture and industry. Shkodra has a hydrographic system “Shkodra Lake – Drin River – Buna River”, which collects the waters of a basin with a total area of 19,582 km2. This considerable catchment area, with high and rugged mountainous relief and abundant intense rainfall, with special lithological construction of the terrain, in the presence of permeable limestone formations makes it possible for the hydrographic network of this basin to stand out for high and quiet diverse hydric potential. This network includes Shkodra Lake, Drin, Bune, Kir, and Gjadër rivers. The study aims to improve water supply and increase the effectiveness and sustainability of services to the citizens who are included in the intervention areas, the provision of clean drinking water and the creation of a sanitary clean environment through the administration of polluted waters, against acceptable fees which cover, at least, the operating expenses. The expected results are a good performance of the CUs, ensuring the proper service and operation of the CUs, efficient water supply, and sewerage systems. Knowledge of the technical aspects of the CU Shkodër is necessary for citizens as it is directly related to the agent and the future of our children.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globalization has led to a significant effect on today’s manufacturing sector. Manufacturers need to find new and innovative ways to increase efficiency and reduce waste in the manufacturing supply chain. Lean/six sigma tools can help companies increase production efficiency and stay in competition. Manufacturing in smaller batches can keep the supply chain lean and customizable. This leads to frequent changeovers and downtime. A changeover is usually required when a single machine produces different products based on the requirement. A large-scale industry can either install multiple individual production lines to cater to the demand (usually expensive) or make frequent machinery changes. Single Minute Exchange Die (SMED) is a system designed for reducing the changeover time for machines. It reduces the time taken to complete the activities and eliminates non-essential activities throughout the changeover. Scheduling an operating procedure within SMED in such case is a challenge. Project scheduling model with workforce constraints can be used to create a set of heuristics to provide us with an optimized list of tasks. The paper proposes to design a scheduling heuristic model to allocate tasks to the operators to get the least amount of operator idle time and reduce changeover downtime costs. The paper further illustrates the benefit of the model in a case study and proposes its integration within the existing SMED methodology. This results in a benefit-to-cost ratio of 7.5% for production scheduling compared to that of stages 4 and 5 in SMED, which is 1.2%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The United States food system requires energy, water, and land in significant proportions, releases large quantities of greenhouse gases, and contributes to other environmental concerns. Meeting future demand for fresh food will be especially challenging, requiring the adoption of holistic, systems-level thinking to maximize production and supply while limiting consequences to the climate and natural resources. We have developed a cradle-to-market life-cycle environmental model to assess the greenhouse gas footprint of fresh tomatoes supplied to ten of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. A linear optimization algorithm is applied to determine the optimal tomato distribution scheme that will minimize tomato-related greenhouse gas emissions across all ten areas. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess the uncertainties in the data. Results indicate that the current tomato distribution scheme is suboptimal; re-allocating the fresh tomato supply across these ten areas has the potential to decrease transportation-related emissions by 34% and overall tomato-related greenhouse gas emissions by 13%—from 277,000 MTCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e to 242,000 MTCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e. The substantial variability of the optimized scenario raises questions about its practical implementation. Ultimately, however, production practices and geographic conditions (such as soil and climate) are more significant with respect to environmental impact than the supply allocation or the seasonality of supply. Our analysis found a roughly six-fold difference between Philadelphia tomatoes sourced from open-field Virginian production (0.38 kgCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/kg) compared with controlled-environment Mexican production (2.3 kgCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e/kg).</jats:p>"

Fast-growing young animals such as broiler chickens, ducks, and calves are examples of this class, prevalent in many food industries. Despite their presence in various food supply chains, studying these items in the context of inventory control, supply chain, and operations management is still in its early stage. This study provides the essential grounds of the knowledge in this area and further reviews the related research developments to provide the researchers with clear insights into the structure of the current literature, its main gaps, and promising directions for future research. In order to guarantee the comprehensiveness of our review, we have incorporated a systematic search procedure to identify the relevant literature. Through this procedure, 23 papers were identified that were used in our further analysis throughout the paper. Our investigations show that the literature on growing inventories is very confined, and this body of the literature gets even more limited when it comes to the problems in the context of the supply chain. Our findings introduce the topic as a promising direction in inventory and supply chain management with high potential for insightful future research works.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper builds a Stackelberg game model led by the manufacturer in a dual‐channel supply chain to examine the reaction of the government under centralized or decentralized decisions‐making structures with different low‐carbon strategies. The result shows that the government can achieve higher profits by taking incentive or punitive measures for centralized decision‐making supply chain no matter they invest in emissions reduction or not. Moreover, for decentralized decision‐making mode, increasing low‐carbon subsidies for retailers can achieve a win‐win result between the supply chain and the government; and, finally, channel competition is good for improving the supply chain and social benefits. Therefore, the government is responsible for taking reasonable subsidy policies, formulate industry’s low‐carbon standards, and properly guide competition between supply chain members to achieve higher profits.</jats:p>",

The thesis widely sustained by scholars and reflected in public opinion is that the institutionalized pattern of European integration contributed to isolate and weaken the political regime that generalissimo Francisco Franco established after his victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936-9) and headed until his death in November 1975. In Spain, during the struggle for democracy under and immediately following Franco’s dictatorship, membership in the European Communities became emblematic of a collective desire for democratic consolidation and social modernization, as well as the fastest route to elevate the Spanish standard of living in line with Europe’s most advanced societies. This notion of the Europeanization of Spain has made it difficult to conceive the Spanish policy of the European Communities during the Franco era as anything other than a significant element in the combat against Francoism. It is indisputable that the Axis stigma prevented Francoist Spain’s membership to the European Communities. Yet the absence of membership constitutes neither the beginning nor the end, nor even the most important component of the story. From exclusion, a multiplicity of possibilities sprouted, including active support. Although the rescue concept emerged from the analysis of the Six, it could be extended to Franco Spain. The purpose of the Spanish EEC strategy was to generate material prosperity in Spain to maintain the dictatorship’s grip on the country, not to advance the arrival of democracy.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the work performed is to determine the actual heat losses through the thermal insulation of the surveyed heating networks and to compare them with normative values. The article presents an analysis of materials on the heat supply system; test findings for actual heat losses in a heat supply pipeline; calculation of actual heat losses for each section and their adjustment to average annual operating conditions of the given heat supply network; comparison of calculation results with normative characteristics. The test findings are used in developing the output performance for the «Heat Loss» indicator and in setting of norms for operating heat losses. The heat supply source for the heat pipeline is the CHP-plant. The pipelines are routed above ground on high and low supports, as well as in crawl ways. The thermal insulation of the pipelines is mainly made of 50 mm blankets of mineral wool and is typical for heat supply networks. In overhauls of heat supply networks, polyurethane foam is partly used as thermal insulation.</jats:p>"

Many believe that governments and global businesses were not as prepared as they should have been. While academics have occasionally predicted the economic problems that could result from pandemics, until 2020, there had been scant research that addresses supply chain management issues during pandemics. Eighty-four percent of all pandemic supply chain research was published in the first ten months of 2020. Since the world now finds itself operating supply chains in response to the pandemic, this literature needs to be summarized and articulated for understanding and future research. This literature review addresses that need by summarizing the research which has been generated since 1997, focusing primarily on the bulk of the research that has been published since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Research tools are used to summarize the literature citations, and the articles are coded according to some important variables to further delineate their details. This research also includes a bibliometric co-citation analysis, which clusters the pandemic supply chain literature by author, journal, and article. The findings are that pre-COVID-19 research on pandemic supply chains was primarily about influenza and the healthcare supply chain, whereas post-COVID-19 research provides more analysis of the food supply chain and uses a wider variety of research methods, including simulation, modeling, and empirical methods.</jats:p>"

Information technology in the form of point-of-sale data, materials requirement planning software, and enterprise-wide systems have often been leveraged to assist with this. However, with the proliferation of data, storing, managing, and analyzing data on a large scale is a challenge. Blockchains provide numerous benefits such as data transparency, immutability, and traceability that are so critical in building a cohesive cyberinfrastructure that facilitates cooperation and collaboration among supply chain partners. This chapter examines the characteristics of blockchain that make it suitable for supply chains and explore how the benefits afforded by blockchain can be leveraged to enhance value creation while optimizing the supply chain. </jats:p>"

The growth of female labour force participation in Mexico between 1960 and 2015 followed an S-shape, with a considerable acceleration during the 1990s. Using decomposition methods and a shift-share design, we show that, put together, supply and demand factors can account for the rise of female labour force participation over the period, led by increases in women’s education and shifts in the occupational structure of the workforce. However, there is unexplained variation in the 1990s, when female labour force participation spiked.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply voltage frequency effect on partial discharge (PD) phenomena has continued to draw research interest. Although most high voltage equipment operates at power frequency (50/60 Hz), testing is often done at different frequencies for various reasons. Despite some agreements and inconsistencies for the research findings of PD activity’s frequency dependence, there has been consensus on the recognition of the discharge mechanism parameters that influence how the supply voltage frequency affects PD activity. These parameters include statistical time lag, discharge area surface conductivity, and the residual charge decay. In this paper, a 3-capacitor model (ABC) is used to simulate how the changes in the discharge mechanism parameters influence PD characteristics as a function of the supply voltage frequency. The findings are that the phase-resolved partial discharge pattern (PRPDP) and PD repetition rate (PDRR) characteristics are more sensitive to variations in the probability of the seed electron availability at higher frequencies of the supply voltage. The opposite trend is observed for the cavity surface resistance. At lower resistance of cavity surface, the PRPDP and PDRR characteristics are more sensitive to changes in the supply voltage frequency than at higher resistances. The paper also confirms that incorporating equivalent resistances in the ABC model makes it more authentic than the model comprising of capacitors only.</jats:p>"

Methodology: A descriptive research design has been used for assessing satisfaction. All hospitals in the study area were selected purposively and simple random sampling with a lottery method was used to pick health centers from the sampling frame. A total of 32 health facilities (i.e. 6 hospitals and 26 health centers) have been chosen for this research. Epidata software and SPSS version 20 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Frequency distribution, arithmetic means, and percentages were calculated. Result: This research discovered that 41(64.1%) of respondents were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, while 19(29.7%) considered themselves as 'satisfied' with the overall quality of the logistics services they received. Besides, 3(4.7%) of the respondents said they were 'dissatisfied' with the service and 1(1.6%) was highly dissatisfied with the service. Conclusion: The overall perceived satisfaction of public health facilities with the quality of logistics service given by the Pharmaceutical Fund and Supply Agency Bahirdar hub was in the middle of the continuum, with the mean score close to the 5-Likert scale midpoint</jats:p>"

The author draws data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey and uses within-state variation in supply of immigrant entrepreneurs for identification. To address concerns of endogeneity in the supply of immigrant entrepreneurs, the author takes advantage of a quasi-experiment provided by the State Children's Health Insurance Program. While the Ordinary Least Squares estimates indicate a positive effect, the Two Stage Least Squares estimates suggest that, on average, there is no significant effect of immigrant entrepreneurs on native entrepreneurship. Moreover, there is no net effect on subgroups of natives separated by skill level. There is also some evidence that immigrant entrepreneurs may “crowd-in” Blacks into certain types of self-employment. These results are in contrast to the significant negative impact suggested by the previous literature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are seen as one of the circular economy’s leading approaches for reducing our natural environment load. Many CLSC models require collaboration among different parties. Game theory (GT) offers a way to consider the profits of all parties in a CLSC, providing insight into the costs and benefits to the involved parties in an objective and quantitative way. Presently, available reviews on the use of GT, in the context of CLSC, are quite limited and consider only a few relevant elements. Here, we present a new and more extensive framework, focusing on the collaboration structure of CLSCs. It contains a content-based analysis of 230 papers based on a four-step systematic literature review process. The characteristics studied are channels for collection, reprocessing and selling, the planning horizon, and the types of games. The structures found are graphically reviewed, leading to 196 different structures. The results show that, so far, most attention has been paid to the dual-channel collection, where collection by two retailers (dual-retailer) is the most studied case. With respect to selling, most attention has been paid to situations with two selling channels (dual-selling), i.e., one channel managed by a manufacturer and one channel managed by a remanufacturer. Studies have prioritized the role of manufacturers as that of the leader and collector. Finally, a number of directions for further research are pointed out.</jats:p>"

There are many companies that operate under the first tier company as subcontractors on the same goal. Cloud computing system is capable to monitor real-time production processes for every subcontractor to assist the 1st tier to make decision and respond customer effectively. Daily monitoring data of all subcontractors in the supply chain are stored in the central database and finally the performance evaluation can be done.

This is perhaps no truer than for Dar es Salaam, the largest city and commercial capital of Tanzania. What was eighty years ago a small town of a mere forty thousand residents is today the world's second-fastest growing city, with a population of more than six million. This growth has come despite a history of racist, colonial urban development and the inadequacy of its formal water supply, which services a fraction of the needs of its residents. This essay examines the development of Dar es Salaam's anthropogenic waterscape, or water infrastructure, and argues that the city's tremendous growth has come despite its inability to provide basic services. In the absence of reliable public water, its residents have adapted creatively, developing their own solutions in a way that has drawn on knowledge and practice from rural areas as well as new urban-centered strategies. This history of creative adaptation, and its benefits and drawbacks, provides a useful framework for thinking about the meaning of resilience in Africa's urban centers in an era of increasing climate uncertainty.</jats:p>",

Particularly with regard to the interdependence of critical infrastructures means that water supply failures can have far-reaching consequences and endanger the safety of a society, e.g., by impairing hospital operations. In case of an emergency in the drinking water infrastructure, minimum supply standards, e.g., for patients in hospitals, become important for emergency management during crisis situations. However, wider recognition of this issue is still lacking, particularly in countries facing comparably minor water supply disruptions. Several international agencies provide guideline values for minimum water supply standards for hospitals in case of a disaster. Acknowledging these minimum standards were developed for humanitarian assistance or civil protection, it remains to be analyzed whether these standards apply to disaster management in countries with high water and healthcare supply standards. Based on a literature review of scientific publications and humanitarian guidelines, as well as policies from selected countries, current processes, contents, and shortcomings of emergency water supply planning are assessed. To close the identified gaps, this paper indicates potential improvements for emergency water supply planning in general as well as for supply of hospitals and identifies future fields of research.</jats:p>",

The distribution of water resources was presented in the following indicators – water supply across the territory of administrative-territorial units and water supply per capita per year. The quantitative indicators of water intake, the directions of the use of the country’s water resources by regions, such as irrigated agriculture, production needs and communal drinking water supply, are described in detail. The sources of drinking water and the amount of water losses are indicated, the main reasons for high water losses are determined. The differences between the northern and southern regions of the country in terms of water supply, the ratio of the north and south of the country in terms of water use have been determined.

It is determined that in the agri-food chain the decisive factors for creating and maintaining competitive advantages are access to the best buyer at the appropriate level of quality, with the required shelf life and proper passage through the supply chain.\n\nIn the context of globalization, the competitive advantages of logistics services, based only on price and consumer properties, lose their leading importance, and in the first place are flexibility, limited lead time, reliable and high-quality supplies, choice, and so on. The complexity of the organization of transport and logistics systems for the supply of perishable food products is due to, on the one hand, the participation of a large number of links in the chain, and, on the other hand, the features of perishable goods.</jats:p>"

The digital supply chain transformation can be evident establishing collaborative forecasting processes, optimizing networks and inventories, etc. Digital supply chain transformation is not a new buzz word. It is the application of digital capabilities to processes, products, and assets to improve supply chain efficiency, enhance customer value, manage risk, and achieve competitive advantage. However, organizations are still facing numerous challenges to transform and perform. Perhaps the most common misunderstanding is that digital transformation is all about the implementation and use of cutting-edge technologies. This chapter will dive deep to understand major challenges to digital supply chain transformations, identify the key drivers and enablers of digital opportunity, and provide a change management framework for digital supply chain transformation. </jats:p>"

This study aims to provide a set of guidelines to data scientists and researchers who are interested in optimizing statistical methods. A systematic literature review revealed six most promising methods for churn forecasting and a selection of metrics which can be used to evaluate the performance of the methods. The six statistical methods are evaluated on five metrics of performance. The best-worst method (BWM), a multi-criteria decision-making method, is used to elicit the relative importance of the performance metrics. Based on the relative importance of the metrics and the performance of the methods, using additive value function, we find an overall value for each method based on which the forecasting methods can be ranked. Experimental analysis reveals that finding an overall value for each statistical analysis leads to a different ranking than when we use a single performance metric like accuracy or AUC. We argue that relying on an aggregated value, like the one we propose in this study, is more reliable than considering only one metric (a common practice).</jats:p>"

Public budget constraints imply a need for prioritizing scarce public funds for financing water-related investment. In this sense, municipalities have ranked stormwater management services as a low priority compared to other public needs, causing them to be underfunded. The creation of stormwater utilities for securing resources should be supported through economic, technical, and legal arguments. There is a global water and sanitation access gap. Municipalities should dedicate themselves more to investigate how these gaps can be reduced, which will bring a higher benefit–cost ratio. Overruling these local governments and financing low priority interventions seems immoral. Furthermore, compulsory charges on public services that supply universal benefits are illegal.</jats:p>",

The EU Commission expects a quota of up to 30 percent by 2030. This has positive effects on the environ-ment, climate, biodiversity and animal welfare. An increase in organic farm-ing also has a direct impact on reducing and eliminating the use of non-organic fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, genetically modified organisms and the use of antibiotics. Egg production in particular is experiencing high growth rates in the organic sector, while other processing sectors have so far only been able to come up with small shares. In the case of fattening poultry and pigs, this is still well below 2%, while eggs have already reached over 15%, and the trend is up-wards. Protein requirements are met primarily by soybeans, but other protein sources such as legumes and, above all, sunflowers and rapeseed have now also be-come increasingly important. Sustainability and CO2 reduction are at the center of public interest. The origin of soy from European cultivation is therefore of great importance. This significantly reduces the impact on the climate. The previous main suppliers in South America are waiting with smaller market shares. This mainly affects the organic sector, while conventional processing continues to rely on non-European origins for cost reasons.</jats:p>"

To address the humanitarian crisis global institutions are tirelessly working to assuage the suffering of people in crisis. Back bone of such initiatives is the Humanitarian Supply Chains which are often a complex linkage of Global non-profit organizations, private players, independent contractors, and local volunteers This paper aims at identifying the areas in humanitarian supply chain which can be improved by implementation of Blockchain technology.

The establishment of the Federal Circuit in 1982, coupled with the relaxation of antitrust restrictions on licensing starting in 1977, inaugurated a strong-IP regime that has enabled firms to mitigate the expropriation risk inherent to the transfer and exchange of informational assets. In the biotechnology market, secure patents have facilitated transactions between R&amp;D-intensive start-ups and large pharmaceutical companies that specialize in the testing, production, and distribution functions required to reach market. In certain segments of the semiconductor market, secure patents have facilitated transactions between chip-design firms and “foundries” that specialize in chip production. In certain information-technology markets, secure patents have facilitated IP-licensing structures that promote informational dissemination among a broad population of producers and other intermediate users.</jats:p>",

Mathematical and logical analysis of different inventory and supply chain models helps mangers in overall cost reduction and further higher revenue generation. Members often encounter conflicting interest and unforeseen scenario. So, all this make supply chain very complex and dynamic process. Complex and uncertain nature of inventory and supply chain, many times either it is not feasible to solve the issue with traditional methods or it is not cost effective. Thus many researchers are using artificial intelligence approach for investigation.

In the era of new retail, customer value is not only affected by the product price, but it is also closely related to innovations, such as value-added services and unique business models. In this paper, we study the joint innovation investment and pricing decisions in a retailer–supplier supply chain based on revenue sharing contracts and customer value. We first find that, in the non-cooperative game, equilibrium only exists in the supplier Stackelberg game. However, revenue sharing contracts cannot coordinate the supply chain in the non-cooperative game. By considering supply chain members’ bargaining power, we find that there exists a unique equilibrium for the Nash bargaining product. In addition, revenue sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain and achieve the optimal consumer surplus. When the supply chain is coordinated, supply chain profit is allocated to the supply chain members based on their bargaining powers.</jats:p>"

This concept has already lost itsviabilitydue to a number of factors, namely: the depleted global ecological system, socio-economic and resource constraints. Through various environmental contaminants sharply reducedand thequality of life disappear goals populations of animal and plant life. Today, there is an alternative to the linear model of the economy - a circular economy, the main task of which is to restore the ecosystem, saving resource potential, financial and human resources through reverse and careful treatment.To form a new model of economy, governments of developed countries use different tools, but there is not always an understanding of the importance and effectiveness of this concept. The article considers the essence and basic principles of circular economy. As a basis for the implementation of the concept of circular economy are considered closed supply chains and as the main tool for the implementation of tasks - reversible logistics.Managing reverse logistics is a complex task that requires a systematic approach and significant resources.The goal of building reverse flows is to reduce costs and increase profits.The author's interpretation of the essence and content of reverse flows in closed supply chains, which include return and return flows, is presented in the article..The constituent elements of reversible material flows in closed supply chains are investigated.The main problems in the formation of closed supply chains are identified, namely the optimization of inventory management throughout the chain.A methodical approach to inventory management in closed supply chains, which provide for multilevel inventorymanagement, is proposed.The use of a set of inventory management modelsthat allow to coordinate actions for inventory management and are adequate to the practice of doing business in a circular economy.Conclusions and recommendations on the peculiarities of the formation of closed supply chains, the list of flows as elements of reversible logistics, methodological approaches to the use of inventory management models in complex logistics systems built on a circular basis (circular).</jats:p>"

The water supply network covers rural areas of approximately 50 square kilometres with a total of 6130 inhabitants (2020). The area is characterised by relatively large differences in elevation. The water-pipe network supplies water mostly to family housing, public utility buildings, recreational buildings, service and craft entities, religious buildings, and commercial facilities and farms, including breeding farms. The network is supplied from one deep water well and a centrally located water supply tank. A hydraulic model was used for the analysis. The model was developed using the Epanet program, based on numerical and operational data. After validation, selected measurement points were used to calibrate the model. Furthermore, a series of simulations were performed to illustrate the network operation for variable water supply and demand conditions. Single-period analysis was used for modelling due to the type of data obtained. The model allowed for the determination of the head of pressure in the network points and flows in particular sections for the operation parameters studied. The analysis showed that at present, the network is not operating stably. In the case of average demand, water is supplied to all users, but there are areas in the network characterised by high pressure. On the other hand, during maximum water demand, due to the limited water supply to the water reservoir, from which most of the network is supplied, there are water deficiencies that cannot be compensated for by the operating pumping system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study aims to find out the relationship between Supply Chain Performance (SCP), profitability, and liquidity of selected leading Indian pharmaceutical companies. The study is based upon the secondary data available on the website of the concerned Indian pharmaceutical companies. The SCP defines the operational velocity and is measured by the manufacturing efficiency (inventory days), ability of recovery from the debtors (accounts receivables days), and payment to creditors (account payables days). Profitability is the relative measurement of the earning capacity of the business organization and facilitates the comparison among the business organization of similar industries. The liquidity in a business organization refers to the state of pay ability of the short term liabilities in ordinary business activities. Profitability and liquidity are the bi-polar concepts in the business organization. There is an optimum balance between liquidity and profitability is expected for the growth and development of the business organization. Ratio analysis is to be used to analyze the SCP, profitability, and liquidity while Karl Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation applied to get the correlation between SCP, profitability, and liquidity of the companies, and relative relationship between a correlation of profitability and profitability to liquidity ratio of all selected companies. It is observed that there is moderate relationship gross profitability, profitability on the owner’s fund, and liquidity. But there is a negligible relationship between liquidity and return on total resources or profitability on total assets. The Indian pharmaceutical companies with higher profitability are much sensitive about the co-movement of profitability and liquidity. The SCP of the Indian pharmaceutical companies negatively and positively but negligibly affects the profitability and liquidity of the Indian pharmaceutical companies.</jats:p>"

So, there is a need to have a holistic view of production and movement of goods from production to last mile delivery. The physical and digital supply chains need to be integrated to ensure secure supply chains that promote business excellence, collaboration among stakeholders, and reduce costs. The high-level view over their supply chains allows them to function better in a multi-channel world. It also helps them identify where to reduce stock without compromising customer service. Otherwise, it leads to a delay in delivery, counterfeit products, thefts, fraud, and cyberpiracy, which may lead to lawsuits and losing of brand image. The tacit function of supply chain management is to provide tracking of specific goods in the supply chain. So, it is imperative to leverage the blockchain technology stack to map multi-enterprise value networks and enable connected multi-modal networks. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture is one of the most important and largest sectors in Indonesia and creates jobs for at least 38.7 million workers. Although the number of workers in agriculture is relatively high and the sector contributes 14% to Indonesian GDP, many challenges still remain hampering growth. One of the key issues is the limited data availability in the agriculture sector causing imperfect and incomplete information on agriculture products. Data can provide the information about the quality of the product to the consumer to create transparency between producer and consumer. In order to facilitate data access, a big data base is needed in which all stakeholders can access the near-time data. A technology that can help to support this database is called blockchain. Blockchain is an immutable, transparent, public and append-only ledger. It is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates and verifies those updates to the ledger in a way that it is impossible to alter the data. This paper discusses HARA, a use-case of blockchain implementation in the food and agriculture sector. </jats:p>"

This is mainly caused due to lack of cold chain infrastructure which includes both storage and transportation facilities. The cold chain industry in India is still at a nascent stage and despite large production of perishables, the cold chain potential still remain untapped due to high share of single commodity cold storage, high initial investment (for refrigerator units and land), lack of enabling infrastructure like power &amp; roads, lack of awareness for handling perishable produce and lapse of service either by the storage provider or the transporter leading to poor quality produce.

This study therefore extends a series of analyses dating back 50+ years to assess SCM publication productivity, evaluating the most productive schools across six journals as well as the associated growth of the base of SCM scholars. The results depict a relatively stable core set of productive schools, while relative research productivity remains mostly fluid outside this core set. In support, SCM author concentration results depict that the overall base of SCM scholars is continuing to expand without signs of slowing. Both SCM programs and individual scholars can apply the results to benchmark peers to improve research productivity and justify requests for resources at their schools. The results also help young scholars understand SCM research expectations and likewise target potential partners for collaboration. We close with thoughts for scholars, academic leaders, and journal editors, including the need for more international and multidisciplinary research collaboration as well as a greater diversity of schools graduating new SCM scholars. Additionally, SCM scholars and journals should revisit our historically strong ties to professional practice to enhance our research relevancy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advent of information and communication technologies (ICT) ushers a cost-effective prospect to take care of large volumes of complex data, commonly known as “big data” in the supply chain operational environment. Big data is being generated today by web applications, social media, intelligent machines, sensors, mobile phones, and other smart handheld devices. Big data is characterized in terms of the velocity, volume, and variety with which it produces along the supply chain. This is due to recent advances in telecommunication networks along with centralized and decentralized data storage systems, which are processed thanks to modern digital computational capabilities. There is a growing interest in the use of this large volume of data and advanced analytics for diverse types of business problems in supply chain management (SCM). Such decision-support software applications employ pure mathematical techniques, artificial intelligence techniques, and sometimes uses both techniques to perform analytical operations that undercover relationships and patterns within supply chain generated big data. This chapter proposes a framework for the utilization of big data in SCM decision making. The framework is based on the SCOR (supply chain operations reference) model, which is endorsed by Supply Chain Council (SCC). The proposed framework is influenced by the enterprise potential of augmented reality and virtual reality in supply chain applications, and it identifies key categories of big data analytics applications for the key businesses of SCOR model. Finally, the chapter highlights research issues to extract insight from big data sources for enterprise decision making. </jats:p>"

Increasing fungicide costs are, therefore, becoming a threat to farmers’ incomes. Developing SBR-resistant cultivars is a possible solution to this problem. To investigate the effects of SBR-resistant cultivars on soybean farmers in Paraguay, we constructed a model for the supply and demand of soybeans considering yields, cultivated area, changes in the stock quantity of soybeans, exports of soybeans and soybean products, feed demand for soybean cake and price linkage functions. We established three scenarios: an SBR pandemic in which fungicides become ineffective (Scenario 1) and the adoption of SBR-resistant cultivars in 33% (Scenarios 2) and 75% (Scenarios 3) of cultivated areas. The estimation of these three scenarios demonstrates that SBR-resistant cultivar adoption will significantly reduce current fungicide costs for farmers by 112–253 million United States dollars (USD). The potential benefits of the widespread dissemination of SBR-resistant cultivars are also considered in terms of economic disparities and environmental risks. To establish a more sustainable agricultural industry, earlier dissemination of such cultivars is required.</jats:p>"

In this design the condenser is made up of a cylindrical copper tube with continuous helical fins over it, that increases the total available condensation area by almost 45% and enhances the overall heat transfer throughout the module. The presence of fins in the gap also reduces the total air gap width by almost 64% and therefore improves the flux production. A detailed experimental analysis is carried out for a better understanding of the underlying phenomenon. The effect of feed water temperature, feed flow rate, cold flow rate, coolant temperature and feed salinity on the performance of HAGMD is investigated experimentally. The analysis shows that the finned condenser results in very high flux. The maximum flux obtained from the system was 20 kg/m2 hr with feed of 5 g/liter salinity and a diving force temperature difference of 45 °C.</jats:p>",

However, most of today's systems, methods, and technologies leveraged for handling the forward supply chain of COVID-19 medical equipment and the waste that results from them after usage are inefficient. They fall short in providing traceability, reliability, operational transparency, security, and trust features. Also, they are centralized that can cause a single point of failure problem. In this paper, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based solution to automate forward supply chain processes for the COVID-19 medical equipment and enable information exchange among all the stakeholders involved in their waste management in a manner that is fully secure, transparent, traceable, and trustworthy. We integrate the Ethereum blockchain with decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems (IPFS) to securely fetch, store, and share the data related to the forward supply chain of COVID-19 medical equipment and their waste management. We develop algorithms to define interaction rules regarding COVID-19 waste handling and penalties to be imposed on the stakeholders in case of violations. We present system design along with its full implementation details. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using cost analysis to show its affordability. We present the security analysis to verify the reliability of the smart contracts, and discuss our solution from the generalization and applicability point of view. Furthermore, we outline the limitations of our solution in form of open challenges that can act as future research directions. We make our smart contracts code publicly available on GitHub.</jats:p>"

The research site focuses on Namlea District Buru Regency with consideration of the availability of the number of agricultural lands that are less than other districts in the Buru Regency. The number of informants interviewed as many as 40 people consisting of landowners, farmers, business owners, and village apparatus. Analytical techniques used to follow the concept of Miles and Huberman where activities in the analysis of qualitative data are conducted interactively and continuously to find saturation in the data processing. The results showed that the reduction of farmland in Namlea district was due to the conversion of land for various activities including housing and development of the Trade Center.

In the work, frost-resistant planar photovoltaic modules and solar roofing panels with an extended service life for power supply of objects are proposed. For simultaneous heat and electrical generation, frost-resistant planar photovoltaic thermal roofing panels and concentrator solar installation with high-voltage matrix solar modules with a voltage of 1000 V and an electrical efficiency of up to 28% are proposed. The considered solar modules have an extended rated power period due to the use of the technology of sealing solar cells with a two-component polysiloxane compound and are able to work effectively at large negative ambient temperatures and large ranges of its fluctuations. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The year 2020 has witnessed unprecedented levels of demand for COVID-19 medical equipment and supplies. However, most of today's systems, methods, and technologies leveraged for handling the forward supply chain of COVID-19 medical equipment and the waste that results from them after usage are inefficient. They fall short in providing traceability, reliability, operational transparency, security, and trust features. Also, they are centralized that can cause a single point of failure problem. In this paper, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based solution to automate forward supply chain processes for the COVID-19 medical equipment and enable information exchange among all the stakeholders involved in their waste management in a manner that is fully secure, transparent, traceable, and trustworthy. We integrate the Ethereum blockchain with decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems (IPFS) to securely fetch, store, and share the data related to the forward supply chain of COVID-19 medical equipment and their waste management. We develop algorithms to define interaction rules regarding COVID-19 waste handling and penalties to be imposed on the stakeholders in case of violations. We present system design along with its full implementation details. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using cost analysis to show its affordability. We present the security analysis to verify the reliability of the smart contracts, and discuss our solution from the generalization and applicability point of view. Furthermore, we outline the limitations of our solution in form of open challenges that can act as future research directions. We make our smart contracts code publicly available on GitHub.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we consider that the supply chain risk management consists of a manufacturer and a retailer faced with demand and supply uncertainties caused by the interruption of supply chain. We consider that the manufacturer transfers the disruption risk by purchasing BI (business interruption) insurance. Three models are established to illustrate the impact of insurance on supply chain decision‐making under risk. It is observed that business interruption insurance can increase the retailer’s order quantity and supply chain profit. The higher the interrupt probability is, the more obvious the value of the business interruption insurance is. Furthermore, the retailer helps the manufacturer to share the premium, and the manufacture shares the proceeds of insurance with the retailer, which can stimulate retailer to order more and increase the profit of manufacturer and retailer.</jats:p>",

Responses were anonymous. Descriptive analysis was conducted.\nResultsOverall, 13/24 (54%) of CEOs responded. A majority (11/13) agreed that climate change is causing real and accelerating harm to health and the environment, with impacts on patients, staff and services a current issue. One hundred percent (13/13) saw leadership by the public healthcare sector on environmental sustainability as an important responsibility (strongly agreed, 9/13 (69%); agreed, 4/13 (31%)), with most CEOs supporting their institution increasing the amount of renewable electricity supply over-and-above grid levels (strongly agreed, 3/13 (23%); agreed, 9/13 (69%)). However, support for renewable electricity was, for the most part, aspirational and not perceived as a current priority. The key perceived barriers to increasing renewable electricity supply were Health Purchasing Victoria contract and financial constraints.\nConclusionsHealth care itself has a carbon footprint. Public healthcare CEOs are supportive of their institutions increasing use of renewable electricity supply, yet perceived barriers regarding inflexible and poorly transparent purchasing contracts and financial cost exist.\nWhat is known about the topic?Australian health care contributes ~7 percent to Australia’s total carbon emissions, with hospital energy consumption (coal-generated electricity and natural/fossil gas) a large majority. An executive level champion is a consistent factor across health services that are taking the lead on environmental sustainability.\nWhat does this paper add?Our research is original in understanding the views of Victorian public healthcare CEOs on climate change, renewable energy supply and key barriers to increasing uptake. A majority of public healthcare CEOs see energy choices as an important issue for their patients, staff and institution, and that greater leadership should be shown by health care in light of the urgency required to address greenhouse gas emissions. However, support for renewable electricity was, for the most part, aspirational, with specific barriers identified across the healthcare network.\nWhat are the implications for practitioners?This research provides information that can inform a pathway to healthcare decarbonisation via sector-wide action.\n</jats:p>"

The work uses general scientific methods of logistics research based on economic and methodological developments in the field of transdisciplinary analysis of modern logistics. The necessity of using a qualitatively new approach of fragmented design of the logistics process, based on a system of values, focused on the new code and digital thinking, in the core of which the cognitive platform is in the real economy sector, has been substantiated. The main components of an industry solution for supply chain visibility and traceability are defined. Conceptualized and theoretically divided into stages the process of designing an effective logistics supply chain that meets the conditions of visibility and traceability. The formation of an industry solution related to the design of a fragmented logistics process and an efficient supply chain is of applied importance and can maximally meet the growing needs of stakeholders to create sustainable multi-level distribution channels of all types of resources.</jats:p>"

In total, in our analysis, we used 472 unique market power index estimates and employed various linear regression models to investigate their determinants.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:bold>Findings &amp; Value added:</jats:bold> Our findings suggest that, on average, the reported degree of market power in the USA is almost twice as high as in other countries. At the same time, market power estimates related to the meat, dairy and horticulture industries are systematically higher than the ones related to other supply chains. Finally, we observed that, on average, supply chains related to highly perishable products tend to have lower market power estimates associated with them, than other supply chains. Our results have important implications for future investigation of the structural source of market power and unfair trade practices.</jats:p>"

Der Weg in diese neue Welt der Mobilität ist mit einer Vielzahl an Herausforderungen und Unwägbarkeiten verbunden und wird die aktuell bestehenden Marktstrukturen nachhaltig verändern. Im Rahmen einer qualitativen Interviewstudie wurden 75 Experten aus verschiedenen Branchen und Sektoren der Mobilität dazu befragt, wie sich die Mobilität in einem autonom geprägten Szenario darstellen und wie sich die einzelnen Verkehrsträger entwickeln könnten. Eine Inhaltsanalyse brachte sechs Kernbereiche hervor: (a) Bedürfnisse; (b) Entwicklung; (c) Vorteile/Nutzen; (d) Anforderungen; (e) Umsetzung/Herausforderungen; (f) Regulatorik. Im Zentrum der Betrachtung standen die Verkehrsträger PKW, Zug/Bahn, Flugzeug/ Drohne sowie Rad/Roller, die vor dem Hintergrund verschiedener Siedlungsgeographien (urban, suburban, rural und magistral) differenziert betrachtet wurden. Insgesamt sprechen die Experten der autonomen Mobilität ein hohes Game-Changer- Potenzial zu, das die Art und Weise der Fortbewegung grundlegend verändern wird. Gleichzeitig kann bilanziert werden, dass der genaue Ablauf des Systemwechsels noch völlig unklar ist und autonome Mobilität – auch im Hinblick auf die ökologische Dimension – nicht der alleinige Heilsbringer sein wird.</jats:p>"

Supplier selection is formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, in which evaluation criteria play a critical role in a realistic assessment of the suppliers. The evaluation criteria can be used to link supplier selection and segmentation steps to have a more efficient and effective supplier relationship management. A multi-stakeholder Best-Worst Method (BWM) is used for supplier selection. The proposed method is a proper tool to handle the optimal weights of the BWM, which are in the form of intervals. The proposed approach enables decision-makers to avoid information loss within their decision-making procedure resulting in more realistic decisions. A real-world case study is used to illustrate the proposed decision-making framework. The final results show the best suppliers based on both capabilities and willingness dimensions which can be selected by the case company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article proposes to consider global supply chain management as a process of management and coordination of the entire business process chain of supply actors, each of which has its priorities and goals in the process of ensuring fast and cost-effective delivery of goods or/and services to consumers, fair distribution of risks, costs and benefits among all participants in the chain. It is formulated that the main idea of the enterprises' transition to a new global level should be to build global logistics and the corresponding global supply chain management. The analysis of scientific sources allowed the author to offer a generalized definition of the supply chain as a linearly ordered system of legal entities and individuals (economic units), which distinguishes suppliers of initial and final levels, manufacturers, distributors of first and final levels, companies involved and performing operations in the process of moving material and related flows from one logistics system to another or the final consumer.\nIt is noted that the main way to prevent negative consequences in the enterprises' activities as those operating in the supply chain is to consider the logistics chain not as a set of individual functional activities, but as global management of the entire supply chain. A prerequisite for effective supply chain management is the integration and coordination of business processes within the enterprise as ways to identify market uncertainty, as well as the presence of external partnerships to share external uncertainties and benefits for a more efficient logistics chain as a whole.\nKeywords: global logistics, supply chain, supply chain management, global supply chain management, market uncertainty, risk.</jats:p>",

Covid-19 virus which infected quite large geographic area and people within very short time affects negatively not only every part of our life but also the production and service sector within the globalised world.  This is mainly because the future tendency and further effects of this virus are unpredictable. Because of that, most countries are focused firstly on measurements to be taken to reduce the spreading speed of the virus. Although measurements and restrictions seem reduced spreading speed in some countries in short term, those measurements increase the operating costs of production and service companies. On the one hand reduction on cargo movements due to low demand and increasing operation cost due to measurements, have effected the supply-demand equilibrium of maritime transportation. This research examined the effects of already taken and could be revised measurements due to the present situation and possible future tendency of covid-19, and its consequential results on the freight market.</jats:p>"

To assess the feasibility of the subject for testing, three processing stages were applied on the subject under review. This was the first step of the original identification of all papers based on the effect of electronic sourcing activities on the efficiency of the supply chain. A second quest covered fully available literature on the issue of e-procurement processes and efficiency of the supply chain. The third stage included the collection of journals that were freely available. The researcher arrived at 12 papers that were relevant for review after an in-depth quest into the top key terms (e-procurement processes, supply chain management, performance).&#x0D;\nFindings: Procurement performance is the backbone of an organization success since it contributes to competitive purchase and acquisition of quality goods that puts the organization products or services in the competitive edge in the market. In the analysis of the use of e-procurement on performance of the procurement functions of county governments in Kenya, the results revealed that e-procurement is positively related with performance of supply chain function of County Governments in Kenya.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study therefore recommended that the Government come up with policies on adoption of e-procurement practices and provide critical resources and leadership in adoption of e-procurement. It is recommended that in order to achieve maximum benefits of reduced order processing time, reduced costs, reduced human errors and improved delivery, management should enhance electronic system and insist on all orders being processed electronically.</jats:p>"

Moreover, immutability, tracking and tracing, and smart contracts are also included in nearly a third of the cases. Moreover, efficiencies and costs through this technology would reduce the costs in payment of intermediaries, reduce paperwork, and help in the shipment of physical documents. Supply chain plays a critical role in the global trade and urgently needs to reassess its models in searching for greater efficiencies. Moreover, better results in visibility across the chain will increase trust for the customers and all interested parties.

The hy-drogen peroxide content was determined spectrophotometrically by the ability to form a stable complex with sorbitol, which is recorded at a wavelength of 540 nm. Catalase activity was determined according to a method based on the ability of H2O2 to form a stable colored complex with ammonium molybdate with a maximum absorption at λ = 410 nm. Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined by the method, the principle of which is based on determining the accumulation of oxidized glutathione at λ = 260 nm. The study was performed on 4 groups of animals: Group I - intact animals (K); II - rats that were on a low-protein diet (LPD); III - rats that were on a high-sucrose diet (HS); IV - rats that received a low-protein / high-sucrose diet (LPD / HS). It was found that in the mitochondria of the kidneys of rats that consumed a low-protein diet, there is a slight increase in hydrogen peroxide against the background of reduced catalase activity and maintaining the level of control of glutathione peroxidase. At the same time, in animals kept on a high-sucrose diet, there is a marked increase in the content of hydrogen peroxide with a simultaneous increase in the activity of both catalase and glutathione peroxidase compared with controls. The maximum accumulation of H2O2 content was found in animals kept on a low-protein / high-sucrose diet, with catalase activity indicators not signifi-cantly different from those of the HS group, while glutathione peroxidase activity is reduced compared to this group. The detected changes in the content of H2O2 and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the mitochondria of the kidneys of rats can be considered as prerequisites for the violation of the functional activity of the kidneys under conditions of nutritional imbalance.</jats:p>"

We also discuss the update of the GTAP-E-Power model database from GTAP 9.0 to GTAP 10.0. The study further analyzes the impact of a change in the power structure on Japan’s macro-economy, the power sector, and industry by comparing the results of four scenarios. In our simulations, which are divided into two periods, shocks are introduced to the growth rate in real GDP, the labor force, the population, and Japanese zero-emission power supply. First, simulations from 2014 to 2018 are performed to update the GTAP-E-Power database. Next, simulations from 2019 to 2030 are performed for policy scenarios with different growth rates of zero-emission power supply in Japan.The simulation results show that with the same growth rate of zero-emission power supply as the Sustainable Development Scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2019, the share of zero-emission power supply in Japan in 2030 will be close to the government’s target. The simulation results show that an increase in zero-emission power supply would have a positive effect on the Japanese economy.</jats:p>"

Managing SC operations has become more difficult as a result of globalization. Supply chains (SCs) are the pathways between suppliers and purchasers. The role of SCs is to safeguard a product from the moment of its creation till it reaches the hands of a customer. Supply chain management (SCM) is a crucial part of companies. It is the main driver of their success and customer loyalty. Marketing is becoming an increasingly important part of the process, balancing procurement by providing critical demand information and cultivating partnerships that help SC operations run more efficiently. These goods must cross international boundaries to enter as many customers as possible. SCs are important for global markets because, without them, suppliers' goods will not be able to reach global markets efficiently.

A multi-graph integrated supply network was designed to meet real-world situations. Minimizing total cost and minimizing delivery time are considered as the objective functions. Since the considered problem is np-hard and the presented mathematical model is very complex and highly constrained, an innovative non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA) called M-NRGA is developed to solve the real word problems. Three different selection procedures were implemented to improve the quality and diversity of solutions in the Pareto-front resulted from M-NRGA. Several numerical examples and a case study are solved to validate the model and performance evaluation of the solution algorithm. Four different performance metrics are implemented for performance evaluation of the solution algorithm. The quality of resulted solutions, the diversity of the solutions in the Pareto front are calculated for evaluation. The results are compared with two other meta-heuristic algorithms.</jats:p>",

In this paper, by sorting out the paths of the epidemic affecting the supply chain of agricultural products and the characteristics of China’s agricultural supply chain, we deeply analyze the sources of risks in China’s agricultural supply chain under the epidemic, and put forward suggestions such as strengthening the collaborative management of the agricultural supply chain, building a response mechanism and prevention mechanism for the quality and safety of agricultural products, constructing a logistics network suitable for the storage and transportation requirements of agricultural products, and accelerating the construction of a big data platform for the agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to present the results, from an empirical evidence, of Six Sigma implementation in Tunisian manufacturing. Therefore, fourteen main factors have been identified through literature review and questionnaire survey. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) has been used to develop a hierarchical structure for analyzing the interactions among the key factors. By using the MICMAC technique, the barriers were classified into four groups according to their driving power and dependence power.

The paper also tries to understand the challenges companies face with respect to the adoption of E-Procurement software solutions. A survey was floated to procurement leaders and with their responses analysis was done. Statistical tools such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), descriptive statistics were used. The twonew factors that got grouped were Downstream Procurement Activities and Upstream Procurement Activities where firms adopt E-Procurement software for the Procure-to-Pay and Source-to-Contract respectively. Reliability test was successfully employed to validate the data set. The descriptive statistics tells us that the Supply Chain Performance had an above average impact by E-Procurement Adoption with a considerable fluctuation. The challenges in adopting E-Procurement were determined to be of moderate extent with cost of these procurement software solutions being a major challenge for uptake. Currently not all firms are using procurement software as one size fit all solution for their procurement management and this paper helps us understand the landscape better by grouping the penetration of electronic procurement into two factors.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Exports and imports are more integrated with the revolutionary e-commerce platforms where people can buy things from other countries at their fingertips. However, the supply chain behind the business transactions beyond the country's boundaries is more complicated than traditional businesses. The successful supply chain performance of e-commerce depends on many local and international aspects. Issues and challenges of the supply chain rapidly change due to the fast development of internet infrastructure. The chapter identifies some key issues like supply chain facility, inventory management, legal obstacles with today's supply chain performance of international e-commerce. Comprehensive solutions and recommendations are given here with focusing the integration of blockchain technology, which tells how the businesses can initiate the combination of both e-commerce and cryptography for effective intercountry supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

Considering that the conflict will affect the operation efficiency and sustainable development of the supply chain, the coordination mechanism of a dual-channel supply chain has been established. In this study, we construct the Stackelberg game model based on consumer utility theory to analyze the complex mechanism of retailers’ innovation input level affecting supply chain operation and design the double coordination mechanism. The results show that: (1) an optimal combination of wholesale prices, retail prices and innovation input levels can optimize the operational efficiency of the supply chain, (2) Noncooperation among channel members affects the retailer’s product pricing, decreases the market share of the physical channel and increases the market demand of manufacturers, (3) The dual coordination mechanism can alleviate channel conflicts, which can improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain. This study provides several insights on the theory of organizational coordination and sustainable development in conflicts of dual-channel supply chains.</jats:p>"

Is this possible with Blockchain technology? While this technology is still evolving, there are still many challenges that remain to be addressed. One of the main challenges in implementing this technology in logistics is to reach agreement on its use among all stakeholders. When interaction between different stakeholders in the supply chain with different interests is achieved, then the full potential of this technology to improve the efficiency of logistics processes will be revealed. This will facilitate the emergence of new business models and processes in global trade logistics and increase transparency in the supply chain. Smart contracts with embedded business rules promise not only to reduce transaction costs but to create more agile value chains that enable closer cooperation.</jats:p>"

Based on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain management, expectancy theory, and diffusion of innovations, a model was developed and validated, considering data from India's supply chain management professionals. The data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that IT deployment capability, compatibility, and trading partner pressure are factors that affect blockchain diffusion significantly. Also, the results bring essential managerial and theoretical implications regarding the blockchain diffusion in the SCM. </jats:p>"

We use the volumetric method to measure the spring discharge 14 times. We compare the base flow and demand over a year to analyze the potential for fresh water. The results show that the Stage discharge rating curve y = 0.0002e5,453x with R² value of 0.87. Duwet Springs is a perennial spring that has a small discharge (class VI). The largest discharge ever recorded was 0.69 L/s (March 7, 2020) and the smallest recorded was 0.12 L/s (August 21, 2020). BFI value varied between 0.05 and 1 with mean 0.801. The total base flow is 2490675.734 L (rainy season) and 1563419.873 L (dry season). These springs are sufficient for 75% of the rainy season and 84% in the dry season.

The purpose is to investigate the impact of contract complexity on supply chain coordination under complete information. The supplier drafts contracts, which include wholesale price contracts and simple quantity discount contracts. These contracts are of different complexity. The retailer chooses one of the supplier-designed contracts to optimize its profit. This study shows that a complex contract with an infinite number of price breaks can achieve the coordination of a general supply chain. It can also arbitrarily distribute supply chain profit under mild conditions. Theoretically, this is the optimal contract. However, it is difficult to implement in practice. Complex contracts with limited price breaks can improve the performance of the decentralized supply chain system compared to simple contracts (i.e. wholesale price contracts), but neither can coordinate the general supply chain. In addition, as the complexity of the contract increases, the performance of the decentralized supply chains continues to decline. This means that the increased in contract complexity does not necessarily increase the efficiency of supply chain contracts. Our study suggest that a three-price contract (all-unit quantity discount contract with two price breaks), although theoretically suboptimal, is sufficient for a general supply chain and should be preferred in practice.</jats:p>"

The analysis of supply and demand takes place at the level of individual local governments and the results are then presented in relation to the size of the municipality and the region. Two approaches were used for the analysis. The first focuses on the description of the current situation through the categorization of local governments according to the approach to the provision of services, and the second consists in regression analysis. The results of the regression analysis suggest that the size of the municipality and the region do not play as important a role in terms of access to the provision of the examined services as indicated by the first, descriptive analysis. To find a \"pattern\" for local authorities to decide on access to services for the elderly, further research will be needed that takes into account several socio-economic indicators.</p>"

Yet, several studies that examined the maritime supply chain have not adequately explored nor assessed the relationship constructs that impacts maritime supply chain performance. This study intends to fill this gap and ascertain the influence that certain relationship elements have on the maritime supply chain performance. The study is solely a desk research. After providing a general overview of maritime supply chain and its structure, relationship marketing paradigm and relationship constructs, this study examines the influence that the identified relationship constructs (i.e. trust, commitment and satisfaction) has on supply chain performance. The study asserts that the present of the identified relationship constructs (i.e. trust, commitment and satisfaction) among supply chain partners will influence supply chain performance positively. Hence, building a successful long-term relationship among maritime supply chain partners requires an understanding of these key relationship constructs.</jats:p>"

This paper studies the influence of retailers’ choice of trade credit or bank loan financing strategy on a GSC’s performance and analyzes their decision-making tendency. The results show that manufacturers should provide trade credit and participate in retailers’ financing decisions to avoid double marginal effects under both centralized and decentralized decision-making. Interestingly, the optimal value of green marketing effort and retailer order quantity was twice as high as the decentralized under the centralized decision, indicating that the centralized decision could better improve GSC’s financing efficiency. Especially when the trade credit financing strategy is feasible, this effect is more significant. Finally, the outcomes are verified through numerical simulation, which references GSC practitioners in management decisions.</jats:p>"

However, planning of the prefabricated component supply chain (PCSC) under disruptions has seldom been studied. This paper studies the construction schedule-dependent resilience for the PCSC plan by considering transportation costs and proposes a multi-objective optimization model. First, the PCSC planning problem regarding schedule-dependent resilience and resultant transportation cost is analyzed. Second, a quantification scheme of the schedule-dependent resilience of the PCSC plan is proposed. Third, formulation of the resilience-cost tradeoff optimization model for the PCSC planning is developed. Fourth, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)-based method for solving the resilience-cost tradeoff model is presented. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate and justify the developed method. This study contributes to the knowledge and methodologies for PCSC management by addressing resilience at the planning stage.</jats:p>",

One of the main solutions for increasing the available capacity is the predetermined plan for constructing a water circulation system to restore the existing water resources. For this objective, a combination model was conducted based on a stormwater management technique and environment landscape system (ELS) under drought conditions. A hydrological framework was established using the long-term meteorological information in central China to estimate the extreme values of surface water in each stress period. A data analysis system was generated at three meteorological points of the study area and the developed model was incorporated to simulate the behavior of the subsurface flow. Consequently, a growth simulation model was designed according to the soil structure and vegetation canopy cover to formulate a real-time plan for the restoration of ELS. Results showed that the proposed model could improve the water productivity in urban and environment consumptions. Furthermore, technical analysis confirmed the suitability and applicability of the developed plan in cities with water shortages.</jats:p>",

The study used a theoretical structural model to investigate the causal impact of interactional justice on informational quality and sustainable SCM. The results indicated that interpersonal justice showed a significant positive relationship with informational justice. Further, interpersonal justice and informational justice had a significant positive effect on informational quality in Korean pharmaceutical companies but not in multinationals. Finally, informational quality had a positive effect on sustainable SCM performance regardless of the company’s nationality. This study is important because it identified the influence of interactional justice on informational quality and sustainable SCM by comparing Korean with multinational pharmaceutical companies.

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test showed that the time series were integrated of order one and the Johansen´s co-integration confirmed the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Moreover, the short and long run coefficients for own-price and yield were statistically significant and presented the expected signs, however, estimated own-price elasticity was below unit suggesting it is not an important factor in peach supply response. Furthermore, the vector error correction coefficient (-0.32) was negative and in line with theory, which showed that in the long-run, the model converges towards equilibrium, however at a relatively slow pace. Therefore, it can be concluded that, overall, the proposed model contributes to the understanding of the dynamics in peach output supply.</jats:p>"

Nanotechnology translates into the ability to manipulate the material on a nanoscale. As in other sectors, recent developments in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology offer new opportunities for innovation for food. Nanofoods are considered foods grown, produced, processed or packaged using nanotechnological tools that incorporate nanomaterials to improve nutritional quality, taste or texture, and increase the shelf life of food. Nanotechnology’s applications are diverse, going from nanoencapsulated ingredients, such as bioactive compounds, nutrients and food additives that increase the bioavailability of the compounds, to ingredients that constitute nanostructures and nanotextures that provide barriers for physical-chemical protection, which allow modification of flavour and odour. Also, has the potential to be used as biosensors to monitor food conditions during storage and transport, through packaging that includes indicators. This review covers the development and use of nanotechnology along the food supply chain, focusing the agricultural production, industrial processing and protection through packaging, as well as addressing the advantages and disadvantages of using this technology.</jats:p>",

In the past few years, severe environmental and hydrological stress have caused the loss of a large part of its area and its bed has become the largest focal point of haze in the southwestern of Iran. Determining delineation is one of the most important and necessary measures to protect a wetland's ecosystem and, in this study, delineation was determined using the USACE-R-G method. This method is a combination of ecological and hydrological criteria with a Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System. The results showed that under the first scenario the marsh is about 3,279 km2 which about 882 square kilometers constitute free-water surface and its average depth is 2.4 meters. In the second scenario, these numbers were estimated to be 1,619 km2 with an average depth of 2.7 meters. Moreover, the area of the haze focus is about 1,659 km2. As well as this, under these conditions the amount of water required to submerge the marsh is 7.9 in the first scenario and 4.4 billion cubic meters in the second one.</jats:p>",

This paper considers the consignment stock (CS) policy for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To achieve the economic goal, this study presents a multi-echelon supply chain with a single manufacturer, a single retailer and a third-party service provider. The objective is to optimize this three-level CLSC under a Stackelberg game scenario. The other objective is to identify the environmental impact of remanufacturing EOL products. In this CLSC, the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader and the retailer, the third party are the followers. Under manufacturer’s leadership, the retailer and the third party acquire three different decision strategies – I, II, and III. In decision strategy I, the retailer acts as the leader and the third party acts as a follower, whereas in decision strategy II, they obtain a Nash game strategy. In the decision strategy III, they act as one unit and decide their decisions centrally. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are used to illustrate optimal results of different decision strategies and also check the behaviour of key model-parameters. The best outcomes are found in decision strategy I. The main findings of our study show that when upper level player has more power then the supply chain gives best outcomes.</jats:p>"

This paper applies the method of dynamic programming to derive the structures of optimal policies and provides an approximate algorithm to evaluate the myopic policies. This paper also conducts numerical examples to illustrate the impacts of put option contract, supply chain structure and demand risk on the members’ decisions and total profits as well as the channel’s total profit. The results indicate that put option contract can motivate to increase the channel’s service level and reduce the manufacturer’s inventory risk under two supply chain structures, when compared to the case without put option contract. In the manufacturer-led structure, the channel always benefits from put option contract, the supplier benefits from put option contract with a high option price and a low exercise price, while the manufacturer benefits from put option contract with a low option price and a high exercise price. In the supplier-led structure, the channel and the manufacturer always benefit from put option contract, while the supplier benefits from put option contract with a high option price and a low exercise price. With put option contract, the supplier is more profitable in the manufacturer-led structure than in the supplier-led structure, while the manufacturer and the channel are more profitable in the supplier-led structure than in the manufacturer-led structure. Without and with put option contract, the optimal total profits of two members and the channel will first decrease and then increase in the demand risk.

Selection of the optimal method is an integral part of the project, in the framework of which this article is written. Earlier all possible methods and their advantages and disadvantages were evaluated. Within the framework of this article, t optimal method for the development of reserves on the Arctic shelf will be proposed, taking into account the possibilities of development and the effectiveness of subsequent transportation to the importing countries. The risks of gas hydrates were considered. The prospects of development of the Northern Sea Route between Russia and Asian countries are assessed; the cost of transportation of liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from the Barents Sea to Central Europe is compared. The hydraulic calculation of the selected section of the gas pipeline network is conducted. The economic calculation of the project as a whole is accomplished. The optimal location of the route in relation to the reserves in the Barents Sea has been chosen. Pressure losses in the selected zone were no more than 12.24 MPa with pipeline pressure from 8 to 16 MPa. In this case, condensation and subsequent formation of gas hydrates are not possible. Using only three sections of the network, the profit of the project will be 223 billion rubles per year. In accordance with this the best way of hydrocarbons realization in the Arctic is a combined method of transportation with modern methods of extraction and pipelaying laying.</jats:p>"

The study employed the quantitative research methodology. The statistical devices used included frequency, percentage and Structure Equation Modeling (SEM). The population and sample group comprised executives of the electronics industry in the electronics and electrical appliances sector in Thailand. The results revealed that the factors regarding the information technology system, leadership support and knowledge management had positive effects on the success of the knowledge management through electronics industry supply chains with the statistical significance (β) of 0.519, 0.621 and 0.448, respectively. However, the factors regarding human resource management affected the success of the knowledge management negatively at the statistical significance of 0.323. As for the effects of variables on the success of the knowledge management, it was found that the factors with the most positive indirect effects (IE) and total effects (TE) were those regarding 1) leadership support (IE = 0.278, TE = 0.278), 2) information technology system (IE = 0.233, TE = 0.233), and 3) knowledge management, which had a positive direct effect (DE) at 0.448 and a total effect (TE) at 0.448. However, the factors regarding human resource management had a negative indirect effect (IE) on the success of the knowledge management at -0.145.</jats:p>"

Port supply chain management is no exception to encompass these dimensions. Port sustainable supply chain management can be associated with implementing the United Nations’ (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). Little effort has been made to shed light on this association. Therefore, an attempt is made in this study to build a framework that comprises measures for the port sustainable supply chain management. The measures are examined by the utilization of the “dashboard of 5 Ps” (Peace, People, Planet, Partnership, Prosperity), thus to identify how the framework measures can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Results show that ports have the potential to influence all the SDGs, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, the framework can be viewed as a conceptual tool that is very appropriate for ports that aim to integrate economic and social aspects along with environmental concerns and push forward the implementation of the UN 2030 agenda internally and externally while collaborating with supply chains.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we examine whether it can coordinate green supply chains in the set up of overconfidence. We assume that the manufacturer is overconfident and the retailer is rational. The manufacturer overestimates consumers’ sensitivity to product greenness and accurately estimates the uncertainty of demand. The overconfident manufacturer and the rational retailer cooperate through cost sharing contracts. Then, we construct a game theoretical model to analyze the impact of manufacturers’ overconfident on product greenness, pricing, profit and supply chain cooperation. At last, a numerical experimentation is presented. We find that, (1) the product greenness, wholesale price and retail price increase with the manufacturer’s overconfidence as well as the retailer’s cost sharing proportion. (2) no matter how much the cost sharing proportion is, the profit of manufacturers and retailers decreases with the manufacturer’s overconfidence level. (3) cost sharing contracts can achieve the green supply chain coordination in rational setting. But under manufacturers’ overconfidence, it cannot.</jats:p>"

With that goal, in monthly, three-month, and 12-month time periods drought indices were calculated. Spatio-temporal distributions of the droughts were determined with each drought index for the years in which the most severe droughts were experienced. According to the results, the basin is under risk of meteorological drought due to the occurrence of severe and extreme droughts in most of the area, and especially in the north, during the monthly and three-month time periods. During the 12-month period, it was found that most of the basin is under risk of hydrological drought due to the occurrence of severe and extreme droughts, especially in the southern parts. The most effective interpolation method for the prediction of meteorological and hydrological droughts was determined as kriging according to the results of the cross-validation test. It was concluded that a drought management plan should be made, and early warnings and precautions should be applied in the study area.</jats:p>",

Paradoxically, the region still suffers problems of water shortage. This is due to the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall that greatly affects water supply through its impacts on surface and groundwater. For this reason, we came up with the research topic<jats:bold>“Rainfall variability and quantity of water supply in Bamenda 1, Northwest Region of Cameroon.”</jats:bold>The objective of this study is to examine the manifestations of rainfall variability, and how it affects quantity of water supply in the humid tropics. Rainfall data use for this study comprised of annual, monthly, and daily rainfall over a period of 55 years. Water supply data was made of monthly and annual supply. With these data, a Pearson’s correlation was computed, and it gave a value of 0.701, with a rainfall proportion of 49.14% and 50.86% for other factors. The seasonality and the Standardized Precipitation Index were equally analyzed. At the end of the study, results showed that rainfall events in Bamenda I fluctuates with time and in space. It equally presented a reduction in the number of rainy days from 204 days in 1663 to 155 in 2018. This led to a reduction in length of rainy season and in rainfall amounts. In addition, the area has witnessed sedimentation of riverbeds and water reservoirs due to erosion and deposition during high rainfall peaks. Equally, floods observed during high rainfall episodes have become a potential threat to water infrastructures imposing exceptional water shortages during the rainy seasons. Due to these, actors in the water supply sector are putting in measures to remedy the situation.</jats:p>"

The portable DC supply offers a very high voltage gain: input voltage is 24 V, while the generator requires supply voltages up to 50 kV. Thus, the system contains two stages designed on the basis of SiC power devices operating with frequencies up to 100 kHz. At first, the input voltage is boosted up to 400 V by a non-isolated double-boost converter, and then a resonant DC-DC converter with a special transformer elevates the voltage to the required level. In the paper, the main components of the laboratory setup are presented, and experimental results of the DC supply and whole system are also shown.</jats:p>"

A multidisciplinary approach was used to evaluate the coagulation process to better remove the taste and odour (T&amp;O) causing organics from water supplied to the local towns. Such high levels of NOM require elevated doses of coagulant for removal, accounting for approximately 60% of the chemical costs. A need arose to reduce these operational costs. However, community expectations regarding T&amp;O, and social and environmental impacts, are not typically considered in this process. The local water corporation, Goulburn Valley Water, undertook a case study involving a comparison of three coagulants to optimise the chemical coagulation process from a multidisciplinary (triple bottom line, TBL) perspective. The financial assessment incorporated operational costs and potential infrastructure requirements. The social assessment investigated the overall impacts on staff operating the water treatment plant and their broader community involvement. The environmental assessment focused on the impact on downstream infrastructure from changes in sludge volumes and wastewater quality, and third-party greenhouse gas emissions from chemical deliveries. From a TBL viewpoint, aluminium chlorohydrate was the most beneficial option.</jats:p>",

This system, with an appropriately sized energy storage capacity, allows improvement in the continuity of the power supply and increases the reliability of the separated network at a specified time during the limitation of power transmission as a result of damage or disconnection of the main power line. This paper presents and describes a specific method of energy storage system dimensioning based on real measurement data. Based on the obtained parameters, an analysis of the reliability improvement of the considered network was performed. The implementation of the battery energy storage system will contribute to a more than 5-fold reduction in the occurrence of power outages in the time interval from 3 min to 1.5 h, which will clearly reduce the System Average Interruption Frequency Index and System Average Interruption Duration Index factors. In this paper, the network conditions for operational normality and failure are presented and the cost for implementation of an energy storage system (about EUR 1 million) is compared with the possible implementation of an additional power line (about EUR 5 million) to a specific power substation.</jats:p>"

Design/methodology/approach - The data for this study were collected through a questionnaire-based survey during two different time periods in Korea, 2006 and 2018. Findings - This study reveals that supply chain professionals in 2006 regarded trust building process as the most important construct for the successful supply chain operations while in the 2018 survey, trust-based commitment became the most important construct. This paper concludes that supply chain sustainability will be enhanced based on strong supply chain relationship framework. Originality/value - This study reaffirmed that a supply chain relationship built on a trust-based commitment is still the pathway to successful supply chain implementation. As far as we know, no studies have been published in examining supply chain relationships during the digital transformation in two time periods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

A critical component of that care relies on a functional supply chain to ensure availability of abortion drugs and supplies within the health system. Disruptions in the supply of medical abortion drugs delay provision of abortion services and can increase the risks to a woman’s health. We examine the ways in which supply chain management (SCM) affects women’s ability to access safe and timely abortion to meet their reproductive health needs and highlight the gap in evaluation research on which SCM interventions best improve access to safe abortion care.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p>SCM comprises a critical component of efficient and sustainable abortion service provision and is a requisite for expansion of services. Furthermore, governments are responsible for safeguarding links in the abortion supply chain, from registration to distribution of abortion drugs and supplies. Strategic public–private partnerships and use of innovative local or community-based distribution mechanisms can strengthen supply chain systems. Finally, alternatives to the pull-based models of distribution could alleviate bottlenecks in the final steps of abortion supply chains. Programs aimed at increasing access to safe and comprehensive abortion care must include SCM as a foundational component of service provision. Without access to a sustainable and affordable supply of abortion drugs and equipment, any attempt at providing abortion services will be critically limited. More implementation research is needed to identify the most effective interventions for improving SCM.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

In this paper, we study the cross-border spillovers of physical climate risks through international trade and supply chain linkages. As we base our findings on historical data between 1970 and 2018, we observe that globalization increased the similarity of countries’ global climate risk exposures. Exposures to foreign climatic disasters in major trade partner countries (both upstream and downstream) lower the home-country stock market valuation for the aggregate market and for the tradable sectors. We also find that exposures to foreign long-term climate change risks reduce the asset price valuations of the tradable sectors at home. Findings in this paper suggest that climate adaptation efforts in a country can have positive externalities on other countries’ macrofinancial performance and stability through international trade.</jats:p>",

Raspberry production in the Republic of Serbia has significant comparative advantages compared to production in most other countries. Serbia is considered one of the largest producers of raspberries, but still, regardless of that, its comparative advantages have not been fully valorized and used. The results of the balance analysis of raspberry production and consumption indicate the existence of a surplus and potential for export. The analysis of ANOVA variances established a high correlation dependence and pointed out the need to improve competitiveness in the production of raspberries and final products in order to meet the domestic market and exports to the world market.

Taking into consideration the indicator of power supply in agriculture in the world’s economically developed countries, the authors consider the domestic needs in agricultural tractors and engines. As a result of the analysis, it is shown that the fl eet of agricultural tractors is at a low level of about 200 thousand units, and it requires further serious development. To ensure eff ective agricultural production, it is necessary to balance the level of farm tractor availability in Russia with that of economically advanced countries. The indicator of 4 kW/ha was taken as a promising level of tractor availability, and the required number of tractors was determined. The analysis was carried out for the cultivation of arable land in Russia with an area of 80 million hectares as of 2020 and amounted to about 2.5 million units for the entire range of agricultural tractors taking into account their traction class. To cultivate all arable areas in Russia, which amounted to about 120 million hectares in 1990, a third more equipment will be required. To maintain the tractor fl eet at this level, it is necessary to ensure an annual supply of at least 250 thousand units of various engines with a total capacity of at least 320 GW. This problem can be solved through increasing the production capacity of existing engine-building plants and designing new diesel engines for tractors of traction classes 0.6…1.4 with a capacity between 20 and 70 kW.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The occurrence of dry periods on the Wupper catchment has increased in the last decades in conjunction with the shifting of the precipitation regime. In the frame of the Horizon 2020 project BINGO (Bringing INnovation to onGOing water management), the effects of climate change scenarios on the water cycle in the Wupper catchment area were investigated. To quantify these effects, a set of hydrological models (NASIM and SWAT) has been set-up, calibrated, and validated for the upper part of the Dhünn River catchment area – Wupper River's main tributary. This sub-catchment corresponds to one of the inflows to the Große Dhünn Reservoir (GDR), the second largest drinking water reservoir in Germany. Both models were driven with climate data from decadal predictions, which have been selected instead of IPCC-RCP scenarios, as they provide a more realistic assumption of climate variability for the next 10 years. Ten decadal members based on the MiKlip (Mittelfristige Klimaprognose – medium-term climate prediction) framework have been prepared for the time span of 2015 to 2024. Additionally, a simulation with TALSIM-NG (a reservoir-oriented hydrological model) was carried out to obtain future reservoir storage. Special focus was given to identify observed trends and compare them to future trends. Past hydro-meteorological extreme dry periods were evaluated based on observed data. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) were estimated for different seasons to determine if they were abnormally dry or wet. SPI, SPEI, and SRI were also calculated with decadal predictions to evaluate future extreme dry periods. Uncertainties in climate data predictions are one of the greatest challenges. Observed and forecast time series were compared by means of statistical tests in order to assess uncertainties in climate data predictions. Also, the application of two hydrological models aims to determine potential uncertainties, so that predictions are more reliable. Results indicate that SRI might be more appropriate to estimate drought periods for the study area in the frame of reservoir management – where inflow rates are of crucial importance – as this index quantifies losses in runoff formation processes. In terms of inflow rates to GDR, future changes indicate a reduction in runoff for the spring season, while an increment during winter. On the other hand, a clear change in pattern for fall and summer seasons remains uncertain. Simulations of GDR reservoir volume with different climate scenarios show that water stress by the end of 2024 is not unlikely, so sustainable adaptation measures should be further considered. Effectively managing the GDR will become consequently more complex.\n                        </jats:p>"

The first hypothesis suggests that it is common to generate more than enough rainfall to account for the volume of water in the debris flow, but to actually produce a debris flow, the water must be delivered with sufficient intensity. This is demonstrated by data from 44 debris flows from eight burned areas in California, Colorado, and Utah. Assuming a debris flow comprises 30 percent water and 70 percent solids, these events were generated during rainstorms that produced an average of 17 times as much water as necessary to develop a debris flow. Even accounting for infiltration, the rainstorms still generated an overabundance of water. Intensity dependence is also shown by numerous cases in which the exact timing of debris flows can be pinpointed and is contemporaneous with high-intensity bursts of rainfall. The hypothesis is also supported by rainfall intensity-duration thresholds where high-volume storms without high-intensity bursts do not generate debris flows. The second hypothesis of sediment-supply independence for the initiation of debris flows is supported by a significant increase in flow volume occurring directly after wildfire, compared to flows in unburned terrain. Also, repeated flows within short time intervals are only possible with an abundance of channel sediment, dry ravel, and bank failure material that can be mobilized. Field observations confirm these sediment sources, even directly after a debris-flow.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the article is to clarification of approaches to the improvement of logistics and marketing support of managing the oil and fat export supply chain.\n\nMethodology of research. Theoretical and methodological basis of the study has been formed by the scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists in the field of logistics and marketing (to identify scientific approaches to marketing and logistics management of export supply chain management), methods of critical, systematic and comparative analysis (to analyze the features of marketing and logistics management of export oil and fat supply chain), methods of graphical analysis (to clearly display the research results), as well as the abstract and logical method (for the logical generalization of theoretical principles and formulation of research conclusions).\n\nFindings. It has been formed that the global situation in the oil and fat market, consumer preferences and tastes in the world are changing dynamically and pose new challenges to companies that can be addressed by gaining more sustainable competitive advantages than those already gained due to the marketing- and logistics-oriented approaches to business activity. It is determined that logistics and marketing are defined as the main orientations of management in a company and interpreted in the real sense as significant spheres of functional and integrated processes in company, and in a modern company marketing must be logistic, logistics must be a marketing one.\n\nIt is established that a key position in the export supply chain of oil and fat products is occupied by the consumer. It is proved that one of the possible directions of effective consideration of market challenges is the logistization of the marketing activity of oil and fat enterprises and the use of integrated marketing logistics.\n\nIt is substantiated that formation of sustainable competitive advantages of oil and fat companies in the global supply chains is possible due to the development of marketing-mix that will include marketing and logistics components.\n\nOriginality. Theoretical and methodological principles have been deepened and of scientific and applied recommendations for improving the logistics and marketing support of export supply chain management have been developed. In particular, a logistics scheme for the export chain of oil and fat supply has been developed, which, in contrast to the existing ones, involves the use of river transport, which will reduce logistics costs, improve logistics services and increase customer satisfaction.\n\nPractical value. The results of the study can be implemented in the practice of managing export supply chains of domestic enterprises, which will increase the efficiency of export activities by reducing logistics costs, improving the level of logistics services and increasing the degree of customer satisfaction.\nKey words: logistics support, marketing support, export, supply chain, oil and fat.</jats:p>"

There is a wide variation in the female work participation rate in the state. It is higher in agro-based, poor and most backward districts and is low in urbanized and industrialized districts as well as in districts with higher levels of per capita income, female literacy and unemployment. The analysis here shows that structural changes in the economy have not resulted in any dramatic change in the quality and quantity of women’s employment. Further, the casual labour segment has been expanding in rural Tamil Nadu with reductions in self-employment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is known that the total power electrical loads consume from the mains is the sum of their two components – active and reactive. Most electric drives of modern industrial enterprises consume up to 40% of reactive energy in relation to the total energy. This results in an increased full power consumption thereby increasing the load on the supply mains. Modern electric drives are built as follows: supply mains – rectifier-direct current link-inverter – asynchronous motor. The total power consumption is at the \"mains-rectifier\" interface, where the required active power factor of the converter can be formed. The higher the active power factor, the lower the reactive component in the total consumed energy. Thus, the paper proposes a solution to the problem of building highly efficient converting devices for powering electric motors with the required power factor. In particular, the paper discusses possible increase in the power factor of the electric drive mains input with two-link frequency converters based on active (controlled) rectifiers with current and voltage inverters. The author proposes new ways to control active rectifiers based on the use of AC rectifying devices with fully controlled GTO, GCT thyristors, as well as pulse-width control IGBT transistors. The paper offers options for the construction of these rectifiers and the results of modeling the proposed control methods, confirming a decrease in the passive components of the mains current, and, as a consequence, an increase in the mains input power factor. The simulation results were obtained in MathLab 10, and are the basis for confirming the method of increasing the active power factor at the mains input of a controlled two-link frequency converter.</jats:p>"

This article employed the qualitative research approach grounded on documents/textual content analysis of literature extracted from databases of Scopus, Science Direct, and LISTA. Findings revealed that academic libraries should utilize interlending and document supply to fulfill growing and diverse demands for information. The ability to fulfill information needs requires diverse knowledge and the skills of librarians, information resources, and infrastructure to strengthen interlending and document supply. The study recommends the adaptation of grey literature as part of the collection development, cooperation with library associations and securing funding for academic libraries in Nigeria as the way forward. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, aimed to target low-noise and fast digital outputs, are fundamentally based on column-parallel structures, jointly designed with oversampling column converters. The typical choice for the employed column converters is the incremental sigma-delta structures, which intrinsically perform the correlated multiple sampling, creating an averaging effect over the system thermal noise when used in conjunction with 4T-pinned pixels. However, these types of column converters are known to be power-hungry, especially if the imaging device needs to target high frame rate levels as well. In this sense, the aim of this paper was to address the excess of power dissipation problem that arises from image sensors while employing oversampling high-order incremental converters, by means of using a different connection scheme to supply and to drive the required reference signals across the image sensor on-chip column converters. The proposed connection scheme revealed to be fully functional with no unwanted artifacts in the imager output response, allowing it to avoid 20% to 50% of the power dissipation, relative to the classical on-chip references generation and driving method. Furthermore, this solution allows for a much less complicated and less crowded printed circuit board (PCB) system.</jats:p>"

The article analyzes the impact on the stability of the supply chain of two types of influences: failure and disruption. The low stability of the supply chain appears in the stoppage of work in case of any disruptions and failures. With moderate stability, disruptions do not give up a significant impact on the operation of the supply chain, and failures lead to an increase in operating costs to maintain the stability of work processes. With a high level of stability, failures can cause disruptions in the operations of individual links. In case of disruptions, response models are applied based on the control of process parameters, the subsequent analysis of the causes of disruptions and the development of measures to restore the normal operation of the links in the supply chain. Effective disruption response involves the use of proactive response models. For this, it is necessary to ensure flexibility and transparency of processes in all links of the supply chain based on digital services for material flow control and mining of big data.</jats:p>"

This chapter proposes a five-stage capability maturity model for the implementation and maintenance of supply chain management processes in farm management information systems. The capability maturity model is a valuable aid to determine the digitized supply chain process' ability to consistently and continuously achieve improvement and organizational objectives.

The surface runoff rate was first estimated in the Han River basin located in South Korea using the calibrated and validated HSPF model. Then a linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the computed surface runoff rate and the observed water quality. It was found that there were statistically significant relationships between the surface runoff rate and concentrations of BOD, COD, and T-P and higher surface runoff rate led to the deterioration of water quality in streams. Finally, the applicability of the surface runoff rate as an indicator to measure the impact of land development on stream water quality was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the surface runoff rate could be utilized as a useful indicator to illustrate the degradation of stream water quality at the watershed scale. The results from this study also suggest that the surface runoff rate needs to be managed and controlled within about 15% to prevent the degradation of stream water quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: The supply chain performance evaluation is a critical activity to continuously improve operations. Literature presents several performance evaluation systems based on multi-criteria methods and artificial intelligence. Among them, the systems based on artificial neural networks (ANN) excel due to their capacity of modeling non-linear relationships between metrics and allowing adaptations to a specific environment by means of historical performance data. These systems’ accuracy depend directly on the adopted training algorithm, and no studies have been found that assess the efficiency of these algorithms when applied to supply chain performance evaluation. In this context, the present study evaluates four ANNs learning methods in order to investigate which one is the most adequate to deal with supply chain evaluation. The algorithms tested were Gradient Descendent Momentum, Levenberg-Marquardt, Quasi-Newton and Scale Conjugate Gradient. The performance metrics were extracted from SCOR®, which is a reference model used worldwide. The random sub-sampling cross-validation method was adopted to find the most adequate topological configuration for each model. A set of 80 topologies was implemented using MATLAB®. The prediction accuracy evaluation was based on the mean square error. For the four level 1 metrics considered, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided the most precise results. The results of correlation analysis and hypothesis tests reinforce the accuracy of the proposed models. Furthermore, the proposed computational models reached a prediction accuracy higher than previous approaches.</jats:p>"

Despite cultivation-based methods routinelyemployed in monitoring drinking water quality, cultivation of specific indicator organisms alone is not always guarantee for assuring safe drinking water delivery. The presence of complex microbiomes in drinking water distribution systems affects treatment effectiveness leading to poor quality water which as a result affects health of human and animals. Drinking water treatment and distribution systems harbor various microbiota despite efforts made in improving water infrastructures and several waterborne diseases become serious problems in the water industry, specially, in developing Countries. Intermittent water supply, long-time of water storage, low water pressure in distribution systems, storage tankers and pipes as well as contaminated source water are among many of the factors responsible for low drinking water quality which in turn affecting health of people. The aim of this study was to explore microbial diversity and structure in water samples collected from source water, treated water, reservoirs, and several household points of use locations (taps). High throughput Illumina sequencing technology was employed by targeting V4 region of 16S rRNA following Illumina protocol to analyze the community structure of bacteria. ResultsThe core dominating taxa were Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Gamma proteobacteria were dominant among other Proteobacterial classes across all sampling points. Opportunistic bacterial genera such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Actinobacteria, as well as eukaryotic microbes like Cryptosporidium, Hartmanella, Acanthamoeba, Aspergillus, and Candida were also the abundant taxa found alongthe distribution systems. The shift in microbial community structure from source to point of uselocations were influenced by factors such as residual free chlorine, intermittent water supply andlong-time storage at the household. The shift in microbial community structure from source to point of use locations were influenced by factors such as residual free chlorine, intermittent water supply and long-time storage at the household.ConclusionsThe complex microbiota which was present in different sample sites receiving treated water from the two treatment plants (Legedadi and Gefersa) starting from source water to household point of consumption across the distribution systems in Addis Ababa brings drinking water quality problem which further causes significant health problems to both human and animal health. Treatment ineffectiveness, disinfection inefficiency, poor maintenance actions, leakage of sewage and other domestic wastes are few among many other factors responsible for degraded drinking water quality in this study putting health at high risk which, this, leads to morbidity and mortality. Findings of this research provide important and bassline information to understand the microbial profiles of drinking water along source water and distribution systems.</jats:p>"

As a specific case of analysis, the horticultural supply chain, originating in Spain and ending with the European consumer, was analyzed, taking as a reference the marketing companies at origin (mainly social economy companies, that is, cooperatives). In addition, a survey of marketing companies is conducted to possibly determine which explicit cooperative growth strategies may include horizontal and vertical collaboration relationships with other members of the chain. The aim was to analyze with whom the horticultural commercialization company collaborates within the supply chain and the key points of such a collaboration. A model analyzing the influence of collaboration on company performance was also considered. The results reveal that, in recent years, aspects related to quality and health have been surpassed and replaced by the concept of sustainability within a framework of collaboration with customers. Additionally, upstream collaboration has been found to be, in most cases, more profitable than collaboration with customers. In any case, it became evident that there is a need to expand collaboration within the chain by incorporating the supplier of the supplier, with the aim of making the chain more profitable.</jats:p>"

The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) defines the Supply Chain Finance (SCF) of the business organization and is affected by the size determinants of the firms. The components of the WC are considered to measure the CCC and define the status of the SCF of the business organization. The study is based on the secondary data obtained from the financial statements of the selected leading Indian pharmaceutical companies. The objective of the study is to find out the relation and degree of governance of size determinants on the SCF. The analysis is based on the ranks of size determinants and relative ranks of inventory days, accounts receivables days, and accounts payables days. The Spearman rank correlation is applied to get the qualitative relationship between the ranks of size determinants and ranks of components of CCC. The study reveals that size determinants affect the SCF positively but moderately while WC governs directly as WC comprises the components of CCC. The study suggests the shortening of the CCC by focusing on size determinants on WC and especially accounts payables in Indian pharmaceutical companies.</jats:p>"

The application of this new method of financing to the decision-making algorithm of a developer requires mathematical modeling of the economic ratios of the main indicators of the developer’s activities, taking into account the interests of other subjects in the housing construction sector: banks and population. The approach proposed by the authors is aimed primarily at expanding the supply in the housing market. We have formalized the possible sale strategies of the developer using a matrix approach in varying prices and the number of meters sold at different stages of construction, as well as interest rates for bank crediting, depending on the degree of escrow accounts accumulation. Testing the model has shown that developers should face serious problems related to increasing the cost of replenishing working capital for the construction process, which will inevitably be included in the price per square meter of housing and paid by the consumer (population). At the same time, banks become the main controllers and beneficiaries of the project financing. The model developed and tested by the authors will allow construction organizations to overcome the first difficulties of project financing application and competently and consistently make a choice of a strategy for offering housing to buyers, taking into account the variability of the economic parameters of all parties.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a research carried out during the SMARTCHAIN project (Horizon project within the research line “Innovative agro-food chains: unlocking the potential for competitiveness and sustainability”). The research aims at iden-tifying an assessment model for grasping the level of social innovation in Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC) taking into consideration the social and sustainability indicators. A specific tool, the Social Innovation Assess-ment Template (SIAT) was created for this purpose. The SIAT investigates five dimensions of SFSC: economic, environmental, socio-cultural, governance and influence (positive impact on other sectors &amp; stakeholders) dimensions. The assessment has been tested in 9 European countries and 16th case studies. The findings show both managerial implications for the SFSC and policy implications for strengthening the SFSC ecosystem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The chapter is focused on modelling of performance of adsorptive heat storage devices and estimation of performance of heat storage devices. Two groups of models of adsorptive heat storage units suggested previous researchers are analyzed. The first one is focused on predicting the heat energy storage density, it being based on Dubinin-Polanyi theory. The second one is devoted to analyzing the kinetic of adsorption processes and performance of the adsorber or adsorptive-desorptive reactor filled with traditional adsorbent or salt which forms crystalline hydrates. The key drawback of both groups of models concerns with considering only one stage of exploitation of adsorptive heat storage device in spite of its operating in two-stage mode, that is, alternating discharge (adsorption) and charge (regeneration). It inhibits estimation of efficiency of adsorptive heat storage device basing on full operating cycle and its involving in heat supply system. Two algorithms for estimation of operating parameters are proposed by authors for closed-type and open-type heat storage devices. The algorithm for calculation of operating parameters of closed type adsorptive heat storage device is proposed: calculation of the mass transfer coefficient, adsorption, useful heat, that is, heat of adsorption, determination of the heat input, it being calculated as heat inputs for heating the adsorbent, device housing, water in the tank, evaporation of water in the tank, heating of the adsorbed water and desorption. Then efficiency factor is calculated. The operating characteristics of a closed-type heat energy storage device were studied when the composite adsorbent ‘silica gel – sodium sulphate' used. The effect of the humid airflow velocity on the efficiency factor is taken into account by introducing a coefficient equal to the value of the adsorption. An increase in the efficiency coefficient was stated when the velocity and relative humidity of the airflow. It is shown that the humid air flow temperature practically does not affect its value. Having been used the suggested algorithm, the optimal operating characteristics of an adsorptive heat storage device of a closed type based on a composite adsorbent ‘silica gel – sodium sulphate' for a private house heating system are revealed to be humid air velocities of 0.6 – 0.8 m/s and relative humidity 40 – 60%. When these operational data applied, the efficiency coefficient is shown to reach the maximum values (about 55%). Algorithm of calculation of operating parameter of open-type heat storage device includes computation of mass transfer coefficient, adsorption, useful heat (heat of adsorption), heat input for heating the adsorbent, device casing, water in the humidifier, evaporation of water, heating the adsorbed water, desorption, and calculating efficiency coefficient. Performance of open-type heat storage device based on the composite adsorbent ‘silica gel – sodium sulphate' is estimated. The optimal operating conditions of the heat accumulating device which allow operating with maximal magnitudes of efficiency coefficients 53 – 57% are stated to be humid airflow speed of 0.6 – 0.8 m/s and relative humidity of 40 – 60%. Correlation between efficiency factors obtained by experiments and calculated with suggested algorithm is confirmed. The possibility of reducing the power consumption when heat storage devices applied in 2,4 – 90 times versus decentralized heating systems on basis of solid fuel boiler, gas boiler and electric boiler is stated when open-type sorptive heat storage device used. Results of the study can be used to develop adsorptive storage devices in decentralized heat supply and ventilation systems and adsorption units for utilization of low-temperature waste heat. </jats:p>"

Respondents of this study were the 78 managers of the community minimart in Medan City, North Sumatera, Indonesia who were selected by purposive sampling method. Meanwhile, the quantitative method was carried out using SEM PLS analysis by analyzing the indicators of aspects of ownership structure, capital structure and dimensions of operational success. The results show that the capital structure variable had a significant effect on Walmart's operational success. Meanwhile, the ownership structure variable had no significant effect on Walmart's operational success. The novelty that is produced from this research is that the success of community self-service is determined by the capital structure. Capital is an obstacle faced by community supermarkets because with limited capital it is difficult for community supermarkets to expand their business.</jats:p>"

Effective coordination of the supply chain can solve this problem, but this may fail if existing capital constraints and financial flows are ignored. This study addresses the challenge by exploiting coordination through joint decision-making on the physical and financial flows of a capital-constrained supply chain. We also consider the capital-constrained member’s financing limitations that lead to lost sales. Two scenarios based on non-coordinated and coordinated structures are modeled in the form of bi-objective optimization problems that simultaneously optimize system costs and service levels. The models are solved using the <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\varepsilon$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n                  <mml:mi>ε</mml:mi>\n                </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>-constraint method. The results indicate that the non-coordinated model cannot satisfy more than about 50% of the demand due to capital shortage and financing limitations, while the coordinated model can satisfy all of the demand via internal financing. Furthermore, the proposed coordination scheme leads to cost reduction for the members and the total system. To motivate all members to accept the proposed coordination scheme, a cost-sharing mechanism is applied to the coordination procedure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis concerning financial parameters is provided for validating the coordination model.</jats:p>",

We conducted an online survey to collect data from targeted respondents with three years of experience on average in the supply chain management field. The respondents consist of company managers, public accountants, public sector accounting managers, and accounting lecturers. We analyzed the data by implementing ordinary least square regression procedures. Our study results suggest that green purchasing, green manufacturing, and internal environmental management can hardly improve economic performance, social performance, and environmental performance. However, strong evidence shows that green distribution triggers a positive effect on economic, social, and environmental performance. Our study implicates that both private sector companies and public sector organizations in Indonesia, as an emerging country, should consider green supply chain management as a necessity. More organizations should pay more attention to apply the green supply chain framework to nourish the competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

The rigorous analytical, as well as simplified, solutions describing the dynamics of the uplifting of a spherical thermic have been obtained. Such a thermic appears during a short-term release of heat, e.g., during an explosion. The uplifting of a meteoroid thermic has also been studied. The theory of the thermic has found applications in the magnetic precursors of earthquakes. At the same time, the heat can be supplied during many hours or even days when big forest fires occur, peat fires burn, volcano eruptions occur for a long time, and during the release of heat before earthquakes. The dynamics of the uplifting of a thermal under these circumstances is considerably different from an instantaneous energy release. Employing the cylindrical model of a thermic, the dynamics of the thermic has been studied in the case of the continuous supply of heat. Within the model, the analytical solutions to the set of equations governing the temporal dependences of the velocity of a parcel of the heated air and the position of the upper bound of the thermic, as well as the excess temperature in the heated parcel have been obtained. The upper thermal boundary speed and location has been shown to increase with uplifting, while the excess temperature to gradually decrease. The numerical estimation has been performed for characteristic situations. The ecological consequences of large-scale fires, as well as the mechanisms for generating gravity waves by the thermals, are discussed. The physics-based mechanisms for generating acoustic wide-band emissions by the thermals have been analyzed; the wave periods have been estimated to be 1–103 s. The energy of acoustic emissions from a big fire has been estimated to be approximately 1014 J. At the same time, the energy of acoustic emissions from all fires that occurred in the Russian Federation in 2020 amounts to 7∙1016 J, while in Ukraine it is three orders of magnitude lower.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The original focus on supply of ecosystem services is shifting toward matching supply and demand. This new focus underlines the need to consider not only the amount of ecosystem services but also their spatial and temporal distributions relative to demand. Ecosystem functions and services have characteristic or salient scales that are defined by the scales at which the producing organisms or communities exist and function. Provision of ecosystem services (ES) and functions can be managed optimally by controlling the spatio-temporal distribution of landscape and community components. A simple model represents distributions of ES as kernels centered at the location of interventions such as grassland restoration or establishment of nesting habitat for pollinators. Distribution kernels allow non-habitat patches to receive ecosystem services from species they cannot support. Simulations for three contrasting ES producing organisms (bumblebees, Northern Harriers, and oak trees) show the effects of interacting distribution of interventions and demand for ES. More ES demand is met when the intervention is spread out in the landscape and demand is evenly distributed, particularly when the kernel radius is much larger than the minimum intervention required for the ES producing unit to be established. Because different functions have different reaches and saturation points, the level of ES demand met at any point in space can be modulated by controlling the spatial distribution of landscape components created by interventions. Different ES can be promoted by the same type and quantity of intervention by controlling the continuum of scales in the distribution of interventions. This work provides a conceptual and quantitative basis to consider the spatial design of interventions to match ES supply and demand.</jats:p>"

Most common practices suggest the cotreatment of primary and secondary sludge starting with thickening and anaerobic digestion. The aim of this study is to investigate the anaerobic digestion of the primary sludge only and estimate its impact on sludge treatment and energy recovery. Within this context, the performance of the anaerobic digestion of primary sludge is explored and focused on practices to further enhance the methane production by using additives, e.g., a cationic polyelectrolyte and attapulgite. The results showed that the overall yield in methane production during anaerobic digestion of primary sludge alone was higher than that obtained by the anaerobic digestion of mixed primary and secondary sludge (up to 40%), while the addition of both organic polyelectrolyte and attapulgite enhanced further the production of methane (up to 170%). Attapulgite increased the hydrolysis rate of biosolids and produced relatively stabilized digestate, though of lower dewaterability. Moreover, the results suggest that single digestion of primary sludge may accomplish higher methane production capacities at lower digestors’ volume increasing their overall efficiency and productivity, while the produced digestates are of adequate quality for further utilization mainly in agricultural or energy sectors.</jats:p>"

The solution of this issue is especially relevant for various types of radio engineering systems, which include autonomous and portable stations. At the beginning of the paper, the theoretical foundations of FPGA consumption are given: types of consumption (static and dynamic) and influencing parameters (switching logic, the physical foundations of the integrated circuit and other internal resources). The work is explained and methodological guidelines are given for the specialized built-in PowerAnalyzer utility of the Quartus II software development environment, the main indicators with which the utility works are explained: toggle rate (switching frequency) and static probability (the probability of finding a signal in a stable state \"0\" or \"1\"). The following is a Pipelinning method for eliminating the racing effect (the effect in which signals passing through an element/crystal reach the destination point with different time delays). The essence of the method is that a register is set at the output of the element that creates the delay. The register stores the value at the input at the CLK clock frequency, so random switching of the previous circuit element will be ignored. This eliminates the effect of racing and reduces the dynamic consumption of the circuit. At the end of the paper, the results of reducing energy consumption using the above methods are presented. The greatest gain is observed when minimizing consumption, when a large number of logic elements on the FPGA chip are involved, as well as when high-frequency operation occurs. This is due to the fact that when using the methods of switching off the clock frequency, we get rid of a large number of switches between the states of logic elements (the higher the frequency, the more such state switches per unit of time). If the number of occupied elements is more than 50%, we get a reduction in power consumption of more than 5%, and if the number of occupied elements is 75%, then we get a gain of about 14%.</jats:p>"

A study was made of the operating modes of the heat supply system in conditions of emergency heat supply from the CHP. The factors affecting the thermal regime of buildings with external fences of various constructions with limited heat supply are considered. A method has been developed for calculating the cooling rate of the inner surface of the outer fence and the temperature on this surface at a given point in time. Calculated dependencies are obtained to determine the acceptable duration of the heat supply system with limited heat supply.

We need to upgrade the SDG targets to focus on universal access to piped water on premises, to incorporate action on AMR in definitions of safe sanitation and to embed actions to improve resilience, which take into account the greater ambition called for in the SDG 6 targets. This requires a shift in thinking in the sector, away from relying on households and communities to manage their services to properly funded, professional services staffed by trained technical, managerial and finance staff. This will require more public finance and better use of financial instruments that have proved effective in other sectors. Increasing our ambition will mean the world can achieve the aim of universal access to safe, sustainable, and resilient services and protect public health.</jats:p>",

This paper introduces a method for the assessment of the resilience of water supply systems, including emergency supply measures. With 20 uniquely defined emergency situations, the technical constellations for possible impairments of the water supply are documented. The system analysis developed for each emergency situation is then used to determine and prioritise all suitable supply measures to reduce the supply deficit. Based on the data of a water utility close to Frankfurt, Germany, the developed system dynamics model was used to examine the resource utilisation for the respective emergency situations and to estimate the amount of water provided. The model allows us to scrutinize and compare emergency water supply measures as well as to identify required resources. Furthermore, the method helps us to prioritize measures as well as to make decisions when planning and providing emergency water supply (EWS).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents issues related to the determination of the continuity quality of power supply (CQoPS) for hospital electrical devices. The model describing CQoPS takes into account power redundancy. The uncertainty modeling method based on the certainty factor (CF) of the hypothesis was used to establish the single-valued CQoPS factor. CQoPS modeling takes into account multidimensional quality models and physical stages of power. The quality models take into account seven dimensions that make up CQoPS (availability, appropriate amount, power supply reliability, power quality, assurance, responsiveness, security). The model of power stages includes five of these stages (power generation, delivery to recipient, distribution by recipient, delivery to device, power-consuming device). To date, when designing hospital power systems, the applied reliability indicators revealed limitations because they do not consider all the possible factors influencing the power continuity. Estimating the supply continuity quality with the use of the uncertainty modeling proposed in this article allows for taking into account all possible factors (not just reliability factors) that may affect supply continuity. The presented modeling offers an additional advantage, namely, it allows an expanded evaluation of the hospital supply system and a description using only one indicator. This fact renders the evaluation of the supply system possible for unqualified staff. At the end of the article, some examples of calculations and simulations are presented, thus showing that the applied methods give the expected results.</jats:p>"

These problems entail reduced employee productivity and additional costs for organizations. It is difficult for a person to recognize mental overwork or burnout in the early stages, primarily because of the subjectivity of his feelings. One way to diagnose mental health problems is to analyze physiological indicators such as temperature, pulse, and electrical activity of the skin. It is possible to track these indicators using a wearable watch. However, a large number of sensors may not fit into the watch form factor. The aim of the work is to create a smart watch circuit with a power supply and sensors wired on the board. The designed solution, due to the versatility of the topological equipment of the boards is the least energy-consuming, since the components of the power supply and the control circuits make up an open-frame design. This allowed them to be located in the most favorable position and to use galvanic isolation in the primary and secondary power supply circuits without affecting the auxiliary control circuit of the sensors.</jats:p>"

Under the centralized and decentralized decision-making, the decision models of CLSC of retailer recycling was constructed, the effects of the manufacturer’s production diseconomy and the sales competition between manufacturer and retailer on new product pricing and waste product recycling were analysed, the optimal pricing strategy of dual-channel CLSC was given, and a “two-part tariff” coordination contract was established based on centralized decision-making. The results indicate that the profits of each member are negatively correlated with the production diseconomy and positively correlated with the degree of sales competition, the direct sales volume of manufacturer is always more than twice that of retailer, and the stronger the competition degree is, the more obvious the advantage is. Further, within the range of contract parameters that the dominant manufacturer and retailer are willing to accept, the “two-part tariff” contract can effectively realize the coordination of dual-channel CLSC.</jats:p>"

As a part of its strategy to fight seawater intrusion and guarantee a reliable groundwater supply in the basin, OCWD built a recycled wastewater facility that treats wastewater received from the Orange County Sanitation District and recharges the water into the basin through injection wells and infiltration ponds. OCWD’s first recycled wastewater facility, Water Factory 21, began operating in 1975 and was replaced in 2008 by the Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS). Recharged water not serving as a barrier for seawater instruction is pumped by local water districts and municipalities (referred to as “producers”), who pay a pumping fee to OCWD. Water provided by GWRS is both more reliable and less expensive for the producers than water acquired from other sources, including imported surface water. In responding to the recognized threat of seawater intrusion, OCWD owes its success to creatively enabling recharge through the development of novel source water. OCWD’s broad purview and authority to manage groundwater, combined with its effective implementation and long-term stewardship of the recharge program as it has evolved over many years, have enabled innovation in MAR using treated wastewater.</jats:p>",

Environmental Protection Agency Network (EPANET, 2.0) has been used to analyze the WDS to explore its reliability in current and future scenarios. Mapping of the existing 564 km long distribution network revealed that more than three-quarters of the system has outdated water pipelines. An accuracy of 93% for pipe diameter estimation has been obtained upon validation by ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. Water supply-demand gap analysis confirmed that although Dehradun city has surplus supply, it suffers from scarcity, mainly due to the unsatisfactory condition of the existing WDS. Twenty-seven percent of the existing pipes are smaller than the prescribed standards; there is an undesirable practice of direct pumping of water from tube wells into the network and storage tanks are required for at least 29 locations in the network. A 24-hour extended period EPANET simulation helped to identify the areas where the water supply network experienced very low or negative pressure.</jats:p>",

It is emphasized that the organization of accounting in terms of the formation of the volume and composition of costs (expenditures) at a state enterprise is carried out in accordance with current national legislation and declared by forming the Order \"On approval of the Regulation on accounting policy of the budgetary institution.\" It was established that the technical condition of the Dnipro-Donbass Canal Management equipment is unsatisfactory, and the fixed assets are significantly worn out and are unusable and unsafe for use. The situation requires capital investments in the reconstruction and modernization of hydraulic equipment. A comparative analysis of the calculation of the cost of services related to the supply of UCD water actual for the current year and projected (planned), in the event of an increase in costs due to the reconstruction of fixed assets. It is proved that such an approach to the implementation of measures to improve the technical condition will increase the tariff for water consumption by almost 4.35 times and requires additional allocations from the state budget. The methods of calculating the cost of water supply are evaluated and it is found that the institution uses the normative method of calculation with elements of administrative regulation. The necessity of developing a program of gradual rehabilitation (modernization and reconstruction) of fixed assets is proved. Proposed and substantiated types of works on the reconstruction of fixed assets UCD. It was emphasized that such a Program should become a part of the National Target Program.\nPurpose. Carry out an economic analysis of the technical condition of the channel equipment; to reveal the peculiarities of the functioning of the state institution in terms of the organization of accounting and analysis of costs (expenses); to analyze the accounting policy of the enterprise as a component that ensures the formation and composition of costs; present methods and options for calculating the cost of water: actual and projected (in the case of modernization of equipment); to develop measures and recommendations for improving cost accounting, calculating the cost of water and improving the technical condition of hydraulic structures of a state enterprise.\nMethod (methodology). Method of system analysis, methods of cause and effect analysis, tabular and graphical methods.\nResults. Based on the study, conclusions were made about the need to attract additional allocations and the implementation of reconstruction and modernization of fixed assets of the state institution of strategic importance.

Asymmetric information, incomplete decision-making and Human bounded rationality are factors for the formation of opportunistic risks, and adopting external governance is a feasible way to defuse the risks. Supply chain governance is a new type of governance which is different from enterprise governance. Its scope of governance is wider than enterprise governance. It is the performance of environmental evolution and organizational innovation. Based on the incomplete contract, this paper analyzes the game between the supplier and the manufacturer. It is found that in the process of the game, the cooperation benefits of both parties are the largest and the distribution of benefits is the fairest. Therefore, combined with the theory of supply chain governance, this paper hopes to maximize the value of supply chain by optimizing the supply chain governance strategy under the condition of incomplete contract.</jats:p>"

In this study, a range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to 2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created. Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation cost using an optimized location–allocation model. Simulation results suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014%. This can also reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these eight cultivars only make up 19.76% of the total rice production in South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014% of total revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated to increase the efficiency of the model performance.</jats:p>"

The study elaborates that government subsidies can provide more effective incentives for supply chain members to cooperate in the production of masks compared with the situation of no government subsidies. A relatively low wholesale price can effectively increase the profits of supply chain members and the supply chain system. The joint contract of two-way cost-sharing contract and transfer payment contract can promote production technology investment efforts of the supply chain members, the optimum trajectory of mask production, and total profit to reach the best state as the centralized decision scenario within a certain range. Meanwhile, it is determined that the profits of supply chain members in the joint contract can be Pareto improvement compared with decentralized decision scenario. With the increase of production technology investment cost coefficients and output self-decay rate, mask outputs have shown a downward trend in the joint contract decision model. On the contrary, mask outputs would rise with growing sensitivity of mask output to production technology investment effort and increasing sensitivity of mask demand to mask output.</jats:p>"

With total annual beef feed demand fixed at the same level, in all scenarios cow numbers and numbers of weaned calves decreased with increasing cow liveweight. When the model was run with consistent efficiency of calf production across the mature cow liveweights (scenario A), heavier cows were more profitable. However, using published efficiency data (scenarios B and C), herds of heavier cows were less profitable. The likely most realistic scenario for New Zealand hill country farms (scenario B) had COS decrease from New Zealand Dollars (NZD) 456/ha with a herd of 450 kg cows to NZD 424/ha with 600 kg cows. Reductions in COS were relatively small, which may not deter farmers from breeding heavier cows for higher calf growth rates.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>User interface design of nowadays safety-critical human-machine systems has a significant impact on human operator situation awareness (SA). SA is composed of three levels including the perception (level 1), comprehension (level 2) and projection (level 3) of information. A significant part of accidents can be attributed to level 1 error. This means that human operators have problems to satisfy their information demand with supplied information during task performance. While thoroughly checking user interface designs for information gaps is a standard in professional system design it is a time consuming and error prone process. In this paper we introduce an information gap model, which allows investigation of inconsistencies between information supply and demand. We present a method to detect information gaps and assess the fitness between information supply and demand. The method can be executed semi-automatically. We show the method’s implementation into an integrated system modelling environment and demonstrate the application with an autopilot component in a course change task on a ship bridge. We performed an expert evaluation with maritime system engineers and a human factors ergonomist to estimate the applicability, benefits and shortcomings of the method. Overall, the evaluation results are promising and warrant further research of the method.</jats:p>"

Increase competition and make a business become sustainable require the involvement of actors in the supply chain and sustainable principles. This study aims to analyze the influence of supply chain sustainable management on performance in organic coffee in Pasuruan Regency. This research conducted in Prigen and Tutor Districts, Pasuruan Regency, East Java, in March until April 2020. The data was gathered from 51 respondents who were determined using purposive sampling and the Rules of Thumb with SEM-PLS as the analysis technique. Based on SEM-PLS analysis, sustainable supply management practices have a sustainable positive effect on sustainable performance, except for sustainable supplier management on social performance and sustainable consumer management on environmental performance. This is due to the lack of involvement of all suppliers in the social activities of the community and consumers who are not oriented towards the environmental aspects of organic coffee.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, internet connectivity almost eliminates all kinds of blockades for the verification of authentication, comparison of prices, and services for a product. Consequently, the market has been becoming more competitive compared to decision making. In this paper, we construct a multi-channel supply chain (MCSC) frameworks with traditional channels as well as a direct channel (DC), where the manufacturer provides services to the customers for both the cases. Then the optimal decisions of the manufacturer and the retailers are examined. The optimal pricing decisions and services are discussed and also compared the profits with one another under various cases (Stackelberg settings, strategic alliance, and two types of no improved service). Then the sensitivity of the service cost coefficients and the cross-channel price coefficients on the profits for each player and the supply chain is analyzed. We find out the best profitable strategies under the parameters such as service costs and the positive effects of the service on the demand rate. We also mark out the optimum level of the services so that the profit will be maximized for each player. Finally, we define an interval such that if the service costs belong to that interval, then the selling price of the DC would be lesser than the wholesale price. These findings help companies such as automobiles, electronic goods, etc. to implement the best strategies to increase their profit.</jats:p>"

Family farming plays a crucial role in fruits and vegetables production; products are marketed in supply chains, which are increasingly demanding, diversified, and complex. Participation of the family farms in each of these supply chains is subject to their ability to meet the increasingly strict participation criteria. In this context, this study identified the main factors that affect the participation of the family farmers in the supermarket supply chains for fresh fruits and vegetables. A systematic literature review was conducted, covering the period from 2005 to 2019. Results indicated eleven variables that affect the participation of the fruits and vegetables family farms in the supermarket supply chains. These variables were grouped in an analytical framework, which comprised four factors: characteristics of the producer, characteristics of the farm, institutional aspects, and available infrastructure. This framework is useful for the development and implementation of the public and private policies for successful participation of fruits and vegetables family farmers in supermarket supply chains.</jats:p>"

The case study also involved observations, a field visit, and other secondary source data. Beef is a high demand, valuable food product with a limited shelf life. By using blockchain in conjunction with RFID and sensor technologies, farming and processing stages in the beef supply chain can be streamlined. Firstly, using the technology to monitor the animals on the farm and during transportation can reduce the amount of water and energy wasted. Secondly, blockchain can be used to establish exactly when and where the meat is cut and packaged, improving the accuracy of information between supply chain entities, resulting in improved inventory management, specifically more accurate delivery times and lengthened product shelf lives. </jats:p>"

The authors point out that the development of partnership in supply chains makes it possible to perform collaborative planning on a common information base, collective management of stocks, risks and all this provides reasons to coordinate activities in the supply chain, i.e. the dependence of «exit» on «entry» becomes homogeneous. Particular attention is paid to the ways of improvement the supply chain functioning, which is proposed to carry out at three levels. The highest level includes the processes taking place throughout the supply chain, and concerns the relationship between all participants [10]. At the operational level (the second level), the constraint theory recommends to use the LPS (Logical Product Structure) method. At the current actions level (the third level) TOC proposes to use the concept of management of the production system DBR (English: Drum – Buffer – Rope), the application of which enables to increase the capacity of the production system.  In order to identify the area of necessary changes, the authors propose to build a detailed flowchart of processes, actions and functions from receiving the order from the customer (either external or internal) up to the moment of order fulfilment and delivery to the customer, which makes it possible to analyze sequentially the system operation in the current time and identify the areas of necessary changes, as well as to increase the level of meeting the customer needs, ensuring the efficiency of material and information flows, strengthening the manufacturer status in the market.</jats:p>"

Currently, reverse osmosis (RO) is commonly used in the desalination technology and experiencing significant growth. The aim of this study was to analyze the environmental impacts of the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant installed in Kampung Pantai Senok, Kelantan, as this plant was the first installed in Malaysia. The software SimaPro 8.5 together with the ReCiPe 2016 database were used as tools to evaluate the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the SWRO plant. The results showed that the impact of global warming (3.90 kg CO2 eq/year) was the highest, followed by terrestrial ecotoxicity (1.62 kg 1,4-DCB/year) and fossil resource scarcity (1.29 kg oil eq/year). The impact of global warming was caused by the natural gas used to generate the electricity, mainly during the RO process. Reducing the environmental impact can be effectively achieved by decreasing the electricity usage for the seawater desalination process. As a suggestion, electricity generation can be overcome by using a high-flux membrane with other suitable renewable energy for the plant such as solar and wind energy.</jats:p>"

A depth varying input source at the upstream boundary is assumed as the location of disposal site of the pollutant from where the contaminant enters the soil medium and ultimately to the groundwater reservoir. At the extreme boundary of the flow site, the concentration gradient of the contaminant is assumed to be zero. Contaminant dispersion is considered along the horizontal and vertical directions of the groundwater flow. The governing transport equation is the advection–dispersion equation (ADE) associated with linear sorption and first-order biological degradation. The ADE is solved analytically by adopting Laplace transform method. Crank–Nicolson scheme is also adopted for the numerical simulation of the modelled problem. In the graphical comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions, the numerical solution follows very closely with the analytical solution. Also, Root Mean Square (RMS) error and CPU run time are obtained to account for the performance of the numerical solution.</jats:p>",

That is why it is not surprising that there are different interpretations of these economic categories. The analysis of these phenomena dates back to the emergence of production relations and production forces. The relaxation of regulatory measures on the national oil market has opened the space for building quality competitive relationships between the participants. Market opportunities, conditions and competition in practice are determined by concentration in the certain observed market. Competitive relations between market participants change over time. Those changes impact on concentration level of certain and well defined market, in this case the oil market of the Republic of Serbia. As the competition changes, the concentration level changes as well. This is the reason why this paper is focused on concentration level measurement and analysis. In  measuring and expressing the concentration level of the certain market, many concentration indicators could be applied. Our choice was Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. </jats:p>"

With competitive pressure for resources from non-agriculture sectors, there is likely to be an inadequate capacity to increase agricultural production. Attaining agriculture business performance continued relevance remains demanding in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan. Anchored in the supply chain management philosophy, this paper highlights cattle businesses and the interrelated elements of supply chain integration and a digital marketing perspective. The cattle meat industry in Malaysia is gradually transforming from unorganized backyard farming into organized farming. However, the supply chains are still characterized by inefficiencies, diseconomies of scale, lack of investments, and inadequate arrangement. Therefore, to improve the efficiency and economy of scale, added value chain is required. One form of value creation is technology adoption. The digital marketing part of technology currently leads to the adoption new business policies in agriculture production. Policies and procedures also need to be eased to facilitate investments to increase production. This paper concludes that, in many important ways, the Malaysian Government still sees food security as a public obligation, especially in the case of protein-based products, and is working attentively to increase food security for its citizens.</jats:p>"

The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encourages procurement practices that are sustainable in line with national policies and priorities. With rising energy prices, industrial pollution, shortages of needed raw materials and natural resources, and environmental disasters, recent studies consider sustainability as the most decisive criterion for choosing the most appropriate supplier. The three pillars of sustainable procurement combine economic (business), social and environmental aspects. Some studies refer to environmental procurement as ethical sourcing, meaning the introduction of restrictions and human rights principles into the supply chain. This includes ensuring fair wages for workers making the products, cleanliness and safety in factories, and consideration of all social and environmental aspects of production for workers and surrounding communities. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) recognizes that companies often have to conduct business or purchase locally, but it is often beneficial not only environmentally but also economically. Sometimes a remote supplier can offer a lower purchase price. On the other hand, long and unreliable delivery schedules greatly increase inventory management costs because more storage space and capital are required, and the risk of receiving goods that cannot be exchanged increases.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade, there has been a renewed interest in oral health workforce planning. The purpose of this review is to examine oral health workforce planning models on supply, demand and needs, mainly in respect to their data sources, modelling technique and use of skill mix. A search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases for published scientific articles on oral health workforce planning models between 2010 to 2020. No restrictions were placed on the type of modelling philosophy, and all studies including supply, demand or needs based models were included. Rapid review methods guided the review process. Twenty-three studies from 15 different countries were included in the review. A majority were from high income countries (n=17). Dentists were the sole oral health workforce group modelled in 13 studies; only five studied included skill mix (allied dental personnel) considerations. The most common application of modelling was a workforce to population ratio or a needs-based demand weighted variant. Nearly all studies presented weaknesses in modelling process due to the limitations in data sources and/or non availability of necessary data to inform oral health workforce planning. Skill mix considerations in planning models were also limited to horizontal integration within oral health professionals. Planning for the future oral health workforce is heavily reliant on quality data being available for supply, demand and needs models. Integrated methodologies that expand skill mix considerations and account for uncertainty are essential for future planning exercises.</jats:p>"

Specifically, key healthcare supply chain processes include product recalls, monitoring of product supply shortages, expiration, and counterfeits. Implementing and executing these processes in a trusted, secure, efficient, globally accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and impact health outcomes adversely. Blockchain, combined with the Internet of things (IoT), is an emerging technology that can offer a practical solution to these challenges. Accordingly, IoT blockchain offers a superior way to track and trace products via a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger of the blockchain network. This article highlights key challenges related to healthcare supply chains, and illustrates how IoT blockchain technologies can play a role in overcoming these challenges now and in the near future. </jats:p>"

Thus, the booming online-to-offline (O2O) food ordering and delivery industry via the online bakery have been changing customers’ food shopping behavior. This article proposes a comparison relying on advanced O2O strategy for a single-vendor-single-retailer integrated system. Three coordination mechanisms consist of revenue-sharing, buy-back, and quantity flexibility contracts have been employed for optimizing the order quantity. Replenishment strategies and temperature for the supply chain members are considered based on the new retailing framework. Herein, the authors suggest an algorithm for the computation of the optimal solution. Lastly, numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are also conducted to clarify the usefulness of the proposed model in the food supply chain. Sensitivity analysis revealed a number of managerial insights. For example, the results obtained under O2O operations can be compared with those obtained under online/offline operations (under various parameters settings) to determine an opportune moment for three coordination mechanisms.</jats:p>"

To enable voltage scaling across wide operating rates from 2.5 Gb/s to 16 Gb/s, two on-chip supply regulators are included in the transmitter. At the same time, the regulators maintain the output impedance of the transmitter to meet the return loss specification of the PCIe, by including replica segments of the output driver and reference resistance in the regulator loop. A three-tap finite-impulse-response (FIR) equalization is implemented and, therefore, the transmitter provides more than 9.5 dB equalization which is required in the PCIe specification. At 16 Gb/s, the prototype chip achieves energy efficiency of 1.93 pJ/bit including all the interface, bias, and built-in self-test circuits.</jats:p>"

This article integrates blockchain technology with supply chain finance and builds a supply chain financial alliance architecture based on blockchain technology and an underlying model of the Ethereum blockchain system suitable for supply chain finance. We innovated new supply chain finance models and operating mechanisms and proposed business scenarios for supply chain finance from the perspective of blockchain. Taking into account the actual operation of the blockchain supply chain financial platform, the principal‐agent model and the incentive theory are applied, and the supply chain financial accounts receivable model is taken as an example in the case of complete information and incomplete information. The incentive mechanism between the service provider of the chain supply chain financial platform and the core enterprise promotes the better implementation of blockchain technology and supply chain finance. Based on the existing theoretical research, this paper identifies the key influencing factors of the supply chain’s cross‐enterprise incentive mechanism. These influencing factors system includes two dimensions: transaction factors and relationship factors. Transaction factors include resource dependence, uncertainty, and cooperation experience; relationship factors include corporate reputation, trust level, and relationship commitment. Based on the nature of the incentive mechanism, information sharing and revenue sharing are extracted as the measurement dimensions of the supply chain’s cross‐enterprise incentive mechanism. On this basis, this article draws on the existing enterprise life cycle division method and constructs a hypothetical model of the influencing factors of the incentive mechanism in the incubation period, the growth period, and the maturity period. Relevant data was collected through questionnaires, and SPSS and AMOS software were used to perform statistical analysis, reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation hypothesis testing on the data. The performance of each influencing factor in different stages of the enterprise’s life cycle and the importance of each influencing factor in the same life cycle stage are obtained.</jats:p>",

The objective is measuring the percentage of the higher harmonics in the output of the three-phase inverter voltage and the effect of adding a passive selective Notch filters. Their inclusion in the output circuit creates a model of the system with improved electromagnetic compatibility, and hence an increased power factor and efficiency. A virtual architecture of the three-phase inverter power supply system has been developed in Matlab - Simulink software environment. The invertor is built of separate functional blocks simulating the components that can be embedded in a real project. The schematic diagram includes three-phase symmetric loads with three-phase filters models. The main operation modes of the invertor are modeled and the effects of adding three-phase filters to the output circuit after the voltage inverter are analyzed. From the pulse with modulation simulation, the frequency spectrum for the output current I<jats:sub>L</jats:sub> and voltage U<jats:sub>L</jats:sub> has been synthesized.</jats:p>",

Studies have shown that in the context of government subsidy, when the random output factor is higher and the loan interest rate is lower, the higher the loan interest subsidy rate, the higher the profit and social welfare of farmer, company, and bank. When the bank interest rate is higher than a certain value, the government subsidy can increase the profits of farmer and bank. Finally, numerical simulation found that in the context of government subsidy, government subsidy reduces the financing cost of farmer, but the real beneficiary is bank.</jats:p>"

Thus, the integrated controller of the PEMFC gas supply system based on distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) is proposed to solve this problem, it combines the original airflow controller and hydrogen flow controller into one. Besides, edge-cloud collaborative multiple tricks distributed deep deterministic policy gradient (ECMTD-DDPG) algorithm is presented. In this algorithm, an edge exploration policy is adopted, suggesting that the edge explores including DDPG, soft actor-critic (SAC), and conventional control algorithm are employed to realize distributed exploration in the environment, and a classified experience replay mechanism is introduced to improve exploration efficiency. Moreover, various tricks are combined with the cloud centralized training policy to address the overestimation of Q-value in DDPG. Ultimately, a model-free integrated controller of the PEMFC gas supply system with better global searching ability and training efficiency is obtained. The simulation verifies that the controller enables the flows of air and hydrogen to respond more rapidly to the changing load.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been reported that Nigeria requires a daily generation of 470,000 MWH (or 19,583 MWH/H) to provide constant electricity to its 36 states and its capital city and is currently generating only 17% of the electricity required to meet the demands of her citizens. However, little or no in-depth analysis has been performed on the performance of the electricity transmission and distribution systems and to determine their impact on the availability of electricity for consumers. This paper explores the effect of transmission and distribution losses on the availability of electricity in Nigeria. The Nigerian National Electricity Grid was able to provide an average of 9.99 ± 0.54 hrs of electricity to the 13 LGAs of Ebonyi State for each day in July 2020. For the case where there were no transmission losses, each LGA in Ebonyi State would have received 10.79 ± 0.58 hrs of electricity each day in July 2020. Where no distribution losses were present, each LGA in Ebonyi State would have received 23.23 ± 1.25 hrs of electricity each day in July 2020. Where there were no transmission or distribution losses, each LGA in Ebonyi State would have received 25.09 ± 1.35 hrs of electricity each day in July 2020. These results indicate that elimination of the distribution losses presently experienced by the electricity distribution companies could ensure constant electricity supply for the 13 LGAs in Ebonyi State. Based on this, the power distribution sector, and not the power generation sector, is the major reason for the electricity shortage in Ebonyi State, and possibly for other states in Nigeria. It is recommended that more emphasis should be on distribution infrastructure now before focusing on improving the country's power generation capacity.</jats:p>"

As a result, the evaluation of the capacity value of variable renewable energy, i.e., its contribution to security of supply, gains importance. This paper develops a new methodology to endogenously determine the capacity value in large-scale investment and dispatch models for electricity markets. The framework allows balancing effects to be accounted for that arise due to the spatial distribution of generation capacities and interconnectors. The practical applicability of the methodology is shown with an application for wind power in Europe. We find that wind power can substantially contribute to security of supply in a decarbonized European electricity system in 2050, with regional capacity values ranging from 1-40%. Analyses that do not account for the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the contribution of wind power to security of supply therefore lead to inefficient levels of dispatchable back-up capacity. Applying a wind power capacity value of 5% results in an overestimation of firm capacity requirements in Europe by 66 GW in 2050. This translates to additional firm capacity provision costs of 3.8 bn EUR per year in 2050, which represents an increase of 7%. </jats:p>",

Recognising sustainability risks within supply chains is an important component of understanding logistics. This research investigated the sustainability risks in the Indonesia–UK coffee supply chain by using System Dynamics (SD), a simulation modeling paradigm commonly used to assess complex systems. The model parameters and other components of the dynamic model were extracted through interviews with key stakeholders in the coffee supply chain, supported by evidence from a literature review. The model was then verified and validated in different stages, before being used to investigate five different what-if scenarios to consider changes to parameters in the system. The results of this investigation demonstrate the importance of improving agricultural productivity to support a sustainable coffee supply chain. This research also confirms that by combining the SD model and the multiple criteria decision-making technique, it is possible to achieve a more practical and accurate solution than by the individual tool alone, thus ensuring a better understanding of the whole issues affecting the coffee supply chain.</jats:p>"

The appropriate model was selected to simulate temperature and rainfall data under the emission scenarios of RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the future period of 2020–2050, and then to model the groundwater level of the region, GMS software for both stable and transient states for one water year was calibrated and then was validated by observation data. The results in the future periods showed an increase of 1–1.5 degrees in temperature and an increase in rainfall in the early months of the year to late spring season and a decrease in rainfall in autumn season. Generally, the RCP4.5 scenario showed slightly more annual rainfall increase over the next 30 years compared to the base period than the other two scenarios. The time series investigation of the average of groundwater level shows that the implementation of RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios respectively leads to an average monthly increase of 4.2, 4.3 and 4.6 cm of the groundwater level.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a new model for designing a dynamic and three level blood supply chain incorporating the quality issues. The proposed model intends to locate facilities, and to determine the best strategy for blood allocation by minimizing both cost and time and maximizing the customer satisfaction based on quality of blood delivery. In order to deal with consideration of real world, intricacies such as blood freshness, both separation and apheresis extraction methods, Cross match to Transfusion ratio (C/T) and equipment failure have been involved. Also, Interval Evidential Reasoning (IER) approach is applied to handle the uncertainty of blood product demand. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, MOPSO and NSGAII algorithms are utilized to solve it. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the problem some numerical examples are designed in different sizes and the most favorable algorithm is determined using TOPSIS method.</jats:p>"

Investigations of quantitative and qualitative transformation of river water runoff were carried out using the interpolation method. The main task is to describe the method of interpolation of hydrometeorological data of the territories; For such system, the center in this work adopted a material point that characterizes the movement of the whole system; for this research, such as the hydrometeorological parameters of the territory. The data of the hydrometeorological service of the Republic of Uzbekistan were used when interpolating climatic parameters, which are the main determining factors in the formation and transformation of the river flow of Chirchik. In the proposed interpolation method, a combined system is created, consisting of a landscape-natural component, a system representing a moving mass with a single center. The meteorological parameters of the territory are taken as elements of the mass system, which have their centers of change-movement. The performed test calculations showed that the difference in meteorological parameters affects the position of their centers; each parameter: atmospheric pressure, precipitation, humidity, and temperature, etc., has its center.</jats:p>"

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free, public risk assessment system used by information security vendors to assess the severity of vulnerability threats. However, CVSS is insufficient because of the strong subjectivity in the selection of measurement standards and the allocation of evaluation index weights. Based on this reason, this paper designs and proposes a more objective risk assessment method for IoT software chain vulnerabilities, and verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the method through experiments.</jats:p>",

The competitive strategy should enhance the competitiveness of the company, which is formulated during the strategic planning process. This paper investigates the impact of strategic planning, purchasing strategy, strategic partnership, on operational performance. The research has surveyed, using a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale, 135 manufacturing companies domiciled in the region of East Java, Indonesia. Data analysis used the PLS technique. The objective of the analysis is to assess the measurement model for validity and reliability. Besides, the analysis also examines six hypotheses developed. The result reveals that all six hypotheses were empirically supported. The manufacturing company's strategic planning influences the purchasing strategy and strategic partnership. The result also shows that purchasing strategy through periodic evaluation of supplier capability, influences the strategic partnership in terms of involvement of suppliers in the business process of the company. Overall, strategic planning, purchasing strategy, and strategic partnership affect operational performance. It was also found that purchasing strategy and strategic partnerships mediate the influence of strategic planning on the performance. The results presented here may facilitate improvements in operational performance in the context of supply chain management. This paper also contributes to the ongoing research in the supply chain management theory.</jats:p>"

As an important mission of higher education, the supply of higher education is a systematic problem with regularity, which is closely related to the regional social and economic development. The problems of higher education supply seriously affect the energy of higher education. Based on this, this paper takes the supply of higher education as the starting point. On the basis of sorting out the current situation and problems of the supply evolution of undergraduate colleges in Henan Province, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to improve the effective supply of higher education in Henan Province. This has a certain theoretical and practical significance to promote the effective supply of higher education in Henan Province and improve the supply quality of higher education in Henan Province.</jats:p>"

This is of concern to practitioners as analytics is needed to improve supply chain performance to achieve competitive advantage for the firm . For researchers, it is of interest to develop a comprehensive framework to study the conditions in which adoption of analytics in supply chain successfully transforms performance. This paper proposes a research framework to study the “perceived benefits” and the “facilitating conditions” of successful adoption. Based on the research findings the paper tabulates the perceived benefits of analytics on supply chain performance, aligned to the SCOR model. Based on findings of “facilitating conditions” the paper proposes that presence of “Extended Supply Chain”, “Information System capability” and a suite of “Digital technologies” is necessary to harness the insights of analytics, for achieving improved supply chain performance. </jats:p>"

Testing used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by the Partial Least Square (PLS) approach. Finding of this study reveals that lean manufacturing practices have no positive effect on operational performance in Indonesian food industries. Meanwhile, the mediating role of Manufacturing Agility Competencies has succeeded in increasing the effect of Lean Manufacturing on operational performance.

Applying a game-theoretic approach, we find that, first, under certain conditions, retailer’s ability to add app channel can induce the manufacturer to adjust the wholesale price and product quality in the opposite direction with the manufacturer being the leader. Second, for the manufacturer and the retailer, retailer’s ability to add app channel can result in two distinct profit situations regardless of the power structure of supply chain: win–win and lose–win. Moreover, in a retailer-led supply chain, adding app channel will make the whole supply chain better off when the return cost is relatively low or high, while make the whole supply chain worse off when the return cost is moderate. Third, we identify a region of the return cost under which the manufacturer, the retailer, the supply chain and consumers can gain from adding app channel, leading to a Pareto improvement.</jats:p>"

This study helps in examining the effect of changed production rate on the quality of goods produced. This research further examines the influence of manufacturing rate on “mean time to failure (MTTF)”. This increased production rate is not always environmental friendly due to the emission of contaminated gases after production process. The idea of making a specific investment initiation is incorporated in this paper to attain a sustainable environment development. Also, the information exchange is assumed in the supply chain system to achieve a better profitability. The mathematical model thus created and is validated with enough data, numerical experimentation, and graphical representation. The study concluded that higher degree of quality function reduces the MTTF of machine, also setup and environmental investment has highest impact on the total cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural industry is highly underdeveloped and requires transformation in technology for food safety and reliability. A digital world is relying on blockchain technology for the successful implementation of sustainable e-agricultural supply chain management (e-Agri-SCM). In current advancements of blockchain in digital marketing, product website design (web design) is essential to streamline the requirements of the customer and the expectations of supply chain partners. The current research has incorporated the blockchain effect by web design elements into the agricultural supply chain management (Agri-SCM) study. In addition, partners in the digital marketing supply chain (DM-SCM) are also facing issues to identify significant web design elements-based blockchain technology to gain maximum profit. Therefore, a cooperative (Co-op) sustainable e-agricultural SCM model is developed in this study by considering the web design index and variable demand to decide shipments, selling price, cycle time, and advertisement cost for agriculture products. The uncertainties in the model due to intangible web design elements and basic costs are dealt with by the application of the fuzzy system whereas carbon emission is also considered for providing cleaner production. A real-time application of the proposed model is done by undertaking five different cases based on mutual share, demand curve, and advertisement budget among participants. The sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify important factors of the total profit. Findings of this work include significant web design elements (WDEs) i.e., web graphics, search engine optimization, cyber-security, fast loading, and navigation, as essentials for digital marketing to convince customers towards the product in a global SCM. The numerical results and managerial insights are advantageous for managers to get maximum profit by cooperative and digital marketing strategies to attain e-Agri-SCM.</jats:p>"

And in the current post-COVID-19 era, agricultural SMEs have difficulty in obtaining the favours of financial institutions in normal lending due to their weak credit guarantee capabilities and high credit management costs. Difficulty in financing has become a bottleneck problem that plagues the development of enterprises and restricts the development of agricultural modernization. How to evaluate and control its credit risk is not only a major way to solve the financing difficulties of agricultural SMEs, but also the basis for the stable development of supply chain financial services. This paper analyzes three typical financing modes of agricultural SMEs from the perspective of supply chain finance, and takes the agricultural SMEs in the New OTC Market as an example to construct a Logistic model, and uses factor analysis to effectively predict the credit risk of supply chain finance. The results show that the operational efficiency factors, growth factors and related core corporate profitability of agricultural SMEs financing enterprises significantly affect their credit risk. After testing, the model is highly accurate in predicting the financing risks of agricultural SMEs.</jats:p>"

Even though the hunter plays a central role here, it is not well understood how hunters themselves perceive their role in the various phases of the production process. The present study explores Italian hunters’ perception of the HWGM supply chain and compares it to their perception towards the conventional farmed meat supply chain. We distinguish several phases of this production process and find that the final phase related to on-site game dressing is considered problematic, perhaps because hunters perceive themselves as less skilled than professional butchers. The results, in fact, show that hunters prefer hunted products over farmed meat, but that they consider hunted wild boar meat less safe compared to farmed pork. Findings from this study provide a rare glimpse from the inside of the supply chain and reveals the needs for a broad risk assessment analysis on the Italian game meat supply chain. Considering the development of the Italian emerging market of the HWGM, our results also highlight the relevance of training activities on hunters in order to increase the safety and quality of the final product.</jats:p>"

However, its environmental and financial sustainability remains disputable. In this study, three metrics, carbon footprint, cost, and waste discharge, are defined and analyzed to identify which water supply technology has greater prospects. Accounting for a full water treatment process from raw water intake to transportation and distribution, the RO desalination plant outruns traditional water treatment facilities due to less carbon emission, limited operation cost and maintenance, and less hazardous waste discharge. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of environmental and financial sustainability of existing solutions to the water supply may provide a more comprehensive understanding and further supports policy making.</jats:p>"

This study analyzed thirty-nine years (1980-2018) shortwave dataset in the tropics to chart the way forward for PV user, manufacturer, and regulatory organizations. It was observed that there is an increase in shortwave radiation in recent times that has led to more damages to PV modules. However, there is a statistical possibility that there may be lower shortwave radiation in the next decade, thereby reducing PV module damage. It is recommended that PV manufacture should modify the PV polymeric to shield the PV modules from UV radiation damage.

The distribution of the red chili supply chain in this study began with farmers in Kulon Progo, Yogyakarta, and extended to consumers in Jakarta, Indonesia. The sampling technique was carried out in several stages for 132 respondents consisting of red chili farmers and consumers. The supply chain relationship structure was analyzed descriptively, while the efficiency of the red chili supply chain was examined using the PMS framework, including indicators of production costs, transaction costs, profits, and return on investment. The results revealed that the relationship structure of the red chili supply chain was formed by three chains consisting of eight actors: farmers, middlemen, wholesalers at the regency level, auction markets, Kramat Jati Central Market or Pasar Induk Kramat Jati (PIKJ) dealers, PIKJ <jats:italic>centeng</jats:italic>, retailers, and consumers.

The purpose of this work is to describe syncretic cases in the structure of sentences with homogeneous semantics. Sentences taken from the language of fiction were the subject of this study, which was carried out within the framework of the structural and semantic direction. With the help of structural and semantic methods, the main characteristics of sentences with homogeneous members in a theoretical aspect are described, and syncretic cases that cannot be qualified unambiguously are shown. In the course of the study, it was found that the phenomena of transitivity are characteristic of sentences with homogeneous members. In the syntax of the language of lyrics, the processes of transition are manifested more vividly than in the language of fiction. This is due to the fact that the linguistic semantics of a poetic work becomes complicated under the influence of the informativeness, rhythm, rhyme and melody of the poetic line. The results of the study outline possible ways of understanding sentences with homogeneous semantics in the syntactic system of the language, and can also be used in the linguistic analysis of the text.</jats:p>"

Machine learning is a field in constant development, and it has a great potential and capability to attain improvements in real industries. The recent tendency of data storage by companies that manage the water supply networks have created a range of possibilities to apply machine learning. One particular case is the prediction of pipe failures based on historical data, which can help to optimally plan the renovation and maintenance tasks. The objective of this work is to define the stages and main characteristics of machine learning systems, focusing on supervised learning methods. Additionally, singularities that are usually found in data from water supply networks are highlighted.Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, eight studies which contain real cases from around the world are discussed. From the data processing to the model validation, a tour of the methods used in each study is carried out. Moreover, the trendiest models are briefly defined together with the mechanisms that best suit their performance.Findings: As a result of the study, it was found that the imbalanced class problem is typical of data from water supply networks where only a small percentage of pipes fail. Consequently, it is recommended to use sampling methods to train classifiers, however, it is not necessary if we are training a regression system. Additionally, scaling and transformation of variables has generally a positive impact on the model’s performance. Currently, cross-validation is almost a requirement to obtain reliable and representative results. This technique is employed in all revised studies to train and validate their models.Originality/value: The use of machine learning systems to predict pipe failures in water supply networks is still a developing field. This study tries to define the advantages and disadvantages of different methods to process data from water supply networks, as well as to train and validate the models.</jats:p>"

The studies carried out made it possible to identify the main defects and inconsistencies in the manufacture and installation of preinsulated pipelines and the reasons for their occurrence. Following this, the authors have developed a set of operations and control tools during the installation of pipes in polyurethane foam PE insulation, clarifying the requirements of the input, operational and acceptance types of control, which contribute to improving the quality of the finished product, which was the purpose of this work.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water scarcity is already causing serious challenges nowadays and devastating water-related processes will certainly continue for decades to come. The emerging water crisis requires new political arrangements, new technological solutions and the development of new water supply chains. Among the possible political-diplomatic answers, water trade may be a viable option, as water abundant countries could distribute resources by commercializing their water surplus. Water trade, however, faces serious obstacles. Dependence of different countries on states that have water surplus, political leverage and the possible opportunity when external powers could control the essentially important human needs are all examples of potential risks. These threats hinder the development of interstate water trade cooperation and orient countries struggling with water shortages towards domestic solutions. This study attempts to examine the practice of water scarcity and water diplomacy, while also applies the Turkish experience as a case study for demonstrating constraints of water trade. The paper will hopefully shed light on the threats posed by global and regional water scarcity and draw attention to the opportunities and limitations of water commercialization. The aim of our study is to outline the issues related to the distribution and trade of water, furthermore to present the problems of water as a product. Our research focuses primarily on Turkey, which has also become involved in water trade, but the story still ended in failure.</jats:p>"

The suggested indicator bank is comprised of three layers such as dimension, attributes, and the number of indicators resulting from 12 different indicator codes that the study has analysed. In addition, this paper presents instructions on how the indicator bank can be used and integrated with water enterprises, enabling decision‐makers to pick the relevant indicators. The proposed indicator bank is an exploratory approach that should be validated in a real work setting since resilience is a challenging concept, and WSSs are complex due to their dependencies to other lifelines such as power networks with too many variables that may affect the actual outcomes.</jats:p>",

The olive sector is a very important sector for several countries in the world, in particular, for Tunisia. In addition, the impacts of olive oil production and extraction on economic, environmental, and social issues are considerable. The main objective of this work is to propose a better configuration of the Tunisian olive oil supply chain (OOSC) from a sustainable development (SD) perspective. The proposed approach consists of applying a fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method as a multi-criteria approach. The proposed approach is applied twice. In the first application, the objective is to compare five possible scenarios for the olive agricultural phase. In the second application, the objective is to compare three possible scenarios for the olive oil transformation phase. The major findings of this research include the following: (1) The best scenario for the agricultural phase is the intensified organic system, which is based on biodynamic olive growing. (2) The best scenario for the transformation phase (oil extraction) is the continuous two-phase extraction system. Consequently, the efficient way for the by-products processing phase is the use of wet pomace for the preparation of biodynamic compost.</jats:p>"

They shouldn’t be. Just as living wages can insulate workers from human rights abuse and labour exploitation, wages that hover around or below the poverty line, compounded by illegal practices like wage theft and delayed payment, leave workers vulnerable to severe labour exploitation and human rights abuse. This article draws on data from a study of global tea and cocoa supply chains to explore the impact of wages on one of the most severe human rights abuses experienced in global supply chains, forced labour. Demonstrating that low-wage workers experience high vulnerability to forced labour in global supply chains, it argues that the role of wages in shaping or protecting workers from exploitation needs to be taken far more seriously by scholars and policymakers. When wages are ignored, so too is a crucial tool to protect human rights and heighten business accountability in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

This paper reports on an in-depth study comparing Thai medium-size manufacturing companies who use Lean with those which have not yet adopted Lean. In this paper the word “Lean” is used to refer to “lean practices” as well as “lean strategies”. Lean methods include just-in-time (JIT), total productive maintenance (TPM), automation, value-stream mapping (VSM), Kaizen, material requirement planning (MRP), Kanban, 5S and waste elimination. Primary data were obtained through questionnaires which were analysed using a number of statistical processes including factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Some 230 medium-sized manufacturing companies were the focal target of this study. Three latent variables, Lean (exogenous variable), product customisation (endogenous) and operational performance (endogenous) are formed in this study. There were 24 parameters and the findings provide further evidence regarding the effects which Lean practices have on product customisation and operational performance of the companies, for example. The methods for analyzing the data favour the proposed structural equation model. The results show that Lean strategies are linked to improved operational performance in the firms which practice them. Management teams in Thai medium-size manufacturing companies which have resisted Lean are encouraged to adopt Lean in order to improve operational performance, particularly in the present economic climate.</jats:p>"

As disruptive innovation is affecting different sectors and areas of society, numerous high-tech development zones should fully release their vitality and realize unprecedented development while contributing to this reform. This study attempted to further analyze the Research and Development (R&amp;D) efficiency of high-tech zones in the past mode, and shed light on a more advanced and effective development pattern in the near future. This paper used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, which is a linear programming method to measure the efficiency between multiple decision-making units, and categorized three decisive factors to reach solid conclusions [1]. Our statistical results indicated that the low R&amp;D efficiency is ubiquity among high-tech industries, and there is not yet a strong platform for advanced R&amp;D activities. Lastly, this paper suggested strategies to maintain the sustainable development of the high-tech industry under the supply-side reform.</jats:p>"

We address the issue of how to help a supplier firmly accept orders and subsequently plan to fulfill demand. We first formulate a linear aggregate planning model for demand management that incorporates elements of order promising, recipe run constraints, and capacity limitations. Using several scenarios, we discuss the use of the model in demand planning and capacity planning to help a supplier firmly respond to requests for quotations. We extend the model to incorporate congestion effects at assembly and blending nodes using clearing functions; the resulting model is nonlinear. We develop and test two algorithms to solve the nonlinear model: one based on inner approximation and the other on outer approximation.</jats:p>"

And the main disadvantages of such networks will remain overboard. Technically competently control the common highway of a multi-storey building is necessary. Here, the commercial metering of electricity consumption does not solve the technical policy considering the development of the city. The construction of multi-storey buildings based on an individual project is growing rapidly in the city. Together with the environmental aspects of the impact of such buildings, it is necessary to address the issue of reliability in power supply. The use of power supply schemes taking into account backup power is relevant. It is proposed to take a diesel power plant as a backup source.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The emergency supply of transboundary water resources is a prominent problem affecting the social and economic development of basin countries. However, current water supply decisions on transboundary water resources may ignore the psychological perception of multi-stakeholders, and the evolution of emergencies increases the uncertainty of decision making. Both factors would lead to the low acceptance of water-related decisions. Utility satisfaction, perceived losses, and quantity satisfaction were selected in this paper to identify the perceived satisfaction of upstream governments, downstream governments, and the public, respectively, over multiple decision-making stages. A modeling framework combining prospect theory and the multi-stage multi-objective programming methodology was then developed to measure the perceived satisfaction of different stakeholders in a watershed under emergency. A two-stage NSGA-II and TOPSIS based approach was adopted to find the optimal compromise solution to solve the model. The framework was applied in the Lancang–Mekong River basin to provide suggestions to decision makers. Upstream decision makers must choose a moderate proportional fairness degree when making emergency decisions to maximize the perceived satisfaction of all stakeholders. Meanwhile, the perceived loss of downstream countries with low water demand should be considered first in the formulation of emergency water supply plans. Furthermore, although water supply from upstream countries can improve perceived water quantity satisfaction of downstream publics, additional actions must still be taken to change the traditional concepts of the public.</jats:p>",

The political regulations resulting from COVID-19 also led to significant changes in physical grocery shopping. However, the specific impact of COVID-19 on consumer satisfaction at the customer end of retail supply chains, i.e., the point-of-sale (PoS), has not yet been addressed. By gathering and analyzing consumer satisfaction data (ratings) and sentiments (evaluation comments) available on the open web, the current study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on consumer satisfaction at the PoS. Focusing on the five biggest retail chains in Austria, the results show that there was a general and significant decline in consumer satisfaction due to the pandemic. The results also show a high impact of political regulations on consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, the text-mining based analysis of evaluation comments indicate that store layout and facilities, as well as product availability and waiting time had a great impact on consumer satisfaction. In total, over 533,000 consumer satisfaction ratings and over 153,000 textual comments have been analyzed, providing the basis for a comprehensive and sound discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on consumer satisfaction and perceptions. Future research could focus on applying the used data analysis technique and the adapted consumer sentiment dimensions in different settings, such as countries other than Austria or smaller retail chains.</jats:p>"

The mathematical model is applied to investigate the impact of applying traceability technology on decision-making and profit of supply chain when two suppliers compete. The results show that: (1) the fresh product supply chain with the traceability technology is more profitable than the case that without the traceability technology; (2) when the tag cost of the traceability technology is within the threshold, the supplier’s profit decreases with the increase of the tag cost, and it is always greater than the corresponding profit when comparing with the case that without adopting the traceability technology; (3) if the tag cost of the traceability technology is too high, the retailer can use cost sharing or bargaining with the supplier to encourage him to implement the technology.</jats:p>"

The value of the BE supply chain value calculation at PT SFO shows a higher figure than at the retail level. The bullwhip effect at PT SFO occurred because of a rationing and shortage gaming policy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Luxury counterfeits are appealing to certain shoppers because they provide the signaling value of luxury brands at a lower price. Because of the myriad challenges facing policymakers and law enforcement, the stigma of using counterfeits has been diminishing and counterfeit sales have been on the rise. Research has been conducted on the characteristics of those more likely to purchase counterfeits, and investigations into the social and emotional motives that underlie counterfeit use have also been undertaken. Despite all of this attention, it is still unclear which levers can be utilized by law enforcement to enact demand-side limitations that will reduce the on-going proliferation of counterfeits. The chapter reviews the literature, particularly in marketing, in order to provide some insight to brand managers, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies who are attempting to curb counterfeit consumption. </jats:p>"

The results showed that the BFP has an opposite effect to the one pronounced in the critiques of the program, the beneficiaries did not have more or fewer work hours than the non-beneficiaries, this fact can be explained by the value of the benefit not being able to meet the expenses of the household. From these results, we can conclude that both tests reinforce the importance of continuing the investigation of the effects on female labor supply in the rural environment in the light of different guidelines.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer delivers the retailer’s order quantity in a number of equal-sized shipments. The replenishment lead-time is such that it can be crashed to a minimum duration at an additional cost that can be treated as an investment. Shortages in the retailer’s inventory are allowed to occur and are partially backlogged with a backlogging rate dependent on customer’s waiting time. Moreover, the manufacturer offers the retailer a credit period which is less than the reorder interval. The model is formulated to find the optimal solutions for order quantity, safety factor, lead time, and the number of shipments from the manufacturer to the retailer in light of both distribution-free and known distribution functions. Two solution algorithms are provided to obtain the optimal decisions for the integrated system. The effects of controllable lead time, backorder rate and trade-credit financing on optimal decisions are illustrated through numerical examples.</jats:p>"

The Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is a method of evaluating all costs incurred and is used to track the financing of the drinking water sector. This study analyses LCC of self-supply water in the Metro City, Indonesia. A field survey was conducted using a questionnaire in October 2020 for households in Metro City that captured information on costs incurred for household water use. It was observed that self-supply water uses in Metro City accounts for 92.86.30% of all water supplies. The average recurrent expenditure is Rp.224,344/ year with mean of capital cost is Rp.275,273. Most expensive cost for self-supply is borehole. High cost of borehole due deeper groundwater source, borehole use more pump electricity and higher drilling cost. This funding for selfsupply water is carried out independently by the households. These results highlighted the importance of self-financing for the water supply sector. Increased reliability and safety of self-supply require a better awareness of the costs and benefits of developing water sources. Furthermore, selfsupply water requires better governance to achieve safe water access.</jats:p>"

With the known number of zones, optimization object is maximum line capacity without consideration of generalized cost. Considering factors such as stator position in section, train speed profile characteristics, blocking time and blocking time overlap method, an optimization model of MSM stator combination is established. According to the given relative position of stators and target speed profile, a genetic algorithm is designed to obtain power supply plan that meets the target expectation.

The study was carried out from the quantitative approach, with a non-experimental correlational transactional research design. A questionnaire was applied to 228 parents between the ages of 30 and 50 who belong to an educational institution in the city of Concepción in Peru. Using the structural equations model, it was found that Content Marketing has a significant influence on the operational management of customer relationships (p &lt;0.05), as well as on the analytical management of customer relationships (p &lt;0.05). Regarding the Marketing of social networks, it was identified that it has a significant influence on the operational management of customer relationships (p &lt;0.05), as well as on the analytical management of customer relationships (p &lt;0, 05), because the media used by educational institutions are attractive to parents. It is concluded that Digital Marketing has a great impact on customer relationship management (CRM) in the educational sector of a city in central Peru.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In February 2020, our laboratory started to offer a RT-qPCR assay for the qualitative detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our method—nasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18–23 °C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction. However, using real clinical samples with Cq values ranging from ~12.15 to ~36.46, the results of the three tested conditions were almost identical. These alterations will not affect the vast majority of diagnostics and increase the daily testing capability in 30% and increase primers and probe stocks in 500% and 250%, respectively. Taken together, the alternative protocols described here overcome the short supply of tubes, reagents and equipment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding the collapse of test offering for the population: 105,757 samples were processed, and 25,156 SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics were performed from 9 May 2020 to 30 June 2020.</jats:p>"

The issues of construction and numerical modeling of the modes of a three-phase inductor for a liquid aluminum stirrer are considered. Reduction of losses is ensured by the use of a toothless design of the MHD inductor. The absence of steel teeth reduces saturation of the magnetic circuit and current distortion. It is proposed to use the parametric model of the inductor under the furnace in the ANSYS environment to clarify the modes of the complex. To take into account mutual induction, using controlled sources, a circuit model was built, and a numerical calculation of the modes was carried out. The characteristics of instantaneous currents and voltages are obtained when powered from a three-phase source with close frequencies, with pronounced beats. It is shown that the presence of mutual inductance redistributes currents in the delta windings, which must be taken into account when developing the design of linear induction machines. It is proposed to use sources with non-sinusoidal periodic currents in the modeling system. The analysis is carried out and the main types of modulated voltage characteristics in the power supply system of the induction MHD stirrer are shown.</jats:p>"

The matrix highlights two mismatches: (1) important customers do not perceive a high degree of port operator SCI; and (2) low-importance customers perceive a high degree of port operator SCI. In the former, the port operator's investments are wasted, while in the latter the port operator reaps benefits from minimal investments. In our first study, we classify 1,441 customers of a Brazilian port operator into three levels of strategic importance: high, medium, and low. A survey instrument sent to these customers measured the perceived port operators’ SCI by 210 customers, and the analysis revealed a mismatch for 76 percent of the companies. The second study examines the reasons for the mismatch. Semi-structured interviews highlighted that the perceived unfairness of the port operator's operational decision making and negative experiences with other supply chain members negatively affected the SCI perceptions of customers. We also found a spillover effect: low-importance customers perceived a high level of SCI due to the port operator's operational investments in its important customers.</jats:p>",

Therefore, cities need to be sustainable and smart in the future. An economically important and innovative sector in urban areas is food security. Nowadays, most of the literature explores the concept of smart cities from the point of view of information and communications technology, indeed, the connection with the sustainability aspects of the food supply chain and the ways to operationalize that, remains unsolved. This paper tries to overcome this gap in the literature. The main aim is to analyze the contribution of the short supply chain of food in terms of sustainability in smart cities, regarding current urban trends in cities in general and in Mediterranean areas in particular. The methodology was based on a literature review and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results confirm the existence of positive impacts in the short supply chains of food in urban areas in terms of sustainability. Despite the existence of a considerable number of papers about smart cities and ICT-related topics, the benefits from society of short supply chains of food, and the linkage among the topics and subjects, remain unreferred to or with a limited knowledge exchange.</jats:p>"

The expected growth of the world's population, from about 7.8 billion people today to 9.8 billion people by 2050, and to around 11 billion people by the end of 2100, will create even higher demand and a greater strain on these basic services. Goal 6 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’ by 2030. However, in a recent report, UN-Water warns us that if things continue on the current path, the world will miss the targets of SDG 6. The selection of appropriate water and sanitation technologies is key to meeting SDG 6 targets. This paper presents an original framework of a decision support system (DSS) for the selection of appropriate water supply and sanitation (Watsan) technologies in developing countries. The proposed DSS has three components. The first component is the user interface, where the inputs are the assessment of a community's capacity to manage a given water supply or sanitation system, and its regional specificity. The second component of the DSS is a database of Watsan technologies classified according to the capacity requirement level (CRL) metric, and finally, the third component is a matching algorithm for the selection of appropriate Watsan technology options. Case studies and simulations results are presented for the evaluation of the performance of the decision support system.</jats:p>",

Particular attention is paid to the need to establish cooperation and appropriate integration between the participants of the supply chain. Supply chain analysis in foreign economic activity helps to investigate logistics costs and solve the problem of their optimization, which, in fact, turns into a task of their minimization, as well as to optimize the cost of customs clearance of goods. A changing competitive environment requires the formation of an effective supply chain, taking into account the peculiarities of not only the national market, but also international norms for transport services of foreign economic activity and legislation of different countries regarding customs procedures. When planning economic activity and foreign economic activity, in particular, many factors that have a direct or indirect impact on the formation of a price for the end user are taken into account, one of the main ones is the proximity to raw materials, fuel, and consumers. The pattern of rational placement of production follows from the economic law of labor economy, which regulates the costs of overcoming the distance between the areas of raw materials production, production and consumption of products, and also takes into account additional costs arising from the movement of raw materials or final products of the customs border. The role of this law is decisive, since logistics costs and customs clearance costs during implementation often occupy the lion's share in the cost of final products and, accordingly, form a price for the consumer. It is through the solution of logistical problems that it is possible to minimize transport costs and customs clearance costs, which ultimately affects the cost of finished products. The effectiveness of such actions depends on the amount of financial and time costs and in the current competitive environment is the main factor that affects the formation of competitiveness of the enterprise. Thus, the task of minimizing total costs is reduced to the task of minimizing transport costs and customs clearance costs. Thus, effective management of supply chains, taking into account the peculiarities of the implementation of foreign economic contracts, will greatly simplify the process of promoting the finished products of the enterprise in foreign markets and establish effective cooperation with foreign suppliers of raw materials for their own production.</jats:p>"

However, the current cost management model still remains in the traditional management method and lacks a smarter big data analysis method. In addition, there is a lot of research on big data applications, and there are few e‐commerce supply chains. Therefore, the research purpose of this study is to use big data technology to explore a series of practical operation methods for supply chain Cultural Communication Enterprises and summarize the operation mode of building SCC control by using big data technology. In terms of research methods, this study combined bibliographic review and empirical analysis, explored cost‐based mobile e‐commerce (EU) cost control related to big data information, used smart and digital analysis methods to thoroughly analyze CCE business issues from internal and external supply chains, established an e‐commerce business supply chain cost control model based on big data technology and elaborated cost control procedures and measures. Finally, it summarized the research results and drew conclusions to provide a theoretical basis for promoting enterprises products products to reduce supply chain costs. The research in this study has achieved a breakthrough in the cost management and control of EE; it provides empirical guidance and theoretical reference for EE to adopt big data technology for cost command of supply chain (CCSC), could help EE to reduce cost of supply chain management to gain higher profit margins, and promote e‐commerce industry as a whole to the next level eventually. This study concluded that the use of big data technology for cost command can solve a series of problems effectively, such as the lack of systematic analysis of cost, the lack of contractual partners, the serious waste of sales links, and the policy errors of logistics links, and continuously improve the enterprise management level and the decline of comprehensive cost. The application mode of supply chain CCE enterprises using big data technology constructed in this study has universal applicability.</jats:p>",

We apply this approach to the sugarcane‐to‐ethanol industry in Argentina, identifying the optimal combination of technologies and network layout that minimize the impact on these ecological boundaries. Our framework can find applications in a wide range of supply chain problems related to chemicals and fuels production, energy systems, and agriculture planning.</jats:p>",

At the same time, this study tries to analyze the coordination problem in the two-stage supply chain with consideration of the retailer and the manufacturer’s risk attitudes. Firstly, this study develops a supply chain optimal decision model in a centralized decision framework. In the proposed model, the L-R fuzzy numbers are used to depict the yield and demand with fuzzy characteristics. Then, the coordination of quantity discount in a supply chain is studied. Consequently, this research further investigates a special case in which the market demand and yield are assumed to be triangular fuzzy numbers, and the optimal solution of the order quantity and the wholesale price are obtained. At last, this paper utilizes several numerical examples to validate the proposed model. The results show that the quantity discount contract can coordinate the supply chain in a fuzzy environment, and the optimal order quantity decreases with the increasing of the risk bias coefficient of the retailer and the manufacturer. It also suggests that risk-seeking retailer will order more products, in addition, the manufacturer tend to choose a risk-seeking retailer as partner and the retailer is more likely to choose a risk-seeking rather than risk-aversion manufacturer as partner.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>West Tarum Canal (WTC) is a canal that drains raw water from the Jatiluhur Dam. Nearly 81% of the raw water for drinking water used by Jakarta’s people comes from this canal. However, various land uses such as agriculture, industry, settlements, and infrastructure development impact WTC’s water quality. This research aims to assess WTC’s water quality in 2016-2020 based on water quality standards set by the Government and using the STORET method. The results of this research indicate that the concentrations of TDS (142-351 mg/L), Fe (0.1-0.15 mg/L), Mn (0.03-0.1 mg/L) are meet the standards, while DO (3.6-4.9 mg/L), BOD (4-10 mg/L), COD (13-30 mg/L) are not meet the standards. Almost all monitoring points have pH values between 5.75-7.68 that are meet the standards. The STORET score of WTC is from -26 to -38 with an average of -30, which indicates that WTC’s water quality is moderately polluted. Water contamination in WTC will burden the drinking water processing and ultimately affect the community’s ability to pay for drinking water. This research also shows the need for integrated management of WTC from upstream to downstream and the need to increase collaboration between stakeholders in carrying out this management.</jats:p>"

The authors studied the conditions for supplying water to the pumping station and the flow path of the pumps of the OP2...OP10 type. The curvature of the flow jets causes the swirl of the flow in front of the impellers, directed counterclockwise for the units located to the left of the axis in the direction of the flow and clockwise - located to the right. With such a flow structure, in the most unfavorable hydraulic conditions there are pumps, the direction of rotation of the impellers of which coincides with the direction of the natural swirl of the flow. The nature of hydraulic losses in the impeller of an axial pump in a wide range of feed changes within (0.1...0.4) Qо has been established. When the direction of rotation of the vortex α coincides with the direction of rotation of the pump, the decrease in flow reaches 0.5 Q0 for OPV 10 pumps, and (0.6 ... 0.7) Q0 for OP2...OP6 pumps. Impellers of axial-flow pumps must be designed taking into account shear phenomena.</jats:p>"

The case study also involved observations, a field visit, and other secondary source data. Beef is a high demand, valuable food product with a limited shelf life. By using blockchain in conjunction with RFID and sensor technologies, farming and processing stages in the beef supply chain can be streamlined. Firstly, using the technology to monitor the animals on the farm and during transportation can reduce the amount of water and energy wasted. Secondly, blockchain can be used to establish exactly when and where the meat is cut and packaged, improving the accuracy of information between supply chain entities, resulting in improved inventory management, specifically more accurate delivery times and lengthened product shelf lives. </jats:p>"

In the verbal formulation, the goal of the model is to determine the range and delivery volumes of perishable goods that maximize profits with restrictions on the funds available for their purchase, storage volumes and weight, as well as on lost profits. The formalized representation of the model is determined by the properties of the supplied perishable goods. If these goods are divisible, then the model is formalized as a linear programming problem. In this case, the rational assortment and volume of goods is determined by solving it, for example, using the simplex method.If the goods under consideration are piece (indivisible), they are formalized in the form of a corresponding integer programming problem. In this case, the rational assortment and volume of goods is determined by solving it, for example, based on the branch and bound method. The peculiarity of the model is that it takes into account the stochastic nature of demand for goods, their limited shelf life, as well as the possibility of storing goods and the availability of funds necessary to purchase the next batch.</jats:p>"

In this study, a multi-period multi-product mathematical model is developed to maximize the profit and examine the effect of different discount schemes on demand and sales. To verify the proposed model, a real-world case study is conducted. The sensitivity analyses examined the important model parameters.

Given that BRI is a large-scale project focusing on building large-scale logistics infrastructure, it can have serious implications for sustainable supply chains from environmental and social perspectives. This study attempts to address this gap. Using a phenomenological approach and conducting 36 semi-structured interviews with senior managers from five South Asian countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, and China), this study reveals that BRI can potentially harm organizations' supply chains from environmental, social, and governance perspectives. The study contextualizes the findings in the extant literature and further articulates its implications for theory and practice.

In the present study, three different modelling approaches: Gaussian process regression (GPR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and principal component regression (PCR) models were used to predict the total dissolved solids (TDS) as water quality indicator for the water quality management. The performance of each model was evaluated based on three different sets of inputs from groundwater (GW), surface water (SW) and drinking water (DW). The GPR, BPNN and PCR models used in this study gave an accurate prediction of the observed data (TDS) in GW, SW and DW, with the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> consistently greater than 0.850. The GPR model gave a better prediction of TDS concentration, with an average <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, MAE and RMSE of 0.987, 4.090 and 7.910, respectively. For the BPNN, an average <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, MAE and RMSE of 0.913, 9.720 and 19.137, respectively, were achieved, while the PCR gave an average <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, MAE and RMSE of 0.888, 11.327 and 25.032, respectively. The performance of each model was assessed using efficiency based indicators such as the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (<jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub>NS</jats:sub>) and the index of agreement (d). The GPR, BPNN and PCR models, respectively, gave an <jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub>NS</jats:sub> of (0.967, 0.915, 0.874) and d of (0.992, 0.977, 0.965). It is understood from this study that advanced machine learning approaches (e.g. GPR and BPNN) are appropriate for the prediction of water quality indices and would be useful for future prediction and management of water quality parameters of various water supply systems in mining communities where artificial intelligence technology is yet to be fully explored.</jats:p>",

To measure supply-side efficiencies in tomato sub-sector, this survey research organized an interview schedule with the randomly selected eighty households in Kirtipur, Chandragiri, Changunarayan, and Godawori municipalities of Kathmandu valley during April to June 2018 with semi structured questionnaire. Study estimated NRs 8,26,144/ha as net profit of tomato grown under tunnel was nearly 44% higher compared to open field condition. Further five types of marketing channels prevailed for tomato market were; channel first (producer-retailer-consumer), channel second (producer-wholesaler-retailer-consumer), channel third (produce-cooperative-retailer-consumer), channel fourth (producer-collector-wholesaler-retailer-consumer) and channel fifth (producer-wholesaler-processor-wholesaler-retailer-consumer) but most dominant was the fourth one since 45% of the fresh tomato supplied through it especially to save time and avoid all possible drudgery in the market.  The marketing margin per kilogram of tomato was the lowest (NRs.16.55) in the third channel and the highest (NRs. 39.2) in the fifth channel while the highest market efficiency was 1.27 for the third channel. The producer’s share was highest for the third channel (66.33%) and lowest for fifth channel (39.88%). followed by 1st channel (63.72%) and lowest in 5th channel (39.88%). In order to promote a coordinated and most efficient supply chain, the study suggested the most dominant, low marketing margin and highly efficient supply channel for tomato so that tomato producers would get a high share. Rather than a private one, either group marketing or cooperatives are suggested to involve in fresh tomato marketing.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

In the present research, we identified eleven challenges in the SFSCM on the basis of literature review and expert opinion. The approach is an integration of fuzzy with DEMATEL which can be used for dividing the challenges into cause and effect group. Fuzzy DEMATEL method has continuously been used for the analysis of challenges and is the novel approach for decision making. Thus, this method can be implemented in many fields including automobiles, food industries, retail market etc. From the fuzzy DEMATEL results, it can be confirmed that the Safety and Security is one of the most influencing challenge and has the strongest association with other challenges. </jats:p>"

Each manufacturer provides a substitutable product and opens an online channel to customers directly. We develop an analytical model to derive the optimal pricing strategies by using game theory and the backward induction method, and we examine related properties under three market power structures while considering channel discrepancy, including the Nash equilibrium, the Manufacturers leader Stackelberg, and the <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> leader Stackelberg models (denoted as the N, MS, and M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>S models, respectively). Numerical simulations are examined to reveal and verify the effect of channel discrepancy on optimal prices, demands, and profits. We find that a higher level of channel discrepancy induces higher prices, demands, and profits for each member in both channels, while this kind of stimulating impact for the leader manufacturer who obtains a higher level of channel discrepancy will be more significant than it is for the other members in the three models. In addition, the profit of the supply chain in the N model is always higher than it is in the MS model, while it may be higher or lower than it is in the M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>S model depending on the level of channel discrepancy.</jats:p>",

E‐commerce also seems to be able to intuitively understand the needs and preferences of consumers. With the continuous competition of online retail, the undifferentiated production of online retail has slowed down the development of e‐commerce. The rise of the new retail model has promoted the production of high‐quality products, which has greatly stimulated supply and demand. The new retail model is able to make better use of existing human and material resources and maximize the use of resources in today’s era of rapid technological changes. Online and offline network competition channels also exert different competitive advantages for different consumers. This paper studies the competition between physical retail and e‐commerce retail and combines centralized decision‐making and decentralized decision‐making for analysis. It also calculates the relative optimal pricing price of e‐commerce retail through numerical simulation calculations. Although the best pricing price is obtained after a series of calculations, it is still necessary to comprehensively consider and analyze multiple factors rationally to promote the long‐term development of the enterprise. Although supply chain pricing strategies can solve certain problems in market sales to a certain extent, comprehensive analysis and scientifically formulating corporate development strategies are the guarantee of sustainable business operations.</jats:p>",

Greater onus of responsibility has been placed on exporting countries to provide documentary evidence of adherence to internally recognized food safety standards. According to global trade agreements, any additional safety tests applied to freshwater fish imported into Australia must be justified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a risk scoring method to provide justification for identifying countries as ‘Freshwater fish high risk’ and to examine the seafood they export to Australia for seafood supply chain breaches. Scoring was conducted using six predictor variables, identified in the literature as important contributors to seafood supply chain breaches, to achieve the outcome variable, Country considered ‘Freshwater fish high risk’. Sixty-seven fish fillets (9.55 kg) of the same species were examined from the third highest scoring country (Country 20) and 562 (5.6 kg) whole fish from the sixth highest scoring country (Country 22). Country 20 had supply chain breaches of 28 macroscopic yellow cysts in one fillet. Two hundred and thirteen parasites and other supply chain breaches were identified in fish from Country 22, including retained liver (91 per cent), visible mud (11 per cent), a variety of debris (16 per cent) and, depending on the commodity code, these fish were imported to Australia under full intestine (90 per cent), retained gills (89 per cent), and partial intestine (9 per cent). Three serious physical hazards were recovered from the edible portion of three ‘consumer-ready’ fish and snails of Genus Lymnaea and Indoplanorbis were recovered from gill mud also from ‘consumer-ready’ fish. The study showed variable results from the scoring system and vast differences in seafood supply chain breaches between the third and sixth highest scoring countries.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the fairness concerns of manufacturers were taken into account in the double-channel low-carbon supply chain. A double-channel low-carbon supply chain model was constructed to research the influence of manufacturers’ fairness concerns to the optimal decision-making of all parties in the supply chain and to the overall performance of supply chain. The research results suggested that: with improvement of manufacturers’ fairness concern coefficient, the decision-making of supply chain members demonstrated different changing strength; the manufacturers’ fairness concern caused harm to overall profit of supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Manual activities of workers in palm oil factories cause pain complaints that can be resolved with an ergonomic program. However, the uncertainty of the success of the ergonomic program requires active involvement from workers. This study aims to discuss the role of workers’ perceptions towards the success of the ergonomic program intervention in palm oil mills. By referring to the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model, acceptance of workers to ergonomics programs are influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust. All these research variables were analyzed simultaneously using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) software, in which data were obtained from questionnaires given to 280 people working in 20 palm oil mills in North Sumatra Province. The sampling method used is simple random sampling and model estimation is performed using PLS regression algorithm and resampling bootstrapping method. The result shows that perceived usefulness has the biggest effect on the success of the ergonomic program, followed by perceived trust and perceived ease of use, which has a smaller effect. This study focuses on workers’ perception that needs to be considered for facing uncertain results in implementing an ergonomic program.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Units of modern cars require an uninterrupted supply of electricity of the required quality, therefore, the prompt determination of the technical condition of the power supply system (SE) is an urgent task. During the operation of the car, there is a dynamic redistribution of electricity consumed for the needs of consumers between the car generator and the storage battery (AKB). The efficiency of the balance of electricity on board the car is influenced not only by the power of consumers, the mode of movement of the car, weather and climatic factors, but also by the technical condition of the generator and battery, however, insufficient attention has been paid to this. It has been established that the currents of the generator, the field winding and the battery, as well as the voltage of the on-board network, can serve as indicators of the technical condition of the vehicle’s ESS. The purpose of the article is to develop typical loading modes of a vehicle’s solar cell and a technique for their modeling in laboratory conditions. The leading method for solving this problem is fixing the ESS parameters using an analog data recorder with variations in the load current and the generator rotor speed. In the course of the experiment, the loading modes were changed in the order of increasing the generator rotor speed. The nature of the change in the parameters of the solar cell in the case of a working generator and a charged battery has been determined. The efficiency of the solar cell can be indirectly estimated by the ratio of the areas limited by the charging and discharging currents of the battery of the dynamic characteristic curve. With a load current of 10 A, the energy supplied by the battery generator exceeds the energy consumed for the work of consumers. When the load current increases to 15 A, the energy balance shifts towards the discharge part. The experimentally established dependences of the change in the parameters of the solar cell with variations in the load and speed modes of operation can be considered a scientific novelty. The practical significance of the research carried out is to increase the reliability of diagnosing SE based on the analysis of indicators of its technical condition. Further research will be aimed at determining changes in the parameters of the vehicle’s ESS in the process of occurrence and development of generator and battery malfunctions.</jats:p>"

Georgian agri-food products are less competitive on international markets. The country has FTAs with its partners that should make Georgian goods more competitive, at least in terms of price. Transport and logistics is one of the main parts of export, therefore, they have an impact on competitiveness of exported goods. Georgia trades with its neighbour countries, with the EU, China, etc. The EU and China represent huge markets and Georgian government targets to increase export in both directions, but there is a long distance between Georgia and its target markets, therefore it needs a developed transport and logistics system. On the other hand, portions of exported Georgian agri-food products are primary production, which have a shorter lifetime period, that’s why they should be transported in a short period of time, with specific machines. Without development of the transport system it is impossible to achieve sustainable export of agri-food products into Georgia’s target markets. Investments in the system, with tangible strategy and holistic approach can create a sustainable transport system that will increase competitiveness of Georgian agri-food products in international markets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fossil fuels, as the primary source of the energy supply in today’s global society, are being depleted much faster than expected and are raising serious environmental and social concerns for contemporary societies. To deal with issues, a global movement towards the generation of sustainable renewable energy is underway. One of the most promising sources of renewable energy alternatives is the use of municipal solid waste, as a biomass source since it does not endanger food security and considerably the biomass made by municipal solid waste will enable the appropriate management of the waste and help cities to be sustainable. The supply chain of converting the municipal solid waste to bioenergy is a challenging issue that have attracted the attention of academic and industrial research. In this direction, a three-echelon mathematical model is developed to design MSW-to-biofuel supply chain network. This supply network is a global network; hence, the international supply chain-related issues and the disruption in the raw material supply have also been studied. Identifying appropriate potential locations to site facilities is a challenge faced in the municipal solid waste-to-biofuel supply chain models. To achieve goal, in this research, the use has been made of a proposed sustainable cross-efficiency DEA model which is an effective ranking method, especially for finding potential points. To deal with sustainability, the social and environmental indicators have also been presented in the form of some criteria in this DEA method. In addition, effort has been made to improve the ecological indicators of the supply chain design in line with the sustainable development as an objective function. Finally, in order to validate the proposed model, a case study with real data is presented.</jats:p>"

Indonesia is the largest soybean market in Asia by importing as much as 67.28% or 1.96 million tons of domestic soybean needs, while the remaining 32.72% is produced through domestic soybean production. The length of the supply chain from producers to consumers causes the selling value of products to fluctuate and tends to decrease. This study aims to analyze: (1) Supply chain performance and the factors influencing the marketing channel choice of soybeans in Grobogan Regency. (2) Activities that add value carried out in the soybean supply chain and the distribution of value added of these actors in Grobogan Regency. This research was conducted in Grobogan Regency, Central Java. Primary data were collected through interview techniques using a questionnaire. The types and number of respondents consisted of 100 soybean farmers, 10 collecting traders and 3 processing industries. Analysis of the description of the soybean supply chain is carried out using the FSCN process framework. Marketing efficiency is measured from marketing margins, farmer's share analysis, profit and cost ratio.The factors that determine the choice of farmers to the supply chain used, the quantitative approach to the multinomial logit regression model, and the added value analysis used is the Hayami method. Viewed from the marketing margin, farmer's share, also the profit and cost ratio, channel four is more efficient than other channels.There are several factors that influence the decision making of soybean farmers to sell soybeans. Some of the factors are the knowledge that the farmers have, number of sales (harvest) and selling prices. All secondary soy products produced will be able to increase the income of businesses, including soybean farmers</jats:p>"

Subsequently, the authors analyze the effects of the emission reduction preferences of decision-makers on logistics network design at both the strategic and tactical levels. Moreover, the authors propose coordination mechanisms for carbon emissions and operation costs in logistics network design.

The volume of apparent losses caused by the inaccuracies of the meters was also calculated. The results of the investigation establish the sub-accounting errors and the annual degradation rate were −15 and −1.88%, respectively for consumption flows below 30 L/h represented by 23% of the subscribers. For flow rates of 120 L/h, the system accounts for a 68% consumption of subscribers and an error of −1.8% and a degradation of −0.14% were recorded. Finally, for consumption flows of 1,500 L/h, the system has accounted for 9% consumption of the subscribers; over-accounting values were obtained generating an average error of 16% and a degradation of 1.68%.

Three mathematical models considering green technology investment and two subsidy methods are constructed. It is found that government subsidies cannot ensure that enterprises reduce total carbon emissions. Compared with subsidies based on green investment costs, subsidies based on emission reduction have greater emission reductions, but the total carbon emissions are also greater.</jats:p>",

Results showed that the highest maize aboveground nitrogen content was 3.11% for FCF treatments at the seven-leaf stage. The maximum nitrogen content in the sensitive flowering stage and the maximum grain yield were also observed in W2N1 treatment with 2.27% and 12.93 ton ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. While, there were no significant differences in aboveground nitrogen content and grain yield between W2N1 and W3N1, W2N2, and W3N2. The highest amounts of nitrate leaching out of the 80-cm soil layer and nitrate runoff losses, were also recorded in FCF treatment, followed by W1N1, W2N1, and W3N1. Based on plant nitrogen content, nitrate losses and maize yield, 80% levels of the required N-fertilizer and required irrigation water could be recommended as the optimal levels to reduce nitrate losses and improve maize yield.</jats:p>",

The biggest contributors to this waste are lack of temperature controlled transport and inadequate quality of cold storage facilities for both Farmers and Food sellers i.e. retailers. What India lacks, and needs, is a well-developed, world-class cold chain infrastructure. Without it, India's problems are vast and likely to grow.

Due to the rapid development of these companies, designing an efficient clothing supply chain network can be highly beneficial, especially with the remarkable increase in demand and uncertainties in both supply and demand. In this study, a bi-objective stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed for designing the supply chain of the clothing industry. The first objective function maximizes total profit and the second one minimizes downside risk. In the presented network, the initial demand and price are uncertain and are incorporated into the model through a set of scenarios. To solve the bi-objective model, weighted normalized goal programming is applied. Besides, a real case study for the clothing industry in Iran is proposed to validate the presented model and developed method. The obtained results showed the validity and efficiency of the current study. Also, sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the effect of several important parameters, such as discount and advertisement, on the supply chain. The results indicate that considering the optimal amount for discount parameter can conceivably enhance total profit by about 20% compared to the time without this discount scheme. When the optimized parameter is taken into account for advertisement, 12% is obtained as total profit.</jats:p>"

Delivering water and sanitation services is now more critical than ever; the hygiene requirements increased water need. It is expected to grow even after the pandemic as a healthier habit that will become a routine for most of the population. In addition, economic activity is predicted to expand once the pandemic is under control. To safeguard sustainable water provision, it is critical for Jakarta to have comprehensive planning based on careful calculation of demand and supply. This is especially valid as climate change adds the pressures to water availability that have long been experienced by the capital, such as pollution, high reliance on groundwater, huge water supply from outside the region, lack of infrastructure, land subsidence, floods, and land-use change. This study aims to estimate the demand and supply for Jakarta’s water comprehensively, cover all water sources inside and outside the capital, and develop a strategy based on the analysis produced. The strategy includes the need to focus on reducing, reusing and recycling approaches to local water available in Jakarta.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution, new energy vehicle (NEV) as a environmentally‐friendly travel tool has been vigorously developed by various countries. However, in 2020, China officially enters the “postsubsidy era” in which the carbon trading scheme will replace the current fiscal and taxation system, affecting the implementation of NEV. Under the carbon trading policy, it has gradually become a major issue how NEV companies achieve production revenue coordination and carbon emission optimization decisions. This study focuses on building a multilevel supply chain for NEV production, sales, and component recycling. In addition, this study establishes a Stackelberg game model dominated by NEV manufacturers and uses contracts to coordinate the model. Results are as follows: (1) With the increasing maturity and perfection of enterprises’ carbon emission reduction technology, consumers’ demand for new energy vehicles will increase, and the effect will be more obvious when the system centralized decision‐making. (2) Since the centralized decision is aimed at the total profit of the system and has the advantage of optimal order quantity, the total benefit of the supply chain is higher than that of the decentralized decision. Moreover, if the cost coefficient of carbon emission reduction is small, the total benefit of the supply chain under the centralized decision will be more obvious. (3) From the perspective of each member of the supply chain, the profit change of the manufacturer is more sensitive to the change of order quantity compared with the cost coefficient of carbon emission reduction. When the cost of carbon emission reduction technology is too high, manufacturers may not have much incentive to carry out technological research and development and innovation, resulting in failure to achieve system optimization. (4) This study designed a revenue‐cost‐sharing contract coordination mechanism; that is, the retailer will provide part of the revenue to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer will provide recovery compensation to the recycler.</jats:p>",

We propose a model which identifies the right mix of biomass to optimize the performance of the thermochemical conversion process at the minimum cost. This is a chance‐constraint programming (CCP) model which takes into account the stochastic nature of biomass quality. The proposed CCP model ensures that process requirements, which are impacted by physical and chemical properties of biomass, are met most of the time. We consider two problem settings, a centralized and a decentralized supply chain. We propose a mixed‐integer linear program to model the blending problem in the centralized setting and a bilevel program to model the blending problem in the decentralized setting. We use the sample average approximation method to approximate the chance constraints, and propose solution algorithms to solve this approximation. We develop a case study for South Carolina using data provided by the Billion Ton Study. Based on our results, the blends identified consist mainly of pine and softwood residues. The blends identified and the suppliers selected by both models are different. The cost of the centralized supply chain is 2%–6% lower. The implications of these results are twofold. First, these results could lead to improved collaborations in the supply chain. Second, these results provide an estimate of the approximation error from assuming centralized decision making in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Hence, the present study was conducted with the objectives of identifying potential environmental risks of different stages of the development of a new water supply scheme located in the wet zone of Sri Lanka, and categorizing identified impacts based on their significance. A rapid environmental assessment (REA) was followed to identify the upstream point source pollution and downstream water uses in the immediate catchment. Subsequently, a semi quantitative approach was conducted to screen the environmental, social, and economic risks concerning likelihood and sensitivity of the impact. Besides, an analysis of physico-chemical and biological parameters of water quality was conducted in the intake location. The semi quantitative method highlighted that low and medium risk with ecological impacts (50%), low risks towards sustainability of water source (75%), medium level constructional impacts (60%), and very high-level impacts at the operational stage were available (50%). A water quality monitoring program revealed that Escherichia coli count, total coliform bacterial count, and colour of the water were above the standard limits in the nearby freshwater source. In conclusion, a similar approach can be implemented worldwide as a reference to determine the potential socio-environmental consequences in water supply projects to minimize the adverse impacts. Through this study, sustainable mitigation measures were proposed accordingly to prevent the impacts and to strengthen the long-term viability of the new Rural Water Supply Scheme.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background: Injuries are a major public health problem globally. With sound planning and organization, essential trauma care can be reliably provided with relatively low-cost equipment and supplies. However, availability of these resources requires an effective and efficient supply chain and good stock management practices. Therefore, this study aimed to assess trauma care resource-related supply management structures and processes at health facilities in Ghana. By doing so, the findings may allow us to identify specific structures and processes that could be improved to facilitate higher quality and more timely care. Methods: Ten hospitals were purposively selected using results from a previously performed national trauma care capacity assessment of hospitals of all levels in Ghana. Five hospitals with low resource availability and 5 hospitals with high resource availability were assessed using the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool and stock ledger review. Data were described and stock management practices were correlated with resource availability. Results: There were differences in stock management practices between low and high resource availability hospitals, including frequency of reporting and audit, number of stock-outs on day of assessment (median 9 vs 2 stock-outs, range 3 – 57 vs 0 – 9 stock-outs, respectively; p=0.05), duration of stock-outs (median 171 vs 8 days, range 51 – 1,268 vs 0 – 182 days, respectively; p=0.02), and fewer of up-to-date stock cards (24 vs 31 up-to-date stock cards, respectively; p=0.07). Stock-outs were common even among low-cost, essential resources (e.g., nasal cannulas and oxygen masks, endotracheal tubes, syringes, sutures, sterile gloves). Increased adherence to stock management guidelines and higher percentage of up-to-date stock cards were correlated with higher trauma resource availability scores. However, the variance in trauma resource availability scores was poorly explained by these individual factors or when analyzed in a multivariate regression model (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>=0.72; p value for each covariate between 0.17 – 0.34). Conclusions: Good supply chain and stock management practices are correlated with high trauma care resource availability. The findings from this study demonstrate several opportunities to improve stock management practices, particularly at low resource availability hospitals.</jats:p>"

With sound planning and organization, essential trauma care can be reliably provided with relatively low-cost equipment and supplies. However, availability of these resources requires an effective and efficient supply chain and good stock management practices. Therefore, we study aimed to assess trauma care resource-related supply management structures and processes at health facilities in Ghana. By doing so, the findings may allow us to identify specific structures and processes that could be improved to facilitate higher quality and more timely care. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Ten hospitals were purposively selected using results from a previously performed national trauma care capacity assessment of hospitals of all levels in Ghana. Five hospitals with low resource availability and 5 hospitals with high resource availability were assessed using the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool and stock ledger review. Data were described and stock management practices were correlated with resource availability. <jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>There were differences in stock management practices between low and high resource availability hospitals, including frequency of reporting and audit, number of stock-outs on day of assessment (median 9 vs 2 stock-outs, range 3 – 57 vs 0 – 9 stock-outs, respectively; p=0.05), duration of stock-outs (median 171 vs 8 days, range 51 – 1,268 vs 0 – 182 days, respectively; p=0.02), and fewer of up-to-date stock cards (24 vs 31 up-to-date stock cards, respectively; p=0.07). Stock-outs were common even among low-cost, essential resources (e.g., nasal cannulas and oxygen masks, endotracheal tubes, syringes, sutures, sterile gloves). Increased adherence to stock management guidelines and higher percentage of up-to-date stock cards were correlated with higher trauma resource availability scores. However, the variance in trauma resource availability scores was poorly explained by these individual factors or when analyzed in a multivariate regression model (r 2 =0.72; p value for each covariate between 0.17 – 0.34). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Good supply chain and stock management practices are correlated with high trauma care resource availability. The findings from this study demonstrate several opportunities to improve stock management practices, particularly at low resource availability hospitals.</jats:p>"

In the model, 35 percent of male and 18 percent of female permanent wage shocks pass through to consumption, compared to the empirical estimates of 32 percent and 19 percent. Most of the consumption insurance against permanent male wage shocks is provided through the presence and labor supply response of the female earner. Abstracting from this private intrahousehold income insurance mechanism strongly biases upward the welfare losses from idiosyncratic wage risk as well as the desired extent of public insurance through progressive income taxation. Relative to the standard one-earner life cycle model, the optimal degree of tax progressivity is significantly lower and the welfare gains from implementing the optimal system are cut roughly in half.

The study followed an interpretivist approach based on qualitative design using 30 non-directive and semi-structured interviews from the various stakeholders of SME. Results reveal the financial, technological, educational, organizational, banking, and suppliers' challenges in the adoption of e-procurement system. Findings emerged with various themes such as limited financial budget and support, high cybercrime rate and lower level of privacy, lack of e-commerce educational programs, and lower level of learning opportunities. Top management must address employee, financial, organizational, and educational challenges before adoption of e-procurement system in SME.</p>",

A manufacturer and a retailer are involved in our discussion. The definition of a reasonable price is given based on the practical requirement. First, we construct a Stackelberg model in which the manufacturer and the retailer make their decisions respectively. During the process of derivation, both ordering time-points and optimal prices are expressed as functions of number of times of ordering. By solving a quadratic programming model with an undetermined parameter, we demonstrate that the optimal ordering time-points of the retailer are equidistant time points on the given selling period. Second, a cooperative model is developed in which the manufacturer and the retailer jointly make decisions. It is shown that the optimal retail price is lower and the number of times of ordering is more in the cooperative situation than the noncooperative one. Further, an allocation method based on revenue proportions is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The detrimental impacts of the compound crises on the FSC are explored and the effects of the affected areas are estimated under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. As a response to the disruption caused by the crisis in FSCs, reactive and proactive solutions are proposed to develop resilience at the food sector level. In the short term, the reactive solutions, consisting of smoothing the food demand, supply and delivery, and food production and processing, can be borrowed. In the long term, the proactive solutions can be conducted by developing multi-level short intertwined FSCs. Our comprehensive investigation of the resilience elements in diverse operations and potential strategies should contribute to the improvement of FSC resilience in the face of ongoing and growing threats.</jats:p>"

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied to analyze the data collected from experienced customers in online shopping in Vietnam from November 2018 to March 2019. The results of statistical analysis indicate that interactive fairness, outcome fairness, procedural fairness significantly impact on customer satisfaction which then increases customer loyalty. This study suggests that customer’s ability to locate and interact with technical support on a website and how a company treats the customer would significantly decide satisfaction and loyalty from customer. E-retailers in developing economies should consider service recovery process as the opportunity to gain customers’ purchase intentions.</jats:p>"

To deal with\nthis threat, adaptation of drinking water supply systems is imperative, not\nonly on a global and national scale but particularly on a local scale. This investigation sought to establish characteristics that describe the\nsustainability of local drinking water supply. The hypothesis of this\nresearch was that sustainability characteristics depend on the context that\nis analysed, and therefore, a variety of cases must be analysed to reach a\nbetter understanding of the sustainability of drinking water supply in the\nNetherlands. Therefore, three divergent cases on drinking water supply in\nthe Netherlands were analysed. One case related to a short-term development\n(2018 summer drought), and two concerned long-term phenomena (changes in\nwater quality and growth in drinking water demand). We used an integrated\nsystems approach, describing the local drinking water supply system in terms of hydrological, technical, and socio-economic characteristics that\ndetermine the sustainability of a local drinking water supply system. To\ngain a perspective on the case study findings that are broader than the Dutch context, the sustainability aspects identified were paired with global aspects concerning sustainable drinking water supply. This resulted in the following set of hydrological, technical, and socio-economic sustainability characteristics: (1) water quality, water resource availability, and impact of drinking water abstraction; (2) reliability and resilience of the technical system and energy use and environmental impact; (3) drinking water availability, water governance, and land and water use. Elaboration of these sustainability characteristics and criteria into a sustainability assessment can provide information on the challenges and trade-offs inherent in the sustainable development and management of a local drinking water supply system.\n                    </jats:p>"

We use a saturated treatment function to model the effect of delayed treatment. We prove that there exist one disease free equilibrium and at most two endemic equilibrium solutions. A backward bifurcation occurs for small values of delay constant such that two endemic equilibriums exist if Rt (R*t,1); where, Rt is the treatment reproduction number and R*t is a threshold such that the disease dies out if and persists in the population if Rt &gt; R*t. However, when a backward bifurcation occurs, a disease free system may easily be shifted to an epidemic. The bifurcation turns forward when the delay constant increases; thus, the disease free equilibrium becomes globally asymptotically stable if Rt &lt; 1, and there exist unique and globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium if Rt &gt; 1. However, the amount of maximal medical resource required to control the disease increases as the value of the delay constant increases. Thus, antibiotic treatment with limited medical supply setting would not successfully control CBPP unless we avoid any delayed treatment, improve the efficacy and availability of medical resources or it is given along with vaccination.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, at present, factors such as the reduction of natural resources, the search for competitive advantages, government laws and global agreements, have generated a greater interest in the sustainable development, which, in order to achieve it, industries need to rethink and plan their supply chain considering a path of sustainability. So sustainable supply chain management emerges as a means to integrate stakeholders' concern for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements, attracting significant interest among managers, researchers and practitioners. The main objective of this study is to provide a synthesis of the key elements of the quantitative model offerings that use sustainability indicators in the design and management of forward supply chains. To achieve this objective, we developed a systematic literature review that includes seventy articles published during the last decade in peer-reviewed journals in English language. In addition a 4 W's analysis (When, Who, What, and Where) is applied and three structural dimensions are defined and grouped by categories: Supply chain management, modeling and sustainability. As part of the results we evidenced a continuous growth in the scientific production of this type of articles, with a predominance of deterministic mathematical programming models with an environmental economic perspective. Finally, we identified research gaps, highlighting the lack of integral inclusion of a life cycle analysis in the design of supply chain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

A structured and closed- ended questionnaire was used to collect primary data, administered by drop and pick a method. Total of (72) strategic managers drawn from the nine manufacturing firms were involved in the study. Data collected was quantitatively scrutinized based on research objectives and presented in form of tables and charts for interpretation. The data was then be analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics supported by the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 22. Regression analysis was done to ascertain the effect of strategic outsourcing approaches on performance. The response rate of the study was 92%.Results and conclusion: The findings of the study showed that strategic professional outsourcing, strategic manufacturing outsourcing, strategic business process outsourcing and strategic project outsourcing have a positive relationship with performance of performance of the manufacturing companies listed at the Nairobi Security Exchange. The results of the regression analysis revealed there is a significant positive relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. The independent variables reported R-value of .805 indicating that there is a perfect relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.647 means that 64.7% of the corresponding variation in performance of manufacturing companies listed at the Nairobi Security Exchange can be explained or predicted by (strategic professional outsourcing, strategic manufacturing outsourcing, strategic business process outsourcing and strategic project outsourcing) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of the regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 0.647), p=0.000 &lt;0.05).Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Finally, the study commends that manufacturing companies listed at the Nairobi Security Exchange embrace the various strategic outsourcing approaches as a way to improve their performance. Equally, the study recommends similar studies be carried out in other industries across the country and in abroad to ascertain if the same results can be obtained and generalized.</jats:p>"

Still, each company or institution bases its vision and strategic progress on certain assumptions for the future. In order to prepare for various developments of the future, it is reasonable to consider different possible scenarios while building a future vision. Thus, this chapter focuses on the methodological approach for the generation of future scenarios showing what the surroundings for supply chains might be like in a time horizon until 2030. This integrates various political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental influences and changes. The methodological framework required for generating scenarios is set by a combination of quantitative and qualitative scenario planning methodologies. Close coordination and collaboration between production and logistics guides the underlying scenario design to focus the context on supply chains. While considering trends described in Kalaitzi et al. 2020, this approach results in a set of macro scenarios, each describing a possible future development until 2030. The macro scenarios range from scenarios with progressive developments to regressing or stagnating evolutions.</jats:p>"

The results generated by structural equations show that specific relationships have p &lt; 0.05, i.e. all the proposed hypotheses are accepted in the proposed correlation between internal marketing and the three types of organizational commitment, among them the affective commitment, which generates emotional ties between the employee and the organization, feeling proud to remain in the same linking the values and objectives of the same as their own goals, the commitment of permanence, which implies the risks involved in separating from the organization as well as the loss of all the benefits obtained and how these would be difficult to obtain if the employee were to leave the organization. Finally, the normative commitment, which arises when the employee perceives some kind of opportunity or special benefit in the organization, thus generating a bond of moral reciprocity, i.e. a bond of loyalty. The conclusion of the study is that the use of internal marketing for personnel selection is a fundamental tool for achieving acceptable levels of the three types of commitment mentioned above.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Coronovirus disease(COVID-19)rapidly spread worldwide after its first report in December 2019,in China.This spread drastically reduced the number of blood donations,thereby creating a shortage at blood banks in the whole world.Turkish Red Crescent(TRC) is the only legal authority that organizes collection,production,storage and distribution of blood and blood components in Turkey.Only in case of emergencyTRC gives permanent permission to hospitals;for collecting blood and producing its components through their own transfusion centers.This report describes how theCOVID-19 impacted blood supplies ofTRC and hospital demands in Turkey with an aim to improve the management of blood supply and demand during theCOVID-19 and future pandemics. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of nine months;from November 1,2019 to July 31,2020.Data were retrospectively obtained from donor attendance and blood inventory records ofTRC and included;1)the number of donated units of apheresis platelet concentrates(APC) and blood toTRC,2)the number of units ofAPC and erythrocyte suspensions(ES) supplied by the hospitals themselves,3)the number of units of APC andES supplied to hospitals by TRC(APCHandESH).The periods before(first period) and after(third period)arrival of COVID-19 to Turkey are compared. RESULTS: An increase of 52%in the number of APCdonations,but a decrease of 22% in the number of blood donations(NBD) were detected in the third period compared to the first one.Mean APCH were 7081±550 and5121±255 units in the first and third periods,respectively.The mean ESH in the first period was 873±326 units,while it was3694±3143 units in the third period. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It is obvious that we have learnt many lessons from theCOVID-19 pandemic,like how to face challenges in maintaining the balance between blood demandandblood supply.Utilizing media to encourage donors and implementation of PatientBloodManagement on national and institutional levels may be some some of the key components of a comprehensive strategy.The collaboration ofMinistry of Health,TRC and hospitalswassuccessful in securing a balance between blood supply and demand in Turkey,which COVID-19 pandemic impacted significantly.</jats:p>"

Herein, we suggest an approach to optimize SCM using retail analysis techniques. As one of the most well-known artificial intelligences (AI) approaches and machine learning (ML) applications in SCM are the main goals of this study. By constructing conceptual framework, data analytics, ML, and optimization techniques are integrated to generate Intelligent Support Techniques (ISTs) for analyzing SC data and identify opportunities for improvement. We apply retail analysis techniques such as demand forecasting, inventory management, and assortment planning to optimize supply chain operations. The efficiency of our ISTs verified through employing it in a real-world case study of a large retail chain. Our results show that the suggested ISTs can lead to significant improvements in supply chain performance, including increased sales, reduced inventory costs, and improved customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

The use of mathematical models should help reveal the patterns of rescue units actions on improving the principles of their application, methods of fulfilling their support tasks. Analytical models make it possible to establish formula dependence between the conditions of the situation, the elements of the decision to be made and the effectiveness of the task performance according to the selected criterion. Statistical methods make it possible to more fully take into account the probabilistic nature of the simulated processes and they are most effective in cases when the analytical description of the simulated process presents great difficulties, or it is practically impossible due to significant uncertainty of the initial information. The best results can be obtained with the combined use of analytical and statistical models: the analytical model allows approximately figuring out the basic laws of the phenomenon, outlining its contours, and any further clarification can be obtained by statistical modeling. Therefore, the article discusses the use of the statistical test method for organizing implementation of first priority engineering tasks performed by rescue units.

The results of the numerical analysis and simulations, conducted using MATLAB, indicate that both the manufacturer and the retailer increase their inventories and that their profits decrease when demand uncertainty increases.

BS concentrations were detected in many water resources, ranging from 10 ng L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 300 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, so that various purification techniques have been sought to remove BS. This study investigated the performance of ozonation and ferrate oxidation in the degradation of BS since they are both promising oxidants with high redox potential among water treatment chemicals. It was observed that both ozone and ferrate can achieve over 99% of BS concentration reduction and up to 22.5% of DOC reduction for dosing 0.036 mM of either ferrate or ozone. The <jats:italic>vibrio fisheri</jats:italic> toxicity exhibited a decline in the treated samples after ozonation or ferrate oxidation. According to the mass spectra analyzed, the degradation pathways were proposed and oxidation products (OPs) were identified. BS degradation by ozonation and ferrate oxidation followed a similar route and four common OPs (OP-249; OP-497-a; OP-497-b, and OP-201) were detected. While ferrate treatment produced one more intermediate (OP-217), ozonation did not, which is attributed to the intensified decomposition of BS by ozonation. The major impact of this study is that ferrate treatment is comparable to the ozonation in removing BS, and further research continuing from this study is necessary to explore the BS removal in various waters with more complex matrixes (e.g., high natural organic matter contents), to investigate BS degradation mechanisms in depth, and to conduct pilot-scale and full-scale trials to establish operational database in running ferrate oxidation and/or ozonation for the treatment of BS in practical world.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cultivation of agricultural crops in winter season is carried out in special greenhouses. For heating greenhouses, a huge amount of heat energy is consumed. In the conditions of Turkmenistan, up to 1500 tons of standard fuel per year is consumed to heat the greenhouse with an area 1 hectare. The increase in heating costs leads to an increase in the prices of grown products. Therefore, saving fuel energy in the greenhouses is one of the most important economic factors. Possibilities of using the heat of the combustion products of steam boilers at the Mary State Electric Power Station (Turkmenistan) for heating greenhouses are discussed in the article. For this purpose, a special contact heat exchanger is installed on the line of the outgoing combustion products of steam boilers. In the experimental facilities, water is injected from top to bottom, and combustion products move in the opposite direction. In this case, the temperature of the combustion products decreases from 120-150 °C to 30-40 °C. The temperature of the cooling water of the combustion products rises from 10-20 °C to 40-45 °C. To increase the contact surface of water and gas in a contact heat exchanger, spray-type layer conductor is used. A distinctive feature of the experimental facility is the use of local materials as a spray-type layer with a conductor. For subsoil heating of greenhouses, water is supplied with the temperature of 40 °C, and for the raise of the vegetables grown in them water is supplied with the temperature of 22-25 °C. The use of the heat of combustion products to heat greenhouses is of great importance both for saving fuel and for purifying the environment from harmful emissions.</jats:p>"

Both sides were very preoccupied with finding a way to win them over or force them to give the surplus to one or the other. Unwillingness to cooperate with the state authorities and partisans put the peasant’s both life and property in danger. Sowing, harvesting and other agricultural work were often only possible with an armed escort. The wheat harvests in the Slavonian and Srijem fields in 1942, 1943 and 1944 was followed by the destruction of crops, i.e. burning of wheat and the destruction of threshers. Despite such conditions, the local population managed to meet their needs, and therefore there was no famine. Due to the destruction of transport infrastructure and means of transport, in attacks by partisans and later by the Western Allies’ air force, it was difficult to transport the collected food. The population of Slavonian cities, especially workers and low-income civil servants, were in a difficult position due to irregular and scarce supplies in approvisations; and therefore, they were forced to purchase the basic foodstuffs on the “black market” at extremely high prices. The daily life became even more difficult in 1944 due to air strikes by the Western Allies and the Red Army air force. The paper gives a brief overview of these issue in the cities, mostly with examples from Brod na Savi / Slavonski Brod, and as for rural areas, mostly with examples from the mountain areas and to a lesser ex-tent from the plains, eastern Slavonia and Srijem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The African sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus Burchell, 1822 is the second most farmed fish species in Senegal due to its high fecundity, good growth performance and tolerance of a wide range environmental condition. Despite its economic importance, much remains to be done to improve the production of the species under controlled conditions. The main objective of this study was to implement a suitable method for seed production to meet the increasing demand for fish through the induction of C. gariepinus spawning by hormonal injection using ovaprim and pituitary gland extracts of C. gariepinus. The experiments were independently conducted in three different locations in Senegal: National Aquaculture Agency (ANA) hatchery (Kolda, Kolda), the National Agency for Agricultural Integration and Development (ANIDA) fish farm (Maraye village, Dagana, Saint-Louis) and SENAQUA farm (Tille Bobou, Khombol, Thiès). The results of hormonal induction with ovaprim (dose: 0.5ml/kg of female body weight) stimulated evolution, with 122,500, 150,000 and 15,000 eggs for the ANA, ANIDA and SENAQUA experiments, respectively. The induction with pituitary gland extracts did not, however, provoke female ovulation, probably due to the low dose of hormone contained in these extracts. The hatching rate of the three localities was 60% (73,500 larvae), 30% (45,000 larvae) and 48% (72,000 larvae), respectively. An average growth of 0.25cm/d was recorded for the ANA larvae that were fed exclusively with zooplankton from the third day after hatching, with an alternation    of artificial food and zooplankton on the sixth day and with artificial food only on the fourteenth day. However the larvae in this locality had a very high mortality rate of 95%. The mortality rate was also extremely high at ANIDA (96%) where larvae were fed with artemia the second day after hatching throughout the first week, and at SENAQUA farm (98%) where larvae were exclusively fed with dry artificial food (exogenous) from the third day, which corresponds to the resorption of the yolk sac. The high larval mortalities recorded in this study may be due the diet and/or poor water quality in the rearing tanks. These parameters are crucial for the success of larval breeding of C. gariepinus. Based   on these results, we suggest increasing by 2 to 3 pituitaries/female and see the effect of this increase on C. gariepinus ovulation.We therefore recommend monitoring breeding conditions after hatching and feeding the larvae with an appropriate diet, preferentially with live food to obtain a better yield, which could help improve production and open other perspectives for the development of aquaculture in Senegal.</jats:p>"

If a correct sustainable logistics is carried out, it would favor the reincorporation of waste into new supply chains. </jats:p>"

In this paper, the noncooperative game, farmer–broker cooperative game, and broker–biomass power plant cooperative game, under government incentives, are constructed and analyzed. The optimal decision strategies and profits for these three cases are obtained, while numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are conducted, aiming at illustrating some specific features of the games. It is shown that the government plays a critical role in the development of utilizing agribiomass for power generation and can work better in cooperative games. In addition, both agribiomass supply quantity and profits of supply chain members are higher in cooperative than in noncooperative game. Meanwhile, farmers can get the maximum profit in the broker–biomass power plant cooperative game, while biomass power plant makes the maximum profit in the farmer–broker cooperative game. To guide the healthy development of the industry, there is an urgent need for further exploration of the biomass supply chain management and coordination issue. Specifically, the cooperative game for establishing optimal feedstock price subsidy policy will be done by way of adjusting government incentives and alliance profit distribution.</jats:p>"

It has been noted that the use of such devices is particularly effective in areas far from centralized power supply, where power supply is not available or where reliability is low. An experimental model of a mechanical energy storage device using an elastic cord braid in a storage system and some equations for its design are given. The possibility and necessity of using this storage system is highly valued in our country. Despite the low power of the original model of the device, it is possible to achieve high results in the future by conducting research in this area and changing the type and composition of the elastic cord.

The increase in number and scales of emergencies consequences, the complexity of the tasks for the solution of which rescue units must be ready requires predicting the results of planned actions and applying mathematical modeling methods to substantiate decisions. The use of mathematical models should help reveal the patterns of rescue units actions on improving the principles of their application, methods of fulfilling their support tasks. Analytical models make it possible to establish formula dependence between the conditions of the situation, the elements of the decision to be made and the effectiveness of the task performance according to the selected criterion. Statistical methods make it possible to more fully take into account the probabilistic nature of the simulated processes and they are most effective in cases when the analytical description of the simulated process presents great difficulties, or it is practically impossible due to significant uncertainty of the initial information. The best results can be obtained with the combined use of analytical and statistical models: the analytical model allows approximately figuring out the basic laws of the phenomenon, outlining its contours, and any further clarification can be obtained by statistical modeling. Therefore, the article discusses the use of the statistical test method for organizing implementation of first priority engineering tasks performed by rescue units. Methods. To obtain the results general scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge including analysis, synthesis, generalization were used; they were based on the provisions of systems theory, operations research, information theory and the method of statistical tests.  Findings. A scientific and methodological approach is developed to improve the effectiveness of emergency rescue units use in the emergency area on the example of their equipping a field water supply point.  Research application field. The results are applicable to substantiate a set of means for performing tasks and operations by rescue teams.  Conclusions. The developed scientific and methodological approach makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of organizing the tasks performance in the emergency area by emergency rescue teams in general, and, in particular, equipping the field water supply point, and it also serves as a basis for improving the work of management bodies at all levels.</jats:p>"

And on this basis, it broadens the whole logistics process of warehousing and distribution and designs a framework of intelligent logistics supply chain management system with wireless sensor network and RFID technology to realize the management process of logistics main business. For the problems of complicated hardware wiring, the excessive number of positioning nodes and low effective coverage rate of traditional RFID‐based positioning methods in large‐scale warehousing environment, the integrated RFID and wireless sensor network fusion technology constructs a new movable anchor node, divides the nodes in the traditional positioning process into fixed anchors and mobile anchors, proposes a secondary positioning method, improves positioning accuracy and effective coverage rate, and provides a new positioning method for large‐scale storage environment. For the transportation of goods in transit, especially precious and dangerous goods, a six‐axis acceleration sensor‐based method for detecting the behavioral attitude of goods in transit is proposed. Time window slicing of cargo motion data stream is performed to reduce data processing and based on the statistical features of a large amount of experimental data, and feature vectors and classifiers are analyzed and designed to achieve behavioral attitude classification of goods in transit. The experiment proves that this method has high recognition accuracy and has certain practical application value. Finally, the whole storage and distribution logistics process is integrated, the framework of intelligent logistics supply chain management system combining WSN and RFID is built based on wireless sensor network software and hardware platform, and the detailed design of logistics supply chain management system business process is mainly carried out. Combined with the two key methods proposed in this paper, the information management process of traditional logistics business such as access, storage positioning and monitoring, and distribution monitoring and management is realized, and the management system is tested on this basis. The testing effect proves that this system has certain deployment reference significance and practical application value and to a certain extent can help improve the intelligence level of logistics supply chain management and achieve the expected goal of this study.</jats:p>",

The author finds no discernible evidence of the labor supply impact of the ACA dependent coverage mandate during the first three years after its implementation (2011–2013), despite its substantial impact on health insurance coverage for the eligible young adults.

Using a case study methodology together with a review of the existing literature the authors describe the main facets of shared information - which influence the information utilization in a supply chain - and propose a mapping notation for how these facets can be visualized together with a supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. Information utilization is especially important because more information sharing does not necessarily result in a better supply chain performance unless the shared information is effectively used in the relevant processes in the chain and well-aligned with the requirements for those processes. The proposed notation provides a systematic structure for mapping the information flows, their specific facets, and helps clarify what information is available and how this information can be utilized in different supply chain processes. Four facets of information sharing are identified and elaborated for food supply chains, together with a mapping tool that emphasizes the information flows and the utilization of information in supply chains. </jats:p>"

On the whole, the demand for language service talents is in urgent with the foreign tourism market’s high-speed expansion; the demand for multi-lingual language talents in the foreign tourism industry of China has been increasing, including the talents of Chinese itself as a foreign language; and the talents with combined skills of <jats:italic>Language + Tourism + X</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>Tourism + Language + X</jats:italic> are in short. In order to meet the demand of foreign tourism market of China for language service talents, the supply-and-demand mechanism should be firstly clarified and then integrate the following docking paths between the language talent’s supply and demand. Firstly, the government should offer its policy support and make an overall planning for the cultivation of language service talents; secondly, colleges and universities at different levels should be demand-oriented to strengthen the cultivation of different types of language service talents; thirdly, foreign tourism industry and its industrial enterprises should strengthen their own ability of language talent cultivation and also their ability of serving colleges and universities supplying language talents. It is necessary to establish a Cooperation Steering Committee of industry, universities and colleges, research centers, enterprise, and the government, so as to realize the seamless connection between the talent cultivation of colleges and universities and the talent demand of enterprises.</jats:p>"

To identify critically important facilities of the fuel and energy complex based on its operation models derived as a result of stage-by-stage sectoral and general energy studies, a methodology is proposed. It is based on the identification methods of critically important industry facilities on the principles of assessing vulnerability of critically important infrastructure elements. The presented methodology is characterized by the complex and flexible assessment of the critical importance of sectoral facilities, which is carried out on the basis of scenario options of fuel and ener gyomplex operation. The methodology is supplemented with a formalized representation of a typical general energy optimization model, which unifies the relationship between the territorial-production structure of the sectoral systems modeled in it, its information base with the corresponding technical and economic indicators, and the research problems solved with its help. The assessment of the critical importance of gas industry facilities is given for 80 constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The approbation results of the proposed methodology are given on the example of the identification of the critically important gas industry facilities using a model of fuel and energy complex operation with a detailed scheme of the Unified Gas Supply System of Russia. The approbation has revealed the differences in the priority of critically important facilities of the gas industry and the fuel and energy complex. It has also shown a significant influence of the system effect of the mutually coordinated functioning of industries on the fuel and energy supply of consumers. The results obtained confirm the efficiency of the methodology, prove the possibility of its use for assessing the critical importance of power industry branch facilities. The research scheme implemented in the methodology allows to obtain an adequate state of matters with the fuel and energy supply to consumers under cut-out critically important sectoral facilities.</jats:p>"

Second, a nine-level hierarchical structure is determined based on Interpretive Structural Modelling to demonstrate the complex interrelationships among obstacle factors. Finally, thirteen obstacles are categorized regarding the driving and dependence power by employing Matrix Impact of Cross Multiplication Applied to Classification approach. The results indicate a lack of digital culture being the most important obstacle hindering DT, followed by lack of support and commitment from top management and lack of risk taking initiative.

This study finds that modularity facilitates the understanding of the dynamics of commoditization and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, modularization drives the asymmetric distribution of information in a multi-tier supply chain. Finally, digital technologies can offer strategic opportunities for targeting different stages of the value chain. Component suppliers should evaluate the criticality of products in new business models and advanced services to reduce the complexity of the landscape of strategic options and, thus, reduce wrong decisions. Managers should encourage general information sharing and open data exchange in a multi-tier supply chain. They should focus on vertical and horizontal partnerships and collaborations to foster the benefits of digital technologies. Conclusively, component suppliers should cooperate to build a counterweight to original equipment manufacturers in the vertical partnership. This study is the first to integrate the benefits of commodities and digital technologies in a strategic framework. It contributes to the literature on competition in the background of commoditization by outlining the concept of information asymmetry within a multi-tier supply chain driven by modularity. Thus, it advances the literature on digital technology and commoditization.</jats:p>"

Drawing on a systematic analysis of the major transnational corporations trading cocoa, coffee, and palm oil, we present advantages and potential pitfalls of relying on traders as implementers of sustainability governance and outline a future research agenda that focuses on producer‐level impacts, changes in supply chain organization and power dynamics, and traders' interactions with state and other nonstate actors. At the intersection of supply chain management, political economy, geography, and global governance, research on traders as key sustainability governance actors also provides novel opportunities for interdisciplinary work and stakeholder engagement.</jats:p>",

This technology replaces the coal-fired hot blast stove, realizes “coal and CBM mining and sharing” in the coal mine, and constructs a virtuous cycle development of “promoting drainage by using and promoting safety by drainage”. The research shows that: the scheme improves the utilization rate of CBM in the mining area, cancels the consumption of coal combustion, and can use 2.59 million Nm3 of pure CBM every year, generating 1.95 million yuan of economic benefits. And the emissions reduction of CO2 equivalent is 36000 tons. The benefits of safety, economy and environmental protection are remarkable. This technology is especially suitable for the utilization of ultra-low concentration CBM whose concentration is less than 8%, which has practical significance to improve the CBM utilization rate and promote the realization of the goal of “zero emission”.</jats:p>"

More precisely, this article examines whether SSM practices have an affect on SP, and this relation is mediated by supply chain risk management (SCRM) and network capability (NC), and moderated by firm size. We collected data from 436 supply management professionals through a survey instrument from six manufacturing and logistics companies in China. The hypothesized direct and indirect linkages were tested through structural equation modeling. Our findings highlight that SSM practices positively affect SCRM, NC, and SP. The link between SSM practices and SP is mediated by SCRM and NC. The results indicate that firm size moderate the hypothesized relationships differentially based on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) versus large enterprises. Our study is novel in establishing empirically how SSM practices influence SP as an integrative model bringing together firm size, SCRM, and NC. Our empirical results have critical implications for both supply chain management literature and supply management professionals. </jats:p>",

However, there is a lack of attention paid to how environmental strategy plays a mediating role in this relationship. In addition, the environmental research in the context of third-party logistics service providers seems to be underexplored. Thus, through the theoretical lens of institutional theory and contingency theory, this study examines the mediating role of environmental strategy on the relationship command and control environmental regulation and environmental performance. Data were collected from small and medium enterprises operating in the logistics industry of Vietnam and partial least square structural equation modeling was employed to examine the proposed hypotheses. The result indicates the full mediating effects of environmental strategy on the link between command and control environmental regulation and environmental performance. In this regard, this study contributes to growing empirical evidence showing that the link between environmental regulation and environmental performance is indirect through mediators. Besides, this study also extends the current knowledge of environmental strategy pursued by third-party logistics providers.</jats:p>"

The main problem here lies in the fact that the control systems of such gas turbine plants are transferred practically unchanged from their aviation counterparts. This situation leads to inefficient operation of the gas turbine power plant, which affects the quality of electricity generation. To solve this problem, it is necessary to improve the control algorithms for the automatic control systems of gas turbine plants. When solving this problem, gas turbine plants should be considered in interaction with other subsystems and units; for gas turbine power plants, this is, first of all, an electric generator and the electric power system as a whole. Setting up a control system is one of the most costly stages of their production, both in terms of finance and time. Especially time-consuming operations are non-automated manual configuration management system for developmental and operational testing. Therefore, it is proposed to use a software-modeling complex, on the basis of which it is possible to obtain a neural network mathematical model of a gas turbine power plant and conduct its tests.</jats:p>"

We investigate their impacts on supply chain coordination under the assumption that the product demand is affected by the selling price, promotional effort and inventory level. We first propose two algorithms for determining optimal solutions of the centralized and decentralized models. We show that the decentralized system can be coordinated perfectly with a two-part tariff contract. Further, we study necessary conditions under which members of the supply chain can accept this contract. At last, we conduct numerical experiment to illustrate the obtained theoretical results in impact analysis and the robustness of the coordinated model.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

We show that whether the retailer considers merging with only one supplier depends upon the revenue sharing ratio and the additional administrative costs of the revenue sharing contract. Meanwhile, the supplier who drops out of the market may adopt a hybrid financing scheme by combining bank credit with equity financing to return to the market. We find that the deselected supplier can be allowed to participate in the market when the bank loans ratio is below a certain threshold. We further investigate the impact of the bank loans ratio and competition intensity on the players' decisions and profits. In addition, we find that there exists an optimal bank loans ratio for the deselected supplier. Specifically, it is optimal for the deselected supplier to adopt pure bank credit if the production cost is sufficiently low.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Parking management has always been a major concern for universities and other activity centers. Nowadays, many universities are suffering from a lack of campus parking capacity. To tackle this problem, it is necessary to take parking lots assignment into consideration, regarding intercampus users’ needs. These users have different ages, physical characteristics, expectations, and administrative positions that should be considered before any parking assignment. Here, a new method is proposed to optimize parking lots management for those universities where staff (academic and administrative), in contrast to students, are allowed to park inside the campus area. For this purpose, first, the probability of using a specific parking lot by each group is determined. For staff, this is done based on their choices, revealed by the relative frequency of using parking lots. This probability for students can be calculated using a fuzzy inference system model. To develop the model, a survey is conducted to extract students’ preferences, regarding parking spaces assignment inside the campus area. Afterward, an integer linear programming model with the objective function of maximizing parking probability is employed, considering several related constraints. The proposed model is applied to Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK), Iran, as the case study. According to the results, it can be concluded that the proposed method can help to reduce wandering time of finding an appropriate parking space for both staff and students. In addition, the proposed application can help increase the satisfaction level of staff and students with regard to parking management.</jats:p>",

From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit drugs are analysed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The block chain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a block chain based drug supply chain management. Our proposed system block chain-based drug supply chain management for consumers. In this drug supply chain management the system is deployed using Hyper ledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system.</jats:p>",

Thus, this study was aimed to examine water storage strategies practiced by farmers for small-scale irrigation systems in East Hararghe zone, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 300 irrigation user households using an interview schedule. Collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate probit (MVP) model. The research findings revealed that about 62.67, 54.33, 20.33 and 17.67% of households have used borehole, shallow wells, hand-dug, and farm pond water storage practices for small-scale irrigation, respectively. The finding of the MVP model showed that the choice of using borehole water storage practices affected by education level and frequency of extension contacts. The choice of shallow wells to store water was influenced by livestock size, participation in non-farm activities, and the use of the improved seed. Furthermore, the choice of using hand-dug is affected by household size, farm size, access to training, external support, and weather information. Finally, the size of livestock ownership influenced the choice of ponds for small-scale irrigation. Therefore, various stakeholders should work to enhance the water storage capacity of the farmers by reducing the hindrances and strengthening enabling factors in the study areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main challenges for industrial companies today are to improve the competitiveness of their products and to adapt and respond quickly to changes in the external environment. Ensuring the effective functioning of an industrial enterprise is largely determined by its procurement activities, including the reliability and consistency of the procurement process. Relevance of the topic is conditioned by the fact that procurement is one of the main components in increasing of competitiveness and efficiency of the enterprise, as the major part of costs in the cost price of the finished products is concentrated exactly in procurement. Reducing costs in procurement is one of the ways to improve the efficiency of the enterprise. This advantage can be achieved through the introduction of modern information technologies, namely automation of the process of selecting suppliers on an electronic trading platform. For this purpose, an information system for selecting suppliers on the electronic trading platform has been developed, which enables a more transparent, fast, profitable and less costly selection of the cheapest and most suitable goods for the operation of energy supplying enterprises. Procurement activities are aimed at ensuring that the energy-supplying undertaking receives the right quantity and quality of raw materials, materials, goods and services at the right time, in the right place, from a reliable and trustworthy supplier with good service and at a favourable price. Automating the supplier selection process on an electronic platform is essential in today's market environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For a slow‐moving high‐margin product, we demonstrate the viability of an information‐based nudging strategy. The motivation to study this problem was because a firm faced availability constraints for one of its slow‐moving high‐margin products, but the available quantities still exceeded the current demand. To identify customers to nudge, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) approach to rank order the customers based on their propensity to purchase the product. The underlying notion in our approach is that Type I errors, to be defined in the paper, in our classifier are not necessarily problematic but are potential nudging targets. Also, as a consequence, traditional ways of evaluating classifiers (with Type I and Type II errors) are not appropriate. Therefore, we conduct a field experiment to evaluate how well the identified customers are nudged through information and/or couponing. We find that in terms of the successful nudges, our SVM‐based approach performed better than other approaches. The experiment also generated insights about when couponing as opposed to information is more effective when nudging. </jats:p>",

The final analysis concludes that the layout planning of livelihood supply commercial facilities in areas with relatively low degree of construction at the edge of the central city of Hefei is unable to meet the basic living needs of residents under normal conditions. The problem is less obvious in the core area of the central city, but is further magnified in the face of sudden public health events, and its problematic area is more obviously expanded.</jats:p>"

The stated scientific and methodological problem consists in determining the optimal ratio of the values of the reliability parameters of the HSS elements (failure rates and / or restorations) and the power of the own IT AP, which ensures the required level of reliability of heat supply with minimal total costs to ensure the elemental reliability of the system and the operation of its own IT AP. The authors propose solutions based on the use of the theory of reliability, models of Markov random processes, some regularities of the theory of probability, nodal PN, models of the theory of hydraulic circuits and enlarged regularities of thermophysical processes occurring during heat supply to consumers.

In this paper, a study on the effectiveness of decentralized and interconnected percolation ponds as a stormwater harvesting technology, for a partially urbanized (semi-urban) catchment is presented. When applied to a case study region in Katpadi, Tamil Nadu, the results were encouraging. The investment required for implementing the proposed stormwater harvesting came to be about ₹555 Million for Option I and ₹714 Million for Option II. The annual volume of water that can be added to the groundwater system through infiltration from the ponds was found to be 1.22 Mm3 in the case of Option I and 0.74 Mm3 in the case of Option II. The percentage area under stormwater harvesting for the entire catchment was found to be 6.14% under Option I and 9.36 under Option II. The hydrologic performance of the proposed stormwater harvesting system indicated that for peak runoff values Option II is more efficient (in terms of minimizing runoff volume) compared to Option I; however, for daily rainfall values, Option I is hydrologically more efficient when compared to Option II.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Le passage du Paléolithique moyen au Paléolithique récent n’est désormais plus perçu comme une rupture franche mais comme la succession d’une mosaïque d’innovations (art, ornements, industries osseuses) apparues au cours du Paléolithique moyen. Il n’en demeure pas moins qu’une distinction forte demeure entre ces deux périodes : les groupes humains du Paléolithique moyen exploitent majoritairement les matériaux lithiques présents à courtes distances du gisement (moins de 50 km) tandis qu’au Paléolithique récent il est fréquent de trouver des évidences de circulations de géomatériaux sur plusieurs centaines de kilomètres. Nous présentons ici une étude comparative de deux gisements français : l’abri Pataud (Dordogne) pour le Paléolithique supérieur, et le gisement de Baume-Vallée (Haute-Loire) pour le Paléolithique moyen, basée sur une approche combinée de données pétrographique, technologique et économiques que nous nommons approche pétro-techno-économique (PTE). Cette approche intègre les démarches et avancées récentes des disciplines de la pétroarchéologie, et de la techno-typologie au service d’une problématique techno-économique (Geneste, 2010), et permet de mettre en évidence les comportements socio-économiques des populations passées. Nous proposons donc ici de discuter de la gestion des ressources lithiques au Paléolithique moyen en utilisant les mêmes termes, méthodes et questions que pour le Paléolithique récent. Du point de vue méthodologique, l’étude des gisements de l’Abri Pataud et de Baume-Vallée s’est articulée autour d’une double approche. D’une part les déterminations pétroarchéologiques exhaustives à l’échelle macro-mésoscopique (loupe binoculaire à fort grossissement, ×20 à ×150, et macroscope) selon des principes analytiques discutés et enrichis depuis les années 1980 (Masson, 1981 ; Séronie-Vivien et al., 1987 ; Affolter et al., 2008 ; Fernandes, 2012) et l’intégration des principes de chaîne évolutive (Fernandes et Raynal, 2006 ; Fernandes, 2012) permettant une meilleure compréhension et identification des gitologies de collecte potentielles. D’autre part l’étude des comportements techno-économiques (Geneste, 2010) appliqués à chaque matériau suivant une analyse segmentée de la chaîne opératoire suivant quatre étapes principales. Cette double approche permet la mise en évidence de groupes pétro-techno-économiques homogènes, utilisés pour discuter et comparer les comportements socio-économiques. Nous pouvons ainsi envisager les distances d’approvisionnement et les territoires des groupes humains, mais également identifier les variations de gestions sur certains itinéraires au sein de ces territoires, la planification des mobilités et les potentiels réseaux de transferts. Les deux gisements étudiés montrent un espace d’approvisionnement en matière première lithique très large s’étendant sur plusieurs centaines de kilomètres autour du gisement. Si de tels résultats sont communs pour le Paléolithique récent, ils demeurent extrêmement rares pour le Paléolithique moyen. Ils apparaissent notamment en contradiction avec la décroissance quantitative supposée des matériaux, et leur plus forte consommation économique, à mesure que la distance au gite augmente. Pour l’Abri Pataud, six groupes principaux de matières premières se répartissant en quatre groupes PTE de gestion ont été identifiés (tableau 1) : les silex sénoniens du Périgord (groupe PTE 1), les silex du Bergeracois et du Grain de Mil (groupe PTE 2), les silex du Turonien supérieur du Grand-Pressigny (groupe PTE 3) et les silex du Turonien d’Angoulême et du Crétacé de Chalosse (groupe PTE 4). Les interprétations divergent en fonction de l’importance accordée aux réseaux de transferts : si l’on favorise une acquisition directe des matériaux, les données pourraient illustrer un territoire organisé autour d’une mobilité saisonnière à longue distance entre le sud du Bassin parisien et le Périgord. Cette hypothèse peut être mise en relation avec les données issues des études archéozoologiques (Sekhr, 1998 ; Soulier, 2013) qui illustrent une chasse préférentielle au printemps et en été. La Charente constituerait alors un espace pivot, propice à la constitution de stock de matières premières avant un séjour en Périgord, quand les matériaux originaires de Chalosse marqueraient des transferts avec d’autres groupes situés vers les Pyrénées. Si l’on favorise l’hypothèse des acquisitions indirectes, les espaces charentais et périgordiens représenteraient les pôles terminaux d’un territoire social centré autour de la vallée de la Dordogne, et des espaces relais au sein d’un réseau de transfert intégrant des territoires voisins centrés sur le Sud du Bassin parisien et les Pyrénées. Ces hypothèses rejoignent celles déjà formulées antérieurement pour l’Aurignacien récent à burin busqué (Bordes et al., 2005 ; Féblot-Augustins, 2008 et 2009 ; Caux, 2015 ; Caux et Bordes, 2016). Pour Baume-Vallée, 37 groupes de matériaux issus de 15 géotopes principaux ont été identifiés (Vaissié et al., 2017) et se répartissent en quatre groupes PTE de gestion (tableau 2) : silex oligocènes de la vallée de la Borne (groupe PTE 1) ; silex aaléniens du Velay, silcrète de Saint-Pierre-Eynac, silicifications du bassin de Naussac, silcrètes de la </jats:p>\n     <jats:p>Paléo-Truyère et de Saint-Léger-du-Malzieu, silex du Turonien inférieur de la vallée du Cher et du Turonien supérieur du Grand-Pressigny (groupe PTE 2) ; silcrète de la vallée de la Laussone (La Collange), silex du Mazet-Saint-Voy, silcrète d’Arlanc, silex barrémo-bédoulien de Rochemaure-Cruas, silex oligocènes du bassin des Limagnes et du bassin d’Aurillac (groupe PTE 3) ; silcrète pédogénétique de Madriat et silex sénoniens du Loiret (groupe PTE 4). Que ce soit par l’ampleur des circulations ou l’économie des matériaux représentés sur le site, les données pétro-techno-économiques livrent des résultats qui dénotent de la variabilité des comportements couramment observés au Paléolithique moyen. Loin d’exprimer les stratégies opportunistes couramment décries, on observe une réelle planification et une anticipation des besoins en matière première, à la fois à une échelle régionale et extrarégionale. Si l’hypothèse d’une acquisition directe semble pouvoir être privilégiée en majorité, la présence de matériaux faiblement représentés et dont l’acquisition implique le franchissement de contraintes naturelles majeures pourrait être un argument en faveur de la mise en évidence de réseaux de transferts. Dans ce cas, le territoire des groupes humains de Baume-Vallée s’organiserait suivant des cycles de nomadismes saisonniers à grande échelle entre le sud du Bassin parisien et l’espace vellave. Ce territoire pourrait s’articuler, via des réseaux sociaux structurés, avec d’autres territoires moustériens limitrophes : Bassin aquitain, Bassin parisien, vallée du Rhône et potentiellement vallée de la Loire.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a new Leagile structure is proposed for a supply chain. This research covers long term and mid-term horizon by designing a supply chain network up to the order penetration point (OPP) and final assembly and sale planning respectively. The problem is programmed in two phases. First, a bi-objective optimization is developed to minimize the total cost related with LM. In the second phase, the total cost and the customer service level (CSL) are considered as the agile manufacturing (AM) architecture. In the proposed model, a utility function is applied to set balance between the price and customer satisfaction. In addition, a robust credibility-based fuzzy programming (RCFP) is developed to handle uncertainty of the first phase. The proposed model and the solution method are implemented for a real industrial case study to show the applicability and usefulness of this study. According to the results, improving the customer service level can enhance the total cost of the second phase meaning that customer responsiveness price is too high for the proposed system.</jats:p>"

Due to the bulk and low‐value characteristics of grain, it is difficult to achieve traceability in a single unit like meat products; as grain has a longer supply chain, involving much more links and even more complicated factors, it is easy to cause information disconnection. In response to the above problems, this paper has done the following tasks: First, propose a RFID‐based grain supply chain traceability model, which mainly describes the information flow and grain flow in the grain traceability system, and secondly, in combination with the GTIN coding standard in the GS1 system, a stage traceability code is set for each batch of grains at each link, providing a method for uniquely identifying the batch of grains at that link, to improve the accuracy of grain traceability. In addition, in order to enable consumers to inquire all the detailed information of the grain in the supply chain through a traceability code, the PRESENT algorithm and the format‐preserving algorithm are used to encrypt the traceability codes of each link and generate a final traceability code. Finally, a security and performance analysis of the proposed traceability scheme was carried out. The results show that the proposed scheme is safe and effective, ensuring the safety and traceability of the traceability system of the grain supply chain.</jats:p>",

It is no secret that the main consumers of electricity are pumping stations. Reducing the power consumption of pumping stations is a priority worldwide. The use of energy efficient technologies and alternative methods of supplying water can significantly save energy. One of these methods of water supply is the use of a hydraulic ram. The purpose of this work is to summarize materials and introduce the features of the use of hydraulic ram on rivers in those places where there is a problem of energy supply. The use of hydraulic ram as a water-lifting device is a rational solution, especially in mountainous areas. Based on the analysis of theoretical information, the results of research and technical developments of a number of institutes and organizations, various ram installations and their calculations are presented. It is emphasized that the positive aspects of the ram allow under the current conditions using these installations in hydraulic and water construction without the introduction of energy-saving technologies. Hydroramplants operate under winter conditions at temperatures up to –25°C. In addition, the use of hydraulic ram improves the safety of water supply systems. extends the service life of the system, thereby increasing the overall effi ciency of the water supply and distribution systems. The analysis of existing equations made it possible to establish optimal formulas for determining the productivity of rams and the efficiency of the plant. These expressions are the most justified ones and fully reflect the physical essence of the processes arising in hydro rams.</jats:p>"

This study aims to determine the quantitative potential of springs with using a geospatial approach and hydrogeomorphological mapping. Based on the results of the field survey, the springs in Palu Groundwater Basin amounted to + 104 springs with divisions in the east and west. The results showed that in Palu Groundwater Basin the appearance of springs was not only caused by geomorphological conditions but also influenced by geological conditions. Based on the type of springs, it is dominated by the type of artesian, fracture and contact. The quantitative potency level of springs ranges from small (&lt; 5.0 liters/second) to large (&gt; 10.0 liters/second) quantitative potency levels. Small quantitative potential levels (&lt; 5.0 liters/second) in the eastern part include the districts: East Palu, South Palu, Dolo and Biromaru. The western part of Palu Groundawter Basin includes the sub-districts: West Palu and South Palu. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the quantitative potential of springs is very potential to meet the needs of clean water in post-disaster areas.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to assess the role of digital technologies and entrepreneurship in improving the efficiency of supply chains in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. The paper considers GDP per capita as a value characterizing the degree of the country's well-being in the pre-crisis period; the LPI logistics efficiency index which determines the degree of development of the logistics environment in the country; the TIDL digital life index, which assesses the degree of development of the economy from the standpoint of digitalization; the GEI entrepreneurship index reflecting the degree of development of entrepreneurship in the country. A cluster analysis of countries by regression coefficients of the dependence of GDP per capita on the year is carried out. The result of the cluster analysis was the division of many countries into clusters, from which two economies were taken for further analysis. The work resulted in conclusions about a significant relationship between ICT and logistics efficiency, between the level of entrepreneurship and the efficiency of logistics in the pre-crisis period. It is shown that developed economies have high efficiency of logistics systems, high values ​​of the rating of digital life and the level of entrepreneurship, which cannot be argued for countries with a level of development starting from the middle and below. The main conclusion of the study is the fact that, firstly, the active introduction of ICT makes it possible to restore supply chains destroyed by the crisis, to increase their efficiency, and secondly, the development of entrepreneurial activity in the country gives a serious impetus to the efficiency of supply chains, as a result of which businesses get a chance not only to survive amid a pandemic, but also gain significant benefits. This work is constrained by the lack of post-crisis data, so there is a huge spectrum to complement the current research on the stability and resilience of supply chains during and after pandemics.</jats:p>"

In the case of meeting the production cycle, with the buffer area capacity as the limit and the shortest production operation time as the goal, a joint optimization model including material handling time, material transportation time and assembly line working time is established, and the model is designed for the established model Genetic algorithm with piecewise coding. Finally, the proposed algorithm was evaluated using a workshop raw date， the simulation results show that although the indirect supply cost is relatively more than the direct supply, it can effectively alleviate the problem of the capacity limitation of the buffer area.</jats:p>"

While this methodology is good enough for simple calculations, it lacks in preciseness, which in turn can lead to an overengineering of the hot water system. In 2017, SP 30.13330.2016 was introduced, in which the calculation of heat loss by pipelines of the hot water system from SNiP was changed to include previously unaccounted for heat losses that were not calculated. Now this methodology almost fully reflects the physical processes of heat transfer, considers the corresponding design parameters, and delivers more precise calculations, than SNiP methodology, which in turn allows to account for precise numbers of heat loss in hot water system. Detailed analysis of formulas and their components will provide better understanding of processes which affect heat losses in hot water systems.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer and retailer are two supply chain players, where the retailer is unreliable and may not send accurate demand information to the manufacturer. As an advanced smart technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is implemented to track and trace each product’s movement on a real-time basis in the inventory. It takes this supply chain to a smart supply chain management. This research proposes a Machine Learning (ML) approach for on-demand forecasting under smart supply chain management. Using Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the demand is forecasted to obtain the exact demand information to reduce the overstock or understock situation. A measurement for the environmental effect is also incorporated with the model. A consignment policy is applied where the manufacturer controls the inventory, and the retailer gets a fixed fee along with a commission for selling each product. The manufacturer installs RFID technology at the retailer’s place. Two mathematical models are solved using a classical optimization technique. The results from those two models show that the ML-RFID model gives a higher profit than the existing traditional system.</jats:p>"

The accounting system is an important informative primary source of business process efficiency and life support management. The article examines the hospitality industry from the standpoint of a systematic approach and proposes to consider it as an independent, industrial, socio-economic system regarding the production of a product in this area, its distribution, exchange and consumption. When considering the hospitality industry as an independent, industrial, socio-economic system, it is important to define its components as the main elements of its functioning. The components of the hospitality industry include: hotel industry, restaurant business, tourism, transport companies, medical institutions, sports facilities, social and cultural institutions. It is noted that in order to ensure the life of the hospitality industry, it is necessary to create prerequisites for the effective functioning of its enterprises and organizations. The systematization of foreign experience and a view through the prism of domestic reality made it possible to conclude that one of these prerequisites is the development of an information base for making managerial decisions. The article focuses on the consideration of four categories of concepts: concepts related to function, concepts related to the use of results; concepts related to processes and technologies; concepts related to capacity. Management accounting is a process that occurs before and during operations and requires continuous improvement through changes in strategic objectives and, as a result, the emergence of new information needs that indicate feedback. Consequently, management accounting is a complex process that includes certain stages of implementation, and not just the organization. Depending on the specifics of the activity, the elements of management accounting may change, so this issue requires further study.</jats:p>"

The general characteristic of the region under consideration is given, and its energy specifics, directions of energy development based on renewable energy sources are considered. In the work, frost-resistant planar photovoltaic modules and solar roofing panels with an extended service life for power supply of objects are proposed. For simultaneous heat and electrical generation, frost-resistant planar photovoltaic thermal roofing panels and concentrator solar installation with high-voltage matrix solar modules with a voltage of 1000 V and an electrical efficiency of up to 28% are proposed. The considered solar modules have an extended rated power period due to the use of the technology of sealing solar cells with a two-component polysiloxane compound and are able to work effectively at large negative ambient temperatures and large ranges of its fluctuations. </jats:p>"

But as technology improves over the years, renewable energy sources are beginning to take the stage of modern energy divide. Based on the limited generation and distribution companies (GENCOs and DISCOs) grid electricity supply in Nigeria, it becomes pertinent to complement available grid power with renewable sources. The purpose of this study is to propose the best hybrid technology combination for electricity generation to reliably satisfy the electrical needs of an off-grid remote village, Ofubu, New Patani in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Solar PV systems and diesel generator are considered. The study estimates the day-to-day load demand Using HOMER software. Identification of the optimal off-grid option and comparison with conventional grid extension was carried out. The results obtained shows that hybrid combination of an PV-diesel is an effective alternative for an off-grid rural location and it is sustainable, techno-economically viable and environmentally friendly most especially considering the concept of green and clean energy source. The study also discussed issues that are likely to influence the realization of the optimal solution.</jats:p>",

This study analyzed the water quality variation over a period of 20 years in Piquiri River watershed. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration from affluent rivers was estimated using a linear regression model. The relationship between total nitrogen and TP presented a Person's linear correlation of 0.80, while turbidity and total suspended solids presented a correlation of 0.79. The relationship between the predicted and observed values for turbidity and TP presented r² higher than 0.60. Spatial–temporal variation of water quality in Piquiri River watershed has shown good quality over the years, although unacceptable values for Escherichia coli, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus levels appeared. Most unacceptable values were identified in affluent rivers, suggesting the improvement in the water quality closer to downstream of the Piquiri River.

Total rainfall during experimental period was 1473.8 mm and estimated interception loss was 34.018% for deodar forest, 24.85% for oak forest. Stemflow represented the minimum proportion of gross rainfall, i.e. 0.321% in deodar forest and 0.463% in oak forest. pH of throughfall and stemflow in both deodar (6.087 and 6.47 respectively) and oak forests (6.75 and 7.03 respectively) was significantly more acidic than the gross rainfall (7.15). Electrical conductivity was recorded higher in deodar stemflow (231.89 μs/cm) and throughfall (102.75 μs/cm) compared to oak forest (172.92 μs/cm and 83.83 μs/cm respectively). Net nutrient leaching and stemflow were considerably higher from oak forest than deodar forest. Oak forest has better water yield capacity than deodar forest as the interception loss was higher in deodar forest. The idea of sustainable agriculture may be possible surrounding such forests as the need for chemical fertilizer and water can be met by the nutrient-rich soil, available soil moisture and surface water.</jats:p>",

Building on the attention‐based view, we outline the antecedents and deterrents of supply chain adaptability. We theorize how “excessive focus on operational exploitation” and “operations‐focused cognition” deter supply chain adaptability, and how scenario planning serves as a strategy process to overcome the deterrents. We illustrate the theoretical model with a longitudinal industry–academia collaborative field study that used scenario planning to formulate, implement, and adapt a chemical company's supply chain strategy over 7 years in Asia's dynamic and unpredictable business environment. We hope that this study at the intersection of foresight studies and OSCM encourages scholarly collaboration between these two largely disparate communities, and provides a foundation for future research amid the growing importance of managing supply chains in unpredictable business environments.</jats:p>",

Organizations need to examine the factors of the firm’s sustainability performance and how to manage them strategically. Hence, the strategic organizational orientation can be the best approach for implementing green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to improve firm sustainability performance. This study aims to assess the impact of strategic orientation in three dimensions, such as green entrepreneurial orientation (GEO), market orientation (MO), and knowledge management orientation (KMO) on the implementation of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices and the subsequently sustainable firm performance. Data were gathered from an extensive scale survey of 266 respondents of textile manufacturing firms in Bangladesh. Data were analyzed in the structural equation model (SEM) with partial least squares techniques to justify the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that GEO and MO have a significant positive effect on GSCM practices, affecting sustainable firm performance. Surprisingly, KMO does not have a positive impact on GSCM practices. Further, this study reveals that GSCM practices partially mediate the relationship between GEO and sustainable firm performance while MO and KMO partially mediate the relationship between GEO and GSCM practices. Overall, findings help textiles firm management comprehensively understand the implementation strategies of GSCM practices in operations and reconfigure accordingly in the competitive business environment while improving firm performances. This study is the first to investigate the effect of strategic orientation on GSCM practices implementation in the textiles industry from the context of an upstream operation with a comprehensive understanding of the factors while reducing environmental impact.</jats:p>"

Development of scientific and engineering solutions to improve the reliability of power supply of stand-alone systems and mitigate the environmental burden by using hydrogen technologies for energy storage.   Methodology. The calculation method provides a set of optimal technical solutions for determining the effective operating modes of a stand-alone power supply system for supplying hydrogen to a fuel cell based on the electric load schedules of a particular consumer by using a computational experiment.   Findings. Based on the study, a technological scheme of a stand-alone power supply system based on fuel cells was developed, and an approach to the creation of a metal hydride system for accumulating and supplying hydrogen to fuel cells was substantiated. A calculation algorithm was developed that allows calculating the annual energy balance of a specific consumer and selecting the necessary equipment to implement the scheme based on the annual heat and electric load schedule.   Originality. An alternative scheme of guaranteed electric power and heat supply for a stand-alone house without using imported fuel is proposed. The advantage of such a scheme is that it is closed because hydrogen is produced on site to power the fuel cell, while the metal hydride hydrogen storage system is capable of performing hydrogen absorption and its release due to the hot and cold water resources available in the system.   Practical value. The technology for converting the energy of primary sources by creating a wind-driven energy technological complex using an electrolysis plant and a metal hydride hydrogen storage system will solve the problem of smoothing the irregular electric power supply from renewable sources.</jats:p>"

The technological enablers of Industry 4.0 have empowered the clinician to attain accurate information in formulating predictive and data-driven diagnoses based on artificial intelligence-enabled medical devices resulting in an efficient and quality clinical pathway for patients. However, there is a noticeable distinction between the hospital's technological aptitude between clinician and non-clinician. The current technological capability of the hospital information system is to digitize daily business processes that could not offer intelligence reports for predicting, forecasting, and data-driven decision-making support. The compilation of past works of literature is expected to justify the need for the healthcare supply chain to adopt BI solutions that produce near real-time data in making efficient inventory management and procurement to support the clinician in delivering efficient and quality clinical pathways for patients by bringing the supplies at the right moment. Hence, a study of BI solutions in healthcare supply chain operation is achieved through a narrative overview of existing literature from papers published online. The results show that appropriate technological tools, resource competencies, and supplier management platform as the essential dimensions to support the business intelligence adoption effort. The study, therefore, not only identified the critical dimensions in facilitating BI adoption but also offer practical awareness to the healthcare policymakers to better understand the strategic need for BI systems in managing the entire hospital operations to gain a competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

In this paper, multi-distribution statistical analysis was performed. As the Anderson-Darling test proved, at least a half out of the ten tested theoretical probability distributions can be used for description of the water consumption. The application of the PWRMSE criterion made it possible to determine, which of the tested theoretical distributions is the best-fitted to the empirical data set. In the case of total daily water consumption for the group of the households, it was Johnson distribution, whereas for the average daily water consumption per capita, it was GEV distribution. Based on the best-fitted probability distribution, a 25-year water consumption simulation with the Monte Carlo method was conducted. Because methodology of this study is based on the probability distributions, even if the type of theoretical distribution of the water consumption will change, it will be still possible to use this simulation method by assuming the other distribution.</jats:p>"

Secondly, the paper explains the sources of credit risks for accounts receivable supply chain financing under credit insurance, and the necessity of using credit insurance. The sources of credit risks mainly include: the enterprises’ comprehensive strength under systemic and non-systemic risks, status of accounts receivable, supply chain operation, performance of insurance companies, and so on. In addition, based on the credit risks explained in this paper, the risk assessment system and the credit risk assessment model are built. At the end, the paper offers three suggestions for the banks’ financing risk control: bank should carefully check the policy’s exclusions clauses; bank must carefully check the authenticity of accounts receivable; bank can use dynamic monitoring on qualification checking for financing enterprises, core enterprises and insurance companies.</jats:p>"

Since the high uncertainty in organizations requires a more rapid response to customers’ needs, agility is a critical success factor for today’s manufacturing enterprise. To be competitive, enterprises must integrate their supply chains more effectively and forge close memberships with customers and suppliers more quickly. Therefore, the current study attempts to understand how supply chain agility has evolved. We have used a systematic literature review approach to examine the current state of the art and identify potential research gaps. It has indicated how companies can form and preserve competitive advantages in turbulent environments between manufacturers and consumers. From the outcomes, it can be observed that the developed supply chain agility has positive impacts on the sales of companies, velocity to market, profitability, market share and consumers’ satisfaction. Also, the investigations showed that the supply chain agility management needs persistent planning. Allotment of the resources to the agility aspects’ improvement might help companies increase the influence of such investments. Our investigation highlights the tactics for better readiness to attain supply chain agility that is the central part of electronic firms' competency in an emerging market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present paper aims to contribute to the contentious debate regarding the role of meat as part of a sustainable diet. It uses secondary data to examine the patterns of meat consumption across the globe, and drawing on academic and grey literature, it outlines some of the policy, market and social trends and issues influencing demand and supply of meat. It also presents an overview of the scientific evidence base regarding the pros and cons of meat consumption. The results show that consumption patterns are not homogeneous globally, nor across meat types, with overall meat consumption increasing strongly in developing countries but stagnating in developed countries, and demand for poultry increasing in most regions in contrast to beef. They also illustrate the evolving impact of factors such as income on consumption and the increasing impact of non-economic factors, such as social and policy influences relating to health and the environment, on food choice behaviours, to the extent that such behaviours are increasingly entering a moral space. Given the solid scientific evidence that simultaneously substantiates arguments to increase and decrease meat consumption, it is clear that dietary recommendations need to be context-specific. An important part of the context is the strategies being pursued by researchers and supply chain actors, from farmers through to processors, retailers and food service operators, to improve the sustainability credentials of livestock production. As new evidence emerges from such initiatives, the context will change which means that dietary guidelines will require continuous review.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of scientific and technological progress has led to the creation of many technical solutions for implementation in the heat supply system. Such solutions, as a rule, are energy-saving, automated, and are positioned by manufacturers as a quick payback. Over time, the cost of such technologies decreases to a level acceptable to most citizens. The introduction of inexpensive energy-saving technologies is becoming more and more widespread. Heat supply systems for even small buildings are becoming more and more complex and device-rich. Modern technologies that are energy-saving include, for example: a heat pump with the extraction of thermal energy from the ground; heat pump with the intake of heat energy from the outside air; recuperator of ventilation emissions with the intake of heat energy from ventilation emissions; thermal accumulators; individual heating station with weather-dependent automation; individual temperature regulators for heating devices; transition from metal pipes to plastic ones with insulation; bimetallic radiators for heating systems, etc. The issue of the durability of several possible options for the implementation of the heat supply system, complicated by the introduction of many different modern technologies, both in terms of the principle of operation and the achieved effect, is relevant. In this case, the use of element-by-element reliability calculation becomes much more complicated. First, the values of the failure rates for various types of modern equipment are usually trade secrets and are not provided by the manufacturer. Secondly, the excessive complication of modern heat-regulating devices does not allow making their element-by-element calculation of reliability due to the inaccessibility of information about a variety of patented solutions. Thirdly, for many new devices, sufficient operating time has not yet passed for the accumulation of statistical information sufficient to determine the value of the failure flow. The listed features stimulate the transition from element-by-element calculation of the reliability of heat supply systems to the calculation of reliability indices. This approach allows you to go to the integrated assessments of the reliability of the heating system of the building, to compare the predicted values of reliability and operating costs for various options for modernizing the building. Clarification of the algorithm and the transition to an index approach for assessing the reliability of heat supply systems will determine the flow of failures of system elements, which will allow assessing the reliability of the system and, according to the data obtained, take measures that will increase the longevity of heat supply systems. On the example of the heat supply system of an individual residential building, indices were determined for the current state of the system, as well as for two options for its modernization. It is shown that the complication of the building heat supply system does not always lead to a decrease in its reliability. Recommendations are formulated for the modernization of the building’s heat supply system, leading to an increase in the reliability index.</jats:p>"

The existing solutions are described using chemical softening and evaporation techniques. The presented article is devoted to investigation of possibilities to remove calcium carbonate from concentrate due to calcium deposition on “seed” crystals. A new technique to reduce concentrate flow is presented that consists of operation of membrane unit in circulation mode whereby concentrate is circulated through a “seed” reactor. In reactor calcium and carbonate ions deposit on the “seed” crystals thus reducing scaling hazard and concentrate TDS value. Water treatment flow diagram is presented and technical parameters of membrane facilities are determined that enables us to design the whole membrane process. Product flow on each membrane stage is determined to calculate the required amounts of membrane modules on each stage; scaling rates and calcium carbonate deposition rates are evaluated; caustic consumption is determined. Experimental technique is proposed and described to determine scaling rates in membrane modules and the amount of hardness removed from concentrate after treatment by the “seed” and the minimal volume of concentrate that could be reached. Relationships are presented to determine operational costs (energy and chemicals consumption), scaling rates in membrane modules on the first and second stages and total hardness removal during concentrate recirculation through the “seed” reactor on the third stage.</jats:p>"

Examples of risks are the contract's unreliability and contract breach. Deterministic planning models cannot perfectly reflect the complexities of real‐world applications in the presence of sourcing risks when the future is uncertain. In practice, forest industries use contracts to guarantee the wood supply. Monthly forecasts are prepared for the delivery volume and are primarily based on the experience of procurement staff and the total volume of contracts. Missed deliveries in the contracts lead to a mismatch between the supply and demand for wood fiber and increase the costs of procurement as a result of high inventory costs or expensive purchases from the open market. Previous studies on simulating the impact of sourcing risks on procurement operations have been conducted; however, none have addressed the selection of procurement contracts in the presence of sourcing risks. In forest industry, numerous suppliers are available with sourcing contracts. Each contract possesses its own characteristics such as flexibility, volume, schedule, and price of delivery. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is implemented to analyze the behavior of a deterministic planning approach. Random events are generated by formulating different types of sourcing risks, having either short‐ or long‐term impact. The simulation is embedded with a deterministic planning model in each period. Results showed that management of sourcing risks is easier with flexible contracts than with fixed contracts, despite their higher purchasing cost.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between staff competency and implementation level of public procurement regulatory framework in the devolved governments in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMethodology:  The study used descriptive design. The population targeted was 47 devolved governments in Kenya.   The study adopted census because of the small size of the population. A structured questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. The study also undertook a pilot test on the instrument’s reliability and validity in the 3 counties; Nyamira, Kisii, Homa-Bay Counties where nine (9) respondents were engaged in the pilot study. Cronbach’s co-efficient Alpha and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to measure the reliability and validity respectively.  The data was cleaned and coded then entered into SPSS 25 to be analyzed. The use of descriptive and inferential statistics for data analysis was considered. Study engaged the key informers from the 44 county Governments who positively responded hence achieving 100% response rate. The statistical tests were also done in the study. Presentation of data was in form of charts and tables as deemed appropriate. The study also used ANOVA to analyze the degree of relationship between the variables in the study.&#x0D;\nResults: The findings of the study indicate that there was a positive significant relationship between Procurement Staff Competency and implementation level of public procurement regulatory framework in the devolved governments in Kenya. The findings were found to be significant as the p-value of 0.00000 which was less than 0.05. This means that Procurement Staff Competency significantly affects positively Implementation level of public procurement regulatory framework in the devolved governments in Kenya. The findings therefore, implied that procurement staff competency was an important factor in determining the level of implementation of public procurement regulatory framework in the devolved governments in Kenya&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended the adoption of procurement staff competency as a way of improving the implementation level of public procurement regulatory. The study therefore, recommended that the county government to heavily invest on procurement staff capacity building as an important factor in improving the level of implementation of public procurement regulatory framework in devolved governments in Kenya. Since some staff members lacked technical skills beyond secondary education, the study recommended that the county governments need to identify, support and organize in-service training for the procurement staff officers to improve on their knowledge and skills capacity. The study found out that Competency theory model was applicable in the study and can provide more knowledge to future researchers and scholars.</jats:p>"

For the network under consideration, the characteristic modes are: short circuit on the buses of shop substations. For the mining industry when selfstarting asynchronous motors with a squirrel-cage rotor and synchronous motors with asynchronous startup, the current multiplicity will be determined by the duration of the power failure (run-down duration). It has been established that the acceleration of motors during self-start will be somewhat slower than the usual start, since self-start begins at a speed of 0.89–0.94 of the synchronous speed and a resistance torque is equal to 0.65–0.75 of the maximum motor torque. The self-starting time of the motors is from 9 s to 42 s. To ensure self-starting conditions in the most severe modes in mountain conditions, it is necessary to make changes to the protection settings presented in the work.</jats:p>"

In the power supply, an avalanche transistor and VOMS transistor are matched to design a driving circuit, which outputs 4.6ns narrow pulse signal. The circuit replaces the traditional cable transmission signal drive mode, reduces the whole signal transmission distance, and improves the signal transmission stability. It makes the two ends of the laser Q-switched crystal KD*P be pushed off instantaneously, which shortened the output laser pulse width from 18ns to 5.6ns. The power supply with high voltage and narrow pulse can be well used in many laser fields including communication, medical treatment, ocean exploration, etc.</jats:p>",

A small (up to 100 clients) logistics company solves the problem of operational planning: during the working day (fixed time window) to provide the supply of cold (food) products from distribution centers to end consumers along well-defined routes (i.e., the logistic network graph is fixed). The company has set the following conditions for the authors. In addition to minimizing the usual transport costs, take into account also the environmental costs (associated with negative consequences for the environment) that arise during the operation of the logistics supply network. And also when deciding to use software available to the company. The case is considered when the transport tariff on each route is a linearly increasing function of the total volume of all traffic on this route. When the Nash equilibrium conditions are met, the mathematical model for optimizing the total costs of the logistics network is reduced to a convex (quadratic) programming problem. Computer implementation in MS Excel environment has been carried out. This makes it possible to carry out simulation calculations for various options for transport costs on routes, taking into account environmental costs.</jats:p>",

An analytical approach is proposed using functional cost analysis (hereinafter referred to as FСA) in order to monitor staff turnover at a heat supply company. On the basis of the FСA, the costs of performing the labor functions of an engineer for the organization, operation and repair of an enterprise engaged in the provision of services for heating and hot water supply are analyzed. According to the results of the study revealed excessive and unusual office functions proposed measures to change the duties of the employee to reduce workload for the position, indirectly contributing to the reduction of staff turnover in this position and allowing to increase the employee satisfaction employment within the organization and, consequently, increase the efficiency of the organization and the level of its competitiveness. A list of indicators reflecting the level of staff turnover in the organization is proposed. The relevance of the implementation of the personnel turnover monitoring system in the organization is justified.</jats:p>"

When a manufacturer uses a retailer for reaching end customers, the rebate strategy undertakes an additional dimension. Here we show whether the two rebate strategies, manufacturer rebate and channel rebate, can be the optimal choice for the manufacturer and the retailer. And we aim at full coordination with rebate. Game theory is exploited to identify the equilibrium rebate decisions, which are fully characterized with two rebate strategies considering rebate sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the decisions depend on parameters, such as market size, rebate redemption rate, and competition intensity in monopoly and duopoly supply chain systems. Our work also coordinates the supply chain with two coordination policies and examines if they can achieve full coordination. Counterintuitive findings suggest that the channel rebate with sensitivity and discrimination is not effective and the manufacturer rebate is the unique optimal option. Besides, the coordination can be realized with a centralized rebate in monopoly setting when the manufacturer forgoes her own interest. Then full coordination can be achieved in duopoly setting with a new coordination policy, rebate combination, given the redemption rate for the channel rebate is lower compared with the manufacturer rebate. Managerial insights are suggested that offering rebates with discrimination can have significant inventory and coordination policy implications and can lead to a double win under a well‐controlled redemption rate.</jats:p>",

The online direct sales channel sells standard and customized products, and the offline retail channel sells standard products. The prices and service levels of products sold via different channels are differentiated, and the customization level which influences the customization cost and choices of customers is decided by the manufacturer. Three game models are proposed: the manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) model, the retailer Stackelberg (RS) model, and the Nash game model. The price and service decisions of the players are derived. Meanwhile, a service‐cost‐sharing contract is designed for the MS model. The impacts of price and service competition, service cost, and customers sensitivity to the customization level on the optimal decisions are investigated. Through the numerical analysis, we find that, among the three models, the manufacturer Stackelberg model is the most beneficial game structure for the overall supply chain but has the largest revenue gap between the two members. Second, under price competition and service competition, the manufacturer should differentiate the prices and services for direct sales standard products and customized products according to his market status. Third, the manufacturer should increase customization expenditures to construct his customization production line and provide more diversified products when consumers are more sensitive to product customization.</jats:p>",

In many emerging economies, it is apparent that a wide variety of social and political issues are related to the associated supply chain sustainability of financial service firms. Although such sustainability and its implementation issues have largely been addressed in existing research literature and in practice for many years, the attention towards socio-political sustainability aspects has been quite limited. Thus, this study attempted to explore the determinants for improving socio-political sustainability in financial service firms. Through adopting the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), performing an exhaustive literature review, and conducting semi-structured interviews with the decision-makers of the service firms, nine key barriers for socio-political sustainability were first identified in this study. Then, the influence relationships of the key barriers were assessed by 15 experts. During the assessment process, the interrelationships and their dependence powers among key barriers were analyzed using the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) methods. The assessment results show that among the studied barriers, “antisocial considerations”, “unstable political climate”, and “lack of political coherence” are the decisive barriers that affect the socio-political sustainability in the supply chain of financial service firms. The knowledge in understanding and reducing these decisive barriers can provide service sector practitioners, especially those with limited resources, the enhanced capability to conduct better planning and designing of effective and continuous improvement programs, so as to win over new consumers and retain existing clients by offering sustainable services.</jats:p>"

This paper combines the heterogeneous network location verification technology, starting from information asymmetry and Rubens bargaining game ideas, and combines it with game theory methods to provide a reference for bilateral cooperation decision‐making on e‐commerce platforms. The experiment results indicated the pricing decisions of e‐commerce platforms which are affected by the efforts of the other party and the ability of bargaining. The quoted price increases with the decrease of the bank’s ability and the increase of the service provider’s ability. The pricing decisions of banks and service providers are only affected by the direct proportion of their respective business costs. When considering the introduction of incentive mechanism conditions, it is found that appropriate incentive conditions can increase the quotation of the e‐commerce platform. The price quoted by the e‐commerce platform that chooses to bargain with the bank is higher than the price quoted by the bank after negotiating with the service provider, which will help to better realize the benefits. Finally, the paper numerically analyzes the results of the bargaining game between e‐commerce platforms and banks and fourth‐party logistics service providers, and the numerical results verify the better performance.</jats:p>",

This study aims to identify impacts of Covid-19 on the broiler chicken supply chain. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with actors in the broiler chicken business, breeders’ associations, academics, experts, and the government. Also, secondary data was collected, including production data, demand data, and balance data. The data were analysed using the rich picture approach, supply chain analysis, and descriptive analysis. The results showed that accessibility and supply of production factors were hampered due to activity limitation policies and production control policies resulting in decreased production. Disruption in the distribution process also affects supply and demand. The decrease in demand for broiler chickens is very high. These factors might affect the fluctuation in the price of production factors and the selling price of the live birds at the farmer level. Issues due to a pandemic must be appropriately addressed and thoroughly as a mitigation effort in facing crises in the future. The right strategies need to be carried out comprehensively from the upstream, supply chain, and downstream levels. For instance, the partnership with the processing industries (or integrator), investments in the cold chain, and promotion would play an important role.</jats:p>"

The associated potential advantages include, among others, increased sales or productivity, innovations in price creation, and new sorts of client interaction. Global enterprises are facing supply chain issues, and consequently, potentially higher operational costs, lower inventory, and the prospects of lower demand will make them reluctant to disburse resources and time to connect in M&amp;A and financing activities, predominantly if valuations of targets remain high. Digitalization of the supply chain (DSC) could be a way that companies can start to strategize and accomplish trade strength against supply chain disturbance. The main focus of this chapter is that digitalization enhances prosperity without human contact in a pandemic, will alter labor markets, and impacts business models. </jats:p>"

The authors collected questionnaire data electronically from 122 experienced SMEs that conduct international transactions in Saudi Arabia. Results from the Analysis of Moment Structures indicate that MERS and METS positively influence export performance; PPD mediates the relationship between MERS and METS in export performance dimensions; and number of sales and ownerships are control variables that influence EFP and ECP, respectively. This study contributes to the literature and society by proposing a framework that addresses the direct and indirect relationships between export marketing strategies and PPD, and their effects on SMEs’ export performance.</jats:p>"

There are many factors that affect food supply and demand, and the factors are interrelated. Therefore, it is necessary to study this complex issue in a systematic way in order to provide a reliable theoretical basis for the country to formulate effective policy measures. Based on the analysis of the current situation of grain supply and demand, this paper uses system dynamics (SD) to carry out digital elevation model (DEM) and latitude correction for land surface temperature (LST). The LST, combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), has initially constructed a temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) model; it has constructed five subsystems including arable land, production capacity, import, population, and consumption. This paper proposes a food supply chain network construction model from the dimensions of the food supply chain network’s information flow, logistics, and business flow. Through detailed empirical analysis of each subsystem, we judge the development trend of the total grain system, perform operational tests and historical tests on the simulation results of the model to judge the rationality of the model system structure and simulation prediction, and give the simulation results. Finally, based on the forecast results, targeted countermeasures and suggestions are proposed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main topics discussed in a supply chain is the production-distribution problem. Producing and distributing the products plays a key role in reducing the costs of the chain. To design a supply chain, a network of efficient management and production-distribution decisions is essential. Accordingly, providing an appropriate mathematical model for such problems can be helpful in designing and managing supply chain networks. Mathematical formulations must be drawn close to the real world due to the importance of supply chain networks. This makes those formulations more complicated. In this study, a novel multi-objective formulation is devised for the production-distribution problem of a supply chain that consists of several suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and different customers. Also, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) mathematical model is proposed for designing a multi-objective and multi-period supply chain network. In addition, grey flexible linear programming (GFLP) is done for a multi-objective production-distribution problem in a supply chain network. The network is designed for the first time to cope with the uncertain nature of costs, demands, and capacity parameters. In this regard, due to the NP-hardness and complexity of problems and the necessity of using meta-heuristic algorithms, NSGA-II and Fast PGA algorithm are applied and compared in terms of several criteria that emphasize the quality and diversity of the solutions.</jats:p>"

Phosphorus addition greatly increased plant biomass and foliar P concentrations but did not significantly affect foliar N concentration and leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA). In response to P addition, the concentration of metabolic P increased the most, followed by that of nucleic acid P, Pi, and lipid P, in all species by an average of 754%, 82%, 53%, and 38%, respectively. However, elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and N addition weakened this positive effect on concentrations of foliar P fractions in the invasive species. Our results indicate that elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and N addition allowed the invasive species to acclimate to a low soil P availability, supporting their successful invasion, through greatly reducing P allocation to non-metabolic foliar P fractions (phospholipids and nucleic acid P) to meet their demand for metabolic P and Pi for photosynthesis, rather than altering LMA.</jats:p>"

The incumbent retailer has an advantage to acquire information about the market at a cost. If he invests in information acquisition, he privately acquires a signal about the market demand. We examine the incumbent’s incentive of information acquisition and sharing, and the upstream supplier’s information leakage strategy. We confirm that the incumbent’s information acquisition and sharing decisions depend on whether the information acquisition is observable. When it is observable, the incumbent fully shares his private signals even though the shared high signal may hurt him. However, when it is unobservable, the incumbent can share the favorable signal (low signal) and withhold the unfavorable signal (high signal). Moreover, we also find that the supplier will always leak the signal to the entrant no matter what signal she acquires. In addition, we demonstrate under the information sharing and leakage strategy, it may benefit the whole supply chain when the retail competition intensity is not very large.</jats:p>"

Some after-sales activities require spare parts and owing to the importance of customer satisfaction, the needed spare parts must be supplied until the end of the warranty period. In this study, a mixed-integer linear optimization model is presented to redesign and plan the sale and after-sales services supply chain that addresses the challenges of supplying spare parts after the production is stopped due to demand reduction. Three different options are considered for supplying spare parts, including production/procurement of extra parts while the product is being produced, remanufacturing, and procurement of parts just in time they are needed. Considering the challenges of supplying spare parts for after-sales services based on the product’s life cycle is one contribution of this paper. Also, this paper addresses the uncertainties associated with different parameters through Mulvey’s scenario-based optimization approach. Applicability of the model is investigated using a numerical example from the literature. The results indicate that the production/procurement of extra parts and remanufacturing are preferred to the third option. Moreover, remanufacturing is recommended when the remanufacturing cost is less than 23% of the production cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the need for a systematic and harmonised way of preventing unfair trading practices (hereinafter UTPs) in the food supply chain has intensified at the European level due to many diverging national legislative solutions. These efforts resulted in the Directive 2019/633 on unfair trading practices (UTPs) in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain. Croatian UTPs Act, enacted already in 2017, was just amended to conform with the requirements of the named Directive. Generally speaking, the UTPs Act sets out rules and measures to prevent the imposition of UTPs in the food supply chain, establishes the list of such practices and sets up the enforcement structure and sanctions. Comparing the Directive to the UTPs Act, the authors discuss the outcome of the transposition pointing to the incorrect scope of application of the national legislation, its potential consequences and de lege ferenda solutions. Further, the authors anlyse the legal nature of the adopted UTPs system concluding that it does not fit into the traditional systematisation of laws jeopardising the coherency of the intricate and complex relationship between relating legislative frameworks. New rules are diverging and overlapping with both competition and contract law, leading to possible undesirable spill over effects in contract law, and unresolved concurring competence with competition law. Authors suggest precautionary interpretative measures as a means of solving the identified legal conundrum.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In an environment with ever changing customers’ needs and intensifying global competition, quality processes and supply chain (SC) are critical for organisational success. To satisfy customers, outsmart competition and improve performance, contemporary organisations are trying to improve on their processes through integrated supply chains.&#x0D;\nIn an attempt to address this question and effectively contribute to this topic, a comparative meta- analytical evaluation along with key moderator and mediator analysis was conducted. In the lens of many theories, SCI from two perspectives; SCID (internal, suppliers, customer integration) with 67 studies and SCIF (information, operational, relational integration) with 25 studies was assessed on overall performance as well as on both operational and business performance. A quantitative meta-analysis based on Hunter and Schmidt (2004) which was performed through Jamovi, revealed the following: The meta-analysis results which were obtained through Jamovi provided significant correlation coefficients for SCID and SCIF respectively (ř = .476, p &lt;.002) and (ř =.508, p &lt;.001). Therefore, indicating that the association between SCID and performance is medium and positive, while that of SCIF and performance is positive and large. This is a clear indication that SCI from the perspective of SCID and SCIF yields different results, with SCIF having a relatively large effect. Moreover, on average SCIF both at aggregate and individual level has a slightly large effect on performance than SCID. Operational performance was the most influenced by SCID and SCIF, although operational and relational integration indicated a significant larger effect on business performance. Thus, individual SCID and SCIF constructs have different effects on business and operational as overall performance. All moderators though with different levels of interactions indicated a significant effect on both SCID and SCIF. Of the three mediators tested, customer integration had a 32% negative effect, SC agility showed an 89.1% full mediation effect with flexibility indicating a 53% significant effect.</jats:p>"

The model allows shortages which are completely backlogged in order to achieve better preserving amenity. The authors present some optimal solutions which leads to determine the total inventory cost in which the collective behavior of customers hinges on the waiting time. An easy-to-use optimization technique is included to find the shortage time point and order quantity to minimize the total system cost. Taking into account the above-mentioned assumptions, different kinds of numerical examples are considered to illustrate the theoretical behavior of the framed optimization model. The sensitivity analysis is made for this problem with variation of parameters. The study shows that the optimal solution not only exists but also is unique and is less expensive to operate if the factors of three-phase variation, representing the growth, the steady, and the decline phases of demand with respect to time are considered.</p>",

Iron and steel remanufacturing can recycle scrap iron as raw materials for crude steel smelting and reduce energy consumption. However, different raw materials in the supply chain will result in different steel plants’ choice of supplier, purchase volume, and production volume. These choices will affect the economic cost and carbon emissions of the entire system. This paper establishes a model to simulate the economic cost and carbon emissions of the supply chain system. Under various constraints, the carbon emissions are set at 95% and 90% of the previous year's carbon emissions as constraints to solve the system’s impact on suppliers selection and processing distribution of steel plants. The results show that as carbon emission constraints become more stringent, steel plants will choose suppliers with better quality raw materials, and processing production will shift to steel plants with lower carbon emission factors. It is worth noting that with the strict carbon emission restrictions, at 90%, the economic cost will rise rapidly, so too strict carbon emission restrictions should be carefully considered.</jats:p>",

The spare parts shortage caused by those uncertainties may lead to severe losses. To solve the uncertainty of supply network, a determined optimization model is developed and then reformulated as a robust counterpart. In the robust model, it is only necessary to know the moment information of the uncertain parameters rather than the true probability distribution. The solution obtained by the robust model can satisfy the constraints in the worst-case, that is, feasible for any probability distribution within the moment based ambiguity set. Two moment based robust models are studied in this work. The result of the experiment indicates that the robustness of the robust model is stronger than that of the determined model and chance constraint model, and the effect of safety tolerance on the robustness is revealed by sensitivity analysis. Finally, the second order moment model is verified to be superior to the first order moment model in spare parts supply network optimization.</jats:p>"

The study explores the degree to which ambidexterity affects agility, which can impact organizational effectiveness. The structural equation model with multilevel simulation used to test the research hypothesis. The study indicates that ambidexterity is an influential factor to agility, and that ambidexterity is also an impactful factor to agility and organizational effectiveness. Furthermore, there is also evidence that the power of agility contributes to greater organizational effectiveness, and also that ambidexterity has an impact on organizational effectiveness through workforce agility. To achieve organizational effectiveness in dry port business, mobile devices and social network technology are functional enablers of ambidextrous activities that can allow staff to be agile in handling dry port business tasks.</jats:p>"

Distributed nature of these ledgers ensure that every participant of the supply chain has access to trusted data. The industry has already begun experimenting with blockchain integration into their operations. For the majority of the organizations, however, these experiments stay in proof-of-concept stages or small pilot studies.

Methods we used physical and chemical characteristics of the water and planktonic diatoms from 9 sampling stations during dry (austral winter) and wet (austral summer) seasons (N = 18) as the outline to identify water quality, spatial and seasonal patterns. To evaluate spatially and temporally integrated events from the recent past (approximately the last 5 years before sampling), and the species from diverse habitats of the system, we used diatoms from the surface sediment (top 2 cm, N = 9). Since we used the top 2 cm of surface sediment containing the dead diatoms that were deposited over recent past of the reservoir, seasonal sampling of the sediment was not needed.  Results during the dry season heavily silicified long colonial planktonic diatom species associated mainly with higher mixing depth, pH, and transparency dominated the plankton, whereas in the wet season the reservoir became stratified, favoring planktonic solitary diatoms with high surface volume ratios. For the sediment, a general pattern emerged where planktonic species dominated in the deep sections of the reservoir, and the abundance of benthic species in shallow areas near the tributaries increased.  Conclusions the diatom assemblages was mainly influenced by seasonal variations and mixing regime. Surface sediment samples provided longer-term information, and revealed habitat differentiation shaping diatom assemblages. Overall, the small centric planktonic Aulacoseira tenella (Nygaard) Simonsen stood out as the most abundant species in the entire reservoir in both, the plankton and the sediment, indicating that size and shape serve as adaptive strategies for buoyancy and nutrient uptake stand as a competitive advantage in deep low productivity environments.</jats:p>"

The transfer of prefabricated modules will inevitably be accompanied by the transmission and diffusion of risks.

Based on this, the Grounded Theory is used to identify the risks of prefabricated construction projects from the perspective of the supply chain, and build a full-stage risk system; and introduce the Interpretation Structure Model Theory to analyze the interrelationship between risk factors, and obtain different risk levels; finally, specific risk control measures are proposed for deep-seated factors, which provide new ideas for the development of prefabricated buildings.</jats:p>"

To ensure the orders, manufacturer convinces the retailer to pay a percentage of the purchasing cost prior to replenish the products and offers the facilities such as (i) delay in payment on the remaining part of the purchasing cost and (ii) free transportation on the basis of advance payment amount. Time dependent development cost is incurred to maintain the reliability of the production system and as a result it reduces the imperfectness of the product during production. Under such circumstances, an integrated profit function has been developed to find the optimum number of production cycle, optimum number of replenishment cycle and hence reliability parameter of the manufacturing system, replenishment quantity for the retailer which maximize the integrated profit. Branch and Bound technique is used to obtain the integer solutions. Furthermore, we derived some useful lemmas and algorithms to obtain the optimum solution. Finally, the model has been illustrated with some numerical examples exploring the sensitivity analysis with respect to some parameters and obtains some managerial insights.</jats:p>",

Entitled the TUSOM COVID Response Group, the primary goal was to collect and distribute donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline healthcare providers in New Orleans, Louisiana to temporarily bridge the supply chain gap. In total, from March 20th, 2020 to May 6th, 2020, the group distributed 29,217 N95s, 181,467 surgical masks, 22,747 face shields, 1,100 goggles, 3,382 boxes of gloves, 13,446 gowns and coveralls, 4,525 sleeve, shoe, and head covers, 175 pairs of scrubs, 762 bottles of hand sanitizer, 699 bottles of cleaning supplies, and 38 tablets which were distributed to 17 local hospitals and healthcare faculties. During this time, the five student leaders oversaw 82 student volunteers and coordinated donations from 169 individual and business donors. All facets of medical education and medical student organizations have been forced to adapt to the new era of COVID-19. This PPE drive demonstrates the adaptability of medical student organizations and the ability to enact change in their communities beyond their clinic sites.</jats:p>"

Our aim was to identify the major food companies manufacturing packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages available in New Zealand supermarkets in 2018; to assess the healthiness of products using (1) the Health Star Rating (HSR) system, (2) Australian Dietary Guidelines classification (core/discretionary), and (3) by level of processing; to compare the healthiness of products displaying and not displaying the HSR and; to assess potential for food reformulation within selected food sub-categories. Information on packaged foods was obtained from the Nutritrack supermarket database. Companies that manufactured each food and brand were identified using company websites and the New Zealand companies register. In total, 13,506 packaged products were mapped to 1,767 brands and 1,214 companies. Based on market share of products available for sale (Euromonitor data), there were 22 dominating companies producing 31% of products and 17% of brands. Fifty-nine percent of products were classified as unhealthy (HSR &lt;3.5/5 stars), 53% as discretionary, and 69% as ultra-processed. Products displaying the HSR on the package had a higher mean HSR ±SD than if the HSR was not displayed (3.2±1.3 <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> 2.5±1.4, p = 0.000). Efforts to improve the healthiness of products should be directed to the 22 food companies dominating this market share, particularly in the core foods groups which are currently less likely to meet Heart Foundation reformulation targets (bread, breakfast cereals, cheese, canned baked beans, yoghurt). The New Zealand supermarket packaged food supply included in the Nutritrack database is dominated by a small number of companies and is mostly unhealthy. Government leadership is required to improve the healthiness of the packaged food supply and provide adequate information to consumers. This includes interventions setting reformulation targets for core food groups, setting population nutrient intake targets and mandating that the HSR is displayed on all products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Changes in travelers’ booking habits and the evolution of technology have come to threaten the existence of traditional travel agents (TAs). However, the cruise industry still relies heavily on TAs as its main distribution channel. A qualitative study was conducted to investigate the networks, relationships, and power distribution between cruise companies and TAs using a triangulation method via a tourism supply chain model. Principal–agent (P-A) theory was taken as the framework to describe various parties’ relationships and roles. Several TA business models were identified, including group blocks (i.e., guaranteed and nonguaranteed) and charter cruises (i.e., retail for resale and corporate; meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions). Results show an imbalance of power between parties due to unique business practices and customer preferences in Mainland China. Principals (i.e., cruise companies) were found to rely excessively on agents (i.e., TAs) to create demand, with the growing number of cruise lines leading agents to overpower principals. The alliance among TAs further affected the principal–agent relationship. A refined tourism supply chain model tailored to the cruise industry is thus proposed herein; this cruise supply chain model simplifies the complicated business network relationships between cruise companies and TAs in China. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper describes special aspects of using the wind power plants (wind turbines) in the power grid. The paper provides the classification and schematic presentation of AC wind turbines, analyzes the role, place and performance of wind power plants in Smart Grid systems with a large share of renewable energy sources. The authors also reviews a detailed analysis of existing AC wind turbines in this paper. Recommendations are given for how to enhance the wind power plants in smart grids in terms of reliability, and introduce the hardware used in the generation, conversion and interface systems into the existing power grid. After the wind power plants had been put online, the relevance of the Smart Grid concept for existing power grids was obvious. The execution of such projects is assumed to be financially costly, requires careful study, and development of flexible algorithms, but in some cases this may be the only approach. The analysis of using wind turbines shows that the structural configuration of wind power plants can be based on the principles known in the power engineering. The approaches may differ, not fundamentally, but in engineering considerations. it is necessary to point out that the method of controlling dual-power machines is quite comprehensive so that their wide use will face operational problems caused by the lack of highly professional specialists in electric drives. Therefore, it seems advisable to use square-cage asynchronous generators in wide applications. The paper shows that as the renewable energy sources are largely used in power grids, there is an issue of maintaining the power generation at a required level considering the variability of incoming wind energy. This results in the malfunctions in the operation of relay protection devices and emergency control automatics (RP and ECA), and the complicated control. Also, the standards of the CIS countries and regulatory documents miss the requirements for the wind turbine protections, taking into account their specialty causing the inefficient standard protective logic, which does not work correctly in a number of abnormal and emergency operating modes, and especially Smart Grid in power grids.</jats:p>"

The secondary data on price and non-price variables were collected from the period 1975-76 to 2015-16. The study concluded that the lagged area, lagged production and lagged yield had exerted significant influence on current year’s area, production and yield of the crop across all the period. The study showed that the co-efficient of non-price factors such as rainfall or irrigation was significant which is more important and complementary to price factors for decision making in allocation of land for groundnut production in the state. The study suggested that, attention should be given to expansion of irrigation facility and developing the suitable HYV in groundnut through suitable policy and programmes in the state which may encourage farmers to achieve stable yields and incomes. The government agenises like SAU; Dept of Agriculture, GOK; Extension units, KOF etc., have to arrange for the buyback of groundnut oilseed with processors or oil millers that could benefit the farmers and in turn farmers will expand the area under oilseeds crops in general and groundnut crop in particular in the state.</jats:p>",

The actors consisted of farmers, trader, PT Lingkar Organik Indonesia, Pamella Supermarkets, Maga Swalayan, Progo Store, Mirota, Panti Rapih Hospital, and household consumers. In terms of continuity flow, the supply chain performance of organic red rice comprising the product flow, money flow, and information flow as a whole, has not been going well. It was because there were still quite smooth flows, including product flow and information flow. The best performance was the chain formed from farmers, trader, PT Lingkar Organik Indonesia, and Panti Rapih Hospital.</jats:p>"

It has thrown some SMEs into a financial crunch, forced them to reduce/remove their workforce, hampered production due to prolonged lockdowns, halted their logistics and supply chain activities, and delayed their delivery schedules enormously. The revival of the SME sector is very important for the survival of the economy. One of the most important aspects of this revival strategy would be to innovate their existing supply chains for more visibility, transparency, and robustness through the adoption of affordable digital technologies. In spite of advanced studies in SC innovation, the in-depth studies related to this area of SMEs towards sustainability are still very scanty and inadequate. Therefore, this chapter proposes to develop a framework of SC Innovation for the sustainability of SMEs through a systematic literature review. This framework will be very useful to the owners and employees of SMEs and various researchers. </jats:p>"

The system enables a controlled, planned and, thus, fair distribution of the water availability independently from the consumption patterns. The system input is transported by gravitation through a branched pipe system to decentralised storage tanks. Each storage tank is allocated to a supply unit which comprises several consumers and, possibly, distribution structures connecting the consumers and the tank. At every junction the water is divided by a distribution tank with several chambers that are separated by weir overflows. Water that is not consumed is redistributed in the system automatically. The concept, the components, planning criteria and system design as well as the system modelling are described within the paper. The application of the solution in a supply area located in northern Vietnam is outlined.</jats:p>",

Open surgical intervention was deemed to carry a high risk of haemorrhage due to the degree and complexity of arterial collateralisation. In the first case, selective embolisation of collateral vasculature was performed prior to successful exclusion of the aneurysm with a thoracic endovascular stent-graft and then balloon-expandable stent dilatation of the coarctation stenosis. In the second case, the additional technique of using a jailed sheath within the aneurysm sac allowed for selective embolisation of previously inconspicuous collaterals after deployment of the stent-graft and stent combination.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Technical success was achieved in both patients with successful occlusion of the aneurysm, with no recorded complications or aneurysm sac perfusion in the long and medium term follow up periods respectively.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>De novo post stenotic aortic coarctation aneurysms are rare.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural supply chain consists of many participants like producer (generally farmer), consumer (people who buy the product and consume them), wholesalers, and retailers. This system consists of many levels of mediator parties as well which have different policies of the commission. Due to the difference in these policies, the producers do not get their fair share of price. Due to the varying prices, consumers also suffer as they do not get the right quality of the product for the right price. There are no central records maintained regarding the transactions between the participants which could lead to many serious problems. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, we need a holistic approach that can provide solutions to most of the above issues. Here, blockchain-based solution can be used to achieve traceability (we can trace the whereabouts of the product, the origin of the product, etc.), transparency (so that a sense of trust is achieved), fairness (by removing the intermediaries), assurance of food safety and pricing (so that nobody has to bear the loss). </jats:p>"

Currently, combustible secondary energy resources in petrochemicals in through hydrocarbon gases are burned in smokeless flares and technological candles without practical use in the electric and thermal energy industry. In the production of polyethylene, an average of 230 t/h of spent combustible gases is burned in a smokeless flare at an altitude of 105 m with useless dispersion of the resulting heat in the atmosphere. The heat of heated process water during cooling in cooling towers is uselessly dispersed in the atmosphere or leaves with contaminated spillways and non-return condensate into settling tanks without practical useful application. In the construction of new and the energy supply of existing industrial and residential facilities, there is a problem providing them with electric and thermal energy at low prices.

Goal of the work is improving the efficiency and survivability of the remote sensing spacecraft and maintaining the energy balance of the power system in critical operating conditions by transferring the storage devices of the accumulating subsystem of the spacecraft to a given level of charge in the minimum charge time.  An algorithm for controlling the accelerated charge of the rechargeable battery with the analysis of the Nickel-hydrogen battery temperature and its time derivative is developed.in some cases, the rechargeable battery replenishment time was reduced by 12−20%. The proposed algorithm for maintaining the energy balance can be used to select the stages of the accumulating subsystem charge current and transition from the current stage to the next one in a minimum time, providing flexibility in managing the modes of electricity storage with the adaptation of the charging current profiles to changing critical operating conditions.</jats:p>"

To improve the efficiency of value chain activities such as manufacturing, distribution, and consumption, an innovative research solution has been proposed: ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)'. Sustainability through ICT is significant for the industry in terms of its sustainable effects on production processes, environment, and community. This research seeks to gauge ICT—as knowledge management—for industries in the successful adoption and execution of SCP. In so doing, potential key ICT-based factors to SCP are identified from the literature and experts' feedback. The present work suggests a decision framework for assessing the interrelationships among and between the ICT oriented factors by utilizing graph theory and matrix approach. Data for this work derives from three automotive companies operating in India. From findings, ‘Governance and Management', is the topmost factor for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production in value chains. The relationship among the index values is further evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This research can facilitate practitioners, government agencies, and customers for a better understanding of ICT-driven factors in managing resources, reducing waste, and improving cost, which would further help in meeting sustainable development goals of the United Nations of responsible consumption and production and innovation, industry, and infrastructure.</p>",

To achieve this goal, we proposed to apply a method for determining the location and volume of leaks, based on the use of energy equivalents. We proposed to check for leakage between static assessments of the state of heat supply systems according to data from a remote manometric survey, with the help of which a simultaneous poll of pressure sensors in the end nodes of the system in question is performed. In the event of sudden changes in the estimated system parameters, it is concluded that there is a leak. If the results of two neighboring evaluations are relatively stable, then a conclusion is made about the absence of leakage. The considered problems are based on mathematical models of flow distribution for a heat supply system. The results of a computational experiment are compared with the results of calculating the parameters in the system based on the results of gauge surveying.</jats:p>",

The operation of lithium-ion batteries is based on the electrochemical oxidation reactions of lithium metal, which is part of the anode. When discharged, lithium is oxidized and its cation moves to the cathode; when charged, under the action of the applied electrical voltage, lithium cations move to the anode, where the recovery occurs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Thyroid gland diseases are the most common endocrinopathies in feline practice. Diagnosis and surgical treatment must base on solid anatomical knowledge about the gland size, localization, and blood supply. However, some textbooks provide a general anatomical description of the thyroid gland of domestic carnivores. Thus, specific details of the feline gland are missing. The present study aimed to investigate the dimensions, topography, and arterial supply of the thyroid gland in Brazilian shorthair cats and, therefore, provide additional data to diagnose and treat feline thyroid diseases.Materials, Methods &amp; Results: Thirty Brazilian shorthair cats formalin-fixed cadavers (15 male and 15 female) were injected with red-stained latex solution by a canula in the thoracic aorta. The necropsy unit of the Rural Federal University of Rio de Janeiro donated the specimens. The study included only adult animals with no history of thyroid disease. After the fixation period, the cadavers were dissected to investigate the measurements (length, width at cranial and caudal poles, and thickness), topography, and in situ arterial supply of the thyroid lobes. The mean measurements of the length, cranial pole width, caudal pole width, and thickness in the right lobe were 19.39 ± 3.10 mm, 5.36 ± 1.40 mm, 3.67 ± 0.93 mm, and 1.30 ± 0.29 mm, respectively; and 20.29 ± 3.35 mm, 4.85 ± 1.58 mm, 3.88 ± 0.91 mm, 1.64 ± 0.65 mm in the left lobe, respectively. There were no statistical differences (P &gt; 0.05) in the comparison of the measures between sexes or antimers (sides). Pearson's linear correlation detected a positive, moderate (r = 0.55), and significant (P &lt; 0.05) correlation between the right and left lobe lengths. In 70% of the cats, both left and right lobes had the cranial poles located at the same level. Typically, the lobes extended between the first to the eighth tracheal ring. However, the cranial pole of some lobes located as cranially as the cricoid cartilage level, and the caudal pole as caudally as the 12th tracheal ring. Fifty-six percent of the cats had a ventrally located isthmus. In all the sampling, one single thyroid artery emerged as a branch of the common carotid artery and provided branches directly to the thyroid lobe, isthmus and the adjacent muscles and esophagus.Discussion: Besides establishing average dimensions of normal thyroid lobes in Brazilian shorthair cats, this study detected no significant difference between the average measurements of right and left lobes. Also, a positive linear correlation between the length and width of the right and left lobes became evident. Therefore, the practitioner must consider suspicious any length asymmetry between right and left thyroid lobes until further endocrine test proves otherwise. Most of the cats had the right and left thyroid lobe positioned at the same transversal level; however, positional asymmetries are not uncommon. Unlike dogs, Brazilian shorthair cats have only a single artery to supply each lobe: the thyroid artery. In a feline thyroidectomy, the surgeon must avoid blindly ligating the thyroid artery since this vessel also provided numerous branches to adjacent muscles and esophagus. In a bilateral thyroidectomy, the ventral region between lobes should be thoroughly inspected for the common presence of an isthmus. Sometimes, the surgeon may need to extend the incision caudally beyond the 12th tracheal ring level to visualize the gland tissue entirely.Keywords: endocrinology, feline anatomy, morphometrics, thyroidectomy.</jats:p>"

System dynamics simulation was used to develop model for General Practitioner workforce forecasting. Sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo method) was performed to account for changes in the number of GP as each and set of model parameters is varied. Three key input parameters were explored: retirement rate, attrition rate, recruitment rate. For each parameter relative sensitivity was calculated. Created model is the least sensitive to the parameter of the retirement rate, but is very sensitive to attrition rate. Staff turnover is one of the main problems of primary health care. The attrition rate parameter has great potential for controlling the flow of labor. The level of recruitment (other than new GPs) is another factor that has a significant impact on forecasting GPs. The sensitivity to this parameter is comparable to the sensitivity to the rate of depletion. We believe that measures taken to reduce dropouts will simultaneously increase recruitment. We also evaluated the effect of all three parameters simultaneously. If the most likely scenario is realized, then the proposal of a General Practitioner will almost completely cover the needs with a small deficit of 68 to 305 doctors. If the high limit or low limit scenarios in the labor market are implemented, Healthcare Ministry will face serious problems.</jats:p>",

To solve these limitations, this chapter proposes a methodology for the design of traceability systems in FAP which allows increasing supply chain visibility, coordination between deliveries and social conditions, and therefore, possible impacts on public policy implications. A qualitative and quantitative comparison of the conventional frameworks is carried out and contrast with the needs of the programmes studied. Also, new criteria are also added to adapt the design to the technological infrastructure and the socio-demographic conditions of the territory. The methodological proposal is applied to the Bienestarina nutritional programme in Colombia, where the technologies and tools to subsequently design the traceability system are proposed. </jats:p>"

It comprises the large amount of data in its network where it fails to assure complete security in the network. Blockchain is a distributed ledger where it mainly focuses on the data security. Every block in the blockchain network is connected to its next block, which prevents threats like large data loss. In the area of agri-food supply chain, where IoT plays a very important role, there occurs data integrity issues or data tampering. This can lead to improper supply chain management, timely shortage of goods, food spoilage, etc. So the traceability of agri-food supply chain is necessary to ensure food safety and to increase the trust between all stakeholders and consumers. Many illegal activities can be prevented, and cold chain monitoring can be achieved by bringing in transparency and traceability. </jats:p>"

With the comparison between commercial bank financing model and the buyer guarantees financing model, this paper researches the optimal decisions of supply chain members and the influence of the cost-sharing ratio, technical input gain effect and the buyer guarantees ratio. The results show that the profit will increase with the add of technical input gain effect. Besides, only under certain conditions, cost sharing is valuable to each member.

According to the results of the analyzes carried out, infiltration waters are mainly fresh with a salinity of 0.5 to 1 g / l. The most rational scheme from a technical and economic point of view in relation to local conditions are beam water intake structures, which is due to the relatively low thickness of water-bearing rocks. At the same time, infiltration-type water intake structures in the Irtysh river valley should be located at a distance of up to 130 m from the river channel (taking into account the value of hydraulic resistance ∆lн). The distance between wells in a linear row should be taken up to 50 m.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern conditions, the practice of building multi-storey office buildings, shopping centers and catering establishments where the installation of air conditioning systems is necessary is becoming widespread. In addition to regulatory requirements, the need for air conditioning systems is dictated by market conditions: a building in which optimal microclimatic conditions are created has significant competitive advantages in terms of renting, selling and operating compared to a building without ventilation and air conditioning systems. The main approaches to the installation of air conditioning systems are as follows: central air conditioning combined with ventilation and air heating; the use of local closers where the coolant is water - climate beams, fan coils; use of freon local systems - local and multizonal. Given the frequent inconsistency of planning and operational decisions of these buildings, due to the fact that different tenants may have different needs for the installation of air conditioning systems, different heat surpluses and other hazards, the installation of water cooling systems is one of the best solutions. within the limits of modernization of the system in accordance with the new operational features. Water cooling systems require the creation of an optimal hydraulic regime, which will not only allow optimal operation of refrigeration equipment, but also save energy. A significant difference in the formation of the hydraulic environment with constant and variable mode has formed the objectives of the study and confirms their relevance. The article considers the approaches to the formation of hydraulic modes of the refrigeration system. The results of the research were implemented during the construction of a real public facility. On the example of this object, the economic indicators of the formation of different hydraulic modes of the refrigeration system are determined. The use of the correct schemes for the formation of hydraulic modes of water cooling systems will significantly increase the energy efficiency of the process of forming the internal microclimate of these premises.</jats:p>"

The clinical and radiologic characteristics of BAVMs with a TBS are poorly understood.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A retrospective review of the medical records was conducted for adult patients who were admitted for BAVMs from Jan 2013 to Dec 2019. TBSs for BAVMs were divided into 3 types: (1) unilateral TBSs from the external carotid artery (ECA) and/or meningeal branch of the vertebral artery (VA); (2) bilateral TBSs from the ECA and/or meningeal branch of the VA; and (3) meningohypophyseal trunk TBSs of the internal carotid artery.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Four hundred and twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with BAVMs during the study period, of whom 30 (7.0%, 30/428) were identified as having a TBS. Type 1, type 2, and type 3 TBSs were identified in 21 (70%, 21/30), 7 (23.3%, 7/30), and 2 (6.7%, 2/30) patients, respectively. Six (20%, 6/30) patients were conservatively managed. Twelve (40%, 12/30) patients underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) of the BAVM through non-TBS feeders. Eight (26.8%, 8/30) patients underwent EVT of the BAVM both through the TBS and non-TBS feeders. The modified Rankin Scale scores at the 3-month follow-up were 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 in 24 (80%, 24/30), 2 (6.7%, 2/30), 2 (6.7%, 2/30), 1 (3.3%, 1/30), and 1 (3.3%, 1/30) patients, respectively. Good short-term recovery was achieved in 86.7% (26/30) of the patients. The size of the BAVMs with a TBS was larger than that of BAVMs without a TBS.

Due to the osmotic pressure difference, freshwater permeates across a membrane to the other side, where the high-pressure seawater flows and drives a turbine to generate power. Many mathematic models have been proposed to evaluate the performance of a PRO. However, it was found that most performance of the PRO that have been reported were performance by using freshwater with limited supply (batch) in the model. It is not accurate as, in practice, the supply of freshwater occurs in a continuous manner. In this work, the influence of batch and continuous supply of fresh water on the performance of PRO was demonstrated. The effect of flow direction, i.e., concurrent and counter-current flows, was also examined. The model simulation was performed by using MATLLAB program, and the performance of PRO is expressed in terms of average power density. The results revealed that the batch and continuous supplies of freshwater had a strong impact on the performance of the PRO.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents a model for evaluating the effectiveness of enterprise decisions on the formation of the vector of procurement of raw materials at the timber exchange based on the volume of costs incurred. Enterprises usually set themselves the goal of incurring costs no higher than the target costs, so it becomes very important to take this factor into account during the process of evaluating efficiency. The evaluator does not always know the level of target costs, in response to which such levels are generated in the work, and for each of them the effectiveness is evaluated and an average value is taken. To calculate the efficiency indicator, a non-linear economic and mathematical model was built, which differs in the calculation of the boundary costs (efficiency boundaries) that determine the categories of efficiency. The article applies the principle of the golden ratio to determine the boundaries and categories of effectiveness. The aim of the work is to draw up a mathematical model and a heuristic algorithm that allows for evaluating the effectiveness of a decision made at the enterprise for the formation of supply chains for raw materials, which is distinguished by the ability to take into account the generated different indicators of target costs and calculate the boundaries and categories of efficiency. The hypothesis of the study is the possibility of assessing the effectiveness of the decision made at the enterprise in the formation of sustainable supply chains of raw materials, provided that the evaluator is not aware of the level of targeted costs. The nonlinearity of the mathematical model predetermined the construction of a heuristic algorithm for finding the solution. With the estimate obtained, the problem of borders appears due to economic reasons. To solve this problem, the methods of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic were used. The algorithm and model were tested on the data of one of the enterprises of the Primorsky Territory. In the course of pilot application, it was shown that the boundaries of efficiency change and, as a result, have different categories of efficiency at different values of the target costs due to the nature of the efficiency assessment function. The results of the model and algorithm test showed the effectiveness of the efficiency evaluation scheme.</jats:p>"

The retailer needs to solve the shortage of working capital either from a bank or from its core supplier, which offers trade credit when it is also beneficial to itself. We assume the retailer is risk-averse behavior and the supplier has different risk preference behaviors that jointly model risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-taking. With a wholesale price contract, we incorporate each member’s risk preference behavior into its objective function. Then we derive the optimal decisions in a Stackelberg game under bank credit financing and trade credit financing, respectively. We find that there exists a supplier’s risk preference threshold that distinguishes financing scheme. When the supplier is a relatively higher risk preference, trade credit financing makes both the retailer and the supplier better off and is a unique financing equilibrium. Otherwise, the members prefer bank credit financing. Besides, the supplier with relatively higher risk preference behavior prefers the retailer with a low initial capital as a partner; the supplier with relatively lower risk preference behavior prefers the retailer with a higher initial capital level.

The growing demand for Halal food has resulted in several food-producing companies to certify their products as Halal. However, with existing supply chains, there is no authenticity of these products being Halal. To ensure Halal food authenticity, the technology of blockchain is proposed as a viable solution. In this chapter, the applicability and usability of blockchain technology in food supply chain management systems is studied and highlighted. The study depicts that how trackability and traceability of the blockchain networks can effectively aid in maintaining the Halal integrity of food products by presenting various use cases. Technological shift for food supply chains over blockchains will result in more transparent, secure, and resilient supply chains. This will bring variety of health and economic benefits to food producing business and consumers. </jats:p>"

Supply chain management instructors will likely want to introduce risk management concepts and strategies into their courses to raise their students' sensitivity to the impact of supply chain disruptions. Unfortunately there is currently a dearth of coverage of supply chain disruptions and risk management in the major supply chain management text books as well as in the broader library of supply chain management pedagogical research publications. To help to close this gap in the literature for instructors, we have developed a reading and set of related discussion questions and exercises that detail the causes of the shortage in toilet paper during the pandemic and short‐ and long‐term strategies to make the supply chain more resilient in the future. By focusing on a disruption students likely experienced first‐hand, they can develop a more nuanced understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of supply chain functions in providing products and services to customers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strengthening international efforts to implement climate policy and accelerate the transition to a “green economy” is a modern challenge to the energy security of the Russian Federation. The enterprises of the fuel and energy complex (FEC) play a key role in the economy of the Russian Federation, but they have a continuous negative impact on the environment. The subject of the research is a set of theoretical, methodological and practical aspects of increasing the energy security of heat supply in the Russian Federation by replacing coal with more environmentally friendly fuels. The purpose of the study is to propose a way to improve the energy security of heat supply in the Russian Federation by replacing coal with more environmentally friendly fuels. The study has been carried out using a set of methods: comparative analysis, analysis of structure, financial analysis. Coal makes up about 80 % of the total amount of raw materials used to generate heat in the Irkutsk region. This has a significant impact on the degree of environmental pollution. There is a possibility of using part of production and consumption waste as an alternative fuel (RDF) for thermal power facilities in the Russian Federation to improve the energy security of heat supply. Fuel for the production of thermal energy can be obtained as a result of processing production and consumption waste. This will lead to a solution to the problem of garbage disposal. The problem in the field of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the Irkutsk region is aggravated by the fact that the waste processing complex, waste handling and waste sorting complexes are absent on the territory of the region. An analysis of the financial indicators of the incineration plant operating in the Russian Federation shows that the financial results of operations are negative for 2019, 2020. It is necessary to create state-owned enterprises for the production of steam and hot water in the Russian Federation using a combination of two types of fuel: biofuel and RDF to accelerate the modernization of heat supply sources</jats:p>"

The combination of silica sand, activated carbon, and zeolite media was simulated into a pilot-scale of 1:2 reactor. Based on the first experimental results, the use of proposed media has a significant effect (p-value≅0) on several parameters. The best improvement in effluent quality reaches 100% in nitrites removal, 29% in nitrates removal, and 94.4% in total coliform removal. However, the media thickness variation factor has an insignificant effect (p-value 0.616) to effluent quality. Based on the second experiment results, hydraulic loading rate (HLR) variation shown a significant effect (p-value 0.01) on several parameters. Effluent quality improvement reaches 71.4% in nitrites removal, 100% in nitrates removal, and 91.9% in total coliform removal.

On 23 March 2021, the Suez Canal, one of the most heavily used shipping routes, was blocked by vast container ship – the Ever Given. Affecting over 400 vessels scheduled to pass through the Canal in the East-West and West-East directions. Such vessels experienced a dilemma of the use of routes and schedules. Other victims included vessels that were scheduled to arrive at/pass through the Canal, shippers, consignees, ship operators, ship owners, and container terminals. About USD$15 to 17 billion has been held up. This paper aims to reveal the potential damage caused to parties involved and examine the liability of parties involved. Specifically, the impact and legal consequences of the obstruction such as how the scope of general average applies as well as the possible solutions to minimise damage are discussed, followed by future developments. These results suggested that maritime transport support global supply chain linkages and economic growth, any disruption could bring huge impact and costs on various stakeholders along the supply chain.

With two different investment perspectives, manufacturers cooperate with retailers and recyclers to collect products from customers. By investing in the retailer, manufacturers gain an opportunity to sell new products, whereas by investing in the recycler, manufacturers can reduce production costs through remanufacturing. Therefore, manufacturers must determine the appropriate investment strategies to be applied to the two channels by analyzing the trade‐offs between these opportunities. For this purpose, we discuss three investment strategies: Revenue‐Sharing Investment, Direct Subsidy per Unit Returned Cartridge, and Hybrid Investment. The system dynamics model is used to construct scenarios of various investment strategies used by the manufacturer with the collection partners and analyze the corresponding changes in the revenues of the manufacturer. The results indicate that the application of the revenue‐sharing strategy and the hybrid strategy to support retailers and recyclers is effective in increasing manufacturer profit. More specifically, by considering the hybrid investment strategy of revenue‐sharing investment and the direct subsidy per unit returned cartridge for the recycler, the manufacturer can simultaneously avoid excess investment by the recycler and promote return activities through the recycler.</jats:p>",

Paths for information and goods designed and optimised for stable conditions may fail to meet the needs of emergency situations, whether suddenly imposed or planned. This chapter discusses the effects of the 2020 pandemic on food supply chains. These issues are considered as problems of information sharing and systemic behaviour with implications for both people and technology. Based on work in Wolverhampton, UK, the effect of the 2020 lockdown period on local businesses and charities is considered. In response to these observations, the design and development of Lupe, a prototype application to support the distribution and trading of food during periods of lockdown, is described. The aim of the system is to integrate the needs of consumers, businesses, and third sector organisations. The use of blockchain technology in the Lupe system to provide appropriate functionality and security for data is explored. Initial evaluations of the prototype by stakeholders are also included. </jats:p>"

However, due to the impact of typhoons every summer, the wind farms are cut off, causing serious damage to the wind turbines and causing significant economic losses. Based on optimizing the yaw system under typhoon conditions, this paper configures and selects the capacity of diesel generators. First, this article introduces the structure and main functions of the yaw control system. Secondly, through the study of the under-stage wind field model, the algorithm of wind speed extreme value and the calculation method of yaw angle and yaw direction are proposed, and hill climbing algorithm is introduced to optimize the work of the yaw control system. Then, a method for calculating the actual power of a single yaw control system is introduced. On this basis, the capacity configuration plan of the standby diesel generator set was determined, so that it can meet the normal yaw work of the whole field yaw system in the event of a power outage in the field to ensure the safety of the wind turbine.</jats:p>"

This experiment showed that absolute and relative N and P supply affected net photosynthesis (source activity) and biomass formation (sink activity), and the relationship between source and sink activities of Holcus lanatus L. under various nutrient treatments. H. lanatus was grown at three N:P ratios (5, 15, 45) with two absolute supply levels of N and P. Between N:P 5 at low level and N:P 45 at high level, and between N:P 45 at low level and N:P 5 at high level, there was a nine-fold difference in N and P supply. Maximum light-saturated net photosynthesis rate (Amax), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area, and shoot and root biomass were determined during and after the growth process. Amax was minimal at N:P 5 and increased only with increasing absolute N supply. Neither SLA nor leaf area were affected by N:P; increasing absolute P supply significantly increased leaf area. Shoot and root biomass were minimal at N:P 45 and increased dramatically with increasing absolute P supply. Plant biomass was not correlated with Amax. Our results highlight that H. lanatus growth is predominantly controlled by P supply and to a lesser extent by N, whereas net photosynthesis exerted no apparent control on growth under these sink-limited growth conditions. Our findings contribute to understanding of plant growth under sink-limited conditions.\n</jats:p>"

This empirical analysis uses a pooled time series from 1992 through 2017 including a data set of retail prices, three tax groups levied on cigarettes (specific tax, ad valorem tax, and V.A.T.), and revenue shares for three categories of stakeholders. The results indicate that the revenue share of the stakeholders is decreasing over the whole period, and specifically, their shares drop by half in the last 15 years. The regression results show that the revenue shares of tobacco companies are most affected by both excise taxes in a negative way, and similarly, both price and the excises affect significantly the revenue share of retailers, whereas the findings regarding distributors' revenues are insignificant. This knowledge is likely to be useful for policymakers in the development of effective tobacco control policies. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim/Purpose: The study attempts to analyse the influences of knowledge management capacity on company performance and supply chain practices. It also examines whether supply chain practices significantly and positively impact company performance.\n\nBackground: Knowledge management capacity is an essential tactical resource that enables the integration and coordination among supply chain stakeholders, but research examining the link between knowledge management capacity and supply chain practices and their impacts on company performance remains scarce.\n\nMethodology: The study uses correlation analysis and factor analysis to confirm the theoretical framework’s validity and structural equation modelling to test hypotheses. The data are obtained from 115 halal food firms in China (with a response rate of 82.7%).\n\nContribution: This study’s findings contribute to the Social Capital Theory by presenting the impacts of different supply chain practices on company performance. The findings also suggest the impact of intangible resources on enhancing company performance, contributing to the Resource-based View Theory. These results are a crucial contribution to both academicians and corporate managers working in the Halal food industry. Managers can apply these findings to discover and adopt knowledge management capacity with practical anticipation that these concepts will align with their company strategies. Also, the research motivates managers to concentrate their knowledge management on enhancing companies’ supply chain practices to achieve improved company performance. \n\nFindings: This study is an initial effort that provides empirical evidence regarding the relationships among supply chain, knowledge management, and company performance from the perspective of China’s halal food industry. The results prove that knowledge management capacity is the supply chains’ primary success determinant and influencer. Besides, knowledge management capacity positively influences company performance, and supply chain practices directly influence company performance.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Managers can apply these study findings to determine and increase knowledge management capacity with practical anticipation that these concepts will align with their company strategies. Also, the research motivates managers to concentrate their knowledge management on enhancing companies’ supply chain practices to achieve improved company performance.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: The study presents a new theoretical framework and empirical evidence for surveying halal food businesses in China. \n\nImpact on Society: These results are a significant contribution to the research field and industry focusing on halal foods.\n\nFuture Research: First, this research focuses only on halal food businesses in China; thus, it is essential to re-examine the hypothesized relations between the constructs in other Chinese business segments and regions. Next, the effect of variables and practices on the theorized framework should be taken into account and examined in other industries and nations.\n\n</jats:p>"

By establishing four differential game models, we investigate the sustainable operations and cooperation of this supply chain. The four game models are a Nash noncooperative game, Stackelberg game with cost sharing, Stackelberg game with fairness concerns and cost sharing, and centralized decision model. By using dynamic models and optimal control theory, we obtain the two members’ optimal equilibrium strategies in the supply chain. Analytical results show that the consumer reference price effect has a positive impact on the manufacturer’s effort level, retailer’s publicity level, and product brand goodwill, which can improve the supply chain performance. The retailer’s partial commitment to cost sharing can enhance the production enthusiasm of the manufacturer, improve the brand reputation of the product, and enhance the two members’ individual profitability. The distributional fairness concerns of the manufacturer not only prevent the manufacturer and retailer from achieving Pareto improvement but also lead to the decline of the manufacturer’s effort level and profitability. The research conclusions of this paper can provide some insights into the cooperation and sustainable development of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a comprehensive set of KPIs for sustainable supply chain management using a mixed method approach including analysing data from the literature survey, content analysis of sustainability reports of manufacturing firms and expert interviews. A 3-level hierarchical model is developed by classifying the identified KPIs into key sustainability dimensions as well as key supply chain decision-making areas including strategic, tactical and operational. A novel multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) based sustainability assessment framework is proposed. The proposed framework integrates value focussed thinking (VFT), intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and IF Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. The novelty of the research lies in (1) using a rigorous mixed method approach for KPIs identification and industrial validation (2) the development of a novel integrated intuitionistic sustainability assessment framework for decision making and (3) the innovative application of the proposed framework and associated methodologies in the context not explored before. The practical data on the performance ratings of various KPIs were obtained from the experts and a novel intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS was applied to benchmark the organisations for their sustainability performance. Furthermore, the case study shows the applicability of the proposed framework to evaluate and identify the problem areas of the organisations and yield guidance on KPIs by recognising the most significant areas requiring improvement. This research contributes to the practical implication by providing an innovative sustainability assessment framework for supply chain managers to evaluate and manage sustainability performance by making informed decisions related to KPIs.</jats:p>"

It is determined that for effective management it is important to distinguish between types of uncertainty: ignorance, uncertainty and risk, their essence and features of manifestation are considered. In the case of pandemic challenges, the levels of threats and risks become more complicated and increase, which makes the process of making adequate management decisions difficult, can lead to negative consequences of the functioning of supply chain. Uncertainty factors that need to be constantly taken into account in ensuring the viability and efficiency of supply chain are analyzed. In addition, the factors that can significantly affect the number of \"failures\" in the system - force majeure, natural disasters, political, financial crises, terrorism, piracy, various emergencies. It is established that the effectiveness of management decisions to increase the stability of supply chain will depend on activities to minimize the impact of subjectivity and objectivity of uncertainty of both internal and external environment, types of uncertainty and system elements that will shape the reliability and stability of supply chains. Under such conditions, managers will be able to make decisions that will maintain the required level of flexibility and adaptability of the system. In order to find ways to increase the level of reliability and stability of supply chains in difficult pandemic conditions, elements of stability are established, it is proposed to consider the reliability of supply chain through the probability of \"failure\" of the system within different components of supply chain infrastructure and flow processes. To meet the requirements of VUCA-world supply chain needs to use innovative approaches, diversity, build transparent information flows through trust throughout the supply chain, build an effective corporate culture that will include emotional resilience to constant challenges, social responsibility, continuous training and retraining, courage in making non-standard decisions.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses the current situation of pharmaceutical industries in India and its repercussions on general health. It also cites similar situations in other countries and the impacts of drug shortage at the moment. Several factors were found responsible for this crisis, especially during the pandemic, including shortage of manpower and disrupted transportation due to strict laws enforcing a nationwide lockdown and dependency of Indian pharmaceutical companies on China for active pharmaceutical ingredient procurement. The paper recommends measures to overcome this situation, emphasizing on relaxing the strict government policies, granting more control to the public sector, and modifying the company laws for workers. It also recommends the government to work in conjunction with the investors and innovators to help curb this problem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The economic progress of a country is surely influenced by its economic indicators. This indicator is an important thing to pay it attention. One of the economic indicators is inflation. Inflation will affect the economy aggregately. Due to the increase in inflation and inflation instability, it will indicate that the level of prices for goods and services in a country is high. In the end, this will have an impact on people's interest in buying these goods or using these services. Of course, the large impact will be sustainable on national income. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effect of interest rates and the money supply on inflation in Indonesia in 2017-2019. The types of data used in this study are quantitative data and the data sources used are taken from BPS for the 2017-2019 period. .The final result of this study showed that based on the results of the analysis, it could be concluded that interest rates and the amount of money have an impact on inflation with a significance value of 0,000296. Meanwhile, the t-test results indicate that interest rates and the money supply have an impact on inflation, respectively, with values of significance are  0.0371 and 0.0286.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on the planning of mine supply chain under the big data. The mine supply chain usually contains three stages, which is mining, processing, and ore product transportation. This paper tackles the difficulty of variable cut‐off grade by establishing a robust optimization model. To solve the robust optimization model, the nonlinear constraints in the model were linearized first. Then, the specific parameter values were determined through the employment of the hypothesis test in statistics, and the robust optimization model was solved finally. The analysis results show that the robust optimization model can be stabilized when the parameters are subject to disturbance. Finally, sensitivity analysis experiments are carried out for several parameters in the model to find out the influence of each parameter on the model. This paper combines mine supply chain planning with big data, which not only improves the production and transportation efficiency of ore products, but also reduces related costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The electronic communications sector is very important sector of a national economy. It provides an opportunity for facilitating business activities and it is a good area for investment. A small number of operators and a large number of users operate in most markets of the electronic communications sector. The conditions under which electronic communications services are available to users in different countries diverge, among other things, due to the degree of liberalization of individual markets in these countries. The Republic of Serbia has significantly liberalized this sector of economic activity by adjusting it according to the regulations of the European Union. However, certain entry barriers have remained, primarily related to the licenses that operators need to obtain to operate in the Serbian market. The paper aims to investigate the level of concentration in selected markets of the electronic communications sector, namely: mobile telecommunication networks and services, broadband Internet services and media content distribution. The research showed a high level of concentration measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index in all three markets. A further increase in concentration is expected in all analyzed markets in the short term. These research results require more attention from regulatory bodies because they increase the possibility of some form of non-competitive behaviour by undertakings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ever since a novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan(China), things have changed to a large extent. It has shattered the entire world in all the possible sectors by its continuous spread. Scientists all around the world have put in in-numerous amount of efforts as a result of which the world has finally witnessed its some of the first potential vaccines which have got approvals for emergency use in various countries. Now the next crucial step that comes in this process of fighting this virus is the supply of vaccines to all the different parts of the world. But there are certain challenges to this process as vaccines need to be constantly monitored all the time for their temperatures, humidity and other environmental factors which vary a lot depending on the geographical conditions. Also, maintaining drug safety is the most important challenge as counterfeiting of vaccines and drugs has always been a concern for the pharmaceutical industry. Manual traceability for all the ingredients used during manufacturing is a very difficult process and doesn’t even give a full guarantee for the same. This can lead to serious health issues in the consumers and can even result in death. The power of Blockchain and it’s principle of proof of concept can deal with this problem by maintaining a record for all the events taking place in this process right from manufacturing to vaccinations in hospitals. BLE Beacons can also come very handy here as they are small, inexpensive and easy to use devices that can provide real time updates by tracking various parameters of the vaccine. This paper aims at suggesting an entire system of supply chain of vaccines using Blockchain based record, QR(Quick Response) Codes for vaccine safety and BLE Beacons network for real time tracking and news updates of the vaccines.</jats:p>"

The most environmentally friendly solution of this problem is using of the timber, which was felled during forest sanitation outside the Anchuk village. Environmental friendliness and other advantages of the biofuel are the main reason of using this type of heat source. This article presents comparative analysis of the production and delivery costs of the fuel wood chips and pellets for Baikalsk. Pressed fuel wood chips and chips with standard bulk density are considered. The levelized cost of heat, unit cost and capital costs are used as indicators of the economic efficiency of pellets and fuel wood chips. According to the results of all three economic indicators, pressed fuel chips proved to be most effective type of heat source than others. Unit cost and LCOH are roughly the same for pellets and for pressed fuel chips. However, the capital costs of production and transportation of the pellets are almost 50% higher than for pressed chips. Thereby, it is preferable to choose pressed fuel wood chips burning for economic reasons of the reducing transportation expenses.</jats:p>",

Likewise, the efforts of the government, especially the province of Lampung, are trying to carry out development through equal distribution of electrical energy to areas where the National Cross Border Center (PLBN) is located, such as Mesuji Regency, although it is still unstable and uneven throughout the village. The condition of the lack of electricity supply causes blackouts to occur frequently and in a relatively long period of time. This greatly affects community activities and is no exception in terms of education or at school, especially in the use of technology-based learning media and school administrative matters, such as filling out report cards and so on. Nowadays, filling out report cards must be done through technology-based applications that require electronic equipment such as laptops to use them. The design of the School Solar Panel System (SSPS) is intended in an effort to increase the availability of electricity in supporting teacher professionalism in carrying out learning activities. So that with the design of the School Solar Panel System which will be implemented later, the electricity supply remains available even though there is a power outage.</jats:p>"

In PwMS and in matched healthy volunteers, we applied a newly developed dual-calibrated fMRI method of acquisition and analysis to map grey matter (GM) cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and effective oxygen diffusivity of the capillary network (D<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>). We also quantified physical and cognitive function in PwMS and controls. There was no significant difference in GM volume between 22 PwMS and 20 healthy controls (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0.302).

No significant between-group differences were observed for OEF (PwMS vs. controls: 0.38 ± 0.09 vs. 0.39 ± 0.02,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>=0.358). Regional analysis showed widespread reductions in CMRO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>and D<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>for PwMS compared to healthy volunteers. There was a significant correlation between physiological measures and T2 lesion volume, but no association with current clinical disability. Our findings demonstrate concurrent reductions in oxygen supply and consumption in the absence of an alteration in oxygen extraction that may be indicative of a reduced demand for oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), an impaired transfer of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>from capillaries to mitochondria, and/or a reduced ability to utilise O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>that is available at the mitochondria.

In this article, a bi-objective integrated scheduling problem of production and distribution is addressed in a production environment with identical parallel machines. Besides, two objective functions are considered as measures for customer satisfaction and reduction of the manufacturer’s costs. The first objective is considered aiming at minimizing the total weighted tardiness and total operation time. The second objective is considered aiming at minimizing the total cost of the company’s reputational damage due to the number of tardy orders, total earliness penalty, and total batch delivery costs. First, a mathematical programming model is developed for the problem. Then, two well-known meta-heuristic algorithms are designed to spot near-optimal solutions since the problem is strongly NP-hard. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is designed using a mutation function, followed by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with a one-point crossover operator and a heuristic mutation operator. The experiments on MOPSO and NSGA-II are carried out on small, medium, and large scale problems. Moreover, the performance of the two algorithms is compared according to some comparing criteria. The computational results reveal that the NSGA-II performs highly better than the MOPSO algorithm in small scale problems. In the case of medium and large scale problems, the efficiency of the MOPSO algorithm was significantly improved. Nevertheless, the NSGA-II performs robustly in the most important criteria.</jats:p>"

Based on this background, this paper considers the impact of consumer low‐carbon preferences on market demand and the impact of uncertainty in carbon emission‐reduction behaviour. We construct a stochastic differential game model with upstream and downstream enterprises based on cost‐sharing coordination under a cost subsidy. From a dynamic perspective, this paper researches the optimal equilibrium strategy and evolution characteristics of the joint emission‐reduction mechanism in a supply chain. This paper discusses the sensitivity of the parameters and uses numerical simulation to verify the impact of each parameter on the emission‐reduction decision‐making activities of stakeholders after introducing the cost subsidy. The results show that a cost subsidy policy can promote carbon emission‐reduction investment and supply chain profit.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Appreciation for agricultural sustainability and ecosystem services (ESS) has received considerable attention from the scientific community. However, research has not yet systematically and sufficiently considered the spatial dimension of ESS trade-offs as a source of conflicts. Moreover, approaches for ESS management that address a wide range of beneficiaries and their interactions at landscape scale are lacking. Our main research question is how to motivate different beneficiaries of agricultural landscapes to cooperate in reducing supply–demand mismatches and accompanied conflicts, as well as to assess how different scenarios would impact relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We present a novel and conceptual integrated model in which we employ a combination of three methodological tools: participatory geographic information system (PGIS), agent-based modelling (ABM) and a Bayesian belief network (BBN). The objective of our model simulation is to identify and manage site-specific spatial trade-off patterns and to provide decision support for shifting competitive behavior of individual stakeholders in satisfying their demand for ESS to a collective and cooperative scheme, while jointly striving to attain relevant targets outlined in the SDGs. Attached to this work is a short video depicting our conceptual model. We strongly suggest that tackling a complex social-ecological system necessitates a highly integrated modelling approach that fosters the transition from farm- to landscape-scale management, from individualistic to collective action, and from competitive to cooperative behavior.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Summary. Introduction: At present, training of highly qualified military personnel including cadet corps students acquires special importance. Educational programs in cadet corps provide for high daily physical activity of students. At the same time, daily food rationing regulated by current sanitary norms and rules does not comply with higher energy expenditures of such students. The purpose of our study was to substantiate a healthy diet of students of boarding schools taking into account their total daily energy expenditures, calorie needs and requirements for micro- and macronutrients ensuring a high level of functional state of the body, high mental and physical performance. Materials and methods: We studied indicators of health status and physical development of cadets based on the results of medical examinations, results of assessing daily physical activity, and school meals. Daily timekeeping and pulse measurements were used to estimate daily energy expenditures and activity levels. Evaluation of nutrition was based on the analysis of a cyclic menu, process charts, menu layouts, and catering hours. Conclusions: The regulated daily norms of food products adopted in cadet corps subordinate to the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation are significantly lower than actual energy expenditures of their students. This reality determines the necessity of revising food rationing. Draft guidelines for hygienic justification of the recommended diet for students with a higher level of physical activity have been developed. The proposals for improvement of boarding school meals were included in the appropriate sanitary rules and regulations within the framework of the regulatory guillotine.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, two approaches, namely theoretical and practical, were used to accomplish four objectives. For the theoretical approach, based on literature review and case studies, the objective used was to identify, classify and validate the challenges that the construction supply chain (CSC) encounter. For the practical approach, a survey questionnaire was employed to quantify the CCSC and investigate the perception of architectural design firms (ADFs) in Egypt towards achieving sustainability by overcoming the CCSC during the design process. Based on the results, the research developed a framework to overcome the CCSC as an approach towards achieving sustainability in construction projects during the design process. The research identified and validated 20 challenges that the CSC encounter towards achieving sustainability during the design process. These challenges were classified under four categories, namely (1) design and technical process; (2) coordination, information flow and accuracy; (3) material specification, technology, supplier rework and whole life cycle cost; and (4) skills gap of the qualified architects and design managers and non-compliance to building codes, regulations, laws and standards. In addition, a survey questionnaire was employed to rank these challenges according to their importance on 1–5 Likert scale using the measure of central tendency and dispersion and relative importance index (RII).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of the Internet age, the gradual deepening of reforms, and the continuous improvement of marketization, the financial ecological environment is directly related to the risk of financial institutions’ loans and the enthusiasm to support local economic development. Capital is accompanied by the physical development and evolution of the production and circulation of goods. After thousands of years of historical development and evolution, it has formulated its own development law and internal logic. In view of the unclear environmental and social evaluation indicators in supply chain research and the model’s failure to accurately describe the real supply chain network, an adaptive dynamic relaxation approximation algorithm model is proposed. This model introduces upstream and downstream transit stations as distributors and as a hub between customers, the transportation mode is improved to horizontal and vertical coordinated transportation, and multiple transportation methods are used for transportation. In this paper, the experimental group adopts a new model based on the approximate algorithm of dynamic relaxation factors, and the control group adopts the original old model. The two groups conduct comprehensive data analysis on social indicators, self‐indicators, initial indicators, economic indicators, and environmental indicators in each year. Starting from the dimension, comprehensively consider the selection of indicators to measure the level of enterprise performance. The experiment proves that the transportation loss in the green supply chain is between the new model and the old model. When the number of partners is small, the degree of the optimal solution between the new and old models is not obvious, and the degree of optimization of the new model relative to the old model is increasing. It has a significant statistical difference (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). This shows that efforts to build a good financial ecological environment and an honest and reliable and healthy economic ecological environment are of great importance for promoting the continuous and rapid growth of the social economy.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to design a hybrid RO/NF filtration system that can operate at low pressure. The designed hybrid RO/NF permeate staging has proven to be able to produce clean water from saltwater wells in Tanjung Lame village at low pressure. To obtain optimum results, the designed hybrid RO/NF permeate staging is operated at the first and second stage pressure of 6 and 3 bar, respectively.

The variant of building proportional feedback on output state variables is used for the regulator in the system with parametric and external disturbances. Due to the technical impossibility of measuring the voltage on the load, a combined optimal regulator with negative feedback is organized, which makes it possible to stabilize the voltage at the payload within the specified limits when receiving data from the output filter of voltage source inverter.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the fusion of wireless sensor modules and UHF RFID readers, this paper develops a UHF RFID reading and writing system based on wireless sensing technology and designs a communication interface circuit that integrates wireless sensing and RFID technology. The financial supervision mechanism of the Internet of Things compatible with these two technologies improves the communication distance limitation of the RFID system and improves the flexibility of the RFID reading and writing system. Secondly, in view of the security issues of WSN small and medium data distribution, this paper proposes a lightweight small data supply chain financial supervision program. The solution adopts two‐way authentication technology based on the improvement of the Internet of Things supply chain, the negotiation of the Internet of Things supply chain, and a lightweight encryption algorithm, which realizes the secure communication between ordinary nodes and gateway nodes, and can more effectively solve the problem of small and medium data distribution in WSN to resist the deficiencies of the financial supervision mechanism; compared with existing solutions of the same magnitude, it has higher security and efficiency. Experimental simulation shows that an important problem in the converged network is the imbalance of node energy consumption. In order to reduce the negative impact of the imbalance of energy consumption on the network, this article compares the two for direct transmission protocol and minimum energy multihop routing protocol. From the perspective of supply chain process performance, based on the proposed technical impact framework, it analyzes how companies actually carry out ID application work, making the research from general to individual, from theory to practice. The network energy consumption calculation method under this protocol improves an improved network architecture model that increases the communication scale. The test results show that the technical impact analysis framework established in this article based on the theory of the Internet of Things and the advantages of RFID technology can analyze the automation benefits, information benefits, and transformative benefits brought by automatic identification technology to the supply chain and introduce complementary resources and potential factors. It provides a theoretical basis and operation method for measuring the impact of RFID on the performance of the financial supervision process based on the Internet of Things supply chain in practical applications.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to identify the actors in the value chain, evaluate each actor’s value addition, identify the roles of men and women in the chain, and identify the issues, concerns, and entry points for intervention. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and tracer survey interviews were done to gather data. A semi-structured questionnaire was directed to 189 respondents within and outside Taal Lake. The study showed that the tawilis marketing system is limited to the local market. Tawilis is traded fresh and processed. The chain’s key actors include the fishers, fish buyers (wholesaler, retailer, peddlers, and contracted fish buyers), processors, and consumers. The outcome of the value chain analysis of the tawilis industry showed that commercial processors have the highest value-added due to the place, form, and time transformation of the product. Meanwhile, the fishers and small-scale fish buyers have the lowest value-added during lean and peak season, respectively. The tawilis industry provides livelihood to the marginal fisherfolk, which is the first supply chain link. Several strategies were recommended in the form of process, product, function, and overall upgrading to uplift the economic benefit of the different actors in the chain and boost the tawilis industry. These include the improvement on the fishing operations, upgrading of fishing gear and other paraphernalia, provision of training on post-harvest techniques (handling, preservation, processing, value-adding, product development, etc.), market matching strategies, improvement in farm to market road transportation, establishment of fish processing facilities, and access to credit, loans or grants from the national and local governments.</jats:p>"

The current study discovers the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on business performance and the environmental sustainability of a developing country, Bangladesh. Cost and profit are the two important indicators of business performance. On the other hand, environmental sustainability is expressed by waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. Primary data were collected through the distribution of web links and direct interaction with the participants of different firms practicing GSCM practices in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Hypotheses were formulated and evaluated accordingly. This study found that the impact of implementation of GSCM practices differs with respect to cost, profit, waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. GSCM practices have a statistically significant impact on cost, waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. The impact of GSCM practices on profit was statistically insignificant. It was found that lack of IT implementation, high cost of waste disposal, uncertainty and competition in the market, resistance to change, and lack of top management support are the major barriers to implement GSCM practices in Bangladesh. </jats:p>",

For example, the implementation of two-vote system has led to the increase of accounts receivable of pharmaceutical circulation enterprises year by year with a decrease of accounts receivable turnover rate and an increasing pressure of capital turnover. The enterprise accounts receivable securitization is an important way for enterprises to broaden financing channels, reduce financing costs, revitalize existing assets and improve the efficiency of asset use, while the securitization of statement type assets is the only standardized financial tool to reduce the leverage ratio of enterprises and realize financial optimization. Asset securitization can relieve the pressure of capital turnover and reduce the cost of financing. The case analysis part of this paper analyzes the factors that promote the financial innovation of enterprise’s supply chain from the macro and micro perspectives.

Purposive sampling technique was employed to obtain information from both the management and staff of the MSMEs. One hundred (100) questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The obtained data were then analysed using the descriptive method.&#x0D;\nResults: The study found out that the manufacturing MSME sector appreciates good supply chain management practices, but does not practise it. The study discovered that the sector has not established long term relationships with its customers and suppliers. The sector was found to face several challenges which threaten its long term growth and survival, the most worrying challenges being the lack of financial resources, failure to practice continuous quality improvement, low integration of process technologies and forecasting challenges. The study also revealed that when implemented SCM practices deliver a number of benefits to the MSMEs. For example, increased response to the customer, cost-cutting on service delivery, improved information sharing and improved capacity to offer after-sale services.  It is evident that MSMEs would perform well if supply chain management activities are improved. This, however, can be accomplished, if the MSMEs engage in strategic partnerships, customer relationship, high level of information sharing, information quality, as well as continuous quality improvement.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study could be replicated in other industry sectors of the economy and also in other developing countries to help build on the body of knowledge.</jats:p>"

This can be explained by the fact that scenarios and datasets used to design and validate those HL models are often too simple compared to the real situations. In this chapter, a scenario-based approach based on a five-step methodology has been developed to bridge this gap by designing a set of valid scenarios able to assess disaster needs in regions subject to recurrent disasters. The contribution, usable by both scholars and practitioners, demonstrates that defining such valid scenario sets is possible for recurrent disasters. Finally, the proposal is validated on a concrete application case based on Peruvian recurrent flood and earthquake disasters. </jats:p>"

The significant increase in consumers’ awareness of food freshness, nutrition, and safety makes the temperature‐controlled supply chain (TCSC) the focus of food logistics safety. However, a large number of Chinese companies are still reluctant to invest in the food supply chain, resulting in a high rate of supply chain logistics loss. This research aims to establish an economic model to explain why these companies do not invest and under what conditions they will do. The results show that high economic investment is the main reason that hinders companies’ willingness to build TCSC. Large companies with bigger production are more willing to invest in TCSC than small companies. Besides, larger companies running with high‐quality products could get more profit while small companies operating with normal products are less competitive.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer sets the wholesale and online price, and the retailer decides the retail price with the retailer’s fairness preference and consumer’s online channel preference. Through investigating the combined impacts of fairness preference and channel preference on the enterprises’ operational strategies, this paper obtains some meaningful results. If a manufacturer thinks over the fairness preference, he decreases the wholesale price to mitigate a loss of retailer and benefit the supply chain design. The manufacturer intends to set up the online channel with a lower acceptance as the fairness preference grows. However, the gains from enhanced online channel acceptance cannot compensate for the manufacturer’s loss by the fairness effect that benefits the retailer. Moreover, the manufacturer cannot neglect the retailer’s fairness preference generating a “lose-lose” case for both members.</jats:p>",

The purposes of the study are to (1) investigate the relationship between three dimensions, namely integration, flexibility, and performance; and (2) examine the mediating effects of supply chain flexibility. This research collected annual reports from the Indonesian basic and chemical industry from 2014 to 2017. Content analysis was used to extract information from companies’ annual reports, and hierarchical analysis examined the hypotheses. The results show that external information integration positively influences both reactive and proactive flexibility. Furthermore, proactive flexibility significantly affects financial performance and operational performance. Moreover, both reactive and proactive flexibility have positive mediating effects on the connection between external information integration and operational performance. Lastly, reactive flexibility positively mediates external information integration’s effect on financial performance. As the market has been becoming more competitive, this study provides important insights for decision-makers. This study contributes to the knowledge of the Indonesian basic and chemical supply chain by considering both financial and operational performance, especially as these performance indexes measure different dimensions. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the solar energy received by the earth is 1.74 x 1017 W / hour, of which about 1-2% is converted into wind energy. However, in terms of total energy potential, Indonesia only uses around 10 MWp of solar energy, the difference is that wind energy which is planned to reach 250 MW in 2025 only uses 1 MW of the total potential. Skyscrapers are places with enormous wind energy potential. Because if the height exceeds 150 m, the reference point of the building can be called a skyscraper, which will cause high wind speed at the top of the building. This phenomenon is caused by the influence of the friction force which suppresses the wind speed, therefore the higher the position, the higher the wind speed. With this potential, to provide additional power and help save energy in existing facilities in the building, a smart photovoltaic and vertical turbine prototype design was created. The prototype design is a combination of weathered turbines and solar panels, the reason for using this type of turbine is because it can rotate at low wind speed (low wind speed) and has a very simple structure. In addition, because it uses a vertical shaft, the generator and gearbox can be placed close to the ground, making maintenance easier. The working principle of this prototype is designed to use a turbine to convert wind energy on the roof of the building into electrical energy, then mix it with electrical energy converted from solar energy by solar panels, so that electrical energy will be more optimal.</jats:p>"

Moreover, humans are merely able to understand cause-and-effect relationships that are close in time and space, not the paradigm of many complex socio-technical systems. Decision-making processes shall rely on models that help harness a problem´s associated complexity – among them the dynamics of supply chains. Models typically fall into two broad categories: mental and formal models. Supply chains are complex systems, which may exhibit complex behaviour patterns. Decisions and policies within organizational systems are the causes of many problems, among them undesirable oscillations and other problematic patterns of the parameters of interest. A system is a grouping of parts that work together for a purpose. Hence, the systems dynamics methodology is an adequate approach to deal with fuel supply chain management. A model was developed that helps manage marine gasoil supply chains in the context of the navy. </jats:p>"

This integrated powerful retailer supply chain model has not yet been discussed in previous supply chain coordination systems literature. We propose an annual total cost function and properties and develop theorems to illustrate that a unique optimal solution minimizes the relevant cost per year.

Combination of different energy efficiency measures and energy supply systems are investigated with an optimal investment model. The cost and environmental impact of the combinations are evaluated. An important outcome is that within the evaluated combinations, the choice of energy supply system has little impact on the cost effectiveness of the energy efficiency measures. However, it has a significant impact on the GHG emissions. The results also highlight the importance of performing energy efficiency measures in coordination with other renovating measures, both regarding cost effectiveness and environmental impact.

The results on both household and citywide scale showed boreholes were perceived to deliver a high service level. On the household scale, 93% of boreholes user got ‘high’ score for water service assessment, while dug wells were only 76%. During the 8 months survey, it was shown that 45% of respondents change their main source of drinking water from self-supply to other source for several reasons.

This method calculates the level value of the overall performance of the SC. This level value is a value between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the higher the overall performance level of the SC.

While rivers can adjust to changing flow and sediment supply through some combination of adjustments of channel slope, bed‐surface sorting, and channel shape, the degree to which riffle‐pools may adopt these changes in response to changing flows and sediment supplies remains unclear. This article presents results from a flume experiment investigating how constant‐ and variable‐width channels adjust their morphology in response to changing flow and increased sediment supply. Two flume geometries were used: (1) constant‐width and (2) variable‐width, characterized by a sinusoidal pattern with a mean width equal to that of the first channel. The variable‐width channel developed bed undulations in phase with the width, representing riffle‐pools. The experiment consisted of three phases for each flume geometry: (1) steady flow, constant sediment supply; (2) unsteady flow, constant sediment supply; and (3) unsteady flow, doubled sediment supply. Unsteady flow was implemented in the form of repeated symmetrical stepped hydrographs, with a mean discharge equal to that in the steady flow phase. In all phases the bed and sediment supply were composed of a sand/gravel mixture ranging from 1 to 8 mm. In both the straight and variable‐width channels, transitioning from steady flow to repeated hydrographs did not result in significant changes in bed morphology. The two channel geometries had different responses to increased sediment supply: the slope of the straight channel increased nearly 40%, while the variable‐width channel reduced the relief between bars and pools and decreased the variability in cross‐sectional elevation with a slight slope increase. Bar‐pool relief varied with repeat discharge hydrographs. Pool elevation changed twice the distance of bar elevations, emphasizing the relevance of pool scour for riffle‐pool self‐maintenance in channels with width variations.</jats:p>",

In line with reducing carbon emission two possibilities are applied in this paper involving the green technologies investment and the trade and cap policy. As simultaneous consideration of all motivating factors raises conflicts between the members in terms of undertaking the costs, a cooperative supply chain, as well as a cost-sharing (CS) contract in non-cooperative form, is devised to alleviate the conflicts and boost the performance of the supply chain. In order to find the optimal decision variables and profits in the CS contract, two game-theoretical approaches, namely Nash and Stackelberg, are applied. The results present the sufficiently of both the cooperative chain and the CS contact. In addition, the analysis of parameters in the CS contract in Stackelberg game indicates that when the distributor undertakes a part of the costs, positive impacts on the other motivating factors are observed. However, there is no interaction among the motivating factors in the Nash game.</jats:p>"

The initial strategy was to approach mapping the actors in the pumpkin agriculture sector from upstream to downstream. The aim of this research was to map the supply chain management of pumpkin in pumpkin production centers in East Java. This research used qualitative methods and participatory approaches. Data collection was done through in-depth interviews, observation, and study of documents and data. The results showed that the management of pumpkin supply chain in East Java had a structure, mechanism, and institutional pattern. The existing structure was formed through the role of 9 (nine) business operators in the pumpkin agriculture sector. Information flow occurs in two directions in the form of information on the quality and quantity of pumpkin harvested, the market price of pumpkin, previous collaboration experience, products that have been produced from pumpkin, pumpkin distribution schedule, and product innovations that have been produced from pumpkin harvest. Financial flow was carried out in the form of cash and credit between business actors. The product flow is in the form of fresh pumpkin products to semi-processed products such as pumpkin chips and pumpkin flour. Based on the supply chain flow patterns, the interwoven relationships that occur are vertical/horizontal as well as trade and partnership patterns.</jats:p>"

The article is focused on the refinement and improvement of existing services' modes of supply and theoretical aspects of the international trade in services operations; identification of future trends in the service sector and the use of existing supply models. Four trade in services modes of supply depending on the need to move the supplier or consumer are distinguished: cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence and presence of natural persons. It was found that the existence of trade in services modes of supply is due to the specifics of international trade in services, such as the need for direct contact between supplier and consumer, greater protection by the state compared to trade in goods, impossibility of some services types selling in international markets, regulation by domestic legislation of individual countries etc. Identification of a fifth trade in services mode of supply in which the consumer and supplier move to a third country to trade in services is proposed. It is established that creating of a commercial presence is the most used model. The future growth of services’ trade in the cross-border regime is substantiated as a consequence of the necessity to operate service enterprises during the pandemic and in the post-quarantine period. The increase of tourism services sales in the cross-border mode of supply due to the active introduction of virtual reality technologies and the development of virtual tourism is forecasted. The transition of construction services to cross-border supply due to active development of modular construction and use of the latest technologies such as 3D printers and artificial intelligence is predicted. However, it is emphasized that it is impossible to completely exclude the physical movement of the supplier or consumer in the provision of certain types of services, even with the advancement of technology. The presented study results can be used as a basis for further research into models of trade in services and development of effective services trade policies during quarantine and post-quarantine period.</jats:p>"

The demand for electricity for pumping equipment will depend on various factors: the operating modes of pumping stations and installations, the equipment used measures to reduce the cost of electricity consumed, etc. The current practice indicates extremely inefficient operation of pumping equipment. Currently, a large number of pumping stations of water supply and sanitation systems operate in an uneconomical mode. Very often, this is due to incorrect selection of pumping equipment, outdated pumping equipment, the operation of pumps in non- calculation mode. In addition, pumping equipment has been installed in many industries since the establishment of production. Such equipment is morally and technically outdated. Now,technological progress allows us to use more efficient equipment and materials that allow us to reduce energy consumption. The article presents an analysis of the energy consumption of a pumping station of technical water supply on the example of JSC «Omsk Kauchuk», a variant of modernization is proposed in order to reduce the consumption of electricity by pumping equipment. The need to modernize the pumping station of technical water supply is associated with a significant service life and high –energy consumption of pumping equipment. Two pump brands were selected and a comparative analysis was carried out. Based on calculations of energy consumption and technological characteristics, the most profitable and optimal version of the D6300-80-2b pump was chosen, since the pump performance is greater and the power consumption is less than that of the JETEX DS600-750 pump, as well as reducing the wear rate of operating elements, improving the pump’s suction capacity</jats:p>"

These circumstances complicate the operation of smart grids, especially in microgrids. One of possible ways to improve the quality of smart power supply grids is to use a three-stage solid-state transformer with galvanic isolation and two DC links, an arrangement that makes it possible to connect power supply sources and consumers, and to arrange backup storage of electricity in storage batteries. The aim of the study is to analyze the electric power quality at the output of a three-stage solid-state transformer powered by an unbalanced three-phase voltage source. The study was carried out by numerical modeling using the Matlab/Simulink software package. The modeling parameters are given, and the current and voltage waveforms at the solid-state transformer output are obtained. Phasors of the input and output voltages are constructed with expanding them into zero-, positive-, and negative sequence harmonic components. The harmonic distortion coefficients for current and voltage in each phase, and the voltage unbalance coefficients for the zero and negative sequences at the solid-state transformer input and output are determined using the method of symmetric components. It has been shown that by using solid-state transformers it becomes possible to obtain noticeably better quality of electric energy and eliminate the unbalance to the levels stipulated by the relevant state standard. It is shown that solid-state transformers are a promising technology as part of smart power supply grids, which opens the possibility to control and adjust power supply parameters, improve the power supply quality, distribute power flows between the sources and consumers, and integrate DC and AC grids of various voltage and power levels.</jats:p>"

Therefore, based on the theory of green supply chain, this research constructs a dynamic multi-objective model under the uncertain decision-making environment with the realization of the equilibrium of the total economic cost and carbon emission of electric-coal supply chain as the decision goal, and taking the coal supply capacity and and other practical requirements as the constraints. The following equilibrium model is applied to a electric-coal supply chain in the southwestern region of Y Province. With full consideration of different carbon emission reduction scenarios, the total economic cost and carbon emission balance plan of electric-coal supply chain under five different emission reduction scenarios were obtained, which verified the practicability and effectiveness of the equilibrium model. The results show that the equilibrium model can effectively alleviate the conflict between the economic cost and carbon emission reduction. Finally, based on data analysis, we put forward management suggestions from macro, meso and micro levels to better realize the greenization of electric-coal supply chain.</jats:p>",

This paper explores the implication of the heterogeneity of environment and environment‐based preference on the evolution of cooperation in supply networks. Cellular automata are considered to examine the synchronized evolution of cooperation and defection across supply networks. The Prisoner’s Dilemma Game and Snowdrift Game reward schemes have been formed, and the heterogeneous environment and environmental preference have been applied. The results show that the heterogeneous environment’s degree leads to higher cooperation for both Prisoner’s Dilemma Game and Snowdrift Game. We also probe into the impact of the environmental preference on the evolution of cooperation, and the results of which confirm the usefulness of preference of environment.

However, how N application rates regulate the vascular bundle structure, matter transport and grain filling of spring maize under a high planting density has been poorly understood thus far. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between grain filling, vascular bundle structure and matter transport efficiency (MTE) of spring maize in the field. Zhongdan909 (ZD909) was used as the experimental material in a 2-year field experiment from 2015 to 2016, and it was grown under different N levels (0, 150, and 300 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) applied to the grain-filling stage of plots with planting densities of 67,500 plants ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (ND) and 90,000 plants ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> (HD). Nitrogen application significantly optimized the structure of the big and small vascular bundles. In particular, there was an increase in the total number of small vascular bundles in the peduncle and cob of the ear system, i.e., increases of 51.8% and 25.7%, respectively, and the proportions of small vascular bundles to the total number of vascular bundles in the peduncle and cob were significantly increased. The root bleeding sap and MTE of maize were significantly increased by N application under both ND and HD, as indicated by the significant increase in the rate of <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C-photosynthate allocation to grain and amount of postsilking dry matter at maturity. Moreover, N application greatly improved the mean grain-filling rate (<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>mean</jats:italic></jats:sub>) under ND and HD by 30.0% and 36.1%, respectively, and the grain-filling rate increased, leading to a distinct improvement in the grain sink at the grain-filling stage. We concluded that nitrogen application significantly optimized the vascular bundle structure of the ear system, increased the MTE and improved photosynthate distribution to the grain, ultimately enhancing the filling rate and grain yield.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy storage units (ESU) and distributed generation (DG) plants including those using renewable energy sources can be used to develop isolated power supply systems (IPSS) and enhance their reliability. Operation of DG plants in the IPSS requires to consider restrictions for consumers maximum load, as well as effects of abrupt load increase or load shedding on the generating plants. These problems can be resolved using ESU and intelligent technologies for DG plants control. The paper considers IPSS of an industrial facility with turbogenerator plants (TGP), wind power plant (WPP) and high-capacity ESU for which fuzzy control systems and prognostic controllers were used. The simulation was performed in the MATLAB system using the Simulink and SimPowerSystems software packages. Normal and emergency modes were studied in IPSS with TGP, WPP, and high-capacity ESU. The simulation results indicated that combined use of high-capacity ESU and prognostic controller of TGP generator rotor speed allows to ensure stability and survivability of IPSS enhancing its damping properties. The auto-prognostic controller of the TGP generator, which does not require special adjustment, provides high quality indicators of the IPSS control in all considered modes.</jats:p>"

The current fashion industry is driven by the ephemeral nature of fashion and its associated wastes which are not very sustainable. Although literature has demonstrated that operations research can be used to reduce inventory wastes, whether emerging technologies can reformat the whole mode of production in the fashion industry to be more sustainable remains unknown. Through interviewing professionals who specialize in the three key stages in the supply chain, this chapter concludes that the transition to sustainability is possible if technology is not just regarded as a tool to reduce carbon emissions, but used to materialize the sustainable design philosophy and integrated into the sustainability rebranding process in the whole supply chain from beginning to end. </jats:p>"

Studying these cases proved that, despite their diversity, several common features could be taken into account in the early detection and possible prevention of certain future cases. Accepting that such incidents may occur anywhere and anytime, societies need to be prepared for their more effective response. Informing citizens about the best way to react to a mass shooting event is considered crucial and essential. The \"\"Run-Hide-Fight\"\" guideline/directive seems to be the most appropriate guideline given to the public. Proper training, of both the Suppression Forces and the emergency medical care providers, is considered of utmost importance. The role of the Incident Commander, regarding the incident management, as well as the external bleeding control of the injured people, are factors of paramount importance in trying to mitigate the casualties from such an incident. The alertness of both citizens and organizations/structures may lead to early detection of potential perpetrators and thereby averting a mass shooting incident. To achieve increased survival and a reduced number of casualties from a mass shooting event it is vital proper education be present at all levels. The response to a mass shooting event should be imprinted in an Emergency plan. Such a plan should have been decided and made, by the Security and Suppression Forces, the Healthcare Institutions, and the Public Safety Answering Point.

Based on thematic literature review and qualitative research (in-depth interviews with experts, focus groups, observations, and reports’ analysis), multi-item measurement quantitative BSC scale and strategy map were proposed to measure and communicate the GESCM performance of a hierarchical chain with multiple nodes and cross-functional green practices. This article conceptually contributes to the active debate on contemporary GESCM performance measurement. It integrates the literature of green production and operations management, strategic management and entrepreneurial supply chain management (ESCM) to investigate the unexplored context of GESCM research. It empirically assesses GESCM performance of an attractive network using BSC and maps its strategy with its multidisciplinary environment-friendly practices. The GESCM performance was measured in terms of four integrated perspectives (innovative and proactive processes, learning and growth, financial gains and supply chain stakeholders’ delight). Results showed that BSC and SM are effective and efficient tools in managing the performance of a successful GESC in an emerging market. Royal Herbs’ BSC key performance indicators (KPIs), which were used in assessing a GESCM strategy, indicate improvements along the BSC’s four perspectives. Results give green entrepreneurs/manufacturers in an emerging market as Egypt a comprehensive view on how they can effectively assess/improve their GESCM performance. It draws attention to the importance of investing in GESCM practices for maintaining sustainable development in a clean business environment. It helps practitioners, academics and policymakers in Egypt to bridge the gap between theory and practice regarding GESCM performance. From an interdisciplinary perspective, it provides insights on improving the ESCM performance of the industry without harming its natural environment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the article theoretical approaches to defining the functions, tasks and pфlace of the risk management department in the organizational structure of management of industrial enterprises within the supply chain are developed. This approach takes into account the necessary coordinating and communication mechanisms between the structural divisions of the enterprise and chain links. This allows for the most effective management of risks that arise during the functioning of supply chains. The main requirements for further improvement of the organization of supply chain management are formulated, namely the organization of collection and statistical processing of information related to financial risks in supply chains. With the increase in the volume of risk management work, it is advisable to create within the supply chain of a group or risk management department at the production plant, as well as maintaining databases in which the necessary information is collected and systematized. The functions of such a department mainly include justification of the feasibility of risk insurance based on methods and techniques of risk management and the development of appropriate methods for economic justification of the need to insure the main types of risks in the supply chain. Information databases can store and accumulate information about each specific consumer of products and suppliers of raw materials and components, the history and types of interactions with each potential and real supplier and consumer, data on the volume and frequency of sales over a certain period of time and the amount of resources spent on sales. The functions of the risk management group should be linked to the core functions of supply chain management. The effectiveness of integration and cooperation in supply chains can be significantly increased due to the introduction of the concept of \"virtual logistics operator\". Such an organization will increase the efficiency of the supply chain by combining sales planning, production and distribution of products, reducing the cost of inventory management, production, delivery, will respond quickly to customer demands and improve customer service.</jats:p>"

The object of research is the reverse and green logistics.  The purpose of the study is to analyze the theoretical basis of the reverse and green logistics interaction in order to substantiate the optimal structure of the supply chain, taking into account its impact on the components of sustainable development.  Methods of the study are the analytical approach and mathematical methods.  The traditional supply chain aims to lower the cost and improve the efficiency of supply chain enterprise so as to maximize the economic benefits. Closed-loop supply chain also seek to maximize economic benefits, to decrease the consumption of resources and energy and to reduce the emissions of pollutants - all in an effort to create a socially responsible enterprise, and to balance the economic benefits, social effects and environmental effects.  To improve the management of reverse flows, the authors of this article propose to integrate the principles of sustainable development in the activities of companies that are part of the supply chain, it will protect the company's reputation and brand value and increase the efficiency of the supply chain. Also, it will help minimize the costs of environmental, social and economic impact. For continuous monitoring the situation related to the imbalance of the links in a closed-loop supply chain are offered an algorithm of using the bottleneck method.  The results of the study can be recommended for implementation in organizations that are directly involved in bringing the material flow from supply to consumption.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Access to safe and affordable drinking water is a basic need for every human being. However, with Lusaka Province being the fastest province in Zambia, it is evident that the rapid development of upcoming residential areas as well as illegal settlements in the outskirts of the city has outplaced the installation of water supply system by the water utility company. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company’s competitive priorities in its endeavor to provide safe and affordable water services in Lusaka’s upcoming residential areas. The research employed a non-intervention approach. Structured questionnaires and interviews were used for data collection. 30 household questionnaires were administered to households in Libala, Chalala and Obama residential areas respectively. Two water samples were collected randomly from each location and tested for quality. The findings showed that cost of drilling a residential borehole was K 17,351 with the reported minimum cost at K5000 and maximum at K75, 000. Borehole water from Chalala and Obama was found to be contaminated with total and feacal coliform bacteria. Nonetheless, piped water in Libala was found to be compliant with the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. The residents in Libala were also generally satisfied with the water supply services, but had concerns over the high water tariffs, the late response to water problems and the elevated levels of chlorine in the water. Majority of the respondents also reported that a decentralized water supply system was an innovative idea. From the overall findings, the main operational core competency identified was the water quality. As a result, for LWSC to extend water supply to the upcoming residential areas in Lusaka, it was recommended that LWSC formulates a welldocumented operations strategy that will focus on the cost of the service and time of service delivery. These can be achieved through a well thought out and implementable capacity strategy and asset management. Capacity strategy will involve decisions on the sizing, timing, type and location of real assets or resources.</jats:p>",

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation method of micro-energy harvesters which includes an evaluation matrix composed of three types of indexes and the corresponding test method. After the evaluation matrix is obtained by testing, a CRITIC-based weight calculation method is used to get a comprehensive score. Finally, ten commonly used solar or wind micro-energy harvesters in five typical regions are compared horizontally by the proposed method. The results show that the evaluation method can comprehensively consider various factors, and harvesters with higher comprehensive scores tend to have more balanced performance in all aspects. Furthermore, in regions with rich wind resources, the wind and solar harvesters have complementary time-domain characteristics.</jats:p>",

Besides using the relative ratio of customer acceptance on the online and the offline channels, this research employed an additional variable, namely the elasticity of demand for quality and discount rate. Adding a new variable to the DCSC structure increases profit systems. This study aimed to investigate the best prices for offline and online channels to get optimal profits. Therefore, optimal prices were discovered for consumers and companies with the two sales structures running simultaneously. The model development profits showe that profits in both offline and online channels increased. In the current condition, the offline channels tended to dominate. However, the analysis of this study showed that online sales could control the sales structures.

In addition, the continuity of care and work overload should not be ignored in this perspective. First, the authors developed a model in which the continuity of care is redefined by considering connected (synchronous) jobs and the work overload is formulated considering nurse-to-patient staffing ratio. Second, a two-stage solution approach based on a cluster-assign algorithm and variable neighbourhood search (VNS) and variable neighbourhood descent (VND) algorithms are tested on a series of large-scale instances.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research was motivated by the existence of environmental pollution problems caused by manufacturing activities that use styrene plastic materials as part of the packaging for electronic products. To solve these problems, innovative uses of environmentally-friendly materials from natural resources are necessary. The substitution of natural materials for the synthetic materials used in manufacturing is vitally important in the effort to eliminate the negative effects of environmental pollution. The use of trial-and-error methods to create and test replacement materials derived from renewable natural resources will allow sustainable manufacturing development. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of replacing styrene plastic materials, which commonly are used in the packaging of manufactured goods, with waste materials from banana stems so that the packaging of manufactured goods can be an environmentally-friendly product. The resulting banana stem of new and renewable material substitution for sustainable manufacturing, namely the M<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> + T + P<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> + A + t<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> model. Micro-biological banana stem material is broken down easily in the soil, so this material does not disturb the environment, while styrene materials do not break down in the soil. The implication of this research is the packaging of manufactured products can be sustainable.</jats:p>"

The water quality indexes and limits in Table 1 and Table 4 are taken from Standards for Drinking Water Quality for evaluation. The detection results showed that the water quality of finished water and the water source area was completely up to the standard. For 71 water samples collected from the finished water of the water treatment factory detected, except for some parameters that slightly exceeded the limits, the rate of reaching the standard is up to 97.2%. It can thus be seen that the water quality safety of the rural water supply projects in the Pearl River Basin area is highly reliable.</jats:p>",

WQI method was utilized to examine the seasonal changes in water quality that can indicate the potential use of water in the future. Water samples were tested from three locations along the Mandakini River. Fourteen physical and chemical parameters were analyzed. All water quality parameters were inside the admissible furthest reaches of the WHO for drinking water except turbidity, especially in the monsoon season. Twelve taxa of macroinvertebrates (Philopotamus sp., Laptophlebia sp., Isoperla sp., Diploperla sp., Tabanus sp., Hydropsyche sp., Baetis sp., Glossosoma sp., Heptagenia sp., Ephemerella sp., Psephenus sp., and Protandrous sp.) were identified in the Mandakini River. The fundamental goal of this investigation was to evaluate the seasonal effects on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity from the physicochemical variables of the Mandakini River. The study also affirmed that tourist-generated waste disposal and poisonous and dangerous chemicals from farming are the key components liable for the deterioration of water quality during the monsoon season.</jats:p>",

To deal with the operational complexities inherent in its mandate, WFP has been developing tools to assist its decision makers with integrating supply chain decisions across departments and functional areas. This paper describes a mixed integer linear programming model that simultaneously optimizes the food basket to be delivered, the sourcing plan, the delivery plan, and the transfer modality of a long-term recovery operation for each month in a predefined time horizon. By connecting traditional supply chain elements to nutritional objectives, we are able to make significant breakthroughs in the operational excellence of WFP’s most complex operations. We show three examples of how the optimization model is used to support operations: (1) to reduce the operational costs in Iraq by 12% without compromising the nutritional value supplied, (2) to manage the scaling-up of the Yemen operation from three to six million beneficiaries, and (3) to identify sourcing strategies during the El Niño drought of 2016. </jats:p>",

Issues related to the development of logistics and supply chain has received great attention. However, considering the factors of timeliness and systemic, previous studies could no longer meet the latest needs. To fill these gaps, this article reviews the 833 articles collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database from 1989 to March 2020 and mainly analyzes annual trends, top organizations, top published countries, author keywords, and main sources and disciplines, using the concepts of system thinking and knowledge-intermediary to summarize the research results. The results show that the research on logistics and supply chain is in a period of rapid development, and presents a decentralized and diversified development trend.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, supply chain finance (SCF) is exploited to solve the financing difficulties of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). SME credit risk assessment is a critical part in the SCF system. The diffusion of SME credit risk may cause serious consequences, leading the whole supply chain finance system unstable and insecure. Compared with traditional credit risk assessment models, the supply chain relationship, credit condition of SME, and core enterprises should all be considered to rate SME credit risk in SCF. Traditional methods mix all indicators from different index systems. They cannot give a quantitative result on how these index systems work. Furthermore, traditional credit risk assessment models are heavily dependent on the number of annotated SME data. However, it is implausible to accumulate enough credit risky SMEs in advance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive heterogenous multiview graph learning method to tackle the small sample size problem for SMEs’ credit risk forecasting. Three graphs are constructed by using indicators from supply chain operation, SME financial indicator, and nonfinancial indicator individually. All the graphs are integrated in an adaptive manner, providing a quantitative explanation on how the three parts cooperate. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed method has good performance for determining whether SME is risky or nonrisky in SCF. From the perspective of SCF, SME financing ability is still the main factor to determine the credit risk of SME.</jats:p>",

Against this backdrop, this study examined the impact of electricity on the performance of SMEs in Ado-Odo, Ota LGA, Ogun State. Consequently, the questionnaires were administered to the respondents using the method of purposive sampling. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), variance analysis (ANOVA) and Correlations and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) techniques. A total of 120 questionnaires were distributed, of which 90 were compiled and analyzed. The findings showed that there is significant impact of electricity supply on the performance of SMEs in Ado-Odo Ota Area, in Ogun State. Also, alternative power sources have significant impact on performance of SME in Ado-Odo Ota Area, in Ogun State. Therefore, by and large, from the findings of this study, the paper made the following recommendation for the policymakers and business owners in Ado-Odo, Ota Area of Ogun State in particular, and Nigeria by extension that sufficient supply of electricity should be placed in a place that maximizes the efficiency of small and medium-sized businesses. In the same vein, SMEs owners should strive to use alternative sources of power to boost the performance of SMEs, and meet their market objectives.</jats:p>"

In the case where the voltage sags failure cannot be avoided, rapid and accurate detection of the voltage sag has become a key technology for improving the reliability of the power supply of the power system. Based on the symmetrical component method, an improved detection algorithm for three-phase unbalanced voltage sag is proposed in this paper, which can significantly improve the detection speed and the reliability of power supply. The method firstly constructs the virtual orthogonal signal of the grid voltage and uses the symmetric component method to realize the fast and accurate extraction of the positive and negative sequence components of the grid voltage fundamental. In addition, an improved method for constructing virtual orthogonal signals is proposed in this paper, which effectively improves the accuracy of the constructed orthogonal signals. Finally, the feasibility and priority of the improved detection method have been verified by MATLAB/Simulink.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores simultaneous reduction strategies of lead time and setup cost in a two-stage supply chain model under trade-credit financing. Lead time depends on a variable production rate and lot size. It consists of setup, production, and transportation time which are shortened to reduce lead time. Although double safety factors are considered to avoid stock-out; but still backorders take place as the demand during the lead time is stochastic. Setup cost is reduced by including an extra investment cost. In addition, the vendor offers a fixed credit period to the buyer to settle the account. The objective is to minimize the integrated expected total cost and optimize the order quantity, number of deliveries, setup and transportation time, setup cost, safety factor for the first batch, and the production rate. A multi-variable optimization technique is used for these purposes. Furthermore, a numerical example together with managerial insights is provided for the establishment and applicability of the proposed model. The numerical results show that the introduction of setup cost reduction and trade-credit financing along with lead time reduction is more beneficial by means of integrated expected total cost reduction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emergency Departments (EDs) worldwide are confronted with rising patient volumes causing significant strains on both Emergency Medicine and entire healthcare systems. Consequently, many EDs are in a situation where the number of patients in the ED is temporarily beyond the capacity for which the ED is designed and resourced to manage―a phenomenon called Emergency Department (ED) crowding. ED crowding can impair the quality of care delivered to patients and lead to longer patient waiting times for ED doctor’s consult (time to provider) and admission to the hospital ward. In Singapore, total ED attendance at public hospitals has grown significantly, that is, roughly 5.57% per year between 2005 and 2016 and, therefore, emergency physicians have to cope with patient volumes above the safe workload. The purpose of this study is to create a virtual ED that closely maps the processes of a hospital-based ED in Singapore using system dynamics, that is, a computer simulation method, in order to visualize, simulate, and improve patient flows within the ED. Based on the simulation model (virtual ED), we analyze four policies: (i) co-location of primary care services within the ED, (ii) increase in the capacity of doctors, (iii) a more efficient patient transfer to inpatient hospital wards, and (iv) a combination of policies (i) to (iii). Among the tested policies, the co-location of primary care services has the largest impact on patients’ average length of stay (ALOS) in the ED. This implies that decanting non-emergency lower acuity patients from the ED to an adjacent primary care clinic significantly relieves the burden on ED operations. Generally, in Singapore, there is a tendency to strengthen primary care and to educate patients to see their general practitioners first in case of non-life threatening, acute illness.</jats:p>"

In the environment of demand updating, we focus on the inequity aversion among the FLSPs and introduce two option contracts (the reservation option contract and the option guarantee contract), build the multi-objective programming models, to explore effects of the inequity aversion behavior on the order allocation, and whether the two option contracts can mitigate the impact of inequity aversion on order allocation. Three important conclusions are obtained after two option contracts comparisons: first, there is an optimal update time, at which point, the order allocation results reach the optimal value and tend to be stable. Second, two option contracts both can not only increase the total performance of the supply chain, but also mitigate the impact of inequity aversion on the allocation under certain conditions. Third, when demand decreases, the reservation option contract is better than option guarantee contract, in contrast, when demand increases, option guarantee contract is better.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

But at the end of the month, the amount of available moisture decreased sharply and continued to decrease during July and August. This led to a shortage of water reserves, which could only be compensated by irrigation. 2016 was generally wetter, although the moisture content in the upper humus horizon was low when it emerged from winter in may. The drop in humidity in Chernozem continued until mid-June, when the ELVs decreased to unsatisfactory values. Since the end of June, regular precipitation has dramatically increased the available moisture reserves, remaining very good until the end of the growing season. As a result, a significant deficit of productive moisture was observed only in late may and early June. In June 2017, the productive moisture reserves in the humus-accumulative horizon were satisfactory. But in the illuvial horizon, the moisture reserves were estimated to be good, which did not require irrigation.</jats:p>"

Relying upon the earlier studies by the author which stress that knowledge-based economy can be characterised as a low profitability of investment in physical capital, higher income inequalities, lower physical capital and economic growth rate phase of the development of economic systems, the present work provides variously conceived arguments to support the idea that significant portfolio choice changes by wealth owners are a relevant feature of knowledge-based economy. Some of the implications of the economic theory of the availability of assets other than physical capital and other assets more connected with production needs were thus discussed, pointing out that this leads mainly to the negation of the necessary arrival of mainstream counterbalance mechanisms which support the affirmation of higher physical capital accumulation when higher income inequalities are recorded.</jats:p>"

In this paper, through the use of these remote sensing techniques, we aim to understand the type of groundwater supply of an Antarctic perennial frozen lake that encompasses two frost blisters (M1 and M2) through the temporal analysis of the features’ elevation changes (frost blisters and lake ice level). The frozen lake is located at Boulder Clay (northern Victoria Land, Antarctica). We relied on several photogrammetric models, past satellite images and ground pictures to conduct differencing of digital elevation models, areal variations and pixel counting. In addition, in situ measurements of the ice sublimation or snow accumulation were carried out. The two frost blisters showed different elevation trends with M1 higher in the past (1996–2004) than recently (2014–2019), while M2 showed an opposite trend, similarly to the ice level. Indeed, the linear regression between M2 elevation changes and the ice level variation was statistically significant, as well as with the annual thawing degree days, while M1 did not show significant results. From these results we can infer that the groundwater supply of M1 can be related to a sublake open talik (hydraulic system) as confirmed also by pressurized brines found below M1, during a drilling in summer 2019. For M2 the groundwater flow is still not completely clear although the hydrostatic system seems the easiest explanation as well as for the uplift of the lake ice.</jats:p>"

The relationship between the organization and its traditions is the key concern. Between these two cases, consumer relationship management (CRM) is the same in theory and may differ significantly. Both the company and consumers have some factors to meet, such as the desires and expectations of all sides, before forming a contract. We need to earn a profit to succeed and to improve clients expect excellent support, better goods and reasonable pricing. The implementation of a CRM program will impact consumer service and customer knowledge for various purposes. Likewise, adopting a CRM strategy would definitely affect consumer loyalty and awareness. CRM guarantees that consumers are happy and strengthens ties between the company and its clients. Such practices improve the partnership between customers and sales representatives. The study carried out the quantitative approach in the delivery of the questionnaire to more than 100 bank customers. In concise and inferential statistics, the data were handled using the SPSS statistical method. Data indicates that the strong relationship between consumer loyalty and customer happiness of CRM technologies occurs and the stronger the overall customer satisfaction score, the larger the volume of CRM technology deployed.</jats:p>"

The main objective of this study is to modify the DRASTIC model to identify groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution. The DRASTIC model was firstly used to analyze the intrinsic vulnerability. The DRASTIC model with the inclusion of a land-use factor (DRASTIC-LU) was put forward to map the specific vulnerability of groundwater. Furthermore, the support vector machine (SVM) was introduced to avoid the drawback of the overlay and index methods, and the improved integrated models of DRASTIC + SVM and DRASTIC-LU + SVM were built. Moreover, 103 groundwater samples were collected for building and validating the models. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of DRASTIC, DRASTIC-LU, DRASTIC + SVM, and DRASTIC-LU + SVM was found to be 0.853, 0.755, 0.631, and 0.502, respectively. The model DRASTIC-LU was more precise than the original one. The results also showed that the integrated model using SVM exhibited better correlation between the vulnerability value and the nitrate pollution. The study indicated that the modified models including the land-use factor as well as SVM in the DRASTIC model were more suitable to assess the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate.</jats:p>",

There were various sources of irrigation water in the suburb farmlands of Xijiang River. We investigated the sources and distribution characteristics of heavy metals in the irrigation water sources on a riverside and inside-dyke farmland of Xijiang River. According to sample test results, it was found that nearly 100% of heavy metals that we were concerned about were detected in the irrigation water sources in the study. The box plot showed that the average content of other elements ranged from 1.65 to 43.75 μg·L−1, and the average level of cadmium was 0.02 μg·L−1 in the studied area. According to quantitative evaluation index and analysis of distribution characteristics, most heavy metals were at relatively low concentration in the irrigation water sources, while mercury content was far greater than other elements, followed by arsenic. Arsenic and mercury had become increasingly prominent problems in local irrigation water sources. River quality was more likely to be affected by river water and agricultural activities, while groundwater quality was more likely to be affected by natural causes. According to single/comprehensive water-quality evaluations, the comprehensive water quality evaluation ranged from level I to level III, but the single-factor index evaluations of mercury in most water samples and arsenic in two groundwater samples were of ‘Inferior’ level. Attention should be paid to the monitoring of mercury and arsenic (in the groundwater) in the studied area. The disposal methods of farmland water inflow and drainage should be increased if necessary, and reducing the influence of human activities on the natural weathering and leaching of heavy metals was an effective measure to avoid risk of agricultural production.</jats:p>",

This work investigates the structure of the future Italian energy system – in terms of power generation capacity, energy storage, mobility fuel shares – and assesses benchmark scenarios able to reach a fully decarbonized supply in power and transport sectors, considering their long-term evolution. The analysis adopts a multi-node multi-vector model that simulates the year-long energy system behaviour with hourly time resolution and optimizes sizing (installed capacities) and operation (energy flows). The model considers power generation from different sources, electric consumption, and mobility demand for energy vectors, focusing on electricity and hydrogen. The required installed capacities of RES power plants and energy storage systems appear to be extremely high (at least 10x today’s solar PV or more), but in general positively influenced by sector integration strategies and energy vector multiplicity. Energy storage and flexibility solutions are essential, combining battery storage, Power-to-Hydrogen, Power-to-Power, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid. If capacity installation is limited (e.g., due to land availability), the need to satisfy consumption yields significant import requirements, which also depend upon the mobility mix and the decarbonization targets.</jats:p>"

In the single contract, a residential high-voltage rate is applied to the total electrical energy consumptions of households and common areas. On the other hand, in the general contract, different rate plans are applied to the electrical energy consumptions of households and their common areas, where a generic high-voltage rate plan is applied to the common consumption. Hence, depending on the amounts and composition of the consumptions, both contracts have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of the total electricity charge. The management office of an apartment complex can select its preferred contract considering the amount and composition of the power consumptions on an annual basis. In this paper, we first formulate a model for the contracts and analyze their properties based on Monte-Carlo simulations. We then observe the contract properties through actual metering data from 30 apartment complexes in Korea. From the analysis of this paper, we can select appropriate contract for a given apartment complex and have guidelines for saving electricity charges. The greater the consumption of the electrical energy and the common area portion, the more advantageous the general contract is in terms of reducing electricity charges.</jats:p>"

The analysed data covers the period of the entire working cycle of the thermal container. In the research, automatic Big Data analysis and mathematical modelling were used to identify the disruption. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to predict possible temperature-related disruption in transport. The provided research proves that it is possible to prevent over 82% of disruptions in the cold chain. The ANN enables analyses of the temperature curve and prediction of the disruption before it occurs. The research is limited to coolbox transportation of food under -20o C, but the method could also be used for Full Transport Load (FTL) in refrigerated transport. The research is based on real data, and the developed method helps to reduce the waste in the cold chain, improve transport quality and supply chain resilience. The presented method enables not only to avoid cold chain breaks but also to reduce product damage as well as improve the transport process. It could be used by cargo forwarders, Third-Party Logistics (3PL) companies to reduce costs and waste. The literature review confirms that there is no similar method to prevent disruption in the transport chain. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for collecting data connected with Big Data analysis and ANN enables chain resilience provision.</jats:p>"

While there are some chains that have low frequencies of unfavorable events, many continuously face uncertainty. Food production has many uncertainties along the global supply chain. The global nature of the large logistical networks increases its complexity. Two main sources of uncertainty arise: External and internal to the SC. External factors mainly come from nature (such as “El Niño” phenomenon) and from human activities (such as food and nutrition policy and standards). Internal factors mainly come from operations such as a cold chain disruption. Thus, one needs to minimize risk and improve resilience in order to achieve food security and sustainability. It is then imperative that risk management practices be integrated into the supply chain design and management process. This chapter presents an overview of the main risks involved in global food supply chains, as well as some techniques for risk management.</jats:p>"

This paper constructs a dual‐channel supply chain decision‐making model composed of low‐carbon emission reduction manufacturers and retailers and studies the optimal decision‐making problem of the supply chain under subsidies by the government based on emission reduction R&amp;D and per unit product emission reduction. The research results show the following: (1) when the government subsidizes emission reduction R&amp;D, the emission reduction will have an impact on retailers’ optimal prices, manufacturers’ optimal wholesale prices, and optimal direct sales channel sales prices. The profit of the manufacturer increases with the increase in carbon emissions, and the profit of the manufacturer increases to a certain level and then appears to decline. (2) When the government adopts a subsidy method based on the emission reduction per unit product, the manufacturer’s wholesale price and the selling price of direct sales channels, as well as the retailer’s own optimal price, will increase with the increase in emission reductions. Retailers’ profits will increase linearly with the increase in carbon emissions. Manufacturers’ profits will first increase in a straight line and then increase in a curve.</jats:p>",

Water quality behavior was simulated using EPANET 2.0 in a block system of the distribution network system linked with a given reservoir. The site surveys for the simulated stagnant areas were used for building the automatic drain system at the accessible site. Water quality online monitoring without drain showed that earlier occurrence event of residual chlorine below 0.1 mg/L with 45 days than that of turbidity above 0.5 NTU with 90 days was a critical factor to open and close the drain valve. The discharge volumes of the automatic drain system at the stagnant area were 10~100% of the flushing volume drained by the existing manual drain work. It was confirmed that the volume and cycle of drain could be flexibly changed over time and water temperature. The long term operation of the automatic drain system at the test bed showed that the annual flushing volume and working time could be reduced by 65% and 80%, respectively. The continuous operation of the automatic drain system showed that optimal flushing and online sensing compared to manual drainage could reduce maintenance costs and ensure stable water quality of stagnant drinking water. Although the scope and effect of this study are limited to a particular water pipe, the applicability of an automatic drain system can be evaluated by the approach of this study with optimized drain conditions.</jats:p>"

The respondent used the mentioned supply, which was sourced in contract, at her home. The court ruled that the spoliation remedy does not protect the quasi-possession of rights sourced in contract. For its quasi-possession to enjoy possessory protection, the right must be in the nature of a servitude, be registered or flow from legislation. This emphasis on the source of the right is problematic for two reasons. First, it contradicts certain common-law authorities which reveal that the quasi-possession of electricity supply sourced in contract does, in fact, enjoy protection under the spoliation remedy. This applies as long as the supply is a gebruiksreg (use right) and the spoliatus performs physical acts associated with the right on immovable property. Secondly, (over)emphasising the source of the right potentially undermines various fundamental rights. When the common law is open to several possible interpretations, as seems to be the case with quasi-possession, the supremacy of the Constitution and the single-system-of-law principle require that courts choose the interpretation that upholds (rather than impairs) constitutional rights. In the Masinda case, the court unfortunately opted for an understanding of quasi-possession which seems to undermine the Constitution. For these reasons, the decision is an unwelcome development.</jats:p>"

Ethnobotanical analysis tools and allometric equations are applied on the data collected. These led to three main results. First, a total of 43 and 34 species registered are used in six (6) usages, such as food, forage, technological, energetic, and medicinal uses respectively both in Dan Saga and Tabofatt cluster. Second, the two landscapes contain a remarkable specific flora diversity which contributes not only to soil fertility but also to sequester 6.04±0.236 and 4.5 9±0.568 tCO2.ha-1 respectively at Dan Saga and Tabofatt. And thirdly in the landscapes of two clusters the amount of woody species inventoried, meets the amount of social use requirements.

Watershed sediment loads are calculated based on sediment-discharge rating curves for gauges covering 80% of the watershed area. The annual average sediment load to the estuary is 1.2 Mt, of which about 0.6 Mt comes from side tributaries. Sediment yield varies inversely with watershed area, with regional trends that are consistent with substrate erodibility. Geophysical and sedimentological surveys in seven subwatersheds of the Lower Hudson were conducted to estimate the mass and composition of sediment trapped behind dams. Impoundments were classified as (1) active sediment traps, (2) run-of-river sites not actively trapping sediment, and (3) dammed natural lakes and spring-fed ponds. Based on this categorization and impoundment attributes from a dam inventory database, the total mass of impounded sediment in the Lower Hudson watershed is estimated as 4.9 ± 1.9 Mt. This represents about 4 years of annual watershed supply, which is small compared with some individual dam removals and is not practically available given current dam removal rates. More than half of dams impound drainage areas less than 1 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, and play little role in downstream sediment supply. In modeling of a simulated dam removal, suspended sediment in the estuary increases modestly near the source during discharge events, but otherwise effects on suspended sediment are minimal. Fine-grained sediment deposits broadly along the estuary and coarser sediment deposits near the source, with transport distance inversely related to settling velocity.</jats:p>",

However, the planning of air transport operations in the context of a disaster response is of great complexity, so that operational research has significant application and potential contribution to the area. In this context, we propose a procedure that aims to optimize the use of helicopters in response operations to small and medium-scale disasters. The proposed procedure seeks to minimize the total time of operation and the mobilization of air resources during the last mile delivery in relief operations. The proposed procedure is applied on a post-disaster scenario, taking as basis the real characteristics of the response operation to the floods, occurred in 2011, in the mountain region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

To that end, experts can evaluate the materials and give an accurate estimation for both aspects. In that case, one might wonder, why is a decision support system employing machine learning necessary? While a fully automated machine learning model rarely surpasses a human’s ability in such tasks, there are several advantages in employing one. For starters, human experts will be more expensive to employ, rather than use an algorithm. One could claim that research towards developing an efficient and fully automated decision support system would end up costing more than employing actual human experts. In this instance, it is paramount to think long-term. Investing in this kind of research will create systems which are reusable, extensible, and scalable. This aspect alone more than remedies the initial costs. It is also important to observe that, if the number of wastes to be processed is more than the human experts can process in a timely fashion, they will not be able to provide their services, even if employment costs were not a concern. On the contrary, a machine learning model is perfectly capable of scaling to humongous amounts of data, conducting fast data processing and decision making. For power plants with particularly fast processing needs, an automated decision support system is an important asset. Moreover, a decision support system can predict the future based on past observations. While not always entirely spot on, it can give a future estimation about aspects such as energy required, amounts of wastes produced etc. in the future. Therefore, processing plants can plan of time and adapt to specific needs. A human expert can provide this as well to some degree, but on a much smaller scale. Especially in time series forecasting, it is interesting to note that, even if a decision support model does not predict exact values, it is highly likely to predict trends of the value increasing or decreasing in certain ranges. In the next sections, we are going to describe the four machine learning models that were developed and which compose the Decision Support System of FENIX. Section 8.1 describes how we predict the quality of the extracted materials based on features such as temperature, extruder speed, etc. Section 8.2 describes the process of extracting heuristic rules based on existing results. Section 8.3 describes how FENIX provides time-series forecasting to predict the future of a variable based on past observations. Finally, Sect. 8.4 describes the process of classifying materials based on images.</jats:p>"

The paper optimizes the process of managing the integrated supply chain in the logistics system of military units of the National Guard of Ukraine is considered as an interconnected and interdependent set of organizations, resources and knowledge flows involved in ensuring supply and value formation. A general model of creating an integrated value formation system is proposed, which is a sequence of actions and strategies, the implementation of which is necessary for the successful reorganization of the existing supply chain for the military units of the National Guard of Ukraine. Within the framework of the offered model the reflected processes consist in optimization of coordination of various functions. Emphasis is placed on the need to create a logistics center that functions as an information adapter in order to rationally manage the flow of the supply process. This article highlights new tasks, the solution of which requires employees to supply the highest level of intellectual and creative potential. The work for the military units of the National Guard of Ukraine offers criteria for selecting decisions on the use of internal and external sources. The article develops a model for estimating the structure of total costs in the supply chain, which acts as a link that is connected between consumers and suppliers. The main factor in the use of information systems for the successful functioning of the supply chain in this article considers the need for almost perfect connections, both within the company of the stakeholder of the military unit, and between them. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the created model changes the very basis of decision-making, using an approach that stimulates the reduction of aggregate costs in the supply chain and increase the overall competitive advantage in the movement of materials and information from supplier to military units. The article proposes a system for measuring efficiency, which is not only applicable at several levels of organizational management, but also able to integrate multi-level operational activities to achieve the goals of organizations in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

It is very important to seek the coordination among the optimal price, service level, and logistics level. In this paper, we propose the coordination of pricing, the service level, and delivery time of a new retail supply chain composed of one product supplier, one platform service provider, and one logistics provider. Firstly, the profit function mode of product pricing, platform service level, and logistics distribution level that influence the consumers’ demand is constructed in two modes, namely, the centralized and decentralized decision mode. Then, we calculate and compare the optimal product price, the optimal platform service level, the optimal delivery time, and the profit of each member of the supply chain from both decision modes. We discovered that cooperation improves the service level, logistics level, and the income of each member of the new retail supply chain. Therefore, we propose a novel mode called the coordination mode as a strategy for the supply chain based on the combination contract. We performed a numerical analysis to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the coordination contract.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article provides an overview of the short-term dynamics of macroeconomic indicators for the Khabarovsk Territory during the COVID-19 pandemic after the introduction of temporary restrictive measures in April and May 2020. The impact of these measures extended both to the elements of regional aggregate demand and aggregate supply. From the point of view of the theory of short-run economic fluctuations, aggregate supply and demand shocks, such as those that occurred in the initial period of the pandemic, lead to a reduction in aggregate output followed by an increase in actual and natural rate of unemployment. Expectations have an additional negative impact since the growth of uncertainty gives rise to an increase in savings and an additional reduction in consumer activity. In the case of Khabarovsk Territory it is shown that the most affected industries of the economy were retail trade and services. Both industries experienced a negative shock in April, but while the former began recovery as early as May, the latter returned to the growth trajectory only in June. Residents changed their income usage patterns due to the restrictions on the consumer market, as well as to increased uncertainty about their future income. The share of net savings and cash balances increased with a corresponding decrease in the share of spending on goods and services. A negative supply shock contributed to a sharp rise in unemployment up to 24.5 thousand unemployed in the third quarter of 2020. Starting from the fourth quarter unemployment began to decline rapidly, but it had not reached pre-pandemic level of less than 7 thousand unemployed by the second quarter of 2021. It is shown that the permanent population outmigration, which increased in 2020, is a specific feature of the regional labor market. It has slowed down the return of the regional aggregate supply to its pre-pandemic positions after the restrictions were cancelled</jats:p>"

To fulfill the protein demand of this growing population, the productivity of the Indonesian agricultural sector should be increased. This can be achieved either by expanding the agricultural land or by increasing the productivity of existing agricultural land and protein use efficiency. An expansion of agricultural land is not always possible or desirable: large parts of Indonesia comprise forest areas, including tropical rain forests. Consequently, the optimization of the use of existing agricultural land is inevitable. The present manuscript describes and discusses the current protein consumption and production in Indonesia. It presents the levels predicted for 2035, which would imply a strong gap between consumption and production. Alternatives therefore need to be considered to avoid protein shortage in the future. These would include the use of new biomass resources, utilization of agricultural residues as alternative protein sources for feed and other nonfood applications, and biorefining of biomass sources. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

In this study, to better understand the genetic mechanisms and characteristics of floods, copula functions are used to analyze the response of flood events to extreme precipitation. The coincidence probabilities of the typical extreme flood and precipitation events are calculated; different return periods of their arbitrary combinations are calculated, whereas the dangerous domains for flood control under different return periods are identified; furthermore, flood risk analysis under different extreme precipitation scenarios is performed via their conditional exceedance probabilities. The Xitiaoxi catchment (XC) and Dongtiaoxi catchment (DC) in the Zhexi Region of the Taihu Basin are selected as the study area. The results show that in four scenarios with precipitation frequencies of 80%, 90%, 93.33%, and 95%, the probabilities of the dangerous flood are 9.72%, 10.57%, 10.86%, and 11.01% in the XC, respectively, and 5.91%, 6.31%, 6.44%, and 6.51% in the DC, respectively.

The article presents the results of the analysis of the strategic documents of the heat supply development in various countries, which showed the need of formation of management instruments, providing the possibility of planning of specific scenarios of the heat supply development in the territories of our country. The key conditions of strategic planning, are revealed. They include providing the solution of social and environmental problems as well as the matters of energy security of consumers, which are in the centre of global environmental challenges now. The legislative arrangements and the experience of the use of \"Heat Supply Schemes\" in the territories of the Russian Federation are chosen as the materials. The scenario approach with the use of the method of the hierarchy analysis is considered to be the basis for planning of construction and reconstruction of the facilities of the heat supply systems. According to the scientific approach, chosen in the research, the level hierarchy of the strategic planning process is offered. The major factors, influencing the development of heat supply of territories are analysed, the main factors and their purposes, as well as the basic scenarios of the development, are described. The authors offer four scenarios for the choice of options for construction and reconstruction of the facilities of heat supply systems, taking into account the practice of its organization in various countries. The importance of the basic scenarios for the strategic development of the heat supply system in the territory is estimated according to the hierarchy levels on the basis of the method of paired comparisons with the subsequent aggregation of the received results. The approbation of the offered management instrument on the example of the urban area allow to prove the scenario of the decentralized heat supply of the explored territory as the most perspective scheme as well as to raise the questions of possible expansion of the offered management instrument.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the evaluation model of the auxiliary power supply system design scheme is established, and the factors influencing the system evaluation are divided into two levels, and the factor evaluation grade is the third level. Secondly, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weight of each factor, and the method of triangular fuzzy number is used to establish a comprehensive evaluation matrix. Finally, the three-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is carried out based on the principle of fuzzy transformation, and the comprehensive evaluation results of each design scheme are calculated. The research results show that the comprehensive evaluation score of the parallel centralized power supply mode is the highest, and the design scheme is the best, which is consistent with the actual application. It shows that the method can directly reflect the advantages and disadvantages of each design scheme, and provide some reference for the selection of the design scheme of the auxiliary power supply system of the metro.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the innovation of global trade business models, more and more foreign trade companies are transforming and developing in the direction of cross‐border e‐commerce. However, due to the limitation of platform language processing and analysis technology, foreign trade companies encounter many bottlenecks in the process of transformation and upgrading. From the perspective of the semantic matching efficiency of e‐commerce platforms, this paper improves the logical and technical problems of cross‐border e‐commerce in the operation process and uses semantic matching efficiency as the research object to conduct experiments on the QQP dataset. We propose a graph network text semantic analysis model TextSGN based on semantic dependency analysis for the problem that the existing text semantic matching method does not consider the semantic dependency information between words in the text and requires a large amount of training data. The model first analyzes the semantic dependence of the text and performs word embedding and one‐hot encoding on the nodes (single words) and edges (dependencies) in the semantic dependence graph. On this basis, in order to quickly mine semantic dependencies, an SGN network block is proposed. The network block defines the way of information transmission from the structural level to update the nodes and edges in the graph, thereby quickly mining semantics dependent information allows the network to converge faster, train classification models on multiple public datasets, and perform classification tests. The experimental results show that the accuracy rate of TextSGN model in short text classification reaches 95.2%, which is 3.6% higher than the suboptimal classification method; the accuracy rate is 86.16%, the <jats:italic>F</jats:italic>1 value is 88.77%, and the result is better than other methods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most water and development interventions aim to contribute to long-term sustainable impacts. Given the uncertainties involved in these longer-term water development projects, adaptive planning approaches hold promise to connect planning, implementation and evaluation. Recent innovations report promising results, but find limited wide-spread practice due to a relatively large distance from current operational realities. Therefore, in this article we set out to investigate the real-world benefits and barriers for adaptive planning, monitoring and evaluation as a tool for water development interventions. To do so, we have stripped the advanced theoretic adaptive planning approach to its essentials, for exploration in an ongoing water development project. Application of the resulting three essential adaptive planning steps to a water development project in Khulna, Bangladesh shows that these steps are feasible and can support a more adaptive planning and management. In particular, they have helped to surface critical assumptions and uncertainties, as well as associated adaptation actions for the case. These were related to spatial development, water quality, finance, and management capacity. However, results also show that the actual use of the proposed steps is likely to be hindered by strategic misrepresentation. Our findings suggest this as an additional and more fundamental barrier to the widespread use of adaptive planning practices. We reflect on this barrier of strategic misrepresentation and on possible mechanisms to counter it, in order to enable water development actors to make their planning and evaluation arrangements more adaptive.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nContext\nLamb producers are currently limited in their ability to make informed on-farm management changes with respect to disease and defects identified at processing. This is due to the limited accuracy and detail of information included in disease and defect feedback supplied by processors. Increasing transparency of the feedback can allow producers to make more informed on-farm decisions, and, subsequently, improve productivity and animal welfare.\n\nAims\nUsing arthritis as a case study, the aim was to develop a scoring system that estimates hot standard carcass weight (HSCW) losses due to trimming at processing, so as to improve feedback to lamb producers.\n\nMethods\nAn observational cross-sectional study was conducted at a southern New South Wales commercial processing facility, over 6 months and in five week-long blocks, from 21 February 2019 to 5 July 2019. Carcass trim components removed due to the presence of arthritis (shank or leg) were recorded for 217 of the 42164 lamb carcasses processed. Utilising average lot HSCWs, the total proportion of HSCW lost due to arthritis trimming (TPL) was calculated for each arthritic carcass. Linear regression analysis, with a logit-transform of TPL, was fitted to the data.\n\nKey results\nProcessing lot and trim-component category were found to be significant (P &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0.001) explanatory variables for variation in TPL. Trim-component categories that were not significantly (P &amp;gt; 0.05) different were combined, with final categories being assigned arthritis trim scores as follows: 1, any forequarter shank; 2, any hindquarter shank; 3, any forequarter leg; and 4, any hindquarter leg. At an over-the-hooks carcass price of AU$7.83/kg and an average HSCW of 23.13 kg, these scores were used to estimate producer revenue losses per carcass (range AU$2.95–AU$18.08).\n\nConclusions\nThe accuracy and detail of information provided as feedback to lamb producers can be improved. For arthritis, this can be achieved using a trim-scoring system.\n\nImplications\nAltering feedback to include HSCW losses for processed lots in both kilograms and dollars against the associated disease or defect will better equip producers to make cost-effective on-farm management changes and reduce the impact on the lamb supply chain.\n\n</jats:p>"

However, it is difficult to be identified and restrain the SCF service provider due to its stability and hiddenness. Different SCF transaction structures will affect the profits of supply chain members from collusion. This paper develops various game models for collusion and not collusion for different SCF transaction structures and investigates the impact of SCF transaction structures on the boundary conditions of collusion. Through comparative analysis, the findings of models are as follows: (1) in a two‐echelon supply chain, the supplier and retailer are more likely to conduct collusion under the sequential game than under the simultaneous game; (2) collusion in the two‐echelon supply chain can obtain higher loans than that in the three‐echelon supply chain, so it has more serious hidden danger; (3) in the two‐echelon supply chain, collusion is easier to form than in the three‐echelon SCF supply chain that has spontaneous endogenous constraints. We also develop two types of mechanisms to restrain collusion behavior from profit sharing and incomplete information perspectives. Finally, we summarize the theoretical implications and analyze the management implications through a case study.</jats:p>",

The most important objective of such a policy in Taiwan is empowering people and communities by improving health literacy and increasing access to healthcare resources. Using the nearest-neighbor two-step floating catchment area method, this study performed an accessibility assessment for community care resources before and after supply capacity optimization. For the target of maximum equity when allocating community care resources, taking maximum values, mean values and minimum values of the distances into consideration, three analytical allocation solutions for supply capability optimization were derived to further compare disparities in geographical accessibility. Three indicators, namely, the Gini coefficient, median minus mean and mean-squared error, were employed to assess the degree of optimization of geographical accessibility scores at the locations of the demand population and to determine the degree of geographic inequities in the allocation of community care resources. Our study proposed a method in which the minimum value of the distance is adopted as the approximate representation of distances between the service point and the locations of demand to determine the minimum value for supply capacity optimization. The study found that the method can effectively assess inequities in care resource allocation among urban and rural communities.</jats:p>"

Each of the modules is composed of an isolated transformer, rectifier, filter tank, insulated gate bipolar transistor switch, gate-drive circuit, free-wheeling diode, and so forth. An embedded system STM32F103 is used for controlling and protecting the SGPS. Meanwhile, the transient output capacity of the SGPS is tested. The effect of the output voltage of the SGPS on the extracted beam current is studied. The experimental results show that there is a turning point in the relationship between the suppress voltage and the extracted beam current. When the rate of the absolute value of the suppress voltage and the gradient voltage is more than 2.5%, the efficiency of the extracted beam of the ion source can be improved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increased usage and non-efficient management of limited resources has created the risk of water resource scarcity. Due to climate change, urbanization, and lack of effective water resource management, countries like Pakistan are facing difficulties coping with the increasing water demand. Rapid urbanization and non-resilient infrastructures are the key barriers in sustainable urban water resource management. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges of urban water management through effective means. We propose a workflow for the modeling and simulation of sustainable urban water resource management and develop an integrated framework for the evaluation and planning of water resources in a typical urban setting. The proposed framework uses the Water Evaluation and Planning system to evaluate current and future water demand and the supply gap. Our simulation scenarios demonstrate that the demand–supply gap can effectively be dealt with by dynamic resource allocation, in the presence of assumptions, for example, those related to population and demand variation with the change of weather, and thus work as a tool for informed decisions for supply management. In the first scenario, 23% yearly water demand is reduced, while in the second scenario, no unmet demand is observed due to the 21% increase in supply delivered. Similarly, the overall demand is fulfilled through 23% decrease in water demand using water conservation. Demand-side management not only reduces the water usage in demand sites but also helps to save money, and preserve the environment. Our framework coupled with a visualization dashboard deployed in the water resource management department of a metropolitan area can assist in water planning and effective governance. </jats:p>",

The essence of the process of reverse flows management in accordance with the reference model of business processes in the SCOR supply chains is researched. The application of a logistic approach to management of reverse flows has determined a separate sphere of logistics – reverse logistics. Enterprises in the supply chain should offer consumers an effective return management service, which allows minimizing the potential deterioration of relations with consumers to manage the process of returning to the supplier in case of expired goods or excess inventories. To carry out this process, it is necessary to properly study communication channels and business processes in order to create an effective feedback system in after-sales service to minimize the cost of return. A significant number of enterprises consider reverse logistics processes a negative phenomenon and do not focus on managing them, although enterprises that implement an effective reverse logistics process can get a number of significant advantages. They include: reducing costs, increasing the speed of customer service, maintaining the customer loyalty. The developed model of business processes allows to structure the tasks of reverse flows management and get an effective tool for the implementation of the SCOR-model of supply chains management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, the designing of a power supply system for mine sections is performed in accordance with obsolete regulatory documents made in the early 90s of the 20th century. This slows down the implementation of the ‘digital mining operation’ concept and prevents the full potential for energy savings from being realized. At the same time, development of digital technologies makes the issues of computer simulation of the power supply system of the coal mine sections urgent. Simulating computer modelling is required to develop measures for increasing the efficiency of the power supply system of operating coal mines as well as for designing new coal mines. The article offers the methodology of forming simulation computer models for evaluation of the energy efficiency of the power supply system for a coal mine section. To ensure the correct development of active and reactive power consumption profiles, it is proposed to use scenario approach to modelling dynamic processes. As an example of using the proposed approach, one of the scenarios for the operation of power supply system of a mine section at one of the coal mines of Kuzbass is reviewed here. The proposed approach to scenario modelling of operating modes of a mine section ensures the correct modelling of dynamic processes for the subsequent assessment of the effectiveness of the use of intelligent devices for controlling the flows of active and reactive power, which will make it possible to accurately assess the effect of FACTS devices on the level of active power losses, as well as the quality indicators of the electrical energy. The proposed methodology can be used in the development of computer-aided design systems for the design of energy-efficient power supply systems for extraction areas.</jats:p>"

One of the uses of renewable energy that is being promoted is the use of biodiesel as a substitute for diesel fuel. This utilization is carried out by mixing biodiesel with diesel fuel. The quantity of biodiesel blended with diesel fuel is following the rules in each country. That is why the biodiesel supply chain must be described to obtain minimum economic costs and environmental costs. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current biodiesel supply chain models. A study of the biodiesel supply chain’s current state concludes by highlighting the unaddressed area or the gaps existing in the existing literature by suggesting future research in the biodiesel supply chain, specifically in the area case study in Indonesia.</jats:p>"

The authors argue that energy issues have set up a new chessboard of power on which countries improve their status, no matter whether they are energy importers or exporters. Such countries as Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and Egypt are pursuing, without being major energy producers, to brand themselves as ideal regional “energy hubs” to serve national interest. Self-branding is not only a matter of declaration. It is primarily a matter of the energy major players recognizing this branding. It is this recognition that is the decisive moment that the countries concerned tip over the energy chess game by turning their aspirations into something more than an energy supply issue. </jats:p>"

In\n   the Casamance region, the climatic situation has been characterised for the\n   last thirty years by a drop in rainfall, combined with a demographic\n   explosion which has led to an intensive exploitation of available water\n   resources. Ziguinchor, the main city of Casamance, although located in a\n   humid region rich in rainwater, does not guarantee continuous access to\n   drinking water for all its inhabitants, especially those living in the\n   outlying districts. The aim of this article is to show that the difficulties\n   of access to drinking water in the outskirts of Ziguinchor are closely\n   related to the inadequacy of the infrastructure for water supply. The\n   methodology adopted revolves around three main axes: documentary research,\n   data collection and data processing. The results of this study reveal that\n   the water production capacity in Ziguinchor, of 9,500 m3 per day (i.e. 400\n   m3/h), in fact presents a production deficit in relation to demand from\n   population estimated at 583,528 inhabitants, mainly noted in the peripheral\n   zone such as N?ma 2. The causes of this mismatch between supply and demand\n   are due to inadequate infrastructure, but also to the pollution and salinity\n   of water resources, in addition to poor governance of the supply sector.\n   Faced with this situation, there is an imperative to mobilise water\n   resources in the commune in a properly rational manner and to ensure more\n   sustainable management.</jats:p>"

Twenty cows were randomly assigned to two groups with 10 cows each. Cows in one group received Se‐yeast at 0.3 mg Se/kg DM during the last 4 weeks before calving in addition to fed a TMR containing supplemented sodium selenite at 0.3 mg Se/kg DM (Se‐yeast), while cows in another group were only fed a TMR containing supplemented sodium selenite at 0.3 mg Se/kg DM (Control). Blood samples were collected and analyzed for nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), β‐hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), glucose, insulin, tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐6, serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp), and albumin. In control cows, plasma NEFA, IL‐1β, IL‐6, SAA, and Hp levels increased after calving, but glucose, insulin, and albumin levels decreased after parturition. Se‐yeast supplemental cows had lower postpartum concentrations of NEFA, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐6, SAA, and Hp, and higher postpartum levels of glucose, insulin, and albumin compared with control cows. The results indicate that feeding Se‐replete cows a Se‐yeast supplement in late pregnancy improves nutrient metabolism and attenuates the inflammatory response after calving.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a new application of state-of-the-art PV potential estimation method based on Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data targeted toward individual household self-supply. The performance of the proposed general approach is demonstrated in the case of Slovenian PV based self-supply (yearly net self-sufficient energy supply) scheme and related policy. The results obtained by PV potential assessment method show drawbacks of the current policy solution in Slovenia, which limits the installed peak power of the PV systems to 80% of the rated power supply. The paper proposes to change the policy in a way that increases the yearly energy production of the PV system and assures proper voltage profiles in the electricity network. The paper is novel in terms of considering PV potential over LiDAR data by also considering self-sustainability, in using such techno-economic analysis to validate the merits and demerits of a policy approach and is the first such case study used in the context of Slovenian self-supply policy. The proposed PV potential estimation method is generally applicable for any location and can be easily adjusted to the local regulatory framework.</jats:p>"

This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on food supply and purchasing behaviour in a rural supermarket. Group model building workshops explored food supply experiences during COVID-19 in a rural Australian community with one supermarket. We asked three supermarket retailers “What are the current drivers of food supply into this supermarket environment?” and, separately, 33 customers: “What are the current drivers of purchases in this supermarket environment?” Causal loop diagrams were co-created with participants in real time with themes drawn afterwards from coded transcripts. Retailers’ experience of COVID-19 included ‘empty shelves’ attributed to media and government messaging, product unavailability, and community fear. Customers reported fear of contracting COVID-19, unavailability of food, and government restrictions resulting in cooking more meals at home, as influences on purchasing behaviour. Supermarket management and customers demonstrated adaptability and resilience to normalise demand and combat reduced supply.</jats:p>"

Polazište su glavne karakteristike hvarske poljoprivrede u ovom trenutku: niska produktivnost, usitnjena proizvodnja, nepostojanje udruženosti obiteljskih poljoprivrednih proizvođača, kao i nedostatak otkupnih centara. Metodologija korištena u radu uključuje analizu dostupnih pokazatelja o količini poljoprivredne proizvodnje na otoku Hvaru i online anketni upitnik kojim su istražena mišljenja poljoprivrednih proizvođača. Rezultati analize pokazuju opravdanost definiranja teoretskog modela koji uključuje „otočki distribucijski lanac“ i „Agro Hub“. Definirani model prikazan u radu temelji se na uspješnim primjerima razvoja distribucijskih centara za poljoprivredne proizvode koji bi mogli biti primijenjeni na otoku Hvaru. Rezultati implementacije predloženog modela uvelike bi unaprijedili poljoprivrednu proizvodnju Starogradskog polja koja se neprekidno odvija već 2.400 godina, zbog čega je i uvrštena na UNESCO-ovu listu svjetske baštine.</jats:p>"

In this article, the acceptance of insect meal as a feed component among Italian farmers of trout and seabass is investigated and discussed. Semi‐structured interviews have been conducted with farmers, feed producers, and insect‐meal producers. Then, a deductive thematic analysis has been carried out to understand which of the different variables characterizing farming structures and marketing channels can affect the choice of feed products and, as a consequence, the acceptance of insect meals. The information collected suggests to differentiate two levels of insights: the first concerns plain economic evaluation in what could be considered a standardized or theoretical environment, and is mainly related to the feed price and the feed conversion ratio. The second level takes into consideration the effects that occur in real environments and that are different depending on farm characteristics and business choices. Among the main aspects that should be considered (beyond prices and feed conversion ratio) are the final destination of the product, the processing and large retailers' requirements, the effects on digestion and feces production, and the variability of performance (as an effect of feed nutritional variability and environmental variability).</jats:p>",

In this paper, we investigate the performance of the CLSCs under different combinations of the recycling channel and the channel leadership when the recycling price is determined by the recycling party. Specially, we consider a CLSC consisting of two channel members, i.e., a manufacturer and a retailer. Each member acting as the channel leader has three different channels to collect the used products, and they are (ⅰ) the manufacturer (M-channel), (ⅱ) the retailer (R-channel) and (ⅲ) the third-party (T-channel). Given the recycling party determines the recycling price, mathematical models are developed to investigate the performance of the CLSC under different combinations of the channel leadership and the recycling channel. Through a comparison analysis, we find that M-channel is the most effective recycling channel. Moreover, once the M-channel be adopted, the retailer-led structure is as good as manufacture-led structure. We find that the recycling channel structure could be more important than the channel leadership in the CLSC. Finally, we illustrate that the CLSC can be coordinated by a two-part tariff contract.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Machine learning, which is widely recognized as a breakthrough technology, has recently made significant progress in improving supply chain management processes and efficiency. From planning to delivery, machine learning may be applied at different stages of the supply chain management process. Machine learning types are supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement. Each type has many tools which are discussed below in detail.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many power grid facilities require heating in winter. For their heating, they usually install a system of electric heaters, connect mini gas boilers or use the thermal emissions of working electrical installations, since these objects are often located away from the sources of central heating. This leads to additional costs for the organization's own needs. It is proposed to accumulate the excess heat generated by using a ground heat accumulator, which will allow you to accumulate heat in warm periods of the year and when there is an excess of thermal energy in the system, and then use the thermal energy of the accumulator to heat the object. (Research purpose) The research purpose is in developing a ground heat accumulator capable of accumulating excess heat energy generated during the operation of high-power transformers and, if necessary, to transfer the accumulated heat to the heat supply system of energy facilities. (Materials and methods) The article considers the advantages of introducing heat storage in the heat supply systems of various facilities. Authors conducted a literary analysis of various methods of heat accumulation. (Results and discussion) The article presents the justification for the choice of a ground heat accumulator. Authors have completed the description of the proposed battery and the technology of its creation. The article describes the method of calculation of the main elements of the selected type of heat accumulator and the quantitative characteristics of the accumulator on the example of real objects. The article describes the operation of the battery in interaction with a heat pump and a horizontal ground heat exchanger. (Conclusions) The use of a heat accumulator as a backup source for energy facilities allows organizations to reduce the cost of heating premises and equipment. Additional functions that the ground heat accumulator is capable of performing are identified.</jats:p>",

The block diagram of the shearer electric drive simulation model is presented. To take into account fluctuations in the level of consumption of active and reactive power, a model of the executive body of the shearer was used in the work, including a model of the moment of resistance on the auger when cutting. As a result, in the MATLAB Simulink environment, a simulation model of the electric drive of the UKD300 shearer was developed, suitable for assessing the energy efficiency of the electrical complex of mining areas and the feasibility of using modern devices for controlling the flow of electricity and power. As a result of the simulation, it was found that a significant irregularity in the graph of reactive power consumption, caused by repeated short-term operation, makes the use of capacitor units ineffective to compensate for reactive power. </jats:p>"

Risk management is one of the key tasks of the credit business of banks and other financial institutions, which runs through all aspects of the credit business before, during, and after the loan. This article combines blockchain and fuzzy neural network algorithms to study the credit risk of SME financing from the perspective of supply chain finance. This article builds a supply chain financial system through blockchain technology and integrates supply chain financial information into blocks. The fuzzy neural network algorithm is used for financial data processing and risk assessment, effectively solving and improving the risk processing level of the supply chain. Through further simulation, the application effect of blockchain and machine learning algorithms in the supply chain financial system was verified.</jats:p>",

We identified the problems of power supply and the presence of decentralized consumers. The analysis of indicators of solar energy resources of the area from both Mongolia and Russia sides was based on various data sources. The NASA data of solar radiation incident on the different surfaces was selected for further calculations and zoning of the area. We evaluated the economic feasibility of the construction of the solar power plant (SPP) serving tourism infrastructure facilities with a capacity of 10 to 100 persons located on the northern coast of Lake Khövsgöl, which are provided with electricity from diesel power plants (DPP). The research used an iterative express method for determining the optimal power of a SPP for autonomous power supply, developed by the authors. The criterion for optimality is the minimum ratio of capital investment in a SPP and the cost of substituted fuel at a DPP. The research findings attest to the fact that the introduction of the SPP for stand-alone electric power supply seems to be economically viable for both stationary and mobile facilities. Undiscounted payback periods resulted from the diesel fuel substitution range from 2.5 to 6 years.</jats:p>",

Energy storage is a new frontier technology which is considered as the ultimate solution in developing micro-smart grid with distributed renewable power generation. Most of the hot countries like India spend nearly 24% of the electricity generated on air-conditioning and food preservation. Under such scenario, among the various types of storage systems, the cool thermal storage plays a vital role to promote renewable power in an economical way. Considering the importance in the present renewable energy scenario, in the present work, an experimental investigation was performed on a packed bed cool storage system integrated with a chiller system which has major advantages in central air-conditioning system for demand management strategies. The storage system consists of encapsulated spherical balls filled with a mixture of distilled water and pseudomonas (nucleating agent) as phase change material and a mixture of distilled water and mono-ethylene glycol as heat transfer fluid. The essential parameters such as reduction in subcooling, instantaneous, and cumulative heat transfer during the charging process are presented for the efficient operation.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is to analyze the modeling preference and trend of the current automobile market in time, which can assist the modeling design of new models of automobile main engine factories and strengthen their branding family. Intelligent rapid modeling shortens the current modeling design cycle, so that the product rapid iteration is to occupy an active position in the automotive market. In this article, aiming at the family analysis of automobile front face, the image database of automobile front face modeling analysis was created. The database included two data sets of vehicle signs and no vehicle signs, and the image data of vehicle front face modeling of most models of 22 domestic mainstream brands were collected. Then, this article adopts the image classification processing method in computer vision to conduct car brand classification training on the database. Based on ResNet-8 and other model architectures, it trains and classifies the intelligent vehicle brand classification database with and without vehicle label. Finally, based on the shape coefficient, a 3D wireframe model and a curved surface model are obtained. The experimental results show that the 3D curve model can be obtained based on a single image from any angle, which greatly shortens the modeling period by 92%. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, research on external supply chain integration (SCI) has largely adopted a static‐snapshot perspective and has failed to grasp SCI's dynamic reality. The scant research devoted to SCI's dynamic perspectives suggests that the strength and scope of ties between buyers and suppliers differ based on integration levels. However, ambiguity persists regarding the relational behaviors exhibited across integration levels, as well as the stimulants that motivate firms to evolve their relationships. With buyers increasingly relying upon suppliers (and vice‐versa) and compounded by the knowledge that nearly half of SCI initiatives end up as failures, the need for a holistic framework that takes into account the underlying dynamics of relational behaviors and stimulants cannot be overstated. Using a mixed‐methods approach, six relational behaviors that differ in their saliency across SCI levels are identified, and eight stimulants that motivate B–S relationships to evolve are extracted. Specifically, we note that once a stimulant is activated, it remains influential across SCI levels, though its potency may vary. Our research significantly extends the contemporary understanding of SCI by (i) providing a holistic framework to comprehend SCI from a behavioral perspective, and (ii) noting that the highest integration levels do not necessarily typify successful B–S relationships. In doing so, we combine an evolutionary perspective with a relationship portfolio perspective for examining B–S relationship dynamics, thereby offering a comprehensive view to yield finer‐grained insights into B–S relationship dynamics.</jats:p>",

The evaluation of the protective effect of labor protective articles can provide reference for the equipment of labor protective articles. In this paper, starting from personal protection, a whole set of protective effect evaluation system is established from the aspects of protective ability, abrasion resistance and tear resistance, comfort and others according to the requirements of power supply protection, and then conduct empirical analysis to discuss the different protective effects of different types of protective articles. The results showed that protective clothing C and E with the best protective effect not only had higher anti-seepage and anti-penetration ability, but also had anti-static and anti-radiation ability, the protective effect of which is 36.9% than that of the worst one. Antis-eepage and anti-penetration ability can be used as the primary selection standard of protective clothing. When selecting protective products, if the economic conditions permit, choose a higher-priced protective product, and the protection effect is better.

Meanwhile, we design three scenarios, the manufacturer‐led earlier scenario, the manufacturer‐led later scenario, and the retailer‐led scenario, to analyze the effects of time sequences when the manufacturer is risk neutral or risk averse. Through modeling and analysis, it is concluded that whether the manufacturer is risk averse or not, the manufacturer prefers the manufacturer‐led earlier scenario and the retailer's preference is the retailer‐led scenario. That is, when considering the time sequences, the players are encouraged to make all decisions in the first stage. Moreover, this paper analyzes the effects of the exchange rate and delivery lead time on the players’ pricing decisions. The theoretical and numerical analyses also show that the effects of an increasing exchange rate on the profits of the manufacturer and retailer are associated with the cost of the online channel. Additionally, while reducing the delivery lead time can attract customers, a moderate delivery lead time is more advantageous for the manufacturer. Finally, we further verify the robustness of the impacts of time sequences when the manufacturer is risk averse. Interestingly, if the cost of the online channel is higher, then the risk‐averse behavior benefits the retailer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of adequate application of quantitative supply chain (SCF) solutions for cooperative working capital management becomes more and more important in terms of globalization and growing competition between supply chains (SCs). Authors address the problem by developing models for cooperative working capital management (WCM) through SCF adoption for the case of the three-stage supply chain. The grounding for the optimization is multicriteria approach. The multi-objective working capital optimization model (Ivakina et al., 2021) allows to nd optimal solution regardless initial financial and liquidity position of SC. In the article, we use this model to quantitatively implement a multi-objective working capital management strategy on the cases of real supply chains. The results obtained in the paper indicate that the model of working capital optimization with concurrent use of multiple supply chain finance solutions can provide an optimal solution for all the cases considered in the research. It allows to decrease the total financial costs on working capital and supply chain finance solutions making individual ones not worse and at the same time achieve greater liquidity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Long patient transport times to trauma centers are a well-known problem in sparsely populated regions with a low hospital density. Transfusion of red blood cell concentrates (RBC) and plasma improves outcome of trauma patients with severe bleeding. Helicopter emergency services (HEMS) are frequently employed to provide early advanced medical care and to reduce time to hospital admission. Supplying HEMS with blood products allows prehospital transfusion and may help to prevent exsanguination or prolonged hemorrhagic shock. We have investigated the maintenance of blood product quality under air transport conditions and the logistical steps to introduce a HEMS blood depot into routine practice. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A risk analysis was performed and a validation plan developed. A special, commercially available transport container for blood products was identified. Maintenance of temperature conditions between 2 and 6°C in the box were monitored at ambient temperatures up to 35°C over 48 h. Quality of blood products before and after helicopter air transport were evaluated including (1) for RBCs: hemoglobin, hematocrit, hemolysis rate; (2) for thawed plasma: aPTT, INR, single clotting factor activities. The logistics for blood supply of the regional HEMS were developed by the transfusion service of the Greifswald University Hospital in collaboration with the in-hospital transport team, the HEMS team, and the HEMS operator. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The transport container maintained a temperature below 6°C up to 36 h at 35°C ambient temperature. Vibration during helicopter operation did not impair quality of RBC and thawed plasma. To provide blood products for HEMS at least two transport containers and an additional set of cooling tiles is needed as the cooling tiles need a special temperature priming over 20 h. The two boxes were used at alternate days. To reduce wastage, RBCs and thawed plasmas were exchanged every fourth day and reintegrated into the blood bank inventory for further in-hospital use. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Supplying HEMS with RBCs and plasma is feasible. Helicopter transport has no negative impact on blood product quality. The logistic challenges require close collaboration between the HEMS team and the blood transfusion service. </jats:p>"

The vehicle classification model is built as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the expectation‐maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to solve the parameter estimation of GMM. A nonlinear mixed‐integer programming model is constructed to minimize the total cost of VCMP. The matching process between vehicle and commodity is realized by GMM‐EM, as a preprocessing of the solution. The design of the vehicle‐commodity matching platform for VCMP is designed to reduce and eliminate the information asymmetry between supply and demand so that the order allocation can work at the right time and the right place and use the optimal solution of vehicle‐commodity matching. Furthermore, the numerical experiment of an e‐commerce supply chain proves that a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) is superior to the traditional method, which provides a decision‐making reference for e‐commerce VCMP.</jats:p>",

In this study, a convenient sampling technique was used to solicit data from 308 potential consumers. Using a two-step structural equation model method for data analysis, the results show that both egoistic and altruistic values affect the willingness of consumers to purchase efficient water-saving appliances. However, compared with altruistic values, egoistic values had a greater influence on consumers' purchasing intention. From the Chinese perspective, this study is one of the primary efforts to understand the association and importance of ethical values and consumers' willingness to support water-saving innovations. The findings of this study put forward significant policy effects that could serve as a benchmark for measures that are likely to promote purchasing intentions toward efficient water-saving appliances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To solve the financing problem of the food producers, we consider a two‐echelon contract food supply chain composed of a family farm with capital constraints and a food processing enterprise. With no capital constraints as the benchmark model, we analyze optimal decisions of the family farm and the food processing enterprise in the case of bank financing with bank participation only and bank financing with “government, bank, and insurance” coparticipation. Then, we discuss how the risk of yield uncertainty influences the optimal decisions and profits of the family farm and the food processing enterprise under different financing situation. Meanwhile, the reason why the government subsidizes agriculture is explored, and the policy of minimum purchase price of the food is initiated when the market price is too low. Finally, the numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented. The results show that the bank financing with “government, bank, and insurance” coparticipation improves the welfare of supply chain members more obviously than the bank financing with bank participation only; when the rice price is too low, the policy of minimum purchase price of food is initiated, which increases the revenue and the growing enthusiasm of the family farm; the profits of the family farm and the food processing enterprise will decrease as the risk of yield uncertainty increases in the case of bank financing, and the risk of yield uncertainty will be reduced for the family farm when bank financing with “government, bank, and insurance” coparticipation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, research has shown that biomass can be a source of energy to replace fossil fuels and effectively reduce current environmental crises. Researchers have studied how biofuels are supplied through the oil supply chain to achieve tangible results. This paper presents an optimization model for the gas-oil and biodiesel supply chains suggesting the optimization of both supply chains simultaneously for the first time. The proposed model deals with the connection points of two supply chains and determines the two chains’ connection points by considering two economic and environmental objective functions. The model can be used to make decisions on issues such as location, allocation, production planning, inventory management, capacity expansion, and so forth. The proposed programming model’s performance has been studied through a real case study in Iran and the sensitivity analyses have been performed. The ε-constraint method was used to solve the multi-objective model. The proposed model is expected to be effective in the future management of countries’ fuel sources, particularly to be used as an alternative to fossil fuels. Also, this research can provide a basis for more extensive research on fuel supply chain integration.</jats:p>"

The corrosion (scale) layer, that invariably develops on the pipes’ inner walls, is capable of adsorbing a significant mass of metal-cations and releasing them thereafter via diffusion to the water once operation is resumed, thereby causing a secondary contamination event. To overcome this, the contaminant should be completely removed, in a controlled fashion, from both the aqueous and scale phases, with minimum damage to the pipe's physical stature. This study determined the range of the Cd(II) adsorption capacity of corrosion-scales and quantified alternative treatments for desorbing it, using an assortment of metal water-pipes, extracted from the WDS. Batch, water-recirculation and flow-through experiments were conducted to determine the extent of Cd(II) adsorption and the best way to desorb it. Corrosion-scales showed substantial Cd(II)-absorption capacity (up to 0.75 mg Cd(II)/g scale) with an approximately linear relation between the aqueous Cd(II) concentration and the adsorbed mass. Desorption experiments included dosages of various acids. Sequential rinsing (eight pipe-volumes) by pH3 solution was found to be the best approach, releasing close to ∼100% of the adsorbed Cd(II), with only a minor effect on the pipes’ integrity.</jats:p>",

We examined the effect of readily available soil phosphorus (P) on early maize growth and linked in‐season height growth to final harvest yield using field plots with contrasting P supply in a one‐year study embedded in a long‐term experiment. Water‐extractable P (Pw) was used as a proxy for readily available P in soil. Plant height, dry matter (DM) accumulation, P and nitrogen (N) uptakes were determined eight times from the two‐leaf stage until final whole‐crop harvest and fitted to logistic growth models. The models revealed that the final yield was significantly related to the time required to reach the maximum rate of height growth (occurring from 330 to 485 accumulated growing degree units, GDU), but not the time required to reach the maximum rate of DM accumulation (occurring from 561 to 649 GDU). Furthermore, plant height at the four‐leaf stage and onwards was significantly related to the final harvest yield. Soil Pw linked closely to height growth parameters; higher levels of Pw gave earlier peaks in height growth. For this light sandy loam with a wide gradient in P content, we conclude that suboptimal P supply postpones height growth and reduces final yields. A sufficient P supply links to an early rapid increase in plant height and forms the potential for optimum nutrient uptake and high forage yields. Thus, early‐season plant height may serve as a simple morphometric indicator for final yields.</jats:p>",

Some of the considered technical solutions can be attributed to innovative developments.  Materials and Methods: the known methods of repairing concrete structures of water-supply structures and linings were studied as research materials, their advantages and disadvantages were noted. Particular attention is paid to technical solutions for which patents for inventions have been obtained.  Results: damage repair of concrete linings of water-supply structures in the form of cracks and destruction of expansion joints is most common, since at the same time water permeability decreases, and the bearing capacity increases. Repair by surface impregnation method is carried out to strengthen the protective layer of reinforced concrete structures to a depth of 15–35 mm. Repair of local disturbances is carried out manually at a depth of destruction less than 0.1 m. Areal disturbances with an area of more than 1 m² and a destruction depth of more than 0.1 m are recommended to be repaired mechanically. Invention no. 1477877 proposes a method for repairing construction structures and facilities, which is carried out by the method of pressure injection of repair compounds, they increase the quality of repair due to the reliability of defective zones filling. Innovative methods of facing repairing include sealing damage by injecting bentonite mortar during data remote transmission from humidity sensors to a personal computer (patent no. 2612431), as well as a method of sealing the joints of facings, including an anti-filtration bundle in the form of a hollow cylinder filled with bentonite clay (patent no. 2598635).  Conclusions: repair of damage to concrete water-supply linings is the most common, since the water permeability of the concrete structure decreases at the same time as the bearing capacity changes.</jats:p>"

This is significantly larger than earlier estimates. The extractable amounts were stratified by extraction cost and ore grade in the model, making them extractable only after price increases and cost reductions. The model simulated extraction, supply, ore grades, and market prices. The assessment predicts future scarcity and supply problems after 2100 for nickel. The model reconstructs observed extraction, supply and market prices for the period 1850–2020, and is used to simulate development for the period 2020–2200. The quality of nickel ore has decreased significantly from 1850 to 2020 and will continue to do so in the future according to the simulated predictions from the WORLD7 model. For nickel, extraction rates are suggested to reach their maximum value in 2050, and that most primary nickel resources will have been exhausted by 2130. After 2100, the supply per capita for nickel will decline towards exhaustion if business-as-usual is continuing. This will be manifested as reduced supply and increased prices. The peak year can be delayed by a maximum of 100 years if recycling rates are improved significantly and long before scarcity is visible.</jats:p>",

Then, a vehicle first-drone second algorithm is used to solve the mixed delivery and pickup problem with drone.

As a result, the supply process of tourism products was confirmed to diversify the strategic market, switch from package tours to free individual tours(FIT), expand representative tour courses, increase of direct sales channels, and strengthen the management system. It was confirmed that the network and structure of the tourism supply chain were divided into public and private areas, that the system for developing and distributing tourism products was systematically equipped, and that it formed an ecosystem as an organization rather than a one-way value chain. The characteristics of tourist products in each stage of tourist behaviors showed that the quality of commercial value and playfulness were strengthened, and the efforts to expand monitoring to induce revisits were marked. The academic implications of this study suggest an integrated framework for inbound tourism products. Practical implications describe the direction of tourism products and the role of each stakeholder.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have suggested that the nutraceutical, quercetin, can improve exercise performance and reduce pain sensitivity in healthy mice and improve blood supply in a rodent model of acute hind-limb ischaemia. These models may not be relevant to people with PAD. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of quercetin on exercise performance, physical activity and blood supply in a novel mouse model of sustained hind-limb ischaemia.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Hind-limb ischaemia was induced in 6-month-old male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice using a novel two-stage surgical procedure. Five days after induction of ischaemia, mice were allocated to commence dietary quercetin or a control diet for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was exercise performance evaluated using a treadmill test. Other outcomes included physical activity, estimated by an open field test, and hind-limb blood supply, assessed by laser Doppler monitoring.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A sustained reduction in relative limb blood supply (P &amp;lt; 0.001) was achieved consistently in all 48 mice before allocation to a control (n = 24) or quercetin (n = 24) diet.

First, we found sharp shifts in the relative career attractiveness of teaching, such that a 13% wage premium for teachers in 1988 dissipated over time and regressed to a 11% wage penalty in 2013, when compared with similar workers. Second, returns to tertiary education are markedly higher in nonteaching careers—about 11–15 percentage points more so than in teaching. Third, highly educated workers in younger cohorts are half as likely to become teachers relative to older cohorts, particularly in recent years. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> The authors contextualize findings and discuss appropriate policy implications. Most importantly, holding back teacher wage levels from broader market prices has consequential effects on teacher supply. Policy makers need to reconsider existing forms of teacher compensation arrangements and develop sustainable wage dynamics that can attract and retain bright minds to enter and stay in teaching. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, a simulation model of an autonomous PVdiesel power supply (PDPS) system with direct current is considered. The autonomous PDPS is implemented in the Simulink programming environment of the Matlab software package. The system includes: a photovoltaic power station (PPS), a diesel generator (DG), an energy storage system (ESS), a remote consumer as well as auxiliary converters. The PDPS model makes it possible to analyze the energy balance between generation, consumption, and the energy exchange available from the ESS connected via a DC bus (DCB). With the help of the proposed model, it is possible to analyze and optimize the technical and economic indicators of DC power plants with the priority of the PPS contribution: reducing the consumption of diesel fuel and carbonation of the air reducing the cost of 1 kWh for the remote consumer and controlling the switching in the power plants as per logical conditions. The obtained technical and economic indicators of the PDPS using direct current are superior to similar systems based on alternating current due to an increase in the contribution of the PPS to the energy balance. As a result of experiments with changing input conditions, i.e. annual changes in insolation and temperature at different latitudes, the authors justify technical, economic, and environmental criteria for the effectiveness of decision-making and recommendations for the design and operation of PDPS power plants. Intelligent algorithms for effective control of PV-diesel power systems based on DC are developed and suggested</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of a capital-constrained supply chain, we examine how a direct channel added by a manufacturer influences the players’ optimal decisions and profits under bargaining game. The capital-constrained retailer adopts a type of hybrid financing scheme including bank credit and equity financing to alleviate its capital shortage. We characterize the equilibrium results under different sales channels, and examine the impacts of the bank loans ratio and bargaining power on the players’ optimal decisions. The conditions of the equilibrium channel choices are derived. We find that if the retailer’s bank loans ratio in the retail channel is beyond a certain threshold, a dual-channel structure can enhance the profits of the manufacturer and supply chain. The retailer, however, will benefit from the direct channel when its bank loans ratio in the retail channel is below a certain threshold. We further demonstrate that a dual-channel structure can reduce the degree of double marginalization of the overall supply chain. In addition, to solve the potential channel conflict, a bilateral payment mechanism is developed to achieve Pareto improvement for both players. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the major results of the paper.</jats:p>"

Purpose. To study the diagnostic capabilities of various research methods in visualization of the neovascular network of small and medium-sized choroidal melanoma. Material and methods. 5 patients (45 eyes) with choroidal melanoma (19 men, 26 women), aged 22 to 84 (56.03 ±15.29) years, underwent complex diagnostics using various methods of studying the blood supply to the tumor: ultrasound in the color Doppler mode mapping, indocyanine green angiography and spectral optical coherence tomography-angiography. Results. The different diagnostic significance of instrumental methods for the identification of neovascular vasculature in \"small\" and \"medium\" choroidal melanomas was established: indocyanine green angiography – 89%, OCT angiography – 71%, ultrasound – 77%. In case of \"small\" choroidal melanomas, indocyanine green angiography (83%) and OCT angiography (79%) are highly diagnostic in detecting tumor blood supply, while the first type of angioarchitectonics of the neovascular bed was diagnosed with a significantly higher frequency. In case of \"medium\" melanoma of the choroid, the informative value of angiography with indocyanine green and ultrasound examination was highly significant and made it possible to diagnose the vascular network in all the cases studied. Choroidal melanomas of these sizes are characterized by the presence of predominantly the second type of angioarchitectonics (81%), in which the hypervascular nature of blood flow was significantly more often determined. Conclusion. The results of this study demonstrate that the use of an integrated diagnostic approach provides a high diagnostic value in the study of blood supply to choroidal melanoma, which determines the prospects for continuing this study with the aim of a detailed study of the angioarchitectonics of choroidal melanoma.</jats:p>"

The low-carbon product manufacturer is both in the carbon trading market and product market. In the former market, the manufacturer can gain profits by selling its emission quota. In the latter market, the manufacturer has two sales channel options, the traditional offline retailer and the online e-commerce platform. These two channels make two supply chains, the manufacturer-led offline one and the e-commerce platform-led online one. This paper combines the carbon trading market with the product market, formulates different Stackelberg game models, compares the manufacturer’s decision under two channels and the impact of channels on the carbon emission, does sensitivity analysis, and verifies the conclusions with numerical examples. Our findings are (1) the establishment of the carbon market will help the manufacturer reduce its carbon emission, especially for those sensitive to the carbon price and those with too much emissions; (2) whether the manufacturer turns to the online channel depends on the consumers’ sensitivity to the sales service, and consumers’ attention will guide the way to the online mode; (3) which mode is conducive to carbon emission reduction relies on the product type: the e-commerce platform does well for daily necessities of mass production while the traditional channel is better for experience goods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are most of the energy`s costs are accounted for by heating and hot water supply in communal housing conditions. Every day there is a growing need for the development and development of alternative options for energy generation technology. In the field of alternative energy, the most popular solution is a heat supply system based on air heat pumps (HP). Construction and installation work is simplified for integrated heat pump systems, but the question of the organization of design for these devices remains not fully resolved. The purpose of the work is to study the features and patterns of design and construction works with heat pump systems built into the premises in the field of low-rise construction and to develop measures to reduce the time and cost of such works. Heat engineering calculations for integrated heat pump systems that take into account climatic features, architectural and construction elements and parameters of engineering networks of the construction object, increase the complexity, cost and duration of design work. The research methods used are the analysis of the entire design process and in particular the section “heating and ventilation”, further modeling through network planning of the design process and comparison of the obtained data. The results of the study are calendar schedules of the design process of integrated heat pump systems on the example of a cottage structure with an area of 150 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. For further analysis, the parameters of the time reserves of the working processes of the obtained network graphs are calculated. The section of heating, ventilation and heat supply (S) for integrated heat pump systems of heat supply is compared with the classical one, where the heat generator is an electric boiler. As a result of the study, a scheme for organizing design work is proposed, which allows you to plan the design of the section S without affecting the overall terms of execution of project documentation and the growth of its cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research develops two models to consider retailer sales promotion and manufacturer trade promotion under demand uncertainty. The objective of the first model is to determine the retailer’s optimal promotional effort and order quantity while maximizing the retailer’s profit under exogenous trade promotion. The second model extends the first to consider the manufacturer’s endogenous trade promotion decisions. For these models, three different trade promotion policies (off-invoice, scan-back, unsold-discount) have been compared to identify the policy that can increase the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s profits. For the model with exogenous trade promotion, the retailer’s promotional effort level, order quantity, and profit are highest under the off-invoice trade promotion policy. With respect to the manufacturer’s endogenous trade promotion decisions, the retailer’s promotional effort level, order quantity, and profit, and the manufacturer’s profit are higher under the off-invoice policy than under the scan-backs policy. When comparing the three different trade promotion policies, we also find that the wholesale price is a key factor that influences a manufacturer’s profit. Our research sheds light on the importance of trade promotion policy in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Investment projects are the basis of such decisions. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to improve the heat supply of residential apartment buildings using the example of an investment project in the Vostochny residential complex of Samara. The article highlights the results of the performed economic analysis of the project to improve the supply of hot water to apartment buildings of the residential complex. The reason for the development of the investment project was the lack of a centralized hot water supply system in residential buildings. The situation was due to the failure of the heat exchange equipment. In order to improve the heat supply of residential apartment buildings, the project provides for the laying of a new route with a length of 1,500 meters from the district boiler house of the municipal enterprise to residential buildings. The total amount of funds required for the implementation of the project amounted to 5640 thousand rubles. To invest the project, it is planned to use the own funds of the municipal enterprise providing heat supply to houses - the items «depreciation» and «profit.» The economic indicators expected from the implementation of the measures were investigated. It was revealed that the construction and commissioning of a new hot water supply route in the Vostochny residential complex will ensure the formation of profits: by the end of the first year of operation - 11 thousand rubles, by the end of the second year of operation - 326 thousand rubles, by the end of the third year of operation - 502 thousand rubles. The payback period of the investment project is very significant and will be 19 years. Conclusions: the studies showed the financial feasibility of the investment project and the economic effectiveness of measures to improve the heat supply of residential apartment buildings in a residential microdistrict.</jats:p>"

However, many manufacturers are conservative about their capacity investment for a variety of reasons. As a result, many retailers have the motivation to stimulate manufacturers to enhance the capacity level. In this paper, we propose a revenue sharing and capacity cost compensation contract to help the retailer stimulate her manufacturer to increase the capacity level. In the contract, the retailer keeps a portion of sales revenue and compensates for the manufacturer’s capacity cost. They face a stochastic demand and play a Stackelberg game where the retailer acts as a leader and the manufacturer acts as a follower. We prove that the channel can be perfectly coordinated through our proposed contract. Moreover, we give a feasible range of profit distribution, in which both channel members can earn no less profit than that in non-cooperation. Meanwhile, comparing with centralized channel with multiplicative demand, we find that capacity in decentralized channel tends to be lower.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Light-emitting diode (LED) has the characteristics of environmental protection and energy saving, having become the lighting source of a new generation of street-light lamps. The traditional two-stage power supply for providing an LED street-light lamp is composed of an AC-DC converter with a power-factor-correction (PFC) function at the front stage and a DC-DC converter at the rear stage. The two-stage power supply for an LED street-light lamp has a large number of electronic components and costs, and the circuit efficiency is not high. Therefore, this paper presents a novel single-stage high power factor AC-DC power supply for providing an LED street-light lamp featuring soft-switching and Bluetooth wireless dimming capability through using smart tablets or smartphones to remote control the output power of the LED street-light lamp for achieving energy-saving benefits. The proposed AC-DC LED power supply integrates an interleaved buck converter circuit with coupled inductors and a half-bridge LLC resonant converter circuit into a single-stage power conversion circuit. Moreover, the coupled inductor of the interleaved buck converter circuit is designed to operate in the discontinuous conduction mode, which can naturally achieve PFC. In addition, the two power switches in the novel LED power supply have zero-voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics, which can reduce the switching losses of the power switches. The two output diodes have the characteristics of zero-current switching (ZCS), which can reduce the conduction losses of the power diodes. This paper developed a single-stage prototype circuit for providing an 144 W (36 V/4 A)-rated LED street-light lamp. According to the experimental results of the prototype circuit with an AC input voltage of 110 volts, the presented single-stage LED power supply offers high power factor (PF &gt; 0.99), low input-current total harmonic distortion factor (THD &lt; 3%), and high efficiency (&gt;89%). In addition, this paper used the built-in Bluetooth wireless communication function of a smart tablet or smart phone to fulfill remote dimming control. By changing the duty ratio of the control signal, we could realize remote dimming control of 20% to 100% of the output LED street-light lamp power.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Firms increasingly put financial pressure on their suppliers, also called squeezing. Suppliers react and adapt to financial squeeze as autonomous agents, causing complex ripple effects across the extended supply chain network. To capture intertwined and highly interactive effects among suppliers, we use agent‐based models. We explore the impact of financial squeeze on supply chain network structure and operational outcomes. Results suggest that financial squeeze affects the stability of the supply chain network and the effect varies depending on the location of the suppliers. Firms located at the bottom of the supply chain network suffer most from financial squeeze, and the magnitude of the effect increases as one goes further upstream. In addition, as existing suppliers exit the network and new suppliers enter, three network archetypes (Empty Nest, TransitUp, and StableDown) emerge. We identify the condition and operational consequences associated with these three archetypes. Our findings are informative to managers at buyer firms about the impacts of squeezing strategy on their extended supply chain partners, who often times are out of their immediate purview.</jats:p>",

The customer’s demand is pretended to be price-sensitive dependent to increment the quantity of offers, and the vendor offers a quantity discount to persuade the buyer to purchase more amounts.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivated by Hema Fresh’s new-retail case, we study the coordination of a two-echelon fresh-product supply chain consisting of a single supplier and a single retailer. Due to a long production lead time, the supplier has to make production decision in advance based on early demand information. The market demand can be updated during the supplier’s production lead time. Hence, the retailer would make order decision according to the latest demand information. Incorporating risk-sharing mechanism of overproduction and overstock, we propose a novel bi-directional risk-sharing contract to coordinate such a supply chain with demand information updating. We construct a two-stage optimization model in which the supplier first decides production quantity, and then the retailer decides final order quantity not exceeding the supplier’s initial production. In both the centralized and decentralized systems, we analytically derive the unique equilibrium of production and order decisions in a Stackelberg supplier-led game. We prove that the proposed contract can realize supply chain perfect coordination and explore how the proposed contract affects the members’ decisions. The theoretical results show that, by turning the risk-sharing proportions, the supply chain profit can be arbitrarily split between the members, which is a desired property for supply chain coordination. Compared with the single risk-sharing contract, the proposed contract results in a greater supply chain profit and achieves Pareto improvement for both members. Furthermore, we also explore how the risk preference and negotiating power affect the contract selection and the additional profit allocation of the supply chain. Numerical examples are presented to verify our theoretical results.</jats:p>",

This problem raises a trade dispute because imported products cannot enter another state market due to different halal standards. So, we need the same halal standards for every country in Asia, one of which requires transparency in each country's HAS. However, the HAS documentation process currently has several shortcomings, such as document fraud and transparency during internal and external audits. This chapter aims to discuss blockchain technology's development in solving internal audit problems to improve its performance, and blockchain technology can improve efficiency, transparency, and traceability of original documents, thereby enhancing the overall halal certification process. And it is hoped that this research will be taken into consideration for those who will make the same halal standards for every country in Asia. </jats:p>"

In addition, there often occur unexplained differences (unbalance) in the accounting of electricity received by end users and consumed by the TWR line at a traction substation. The accomplished studies have shown that in almost all sections of the network, the actual electricity consumption is significantly lower than that recorded by the TWR line metering devices. The discrepancy in the readings could be explained by unauthorized taps of electricity. However, such a statement will be superficial. The article considers the real factors causing the unbalance in accounting the electricity consumed on the TWR line, which are explained by the magnetic influence of the contact system. An equivalent circuit of the contact system magnetic influence on the TWR line is presented for any configuration of the section with different placements of self-contained transformer substations at different levels of their power capacity. The magnetic influence of the contact system on the TWR line is illustrated by a phasor diagram.</jats:p>"

The paper considers energy efficiency of both the existing traction power supply system without current regulating devices and the traction power supply system with the use of such devices. The author has determined the influence of increase of speed from 50 to 100 km/h on power consumption on traction including on power consumption according counters of electric locomotives and losses of power in the catenary. Also as a variant of strengthening the paper considers a buffer traction power supply system consisting of main regulated traction substations and a not regulated single-unit traction substation in the middle of inter-substation zone. This system is used in situation when regulation of voltage on main traction substations doesn’t provide the increase of traffic and carrier capacity of sections (directions). Modeling of operation of the traction power supply system has been carried out on a section of the Sverdlovsk Railway. All the calculations have been executed for the batch of freight trains with the mass of 7100 tons. In calculations the author has applied a new clarifying method that includes the use of corrective current coefficients and the assessment of voltage level on an electric locomotive current collector. The energy efficiency of the traction power supply system has been assessed by such indicators as a level of voltage on the electric locomotive current collector, power losses in catenary and transformers of traction substations.</jats:p>"

While the law structures today’s global value chains and is designed to secure the economic interests of Global North companies that sit at the top of most of such chains, it also bears considerable potential for transformation and empowerment. The different legal interventions around the 2012 Ali Enterprises factory fire demonstrate that law is not only a direct product of dominant class interests, but that it can also open up opportunities for resistance and emancipatory struggle. Written from the perspective of one of the actors closely involved in the legal struggle for justice that followed the Ali Enterprises factory fire, both in terms of building transnational alliances as well as in the litigation itself, this chapter critically reflects on the achievements of the legal interventions carried out and also attempts to develop criteria for a holistic approach to what is often called strategic litigation.</jats:p>"

From a knowledge management perspective, little attention is paid to such knowledge risks arising from data-centric collaborations. Hence, this proposed PhD project aims at investigating this, by using the overall method of Design Science Research. The project focuses on digital SC, as data-centric collaborations play a central role within them. To contribute to knowledge research, a framework is being sought.

Hydrogen is widely considered as an imperative energy carrier to reach carbon neutral targets. However, hydrogen production, either from non-fossil power or fossil fuels with carbon capture, is closely linked with an energy supply system and has great impacts on its structure. Identifying an economically affordable transition pathway is attractive, and energy infrastructure is critical due to massive investment and long life-span. In this paper, a multi-regional, multi-period, and infrastructure-based model is proposed to quantify energy supply system transition costs with different low-carbon targets and hydrogen production alternatives, and China is taken as a case study. Results show that, fulfilling 2-degree and 1.5-degree temperature increase targets would result in 84% and 151% increases in system transition costs, 114% and 246% increases in infrastructure investment, and 211% and 339% increases in stranded investment, compared to fulfilling stated policy targets. Producing hydrogen from coal would be economical when carbon capture and sequestration cost is lower than 437 yuan per tonne, and reduce infrastructure investment and stranded coal investment by 16% and 35% respectively, than producing hydrogen from renewable power.</jats:p>"

Based on the analysis of the burial depth of the critical water level of vegetation groundwater, a calculation method for the response of vegetation to water environment stress is established, and the water inrush and seepage volume of tunnel engineering under the condition of ecological balance protection are derived. By calculating the range and volume of the dewatering funnel when the tunnel underground water level reaches the maximum depth after water inrush and seepage, the maximum drainage value that must be controlled in tunnel construction is obtained. The proposed method has achieved certain practical results and could provide some theoretical reference for guiding the reasonable protection of groundwater, alleviating and eliminating adverse environmental geological effects in tunnel construction.</jats:p>",

The balancing of demand-and-supply can be of significant social benefit, for which the equilibrium method for urban taxis, especially with dynamic trip demands, is not well studied yet. In this paper, we formally define the equilibrium problem and propose a coarse-grained dynamic balancing algorithm. It efficiently evaluates the trip demand distribution pattern and schedules supplies to more unbalanced regions. We first propose a density-based blocking algorithm to detect regions that are with more travel demands. A trip demand merging strategy is then proposed, which checks the correlation of trip demands to merge the trips into ones. To reduce the computation load, a lazy trip correlation strategy is devised to speed up the merging process. By calculating the defined balance factor, a scheduling algorithm is proposed to realize the trip merge and supply translocation based balancing approach. We evaluated our approach using a month of global positioning system (GPS) trajectories generated by 13,000 taxis of Shanghai. By learning the spatiotemporal distribution of historical taxi demand-and-supplies, we simulated an inflated trip demand platform. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, the proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

Increasing of number, scale and duration of the consequences of emergency situations associated with the violation of the conditions of normal living of people requires the creation of temporary field accommodation points for the affected population and rescue units. At the same time, electric power supply in field temporary accommodation facilities plays a crucial role in the complex of tasks and measures aimed at providing life to the injured population and rescue units. At the same time, there are no mobile autonomous sources of electric energy for providing life support to people in the field in the organizational and staff structure of rescue units, and the existing sources of electric energy in the complexes of equipment used in areas of emergency situations cannot be used for these purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a scientific and methodological approach to determine necessary and sufficient number of sources of electric energy for the power supply of the life support of the injured population and rescue units when they are placed in field temporary accommodation points. The purpose of the study. Electric power supply of field temporary accommodation points for the injured population and rescue units, ensuring the required reliability of electric power supply, maximizing its efficiency in the conditions of possible resource constraints and minimizing the influence of the uncertainty factor in the planning of electricity consumption. Research methods. The main provisions of the calculation of electrical loads, system theory, set theory, probability theory and the apparatus of mathematical statistics. The results of the study. A methodology has been developed that allows to justify the power of electric energy sources for the power supply of field temporary accommodation points for the injured population and rescue units, rational options for the power supply system, the nomenclature and number of electric energy sources for the life support of people in the field; to calculate the electric network; to evaluate the operation of the power supply system, based on the probability of failure-free operation of the source of electric energy; to justify the composition of engineering means to ensure the creation of the power supply system. Conclusion. The scientific and methodological approach for determining the composition of electric energy sources for the power supply of life support for the injured population and rescue units when they are placed in field temporary accommodation points is justified, which also allows to resolve the contradiction between the need to organize the power supply of life support for people in temporary accommodation points and the lack of a reasonable structure of electric energy sources for these purposes.

The model aims at the optimal total cost of the distribution network, considers the user’s differentiated reliability indicators, solves the results of the location and capacity of distributed power sources and emergency power configuration. Finally, the optimal solution is selected by the particle swarm algorithm into the program. Three scenarios are set on the IEEE-33 node system for simulation testing. The results show that this method can effectively meet the consequence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We present PRISM3D, a 3-D reference seismic model of P- and S-wave velocities for Iberia and adjacent areas. PRISM3D results from the combination of the most up-to-date earth models available for the region. It extends horizontally from 15°W to 5°E in longitude, 34°N to 46°N in latitude and vertically from 3.5 km above to 200 km below sea level, and is modelled on a regular grid with 10 and 0.5 km of grid node spacing in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. It was designed using models inferred from local and teleseismic body-wave tomography, earthquake and ambient noise surface wave tomography, receiver function analysis and active source experiments. It includes two interfaces, namely the topography/bathymetry and the Mohorovičić (Moho) discontinuity. The Moho was modelled from previously published receiver function analysis and deep seismic sounding results. To that end we used a probabilistic surface reconstruction algorithm that allowed to extract the mean of the Moho depth surface along with its associated standard deviation, which provides a depth uncertainty estimate. The Moho depth model is in good agreement with previously published models, although it presents slightly sharper gardients in orogenic areas such as the Pyrenees or the Betic-Rif system. Crustal and mantle P- and S-wave wave speed grids were built separately on each side of the Moho depth surface by weighted average of existing models, thus allowing to realistically render the speed gradients across that interface. The associated weighted standard deviation was also calculated, which provides an uncertainty estimation on the average wave speed values at any point of the grid. At shallow depths (&amp;lt;10 km), low P and S wave speeds and high VP/VS are observed in offshore basins, while the Iberian Massif, which covers a large part of western Iberia, appears characterized by a rather flat Moho, higher than average VP and VS and low VP/VS. Conversely, the Betic-Rif system seems to be associated with low VP and VS, combined with high VP/VS in comparison to the rest of the study area. The most prominent feature of the mantle is the well known high wave speed anomaly related to the Alboran slab imaged in various mantle tomography studies. The consistency of PRISM3D with previous work is verified by comparing it with two recent studies, with which it shows a good general agreement.The impact of the new 3-D model is illustrated through a simple synthetic experiment, which shows that the lateral variations of the wave speed can produce traveltime differences ranging from –1.5 and 1.5 s for P waves and from –2.5 and 2.5 s for S waves at local to regional distances. Such values are far larger than phase picking uncertainties and would likely affect earthquake hypocentral parameter estimations. The new 3-D model thus provides a basis for regional studies including earthquake source studies, Earth structure investigations and geodynamic modelling of Iberia and its surroundings.</jats:p>",

Supply of electricity power plays an import role in guaranteeing the running of a country. However, with complex circumstances, it is often difficult to make accurate forecasting with limited reliable data sets. In order to take most advantages of the existing grey system model, the ensemble learning is adopted to provide a new stratagy of building forecasting models for electricity supply of China. The nonhomogeneous grey model with different types of accumulation is firstly fitted with multiple setting of acculumation degrees. Then the majority voting is used to select and combine the most accurate and stable models validated by the grid search cross validation. Two numerical validation cases are taken to validate the proposed method in comparison with other well-known models. Results of the real-world case study of forecasting the electricity supply of China indicate that the proposed model outperforms the other 15 exisiting grey models, which illustrates the proposed model can make much more accurate and stable forecasting in such real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the heating period, the supply air temperature is lower than that in industrial premises, and the cooled air is denser. Entering a warm room, it tends to move downward. This condition leads to the formation of chilled and stagnant zones. The article presents a theoretical study on the possibility of ensuring the maximum propagation range of a non-isothermal supply air jet by angular correction of the fl ow vector at the outlet of the ventilation unit. Based on the theory of free air distribution, the author analyzed and graphically visualized the fl ow trajectories of the supply air from the combined climate control unit with  heat recovery in the production room in the range of outdoor temperatures from +10 to –40°C. Given the time period of outdoor temperatures, fl at sections of a three-dimensional graph were built with a step of 10°C in the range from +10 to –30°C. The author found that the maximum service area of the installation is limited by the propagation range of the supply air jet. The area can be increased by changing the direction of the fl ow vector by an angle ranging between 0 and 34°. The value of the inclination angle of the fl ow vector of the supply air jet is determined by the obtained approximation dependency. Considering the regulation of the fl ow vector, the author used the formula of M.Z. Pechatnikov to determine the propagation range of a limited axisymmetric jet. The studies carried out made it possible to establish the relationship between the propagation range of the supply air jet of the installation and the outside temperature, the inclination angle of the fl ow vector, and the theoretical variation range of the inclination angle of the fl ow vector, ranging between 0 and 34°.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, a new mathematical model is presented for a cellular manufacturing system into tactical planning of a closed-loop supply chain to build a sustainable manufacturing enterprise. On the manufacturing side of the model, a comprehensive cellular manufacturing system is designed considering dynamic cell configuration, alternative process routings, lot splitting, sequence of operations, multiple units of identical machines, machine capacity, machine adjacency requirements, and cell size limits. On the closed-loop supply chain side of the model, different activities are considered including acquiring returned products, setting up the system for the implementation of disassembly operations, inventory holding of the returned products, remanufacturing the parts having high quality, and disposing of the returned products that cannot be economically recovered. The mathematical model in this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model reducing the total costs of the cellular manufacturing system while considering the alternative process routings and subcontracting of the part demands. A detailed economic analysis is done on the large-sized example problem of the mathematical model to investigate the impacts of adopting different production policies such as internal production, inventory holding, and subcontracting as well as different manufacturing attributes such as dynamic reconfiguration and alternative process routings. The mathematical model is also solved for different instances to investigate the effects of incorporating subcontracting, alternative process routings, and dynamic reconfigurations in the model. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted to investigate the effects of the recovery rate of returned products on the objective function value and the number of returned products to be acquired. The effect of taking alternative process routings into consideration on the objective function value is also investigated. </jats:p>",

Mathematical models were programmed by MATLAB to predict the solar energy incident on the surface all day of the year at angles from (0-90°). Experimental results manifested the performance of photovoltaic panel (PV) to provide a home with a light energy use in the shortcut electricity. The solar power system output is a function of the solar radiation. The high output of power was between (11.00 am) and (1.00 pm), which matches the high-power output time.

Thus, in order to improve existing production systems or design new ones, there is a need for sustainability assessment tools. We propose here a method based on a participatory approach to assess the sustainability of chicken supply chains. A participating group composed of various French stakeholders (poultry industry operators, research and development scientists, non-governmental organizations, etc.) was consulted to gather the various existing visions of sustainability. Each decision was validated by this group, and this resulted in the creation of a consensual assessment grid, based on economic, social, and environmental pillars, summarized in 9 goals, 28 criteria, and 45 indicators. Each item was weighted by the participating group according to their relative importance. The grid was then tested on two different French supply chains, producing either free-range or conventional standard chickens. The strengths, weaknesses, and improvement margins of each supply chain were identified. For conventional standard production, an improvement scenario was proposed, based on changes in chicken feed and the renovation of chicken houses. This new supply chain improved many criteria in the three pillars; such as economic competitiveness, European protein autonomy, social acceptance, and lower greenhouse gas emission. In conclusion, this method provides a robust and powerful tool to help stakeholders to start their own autonomous improvement process, and thus progress towards a more sustainable chicken production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With more and more end-of-life products in daily life, many companies are engaging in remanufacturing, including backward production capacity (BPC) enterprises. Meanwhile, take-back regulation always asks the manufacturer to take back end-of-life products to reduce pollution. However, the effect of take-back regulation on remanufacturers remains unclear. In this paper, we first analyzed the take-back regulation threshold with the elimination effect. We then discussed the impact on stakeholders, such as the manufacturer, the remanufacturer, consumers, and the government. A two-stage dynamic market model is proposed, which considers the market with/without BPC remanufacturer. Take-back regulation’s elimination effect is studied, and the results show that when the collection target reaches the elimination threshold, the manufacturer’s profit declines, the BPC remanufacturer is eliminated, consumer surplus decreases, and social welfare is improved. Besides, to cope with a high take-back regulation target, the manufacturer will reduce new product output, which leads to BPC remanufacturer’s benefits decline. A numerical study is given with a different collecting strategy of the BPC remanufacturer, the incentive interval, the inhibition interval, and the elimination interval of the take-back regulation for stakeholders which are described. At last, some managerial insights are given to help the regulator implement take-back regulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since in the current conditions the dominant trends in agriculture are automation and robotization, in the near future, human-controlled equipment will be almost completely automated and most of the competencies required in production will lose their relevance, since the use of digital technologies can replace not only routine manual labor, but also a significant number of mental labour of workers. During this period, the formation of unique competencies inherent only to a person acquires special relevance. Therefore, in our opinion, the need for the formation of knowledge and skills of a higher level comes to the fore. The use of digitalized systems and algorithms in agricultural production leads to a significant increase in labor productivity and, as a result, to a significant release of labor resources. At the same time, the demand for workers with a certain set of knowledge and skills is increasing. The article discusses the main changes taking place in the agricultural labour market in the context of digitalization.  Key points:  – the use of digital algorithms significantly affects the growth of labour productivity;  – the growing demand for workers with digital competencies leads to a lagging supply in the agricultural labour market;  – the influence of non-price factors of supply and demand leads to an imbalance in the agricultural labour market The object of the study is the agricultural labour market in the conditions of digitalization.  The subject of the study is the supply and demand imbalance in the labour market.  The purpose of the study is to identify and systematize the factors that have a non-price impact on the state of the agricultural labour market.  Research methodology reveals the principle of objectivity and comprehensiveness; taking into account the continuous development of elements Research methods are presented by statistical, analytical, abstract-logical, graphical and other used methods</jats:p>"

The impact of the pandemic is far-reaching and access to health commodities is not spared. Proper drug supply is critical for a robust healthcare system. It determines the extent at which the population are likely to have access to essential medicines and treatments. In Rwanda, the pharmaceutical sector heavily relies on imports. With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, the drug supply system was interrupted leaving many stores from small local pharmacies to the big medical stores running out of stock. The reasons were limited importation of goods from abroad, and the panic buying practice among the customers and some institutions when responding to the pandemic. Drug and medicines accessibility, availability and affordability should be the core of any drug management policy. It is with no doubt that, Rwanda has made a tremendous work to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the country’s drug supply; however, efforts are still needed to invest in local pharmaceutical production as a way to minimize import expenses in the country. Good policy on drug importation, production and distribution should be enforced to avoid any drug shortage that may be encountered in the Rwandan drug market.</jats:p>",

Here, we comprehensively study variations in total phosphorus (TP) concentration and TP loads in the upper reach of the Yangtze River during 2004–2017 (after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam). Non-point source TP loads flowing into the mainstream are also analyzed based on the base flow segmentation method. TP concentration in the mainstream showed a fluctuating trend of decreasing–increasing–decreasing from 2004 to 2017. TP loads from tributaries had a greater impact on TP concentration in the mainstream than the retention effect. Non-point source was an important source of TP loads. Average TP loads from non-point source pollution were 24.9 × 106 kg per year, contributing about 50.8% of the TP loads from 2004 to 2017. Non-point source TP loads were mainly from Jinsha River and Jialing River, accounting for 59.1% of total non-point TP loads, and they mainly occurred in the wet season. The long-term variation trend of TP loads from tributaries was affected by economic development, intensity of pollution control and significant discharge change. In terms of pollution control, we suggest comprehensive treatment of point and non-point source pollution.</jats:p>",

The initial policy of the Soviet government to maximize the self-sufficiency of partisan detachments at the expense of trophies and food captured from the enemy was ineffective. With the creation of the Belarusian headquarters of the partisan movement, as well as with the organization of partisan airfields and sites, the supply of food (primarily salt and tobacco) became regular. The main source of food for the “forest soldiers” were products obtained during procurement and economic operations from the civilian population. Because of the “food issue.” the attitude of the local population to the partisans was not always positive. There were cases of abuses by the partisan leadership during procurement operations, as well as cases of looting. The leading partisan and party bodies actively fought against offenses among the partisans, but it was not possible to completely eradicate this phenomenon. At the same time, in some cases partisans themselves distributed food and livestock to the civilian population. In some detachments and brigades, small enterprises were organized that produced food products (creameries, small slaughterhouses, bakeries, etc.). In general, during the occupation, the partisans managed to solve the issue of food supply to one degree or another, which had a positive impact on the dynamics of growth in the number of “forest soldiers” and on the combat and moral qualities of the personnel.</jats:p>"

The simplest of the renewable energy sources is photovoltaic solar energy converter. However, solar photovoltaic generation depends significantly on many factors - geographical location, time of day, state of the atmosphere, time of year and the like. In addition, photovoltaic generation depends on the weather conditions and cloudiness, which makes it unstable and prone to change drastically (by an order of magnitude) during daylight hours. Therefore, an important element of the power system based on renewable energy sources is the system of accumulation of generated energy. The method of power stabilization using supercapacitors for systems with a significant change in power generation in the electrical power system is analyzed. The paper offers design principles of the power supply systems for powerful LEDs with supercapacitor energy storage devices intended to make the use of energy from sources with variable generation more efficient. The systems with supercapacitor-based drives, which allow to ensure stable operation of the lighting system when the power supply from an alternative source is absent or reduced, provide high safety and reliability, and have a significantly longer service life than battery-based energy storage systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main trend in energy development is to increase energy efficiency by reducing the use of limited natural resources, the spread of renewable energy, and reducing the negative impact on the environment. An effective response to these challenges is the use of biogas plants that produce clean energy and solve the environmental problems of waste disposal and recycling. The purpose of the article is to assess the economic efficiency of replacing district gas supply with autonomous biogas plants in public utilities. A hypothesis has been put forward that the feasibility of using such technologies depends on climatic features and the specific provisions of state regulation of prices and gas consumption rates. A cost approach was applied that assesses the overall structure of equipment costs, as well as a comparative assessment method according to the principle “with / without a biogas plant”, and a scenario analysis, the criterion of which is the size of the family owning the plant. An auxiliary method for forecasting retail and economically justified prices for natural gas for the population was used. The object of calculations is the “HomeBiogas” installation intended for home use. Three Russian cities were chosen as territorial subjects: Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk and Krasnodar. The cities which differ significantly in their natural characteristics and approaches to the formation of retail gas prices. It has been proved that although the average monthly temperatures differ significantly in the cities considered, none of them has a constant temperature exceeding the required standard value of 17°C. In each case, the initial capital investment is driven up by the cost of installing additional insulation and heating systems. This equalizes the costs of warmer and colder areas. Therefore, the climatic features of cities are not significant and do not affect the economic efficiency of using a biogas plant. In turn, state regulation of prices and norms of gas consumption by the population is of decisive importance. The findings are of theoretical and practical importance. The methodology can be applied to assess the efficiency of using biogas plants in industry and gasification projects in the remote areas of Russia.</jats:p>"

The farmers have been forced to produce more with the same resources. This pressure means that optimizing productivity is one of the main objectives of the producers but also in a sustainable way. Not only does agriculture face a decline in production, but it has also had to face limitations in data collection, storing, securing, and sharing, climate change, increases in input prices, traditional food supply chain systems where there is no direct connection between the farmer and the buyer, and limitations on energy use. Existing IoT‐based agriculture systems have a centralized format and operate in isolation, leaving room for unresolved issues and major concerns, including data security, manipulation, and single failure points. This paper proposes a futuristic IoT with a blockchain model to meet these challenges. Further, this paper also proposes and novel energy‐efficient clustering IoT‐based agriculture protocol for lower energy consumption and network stability and compares its results with its counterpart low‐energy adoptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol network stability is 23% higher as compared to LEACH as first node of LEACH dies at 168 rounds while IoT‐based agriculture first node dies after 463 rounds. Similarly, IoT‐based agriculture protocol energy consumption is 68% lower than that of LEACH. The proposed protocol also extends the network life to more rounds and demonstrates an increase of 112%.</jats:p>",

Among them, the risk of supply and demand interruption will lead to the disconnection between upstream and downstream enterprises and consumers in the crossborder supply chain, making it difficult for them to achieve the profit target of the supply chain and meet the market demand. In order to reduce the risk of supply and demand disruption in mobile communication procurement platform and improve the ability to prevent and deal with disruption emergencies, a two‐level supply chain composed of crossborder suppliers, overseas suppliers, and overseas retailers is established, and the procurement decision optimization of crossborder supply chain under the condition of single channel procurement and dual channel procurement before and after investment is studied. The research show that when overseas retailers invest in crossborder suppliers and choose a dual‐source ordering strategy, it is more conducive to overseas retailers to reduce the risk of crossborder supply chain interruption and obtain higher expected profits.</jats:p>",

Then, an “altruistic preference joint fixed-cost” contract is proposed to maximize system efficiency. Finally, numerical analysis is used to validate the findings of the paper. The article not only analyzes and compares the optimal decisions under different ESC models, but also explores the intrinsic factors affecting the decisions. This paper finds that the conclusions of dual-channel supply chains or traditional supply chains do not necessarily apply to ESC, and that the effect of altruistic behavior under ESC is influenced by consumer preferences. Moreover, there is a multiparty win–win state for ESC, and this state can be achieved through the “altruistic preference joint fixed-cost” contract. Therefore, the findings of this paper contribute to the development of an e-commerce market and the cooperation of ESC members.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the expected impact on electricity market, security of supply, and system stability must consider the European context because of the strong coupling—both from an economic and a system operation point of view—through the cross-border power exchange of Germany with its neighbors. This analysis, complemented by options to improve the existing development plans, is the purpose of this paper. We propose a multilevel energy system modeling, including electricity market, network congestion management, and system stability, to identify challenges for the years 2023 and 2035. Out of the results, we would like to highlight the positive role of innovative combined heat and power (CHP) solutions securing power and heat supply, the importance of a network congestion management utilizing flexibility from sector coupling, and the essential network extension plans. Network congestion and reduced security margins will become the new normal.

Meanwhile, consumers have strategic delayed purchasing behavior when purchasing the PSS and high requirements for service quality. This paper investigates the two‐period pricing and service quality decisions of product‐service supply chain (PSSC) considering consumers’ strategic behavior under decentralized and centralized scenarios. The equilibrium results are compared in two scenarios. In order to eliminate performance loss under the decentralized scenario, we design two‐period dynamic contracts to coordinate the PSSC. Furthermore, numerical simulation is provided to verify the feasibility of the contracts. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the higher the service input‐efficiency, the more beneficial for alleviating consumers’ strategic purchase behavior under two scenarios, but this mitigation effect is more obvious under the centralized scenario. (2) Compared with the centralized scenario, the service quality is lower, the two‐period PSS sales prices are higher, and the two‐period profit is lower under the decentralized scenario. The proportion of service valuation (accounts for the valuation of PSS) will promote the widening of the service quality gap under two scenarios, but in some cases, the service input‐efficiency will weaken the promotion effect of the proportion of service valuation. (3) The design of the two‐period combined contracts depends on the proportion of service valuation. When the proportion of service valuation is high, the “two‐period revenue sharing + service‐cost sharing” combined dynamic contract can achieve PSSC perfect coordination. However, when the proportion of service valuation is low, it is necessary to design complexity combined dynamic contract which can achieve PSSC perfect coordination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The existing sources of the operating fluid used in aviation and rocket-space technology are analyzed. The disadvantages of inert gas cylinders used as a source of the operating fluid of the component supply system in jet engines are considered. An alternative to the gas pressure system is a low temperature solid propellant gas generator (LTGG) with a coolant. Controllable powdery components supply scheme of an air-breathing engine (ramjet) is proposed. The principle of operation of such a feeding scheme is described. To ensure the stability of the output characteristics of the LTGG, a valve system is used. The requirements for the gas source and combustion products (CP) involved in the operating process have been determined. The analysis of the existing methods of cooling the CP is carried out. It was revealed that the low-temperature solid-propellant gas generator with a powdery capacitance coolant meets the most fully the above requirements, the principle of operation, which is based on the heat transfer wave localization effect. Solid propellant with the following composition: 38 % AP + 38 % Octogen + 24 % SKI-NL is selected. The CP temperature, at a pressure in the combustion chamber of 6 MPa, is 1545 K, and the CP gas constant is 459.4 J / kg·K, the condensed phase is absent, and the water vapor content in the operating fluid does not exceed 1.6 %. The combustion of the proposed propellant produces a significant amount of combustible components – 60 % CO, 4 % H2, &gt; 1 % CH4. The use of valves on cold gas ensures the reliability of the controlled supply system of powder components, and, accordingly, the entire engine. Based on the results of the work, conclusions were made about the correspondence of the obtained parameters of solid propellant and LTGG to all the requirements set.</jats:p>"

The classical economic production quantity model has been employed, relying on the two-stage assembly production system. The three parameters that contribute to the total profit formulation that have been considered consist of the social charity amount for per unit selling, the unit wholesale price of the manufacturer, and the return rate of used goods from the customer. The study has stressed that there is a significant impact from implementing CSR initiatives on the enterprise’s inventory policy that leads to enhance the firm’s financial performance.</jats:p>"

The key component in the HRV is the Paper Heat Exchanger, which allows the heat exchange of indoor and outdoor air through a crossflow, while also filtering out stale air and dust particles. This article investigates the effect of manipulating the supply and exhaust air velocity on the enthalpy and temperature exchange efficiency of a paper heat exchanger. Data is obtained from experimental results, where the experiments are conducted in a test lab using heat recovery ventilators (HRV) installed with paper heat exchangers. Two paper heat exchangers from different suppliers were tested inside a HRV installed in an air conditioned room. The HRV fan speed was varied at a fixed interval of 0.5 m/s, and the air velocity was measured by using a wind speed meter. At the same time, a USB data logger was used to collect relative humidity and temperature of the air at the supply inlet, indoor air inlet, and return air outlet to determine temperature exchange efficiency and the enthalpy of air. The results of the testing shows that the HRV was able to achieve a temperature exchange efficiency of 47 to 63% and enthalpy exchange efficiency of 63 to 94% for PHEX-A, and a temperature exchange efficiency of 28 to 48% and enthalpy exchange efficiency of 57 to 85% for PHEX-B. The data shows that PHEX-A has higher efficiency than PHEX-B.</jats:p>"

Degradation of phenol from the environment by mesophilic bacteria has been studied extensively over the past decades, but only little is known about phenol biodegradation at high temperatures or low pH. In this work we studied phenol degradation in the thermoacidophilic archaeon<jats:italic>Saccharolobus solfataricus</jats:italic>P2 (basonym:<jats:italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</jats:italic>) under extreme conditions (80°C, pH 3.5). We combined metabolomics and transcriptomics together with metabolic modeling to elucidate the organism’s response to growth with phenol as sole carbon source. Although<jats:italic>S. solfataricus</jats:italic>is able to utilize phenol for biomass production, the carbon source induces profound stress reactions, including genome rearrangement as well as a strong intracellular accumulation of polyamines. Furthermore, computational modeling revealed a 40% higher oxygen demand for substrate oxidation, compared to growth on glucose. However, only 16.5% of oxygen is used for oxidation of phenol to catechol, resulting in a less efficient integration of carbon into the biomass. Finally, our data underlines the importance of the phenol<jats:italic>meta</jats:italic>-degradation pathway in<jats:italic>S. solfataricus</jats:italic>and enables us to predict enzyme candidates involved in the degradation processes downstream of 2-hydroxymucconic acid.</jats:p>"

The magnetite phase and the unique epsilon phase of iron oxide can be especially pointed out. The main difficulty in the synthesis of the epsilon phase is connected with the fact that it can exist only in a nanoscale state and is extremely difficult to obtain. We used the method of direct plasma dynamic synthesis, which allows obtaining multiphase powders of iron oxides containing both the epsilon phase and magnetite. It was found that by varying the initial parameters of the power system, namely the pulse duration by increasing the capacitance of the capacitive energy storage, it is possible to influence the phase composition of the obtained products and to achieve the preferential output of the epsilon phase. In addition, in the mode with the maximum pulse duration, when the best product is obtained from the point of the epsilon phase output, the system efficiency of converting the stored energy into released energy significantly increases. In general, it has been established that such a regime is most favorable for the system operation for the purpose of the iron oxides synthesis.</jats:p>",

The article considers the electrical operating conditions of the ladle furnace unit (LFU) equipped with a 40 MVA electric furnace transformer. It was expected that the LFU load would vary insignificantly, because the electric arc burns between the electrodes and the surface of already molten metal, without the occurrence of short circuits. However, the accomplished studies testify that the LFU load is abruptly variable and nonlinear in nature, and gives rise to significant voltage fluctuations and harmonic distortions in the power supply network. The flicker intensity (severity) factor has been estimated, and the level of current harmonic components generated due to LFU operation has been determined. By using the obtained results, it becomes possible to predict the influence of LFU electric operating conditions on the levels of electric power quality indicators in changing the power supply network parameters, and to adopt circuit engineering solutions for assuring the electric power quality in the plant electric power supply system.</jats:p>"

It is determined that during 2018–2020 there is a practice of applying the norms of labor legislation of Ukraine to recover from the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine the average amount of cash during the delay of full payment of a serviceman upon discharge from military service. It is noted that this state of affairs puts excessive financial pressure on the state defense budget, and therefore it is necessary to clarify the legitimacy of the application of labor legislation to servicemen in terms of payment of the average amount of cash for the delay in discharge from military service. It is substantiated that the norms of special legislation have an exclusive advantage over the norms of labor\nlegislation in resolving disputes concerning the full calculation of servicemen upon discharge from military service. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the practice of the European Court of Human Rights regarding the payment of average earnings to individual citizens of Ukraine during the delay in payment upon dismissal is ambiguous. It was found that at the regulatory level there is no procedure for calculating the average amount of cash collateral. It is noted that the application of the analogy of the procedure for calculating the average salary of employees is technically impossible given that the structure of monetary support of servicemen and its economic essence is different from the structure and nature of wages. It is proposed as a direction of further research to develop a compromise mechanism in the system of special legislation to strengthen the responsibility of officials of military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for late and incomplete payment of servicemen upon discharge from military service.</jats:p>"

The significance of FLW has been highlighted in the literature due to its impact on society, economy, and the environment. We propose a conceptual framework to systematically examine FLW issues within FSCs in the field of operations management (OM). We discuss various types and distribution modes of FSCs where FLW occurs, definitions of FLW, the impacts of FLW, and measures to reduce FLW in the OM field. We further introduce the methodologies that have been applied in existing FLW studies. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it proposes a conceptual framework to identify FLW problems within FSCs. Second, it helps to comprehensively understand FLW occurrence and thus stimulate research focusing on FLW from different perspectives. Third, it motivates researchers to discuss FLW issues by applying different methodologies.</jats:p>"

Taking into consideration the indicator of power supply in agriculture in the world’s economically developed countries, the authors consider the domestic needs in agricultural tractors and engines. As a result of the analysis, it is shown that the fl eet of agricultural tractors is at a low level of about 200 thousand units, and it requires further serious development. To ensure eff ective agricultural production, it is necessary to balance the level of farm tractor availability in Russia with that of economically advanced countries. The indicator of 4 kW/ha was taken as a promising level of tractor availability, and the required number of tractors was determined. The analysis was carried out for the cultivation of arable land in Russia with an area of 80 million hectares as of 2020 and amounted to about 2.5 million units for the entire range of agricultural tractors taking into account their traction class. To cultivate all arable areas in Russia, which amounted to about 120 million hectares in 1990, a third more equipment will be required. To maintain the tractor fl eet at this level, it is necessary to ensure an annual supply of at least 250 thousand units of various engines with a total capacity of at least 320 GW. This problem can be solved through increasing the production capacity of existing engine-building plants and designing new diesel engines for tractors of traction classes 0.6…1.4 with a capacity between 20 and 70 kW.</jats:p>"

The normal operation of subway traction power supply system is directly related to the stable operation and safety of subway. If the subway traction power supply system breaks down, it not only will cause economic losses, but also may cause social disorder. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the traction power supply system of subway to ensure the safe operation of subway. The establishment of a reasonable monitoring and testing platform, the simulation analysis of the traction power supply system, and the regular health assessment can provide a strong guarantee for the safe operation of the subway. This paper aims to design a practical test platform through MATLAB modeling, so as to establish a simulation model of subway traction power supply system, and comprehensively monitor and grasp the health status of subway traction power supply system. This paper quantitatively evaluates the health status of subway traction power supply system, applies the principle of multilayer immunity, establishes the traction power supply system of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and constructs the immune monitoring system of each layer. This method can provide the health status information of subway traction power supply system, subsystems, and components comprehensively, accurately, and intuitively and determine the subsystems and components that need to be maintained.</jats:p>",

Entering a warm room, it tends to move downward. This condition leads to the formation of chilled and stagnant zones. The article presents a theoretical study on the possibility of ensuring the maximum propagation range of a non-isothermal supply air jet by angular correction of the fl ow vector at the outlet of the ventilation unit. Based on the theory of free air distribution, the author analyzed and graphically visualized the fl ow trajectories of the supply air from the combined climate control unit with  heat recovery in the production room in the range of outdoor temperatures from +10 to –40°C. Given the time period of outdoor temperatures, fl at sections of a three-dimensional graph were built with a step of 10°C in the range from +10 to –30°C. The author found that the maximum service area of the installation is limited by the propagation range of the supply air jet. The area can be increased by changing the direction of the fl ow vector by an angle ranging between 0 and 34°. The value of the inclination angle of the fl ow vector of the supply air jet is determined by the obtained approximation dependency. Considering the regulation of the fl ow vector, the author used the formula of M.Z. Pechatnikov to determine the propagation range of a limited axisymmetric jet. The studies carried out made it possible to establish the relationship between the propagation range of the supply air jet of the installation and the outside temperature, the inclination angle of the fl ow vector, and the theoretical variation range of the inclination angle of the fl ow vector, ranging between 0 and 34°.</jats:p>"

Assembly workers are exposed to increased process complexity resulting in physical and cognitive workload. Worker guidance systems (WGS) are used to overcome this challenge through output of information regarding what should be done, how it should be done and why it should be done. An unsolved scientific challenge in this context is efficient information supply of WGS. Information such as worker’s instruction texts, pictures or 3D representations are created by employees of the work preparation department and transferred to the WGS. Manual information supply is a time-consuming and complex process, which requires a high (non-value-adding) effort as well as comprehensive knowledge in handling 3D CAD modelling and software programming. This paper presents a novel approach to reduce the required manual effort in information supply process. A knowledge-based model is proposed that enables an automated information supply of WGS in smart assembly environment by means of algorithms and self-learning expert systems, which pursues a holistic and consistent approach without media breaks. The automated approach assists employees of work preparation department, which means they can concentrate on their essential core competencies instead of being busy, for example, creating assembly plans, instruction texts or pictures for individual WGS. Finally, the technical implementation as a software-based proof-of-concept demonstrator and sub-sequent integration into the IT environment of TU Wien Pilot Factory Industry 4.0 is outlined.</jats:p>"

For the community e‐commerce platform supply chain composed of suppliers, community e‐commerce platforms, and grid station service providers, considering the degree of supplier value cocreation efforts, this paper studies the optimal decisions under centralized decision‐making, supplier‐led decentralized decision‐making, and community e‐commerce platform‐led decentralized decision‐making, respectively. The results show that the supply chain obtains the highest profit in centralized decision‐making; under decentralized decision‐making, the dominant party will get higher profits; and the supplier value cocreation sensitivity coefficient is positively correlated with sales price, value cocreation effort level, and total supply chain value. The results are helpful to improve the competitiveness of the community e‐commerce platform supply chain in the market and are of great significance to the long‐term development of the community e‐commerce industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Though it is an important means for enterprises to increase market demand and boost profits, trade credit can carry risks. Besides, risks also result from uncertain market demand. Decision-makers’ attitude towards risk will influence the decisions of enterprises, so it is meaningful to study the impact of risk preference on supply chain performance. This paper explores the effect of risk-averse preferences of the manufacturer or retailer on their delayed payment periods decision and utility when the dual-channel structure is adopted. Customer demands are uncertain and depend on the delayed payment periods that the manufacturer and the retailer may offer to them. Mean-variance model is used to describe the risks due to uncertain demand, and establishes supply chain utility models under four decision-making situations (both are risk-neutral; only the retailer is risk-averse; only the manufacturer is risk-averse; both are risk-averse). According to our study, supply chain members with higher risk aversion are more inclined to prolong delayed payment period. The retailers risk aversion is adverse for her utility, but beneficial to the manufacturers utility, thus a new coordination mechanism is proposed to achieve coordinate when only the retailer is risk averse. We prove that the contract can effectively improve the utility of the whole supply chain. This paper conduces to enrich the emerging literature on relating risk aversion preferences to trade credit period decision and coordination behavior under dual-channel environment.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the use of retail analysis techniques in SCM and how they can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain operations.  We then present a unified RAT framework that integrates data mining, predictive analytics, and machine learning for optimizing SCM. Additionally, the paper presents a case study of a company that has successfully implemented retail analysis techniques in its SCM practices.

Those fuels, on one hand, allow to drastically reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, helping to comply with the increasingly stringent emission regulations, and, on the other hand, could lead to possible advantages in performances if blended with conventional fuels. In this regard, this work focuses on the 1D numerical study of an internal combustion engine supplied with different fuels: pure gasoline, and blends of methane-hydrogen and ammonia-hydrogen. The analyses are carried out with reference to a downsized turbocharged two-cylinder engine working in an operating point representative of engine operations along WLTC, namely 1800 rpm and 9.4 bar of BMEP. To evaluate the potential of methane-hydrogen and ammonia-hydrogen blends, a parametric study is performed. The varied parameters are air/fuel proportions (from 1 up to 2) and the hydrogen fraction over the total fuel. Hydrogen volume percentages up to 60% are considered both in the case of methane-hydrogen and ammonia-hydrogen blends. Model predictive capabilities are enhanced through a refined treatment of the laminar flame speed and chemistry of the end gas to improve the description of the combustion process and knock phenomenon, respectively. After the model validation under pure gasoline supply, numerical analyses allowed to estimate the benefits and drawbacks of considered alternative fuels in terms of efficiency, carbon monoxide, and pollutant emissions.</jats:p>"

The study used an experimental-theoretical research method. As a part of the experimental study, the data of temperature measurements in one of the heating points in Tyumen were requested. Within the framework of a theoretical study, the air temperature in a living room was calculated, depending on the coolant temperature according to the schedule of the CHPP and according to the supply in the supply heat pipe. In carrying out the theoretical study, standard methods were used for carrying out thermal calculations of heat supply systems, statistical research methods, as well as standard computer programs.\nThe need to regulate heat energy is determined and the types of regulation are considered. The analysis of the adopted temperature schedule of the CHPP was carried out and a comparison was made with the calculated temperature schedule. The solution of the equation for determining the air temperature in the room is given. The air temperature in the room depends simultaneously on two factors: the temperature of the heating medium and the temperature of the outside air. As a result of the study, the presence of a discrepancy between the temperatures of the network water supplied to consumers and the created air temperature in residential premises was determined. The intersection point of the calculated temperature schedule and the CHP schedule was determined. The necessity of observing the calculated temperature schedule of the central quality regulation has been substantiated. The necessity of heat supply at a constant flow rate of the heat carrier has also been substantiated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article deals with improvement off the efficiency of external and traction power supply systems using for example indicators of traction substations for a real electric transmission line segment of a traction network of 25 kV. The analysis of the functioning of a real section of electrified railways with traction substations, two of which are connected according to the \"feeding\" scheme is providing in the article. The currents in the wind-ings of traction transformers are calculate for these substations. The proportion of the currents values of the most loaded winding to the two less loaded is 2: 1. The coefficient asymmetry of currents of transformer wind-ings operating on existing traction substations is equal to 1. The results prove a significant currents asymmetry of transformers windings and phases of electric transmission lines which leads to an increasing voltage unbal-ance. New schemes for connecting traction substations for the considered section of electrified railways have been developed in order to improve the quality indicators of electrical energy. New connection schemes for three traction substations, determined according to the requirements for connecting to the external and trac-tion power supply system are presents in the article. The calculation for new schemes of connecting traction substations, similar to the previously considered option, has been performed. The values of winding currents, power transmission line phases and coefficient asymmetry were obtained for new substation connection schemes. The proposed schemes for connecting traction substations provide a decrease in the coefficient asym-metry of the winding currents from 1 to 0.5 and a decrease in the current modulus in the most loaded windings by 1.5 times. New schemes for connecting traction substations reduce the currents of the most loaded windings and phases of the power transmission line, as well as the asymmetry of currents, which ensures an improvement in the efficiency of the external and traction power supply systems of the real traction network.</jats:p>"

Many of these catchments face the threat of postwildfire erosion, which can contaminate reservoir water. The aim of this paper is to determine the probability and duration of disruptions to treatability due to runoff‐generated debris flows in the first year after a wildfire, before substantial vegetation recovery takes place. We combine models of reservoir hydrodynamics, postfire erosion, and stochastic rainfall to determine probability and magnitude of sediment concentration at the reservoir water offtake. Central to the paper is our technique for linking model components into a risk framework that gives probabilities to the number of days that the turbidity threshold for treatment is exceeded. The model is applied to the Upper Yarra reservoir, which is the linchpin of the water supply system for Melbourne in SE Australia. However, the framework is applicable to other unfiltered water supply systems where suspended sediment is a risk to treatability. Results show that postwildfire erosion poses a substantial threat, with a relatively high probability (annual exceedance probability = 0.1–0.3) of water being untreatable for &gt;1 year following a high‐severity wildfire. Important factors that influence the risk include postwildfire runoff potential, reservoir temperature, and the amount of clay‐sized grains in eroding headwaters. Assumptions about spatial‐temporal rainfall attributes, reservoir hydrodynamics, and the catchment erosion potential are all important sources of error in our estimate of risk. Our approach to risk quantification will help support planning, risk management, and strategic investment to mitigate impacts.</jats:p>",

Using data from a factorial survey conducted in the City of Bern, Switzerland, we examine whether childcare subsidies reach their goal. Because of the simultaneity of the decision to take up a job and arranging childcare, we experimentally alter hypothetical income (e.g., gross earnings from a job, income from other sources) as well as aspects of the childcare setting including subsidy levels. Using an alternative-specific conditional logit model, we show that subsidies have the expected effect of increasing parents’ labor supply. Moreover, the results from simulations based on the estimated utility function show that varying subsidy levels have different effects on subgroups of parents. Subsidies are especially efficient in raising the labor supply of low-status parents, and especially for women. We also find that subsidies already have the desired effect at 25% of total childcare costs and that the marginal utility of higher subsidy levels decreases beyond that threshold. Subsidies covering 25% of the total costs for childcare lead to an approximately 2 h per week increase in the labor supply of women.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To improve borehole siting for rural water supply, an advanced resistivity method was adapted for developing country use and demonstrated in Malawi. The method was designed to be low cost, developing-country accessible, efficient. It allows single or multiple operators to acquire the multiple vertical electrical soundings (VESs) required that are inverted together in 2-D, to give a true cross-section of subsurface resistivity. Application at four sites generated true cross-sections of subsurface resistivity to around 100 m depth relevant to groundwater-resource investigation. A wide range of (hydro)geological features was identified, including fractured/weathered basement, gneiss domes, well-developed fault zones and several types of deltaic deposits. Imaging performance appears comparable to that of 2-D surface ERT (electrical resistivity tomography) that uses more expensive equipment, often unaffordable in developing countries. Based on the subsurface configurations determined and hydrogeological conceptualisation subsequently undertaken, the local aquifer potential could be evaluated, thereby providing a decision-making basis for future borehole siting at the sites surveyed. The technology is far superior to conventional 1-D VES, electromagnetic profiling or magnetic profiling currently used for borehole siting in Malawi. Technology adoption currently under consideration nationally would make use of existing VES capacity and permit much improved targeting of aquifer resource, more sustainable siting of boreholes and greater future resilience of Malawi’s rural water-supply infrastructure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Heat Recovery Ventilator (VHR) is widely used nowadays as it is capable to maintain high Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) while minimizing the energy loss of indoor air through air-to-air heat exchanger principle. The main component that enables VHR to perform air-to-air heat exchange is known as Paper Heat Exchanger (PP-HEX). Hence, the objective of this research is to study and analyse the performance of a PP-HEX under different return and outdoor air temperatures as well as their effect on both enthalpy and temperature exchange efficiency. Moreover, some numerical models of VHR have been developed to optimize some complex cases and the numerical models are meant to reduce the physical experiments to analyze or improve complex cases in the future. To the best of the authors knowledge, there is no experimental data available from any sources to validate the numerical models. To address this issue, two different supplies of PP-HEX are tested with an actual VHR, and both PP-HEXs will be referred to as PP-HEX-A and PP-HEX-B due to confidentiality. Furthermore, the testing is conducted in a temperature-controlled testing laboratory and the testing conditions are set according to the ISO standard. The preliminary testing results show that the temperature exchange efficiency and enthalpy exchange efficiency of the PP-HEXs have the same trends while the outdoor air temperature is fixed and varying the temperature of indoor air. In contrary, the temperature exchange efficiency and enthalpy exchange efficiency of the PP-HEXs have the same trends while the indoor air temperature is fixed and varying the temperature of outdoor air as well. With the default voltage supplies (240V) to VHR and the setup conditions (according to the ISO Standard) of return air to be 27°C and outdoor air to be 35°C, the testing results show that PP-HEX-A has a temperature exchange efficiency and enthalpy exchange efficiency with a range of (37.97 – 40.28) % and (30.77 – 57.81) % respectively. While PP-HEX-B has a temperature exchange efficiency and enthalpy exchange efficiency with a range of (35.29 – 42.5) % and (39.6 – 55.93) % respectively.</jats:p>"

With growing demand for contraceptives in some areas, low contraceptive method availability and stockouts are thought to be major drivers of unmet need among women of reproductive age, though evidence for this is limited. In this research, we examined trends in stockouts, method availability and consumption of specific contraceptive methods in urban areas of four sub-Saharan African countries (Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Nigeria) and India. We used representative survey data from the Performance Monitoring for Action Agile Project that were collected in quarterly intervals at service delivery points (SDP) stratified by sector (public vs private), with all countries having five to six quarters of surveys between 2017 and 2019. Among SDPs that offer family planning, we calculated the percentage offering at least one type of modern contraceptive method (MCM) for each country and quarter, and by sector. We examined trends in the percentage of SDPs with stockouts and which currently offer condoms, emergency contraception, oral pills, injectables, intrauterine devices and implants. We also examined trends of client visits for specific methods and the resulting estimated protection from pregnancy by quarter and country. Across all countries, the vast majority of SDPs had at least one type of MCM in-stock during the study period. We find that the frequency of stockouts varies by method and sector and is much more dynamic than previously thought. While the availability and distribution of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) were limited compared to other methods across countries, LARCs nonetheless consistently accounted for a larger portion of couple years of protection. We discuss findings that show the importance of engaging the private sector towards achieving global and national family planning goals.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, group and district water supply and sewerage systems are designed, built, and developed, hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long. The construction and operation of such facilities require significant financial investments every year. Therefore, the issues of the choice of routes, the structure of facilities, and particularly the methods of transporting water and wastewater, justifying the locations of water intakes and treat treatment facilities are relevant and require special attention and development of a comprehensive methodology for optimizing the structure and parameters of water supply and sewerage systems. The paper proposes, on the basis of a previously constructed redundant graph, the method of contour minimization of the structure of facilities and ways of supplying water to end users, transporting wastewater to treatment plants by pipelines and trucks. The redundant graph includes all kinds of connections (edges, arcs) that simulate pipelines and trucks, between vertices that simulate existing and new sources of water and wastewater discharges, sewage treatment plants, pumping stations, control tanks, and end users. The method selects the best (from the point of view of minimal life cycle costs) edges, arcs, and vertices of the graph and determines the corresponding parameters of pipeline and road sections of the network and facilities. This method is based on the procedure of traversing the contours and sequentially replacing the branches of the tree with moves, while the best option is remembered in the form of a spanning tree. Based on the results of the performed numerical experiments, it was shown that the use of combined (pipeline and truck) systems for transporting water in terms of life cycle costs is optimal.</jats:p>"

In order to explore the impact of consumers’ reference low-carbon effect and product low-carbon goodwill on the balanced emission reduction decisions and profit of dual-channel supply chain members, we establish a dual-channel supply chain emission reduction dynamic optimization model, use differential game theory to solve the manufacturer’s optimal emission reduction investment and the retailer’s optimal low-carbon publicity investment strategies under four different decision scenarios, and analyze them in detail. In addition, we also design an effective low-carbon publicity cost-sharing contract to achieve coordination of the supply chain. The research results show that the equilibrium strategies of the manufacturer and retailer and the overall profit of the supply chain under the centralized decision scenario are better than those of decentralized decision scenario. When the initial reference low-carbon level is low, the online and offline reference low-carbon effects are beneficial to the manufacturer and retailer. When the initial low-carbon goodwill is high, it is beneficial for both the manufacturer and retailer to increase consumer recognition of low-carbon goodwill. When the ratio of low-carbon publicity cost sharing provided by the manufacturer to the retailer is within a reasonable range, the cost-sharing contract can reduce the double marginal effect and achieve supply chain coordination.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The increasing number and duration of the consequences of emergency situations associated with the violation of the conditions of normal living of people requires the creation of autonomous temporary field camps to accommodate the affected population, which, as a rule, create and maintain rescue formations. In the complex of tasks aimed at providing life support to the affected population and rescue units in field camps, their electric power supply plays an important role. However, there are no autonomous sources of electric energy for the power supply of life support for people in the field in the organizational and staff structure of rescue units. At the same time, it is necessary to determine the number of electric energy sources for the power supply of life support for people in field camps, not only taking into account the application of the provisions for calculating the electrical loads of consumers, but also taking into account additional factors, in particular, taking into account the output of electric energy sources for operational reasons, the failure of service personnel, the organization of technical support of the power supply system, its planning, repair. The purpose of the study. Electric power supply of field points of temporary accommodation of the affected population and rescue units, ensuring the reliability of their electric power supply, minimizing the influence of the uncertainty factor when planning their power consumption. Research methods. The main provisions of the calculation of electrical loads, system theory, set theory, probability theory and the apparatus of mathematical statistics. The results of the study. Recommendations have been developed on the composition of electric energy sources for the power supply of life support to the affected population and rescue units when placed in field camps, taking into account additional factors affecting their composition, in particular, the output of electric energy sources for operational reasons, the failure of maintenance personnel, the organization of technical support of the power supply system and other issues. Conclusion. The scientific and methodological approach is justified, which allows taking into account additional factors affecting the formation of the composition of electric energy sources for the power supply of life support of people in temporary accommodation points, which, in combination with scientific and methodological approaches to substantiate the electrical loads of consumers, allows us to develop a comprehensive scientific and methodological approach to substantiate the composition of electric energy sources for the power supply of life support of people. The resulting composition of electric energy sources can be refined and serves as an example of assessing the stability of the power supply system, the criterion of stability of which is its ability to provide consumers with electric energy.

In Ukraine, the need for state regulation of activities (including investment) in the field of heat and power engineering is established by the Law of Ukraine “On Heat Supply”. Such regulation is carried out by adopting regulations that are mandatory for use by all economic entities in the field of heat supply, and by providing control functions to the national regulator and local governments. The article analyzes Procedures for development, approval, coordination and approval of investment programs of municipal heat companies which are now in force in Ukraine. The analysis of current regulations has made it possible to identify the main problems of the state regulation of investment activity: imperfection of planning; complexity of development, justification, approval and control of investment programs; and a complicated mechanism for financing investment activities. According to the results of the research, the following ways to improve the state regulation of investment activity of the enterprises working in the municipal heat power engineering are offered: transition from short-term to medium- and long-term planning of investment activity; simplification of the current procedures for approval and adoption of investment programs; further decentralization of investment management and granting all powers to local governments; dismissal of the obligation for each measure and investment program as a whole to be economically efficient. A local authority should be entitled to independently choose the priorities for designing an investment program, e.g.: to improve the quality or reliability of heat supply, or to reduce tariffs; to simplify procedures of monitoring the implementation of investment programs, to give a heat supply company more independence in spending funds received under the investment program.</jats:p>"

The random nature of the impact, as well as the importance of the power supply system, determine the need to create a model that allows adequately describing the process of functioning of both the node itself and its elements. The purpose of the work is to develop a model of the functioning of the communication node under the influence of internal destabilizing factors – failures of elements of the power supply system. Methods used: the use of the apparatus of topological transformation of stochastic networks with the probabilistic method of network planning (GERT) in the field of studying the functioning of the control system, taking into account the impact of failures of elements of the power supply system, allows us to adequately describe the functioning of both the elements (taking into account the specifics of the method of organizing power supply) and the communication node itself under the influence of destabilizing factors, expressed in its functions of the distribution of recovery time and preservation of working condition. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that the peculiarities of the organization of the power supply of each element of the node are taken into account; destabilizing factors are failures of elements of the power supply system, as a result of which it is possible to disrupt or terminate the functioning of the node, which allows determining the probabilistic and temporal characteristics of the functioning of its elements under the influence of destabilizing factors; features and probabilistic-temporal characteristics of the process of restoring the functional state of the node elements, which includes a number of measures for the transition to autonomous sources, a cold reserve power plant, power sources for other consumers. Result: the presented model makes it possible to assess the reliability of the functioning of the communication node and its elements in the conditions of failures of the elements of the power supply system based on the available initial data. Practical significance: the presented model is universal and can be applied to any field communication node.</jats:p>"

Our research aims to assess the use of rainwater and the impact of operation and maintenance activities of the rainwater system on drinking water quality in rural areas where there is no access to a public drinking water system. Through the questionnaire, direct visits, interviews and sampling of water at surveyed households (HHs), it was found that 100 and 98% of surveyed HHs used rainwater for drinking and cooking, respectively. Nearly, 80% of them were aware of the necessity of frequent reservoir cleaning as well as first-flush removal. Cleaning the water reservoir had a significant impact on water quality, in particular the total dissolved solids (p-value &amp;lt; 0.05). The use of strainers and more frequency of cleaning the catchment roofs and gutters would make the lower turbidity in water. However, the use of strainers would reduce the dissolution of oxygen in the reservoirs. A recommendation on the frequency of maintaining the rainwater harvesting systems was proposed after assessment of the operation and maintenance behaviors at surveyed HHs.</jats:p>",

This paper explores how retailers can leverage Big Data analytics techniques on supply chain data to gain enhanced visibility into their operations. We examine three use cases of data-driven supply chain visibility: (1) predictive replenishment to anticipate future demand and optimize inventory levels; (2) personalized assortment optimization to tailor product selections for local customer segments; and (3) optimized order fulfillment to improve delivery times and reduce transportation costs. We analyze how retailers can apply machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis on point-of-sale data, inventory data, customer data and external data sources to uncover hidden patterns and drive data-driven decisions in these areas. The results include reduced excess inventory, fewer stock-outs, higher in-store product availability, lower fulfillment costs and improved customer experience. Data-driven supply chain visibility allows retailers to transition from a reactive, speculative business model to a predictive, personalized model that enhances competitiveness.</jats:p>"

However, NBS that are exclusively reliant on natural processes are not fit-for-purpose for the provision of safe drinking water – some range of built technology is required. There is a wide spectrum of techno-ecological NBS – ‘green technologies’ – that are fit-for-purpose in the treatment and distribution of safe drinking water. A framework was developed to enable an accurate and transparent description of the ‘green’ attributes of technology – including green infrastructure – in the water industry. The framework differentiates technology ‘greenness’ by relatively examining key attributes that may cause environmental impacts across the technology's life cycle through the lens of the environmental setting in which it is applied. In the water industry, green technology can be described by four main attributes: natural-resource basis, energy consumption, waste production, and footprint. These attributes are closely linked and must be considered relative to the biophysical and human environments in which they are applied and the other technologies to which they are being compared. The use of the framework can facilitate techno-ecological decision-making that strives to address diverse stakeholder priorities – including the influence of sociocultural factors on the green technology preferences of individuals, groups, or communities.</jats:p>",

In particular, the RTFS is targeted at customers actively involved in product purchasing, personalising, co-designing, and manufacturing planning. The fashion industry is oriented towards 3D services as a service model, owing to the automation and democratisation of product customisation and personalisation processes. Furthermore, AI offers referral services to prosumers or/and customers and companies, and proposes individual designs with perfect styles and measurements using new 3D computer aided design and AI-based product design technologies for fashion and design companies and customers. Consequently, 3D fashion products in the RTFS supply chain are entirely digital, saving time and money with sampling and tracking capabilities, secured, and trusted with personalised service delivery.</jats:p>"

As such, the purpose of this work is to analyze the influence that exists between these two variables, both at a business or micro level and at a country/region or macro level, and the most influential factors, such as country of origin and sector of activity, among others. To this end, 60 publications have been reviewed from 1996 to 2019 from a global perspective, to analyze the characteristics that define them and both the existing relationship and impact generated by the two variables being studied within international supply chains. The results show that, in general, there is a positive bidirectional relationship, influenced by several factors, such as social performance, environmental regulation, cooperation strategies, employment level, or business size. Additionally, there is a growing interest in this issue within the agrifood sector, as the benefits of an appropriate environmental policy based on innovation to promote exports are of great importance. Finally, a series of recommendations are made for future research that is able to serve scholars, companies and also policy makers.</jats:p>"

As an example, the project of the X-57 Maxwell electric aircraft developed by NASA, which is equipped with 14 propulsion electric motors, is given. In view of insufficient energy efficiency of existing storage batteries, a combined storage battery-and-generator power supply system for electric aircraft is considered. In the considered system, the aircraft propulsion is provided by electric motors, which are powered by storage batteries in combination with permanent magnet generators. The generator shaft is rotated by an auxiliary internal combustion engine, which operates in an economical mode. The power circuit of an active rectifier producing the +270 V DC bipolar output voltage is proposed, with which the permanent magnet generator operates with a sinusoidal phase current waveform and a close-to-unity power factor. The active rectifier control system uses an enhanced phase-locked loop, which eliminates the need to use generator rotor position sensors. For determining the stability domains and revealing undesirable hidden attractors in the considered storage battery-and-generator power supply system, it is proposed to use special analytical-numerical computation procedures based on modifications of Lyapunov's functions methods. The article will be of interest for developers of both aircraft and ground-based self-contained electric power supply systems with a bipolar 270 V DC voltage that must meet stringent requirements for improvement of their mass-and-dimensions and power performance characteristics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article analyzes the basic principles of forming a technical and economic forecast model of energy supply in the region using renewable energy sources. It is noted that the urgency of creating autonomous energy sources based on renewable energy sources is due to the need to optimize the costs of energy supply of facilities located outside the central energy supply systems, the requirements of legislation in terms of energy saving and improving the efficiency of using natural resources and possible tax restrictions on CO2 emissions, as well as the requirements for import substitution of products of foreign manufacturers with modern power plants of Ukrainian production. It is indicated that taking into account the fact that the production of electricity by this type of installation cannot do without additional backup sources, for power systems based on renewable energy, the concept is suitable – an energy complex that includes power plants located in close proximity to each other, designed to generate one or more types of energy, equipped with automated operation systems, which allows you to keep records and control over the rational use of energy resources. It is stated that energy complexes based on renewable energy resources can perform a number of important tasks in the organization of the production process. For the economic assessment of the feasibility of using renewable energy sources and determining the potential for implementing such technologies at industrial facilities, a forecast model of economic efficiency was developed, taking into account possible technological and institutional changes. When creating a forecast model of economic efficiency that takes into account possible technological and institutional changes, first, factors, criteria and their parameters were identified and described with the distribution of the significance (weight) of each of the values, relationship and dependence. It is determined that the first stage of the proposed model concerns finding out the possibility of applying energy supply technologies based on renewable energy sources in certain geographical conditions; at the second stage (regional), after selecting a promising area, mesoscale numerical modeling of wind flow at an arbitrary height above ground level is carried out; at the third stage, the economic efficiency of the project is reassessed, taking into account changes in forecast factors, and the results are compared, as a result of which the final option is selected and a decision is made on the feasibility of using renewable energy supply systems. It is stated that the model for choosing the optimal energy supply system for current and prospective projects using renewable energy sources should take into account possible technological and institutional changes.</jats:p>"

Nigeria is particularly vulnerable with respect to pharmaceuticals since there is reduced local production and about 70% of the drug supply is imported creating a huge supply–demand disparity particularly in times like COVID-19. Nigeria is in need of huge quantities of quality-assured health commodities to effectively respond to the pandemic. Significant shortages of other essential medicines and medical products across the country could be imminent. Drug scarcity in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic period is because of several accumulated factors, majorly as a result of global lockdown, decreased manufacturing, unaddressed regulatory affairs, poor access to resources by the population, lack of buffer stocks, security instability, and poor funding of the healthcare system. This situation if left unattended, could cause serious drawbacks to the health of the populace as well as the quality of life of Nigerians amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. Appropriate measures should be directed to ensure ethical processes on drug production, importation, pricing, and distribution to avoid such events during unavoidable scenarios, like the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health emergencies.</jats:p>",

In this study, a sampling program was undertaken to investigate the fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the characteristics of DBP precursors in a pilot constructed wetland imitating the Yanlong Lake ecological project. Using XAD resin adsorption and ultrafiltration techniques, the dissolved organic carbon, UV254, and DBP formation potential (DBPFP) were measured in different DOM fractions in raw water and wetland effluents. After the constructed wetland treatment, the low molecular weight fraction (&amp;lt;3 kDa) of DOM and DBPFP generally showed a decreasing trend along the water path, while the high molecular weight fraction (&amp;gt;3 kDa) of DOM increased. The specific DBPFP (SDBPFP) was much higher in the &amp;lt;1 kDa fraction than in the other fractions. Although the hydrophobic fraction of DOM was the most abundant in all stages of the wetland treatment, the SDBPFP of the hydrophilic fraction was higher than that of the hydrophobic fraction. Furthermore, compared with raw water, the DOC, UV254 and DBPFP in the treated wetland effluents increased; however, all of the chemical DOM fractions exhibited decreased SDBPFP in accordance with a decrease in the specific ultraviolet absorbance during wetland treatment. These conclusions indicate that the DOM produced by the wetland system may generate DBPs less readily compared with the DOM of raw water.</jats:p>",

The main objective of this paper was to assess the presence of cyanobacteria in surface water sources and associated cell removal efficiency in full-scale WTPs across the world. Previously unpublished data was collected from WTPs experiencing cyanobacterial blooms in either their managed surface waters or recreational waters. In total, data were collected from 31 surface water sources and 21 WTPs in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The most commonly detected species were identified in both the surface waters, including Microcystis, Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, and Planktolyngbya, and water treatment plant intakes, including Microcystis, Cylindrospermopsis, Anabaena, Pseudanabaena, and Aphanizomenon. In the intakes, cyanotoxins and taste and odor (T&amp;O) compounds frequently co-occurred (80%) as did multiple cyanotoxins (39%). Conventional treatment saw a wide range of removal depending on the density of cells, species, and metabolites. Although more than 28% of sampling events displayed negligible or even negative removals of metabolites or cells due to accumulation within the clarifier, filtration, or water recycling, the presence of multiple treatment barriers, particularly advanced treatments like granular activated carbon and nanofiltration, allowed for the cells and their metabolites of concern to be removed to below guideline values. During treatment, total microcystins were often removed without releasing their intracellular fraction, whereas cylindrospermopsin, geosmin, and 2-MIB were commonly detected as entirely extracellular at the plant's intake. The maximum tolerable cell (MTC) counts for cyanotoxin- or T&amp;O-producing cells were calculated using guideline values, average removal efficiency, and the average cell quota derived from data. The 21 WTPs in this work were found to be able to tolerate approximately 74,000 cells/mL for microcystins, 8,000 cells/mL for cylindrospermopsin, and 1,200 cells/mL for geosmin and 2-MIB before exceeding guideline values. These levels provide guidance for water treatment plant operators to assess the potential risk associated with cells capable of producing cyanotoxins or T&amp;O compounds.</jats:p>",

These guide the small and medium‐sized enterprises within the supply chain to focus on improving work safety according to the leading position of the supply chain’s core enterprises. Therefore, the Stackelberg game model is applied to build and explain supply chain node‐enterprises’ optimal centralized and decentralized operational decisions. This research was conducted in the context of enterprise work safety constraints’ influence on the manufacturing supply chain’s equilibrium results. It also reveals the necessity in supply chain node enterprises’ contract coordination design by comparing the two decision models’ equilibrium results. Ultimately, the manufacturing supply chain’s overall profit and work safety can reach a level that includes centralized decisions through revenue‐ and cost‐sharing contracts. Furthermore, profits to the supply chain’s node enterprises also improve, and a Pareto optimality is achieved. An enlightened management demonstrates the importance of core enterprises’ leading position in the supply chain, and the supply chain node enterprises’ levels of work safety, product demand, and total profit can be promoted through revenue‐ and cost‐sharing contracts.</jats:p>",

In the context of this paper it depends on synchronous generators  operating  in  autonomous  power  supply  sys-tems.  In  contrast  to  the  power  plant  generators  which  are part of power systems and are protected from the loads by sufficiently  large  resistances,  power  supply  systems  withautonomous  generators  are  characterized  by  rather  low resistances. Abrupt changes in the supply load parameters, their  own  transient  and  emergency  modes,  for  example, short  circuits  at  the  generator  terminals,  forcing  excitation, etc. may lead to various failures in the synchronous gener-ator operation. This paper discusses the possibility of over-voltage  in  the  valve  excitation  system  of  a  synchronous generator  with  external  three-phase  short  circuits.  On  the basis of analytical expressions describing the physical pro-cesses  occurring  in  the  excitation  system  of  synchronous generators,  the  conditions  for  the  occurrence  of  overvolt-ages are identified</jats:p>"

In this work, we estimated the relaxation time of the free volume of liquid for the most unfavorable case, and the minimum supply of the covolume for the guaranteed starting and uninterrupted operation of the liquid-propellant rocket engine in zero gravity. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of controlling the relaxation time with a gradual or stepwise starting operation. The proposed formula makes it possible at the design stage to assess the minimum supply of fuel, which can be in contact with the innertank device before starting the liquid-propellant sustainer in zero gravity in order to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the propulsion system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A supply chain is a complex and dynamic supply and demand network of agents, activities, resources, technology and information involved in moving products or services from supplier to customer. The suitability of supply chains can be measured by multiple criteria, such as environmental, social, economic, and others. Finding an equilibrium between the interests of members of a sustainable supply chain is a very important problem. The main objective of the paper is to analyze the design of sustainable supply chains and to create a comprehensive model and solution methods for designing sustainable supply chains. Multiple criteria analysis and game theory is a natural choice to effectively analyze and model decision making in such multiple agent situation with multiple criteria where the outcome depends on the choice made by every agent. Multiple criteria analysis is useful for assessing sustainability of supply chains. The De Novo approach focusses on designing optimal systems. Game theory has become a useful instrument in the analysis of supply chains with multiple agents. Games are used for behavior modeling of supply chains; they focus on the allocation of resources, capacities, costs, revenues and profits. The co-opetition concept combines the advantages of both competition and cooperation into new dynamics, which can be used to not only generate more profits, but also to change the nature of the business environment for the benefit of users. Keywords: supply chain, sustainability, multiple criteria, De Novo approach, game theory, biform games.</jats:p>"

During the period of mass development of cyanobacteria, the quality of water in the reservoir deteriorates in terms of a number of indicators, including smell, taste, and content of organic and toxic substances. Among the wide range of cyanoxins, the greatest danger to the population is microcystin-LR, the concentration of which in drinking water should not exceed 1 μg/dm3. The growth of anthropogenic load and global warming of the climate create favorable conditions for the rapid development of cyanobacteria, therefore, the problem of providing the population with high-quality drinking water will only worsen in the future. Traditional methods used at drinking water treatment plants in Volga cities are ineffective in removing intracellular and extracellular cyanotoxins. The best and safest barrier against the ingress of cyanotoxins into drinking water can be membrane technologies that allow ultrafiltration of bacterial cells without mechanical damage and nanofiltration of cyanotoxins dissolved in water.</jats:p>"

One way to address these losses is the explicit anticipation of failures within the design process. We consider a water supply system for high-rise buildings, where pump failures are the most likely failure scenarios. We explicitly consider these failures within an early design stage which leads to a more resilient system, i.e., a system which is able to operate under a predefined number of arbitrary pump failures. We use a mathematical optimization approach to compute such a resilient design. This is based on a multi-stage model for topology optimization, which can be described by a system of nonlinear inequalities and integrality constraints. Such a model has to be both computationally tractable and to represent the real-world system accurately. We therefore validate the algorithmic solutions using experiments on a scaled test rig for high-rise buildings. The test rig allows for an arbitrary connection of pumps to reproduce scaled versions of booster station designs for high-rise buildings. We experimentally verify the applicability of the presented optimization model and that the proposed resilience properties are also fulfilled in real systems.</jats:p>"

So far, many kinds of COVID-19 vaccines have entered phase III clinical trial. However, it is difficult to deliver COVID-19 vaccines efficiently and safely to the areas affected by the epidemic. This paper focuses on vaccine transportation in a supply chain model composed of one distributor and one retailer (clinic or hospital), in which the distributor procures COVID-19 vaccines from the manufacturer and then resells them to the retailer. Distributor detects the activity level of the vaccines, and retailer is responsible for transportation of the vaccines. Firstly, we establish a difference equations model with time-delay. Secondly, we investigate the impact of time-delay on the stability of vaccine supply chain. In addition, we explore the influence of decision adjustment speed of the distributor (or retailer) on the stability of vaccine supply chain. Finally, we verify the theoretical results by a two-dimensional bifurcation diagram, the largest Lyapunov exponent, entropy, and domain of attraction. The results show that when the decision delay-time or the adjustment speed of decision variables exceeds a certain threshold, it brings a negative impact on the stability of vaccine supply chain system. The stability domain of the system shrinks as customers’ sensitivity to cold chain transportation decreases and by contrast expends as customers’ sensitivity to vaccine prices decreases. When the vaccine supply chain is in a state of chaos, the effect of external control over the system is superior to that of internal control over the system.</jats:p>",

In this study, a ball-driven sprinkler was selected to investigate the radial distributions of droplet impact angles under three operating pressures (0.25, 0.30, and 0.35 MPa) and two nozzle diameters (1.9 and 2.2 mm), which are commonly used in agricultural irrigation. The effect of droplet impact angles on the distances from the sprinkler, droplet impact velocities, and shear stresses were analyzed by a 2DVD instrument. Irrespective of the nozzle diameter or operating pressure, the droplet velocities and impact angles near the sprinkler were distributed at 1.0–5.5 m s−1 and 70–90°, respectively, and the droplet shear stress increased with the distance from the sprinkler. Suitable operating pressure and distance from the sprinkler significantly reduced the droplet shear stress. Although the nozzle diameter had a certain effect on the maximum shear stress, the overall effect was insignificant. We developed the models for the radial distribution of droplet shear stresses, which were in good agreement with the measurement. This study proposes a new method for accurately predicating the soil erosion under sprinkler irrigation.</jats:p>",

We establish sharing logistics service supply chain models under revenue-sharing or cost-sharing contracts. Revenue-sharing factor or cost-sharing factor is the equity cooperation parameter. When the members of the supply chain choose to cooperate in revenue-sharing or cost-sharing mechanism, not all cooperation scenarios considered in the study can achieve Pareto improvement of the total profit of the supply chain, but at least one situation can achieve Pareto improvement. This study provides feasible solutions for logistics companies to join the sharing logistics service platform and provides a reference for the operation of a joint distribution platform established by logistics companies.

Our study intends to examine the effect of COVID-19 on SCs and help organizations choose options depending on their relative relevance. Phase one and phase two of the investigation are the most important. As a first step in strengthening SCs' ability to withstand the pandemic, Phase 2 examines the difficulties, concerns, actions, and solutions that have been encountered so far. As part of this phase, a MARCOS method is proposed to select solutions that address the complex interrelationships that are involved in decision-making. Positive and negative solutions are considered and it is at the start of the creation of a preliminary matrix, utility degree is determined closer to both solutions, a new method of determining utility functions and their aggregates is proposed, and the method is stable enough to take into account a huge list of conditions and alternatives. Using this approach, decision-makers will be able to more properly weigh the relevance and influence of many options before making a final choice. The findings suggest that SCs should continue to rely on innovation to endure potential competition and disasters.</jats:p>"

The author notes that the unsatisfactory performance of military outfits by state-owned plants in the Urals, as well as numerous disputes over the rejection of metals, guns and shells between military receivers and the mining administration forced them to revise the existing laws governing acceptance of military products. There were two stages in the development of the regulatory framework for the military order. At the first stage, in 1804, on the initiative of the Minister of Finance, approved by the imperial decree, a special committee was created, consisting of the leaders of Ministry of Land Forces, the Naval Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. As a result, new rules for testing and acceptance of military products were developed. Already in 1808, those rules required processing, which was handled by the Scientific Committee for the Artillery Unit of the Artillery Department. Representatives of the Mining Department were also involved in the work on improving the rules. As a result, new requirements for accepting guns and shells were developed. The second stage of improving the legislation governing the production of military products covers the 1820s – early 1830s. By the early 1820s, state-owned plants of the Urals could no longer cope with the repeatedly increasing volumes of military orders. In addition, they were charged with the manufacture of new types of military products. As a result, in 1822, on the initiative of the Minister of Finance, a special committee was again created from the officials of the Artillery and Mining departments. The result of its activities was the improvement of the supply system of military products, the reduction in orders and the development of new rules for trial and acceptance of military products.</jats:p>"

Here, the park refers to a microgrid that gathers distributed energy such as wind and photovoltaics and has requirements for cooling, heat, and electricity at the same time. Next, combining the constraints of each link, the particle swarm algorithm is used to solve the model. Finally, an example is analyzed in a certain park. The results of the example show that, on the one hand, the proposed scenario generation method and fuzzy number method can reduce the uncertainty of supply and demand, effectively fitting the wind and photovoltaic output and various energy demands. On the other hand, considering the economy and environmental protection of the park at the same time, the configuration of energy storage equipment can not only improve the economy of the park, but also promote the consumption of renewable energy.</jats:p>"

Therefore, developing reliable, cost-effective tools to assess tree nutritional status is of great interest. This investigation sought to assess the use of phloem sap-derived metabolites as an indicator of nutritional status on a background of seasonal water availability of Eucalyptus globulus (Labill) trees grown under field conditions. Phloem is a central conduit for long-distance transport and signaling in plants and offers great promise in reflecting plant-scale resource limitations. Changes in the abundance of solutes and isotopes in phloem sap are sensitive to environmental cues. With a focus on both water and nutrient availability, we characterize patterns in phloem sugars, amino acids and the abundance of carbon isotopes in phloem sap obtained from E. globulus among different seasons and fertilizer treatments. Phloem-derived total amino acid concentration was found to increase with an increasing nitrogen (N) supply; however, this response was lost with the concurrent addition of phosphorus and at the highest level of N supply. Significant seasonal variation in all measured parameters was also detected, highlighting the need for caution in making quantitative relationships with growth. Broader implications of the interactive effects of both water supply and multi-nutrient additions and relationships with growth are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main criteria for planning and evaluating supply chains is the indicator of the flow capacity, which affects the structure of the supply graph, terms of supply, risks, opportunities and the need to differentiate supply channels. The paper analyse an algorithm for calculating the optimal value of the flow in supply chains, taking into account the requirements and expectations of key stakeholders in the supply process. The algorithm provides for finding a balance between \"requirements\" and \"expectations\" by mathematical modelling of a multicriteria problem for each side of the supply process. It proposed to use the obtained parameters for calculating multicriteria problems as \"input\" data for an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal flow value. The proposed model allows one to take into account probabilistic fluctuations in processes by using stochastic programming. The model allows the parties to the procurement process to consider alternative proposals before the formation of contractual obligations, that is, based on residual capacity after choosing the best alternative.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim/purpose  –  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  present  a  strategy  that  allows  companies  to  recover  from  disasters,  when  creating  a  supply  chain.  Furthermore,  it  also  shows  the  impact on the company’s resources that are used in the implementation of the strategy in  case of small and big disasters. Thanks to the proposed solution, it is possible to analyze  each company individually, as well as in groups, at any given time.  Design/methodology/approach – The results were obtained based on a numerical anal- ysis which was performed with the use of MATLAB software. The tests were carried out  separately  for  five  companies,  as  each  of  them  may  expect  a  disaster  on  any  different  day.  However,  the  selection  of  the  day  when  crises  occur  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with the probability determined by scientific research.  Findings  –  The  research  showed  that  companies  using  their  resources  can  continue  to  fulfill their functions as a link in the Supply Chain despite the fact that they react differ- ently  to  small  disasters  compared  to big  ones.  This difference occurs  since  small  disas- ters in contrast to big ones appear in every company much more often. Consequently, it  is  more  difficult  for  companies  to  build  their  wealth  in  the  case  of  small  disasters.  The  advantage of the proposed approach is that one can freely test which strategy can cause  the least losses for the company as well as for the entire supply chain.  Research  implications/limitations  –  The  analysis  carried  out  shows  that  companies  wishing  to  develop  in  conditions  of  unexpected  disasters,  that  cannot  be  predicted,  should  regularly  increase  their  assets  because  they  are  needed  to  implement  a  strategy that  allows  them  to  maintain  an  appropriate  operational  level.  This  approach  provides  tools  that  enable  the  selection  of  strategies  with  variable  parameters,  freely  determined  during the scientific research.  Originality/value/contribution – The paper presents a graphical analysis of the change  in the value of resources of a supply chain company over one year period. Such an anal- ysis  may  be  useful  for  any  company  that  creates  a  supply  chain  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  period,  which  is  an  unpredictable  disaster.  The  adoption  of  a  Gaussian  Pseudo  Random Number Generator turned out to be useful as it creates crises days while simula- tion studies allow us to generate experiments for different data configurations. This pa- per provides an analysis of small and large disasters separately, which is an approach not  presented in the literature.  Keywords: supply chain, disaster, strategy, threats, simulations.

A total 63 German-Holstein cows were housed from three weeks antepartum until sixteen weeks postpartum. After calving, cows were assigned to one of four treatment groups receiving either moderate or high energy concentrations in roughage and secondly moderate or high amounts of concentrates. Retrospectively, cows were additionally grouped according to their β-hydroxybutyrate concentration (SK: cows with SCK vs. CON: cows without SCK). The different energy supply of treatment groups had little effects on blood and liver variables; greater differences occurred between SK and CON cows. Liver fat content of SK cows was 34% higher compared to CON cows. Also, the activity of aspartate aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin concentration, and percentage of granulocytes were increased in SK cows. The results indicate that cows were able to adjust their metabolism to different dietary energy supplies without having a clearly increased risks for metabolic disorders. However, individual animals of all groups developed a metabolic derailment during the postpartum period resulting in SCK, which is closely connected with impaired liver function, compromised immune-responsiveness, and elevated oxidative stress.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To efficiently cross the endothelial barrier during inflammation, neutrophils first firmly adhere to the endothelial surface using the endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Upon actual transmigration, the release from ICAM-1 is required. While Integrin LFA1/Mac1 de-activation is one described mechanism that leads to this, direct cleavage of ICAM-1 from the endothelium represents a second option. We found that a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) cleaves the extracellular domain of ICAM-1 from the endothelial surface. Silencing or inhibiting endothelial ADAM10 impaired the efficiency of neutrophils to cross the endothelium, suggesting that neutrophils use endothelial ADAM10 to dissociate from ICAM-1. Indeed, when measuring transmigration kinetics, neutrophils took almost twice as much time to finish the diapedesis step when ADAM10 was silenced. Importantly, we found increased levels of ICAM-1 on the transmigrating neutrophils when crossing an endothelial monolayer where such increased levels were not detected when neutrophils crossed bare filters. Using ICAM-1-GFP-expressing endothelial cells, we show that ICAM-1 presence on the neutrophils can also occur by membrane transfer from the endothelium to the neutrophil. Based on these findings, we conclude that endothelial ADAM10 contributes in part to neutrophil transendothelial migration by cleaving ICAM-1, thereby supporting the release of neutrophils from the endothelium during the final diapedesis step.</jats:p>"

According to the results of mathematical calculations in the Petro-SIM software, the fraction 140-240°С was determined as optimal for supplying into the top live reflux line of the K-2 column of the atmospheric vacuum pipestill unit. This action makes it possible to reduce the load on the condensing system of the K-2 column of the atmospheric vacuum pipestill units; the heat potential of the hotter kerosene flow also increases, both for heating oil and for generating low-pressure steam. The article describes the advantages of the method.</jats:p>"

Study of the influence of drinking water quality on the ecologically-dependent morbidity of the population of the Republic of Dagestan.<jats:bold>Material and Methods</jats:bold>. Methods of current and retrospective analysis of regional health indicators and methods of mathematical-statistical and medical-geographical analysis were used. Statistical processing of the results was carried out using the STATISTICA and Excel software packages. When carrying out laboratory studies on the quality of drinking water, we used a Lumex atomic absorption spectrometer \"MGA-915MD\".<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. Numerous hygiene studies indicate the direct impact of unsatisfactory drinking water quality on the health of a population. The relationship between sanitary and chemical indicators and the incidence rate for a number of nosological forms has been proven. It is generally accepted that human health is influenced by lifestyle factors (working, living and relaxation conditions), heredity and the ecological condition of the area of residence, including the quality of drinking water. Although it is not possible to differentiate the share of the negative effect caused by the consumption of poor quality drinking water but the incidence of certain nosological forms (cancer of the esophagus, gastrointestinal tract and kidney diseases) in the those regions of the Republic of Dagestan under consideration correlates with the characteristics of drinking water.<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. The problem of pollution of water supply sources for the population in the dynamics of the long-term remains a priority concern. The quality and safety of drinking water are decreasing, which cannot but have a negative impact on public health. Correlation linkages between indicators of drinking water quality and oncological morbidity of the population were also established in indicators below the maximum permissible concentrations, which corresponds to a typical logistic model of causal relationships and serves as evidence of the high dependence of health disorders on chemical contamination of water supply sources.</jats:p><jats:p> </jats:p>"

The present research aimed at comparing coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), cv. Verdão, yields under fertigation via drip irrigation with a continuous application and in pulses, with 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) being recovered. These treatments were distributed in randomized blocks in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme, with three replications, in a greenhouse located at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, northeast Brazil (08°01′6.50″ S and 34°56′46″ W, average elevation 6.5 m). The continuous irrigation consisted of the application of water depth in a single daily event, while pulsed irrigation comprised the application of the same irrigation depth split up into five events with a 1-hour interval between pulses. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was determined via the water balance by lysimetric drainage. The fertilizers were applied in every watering. The biometric and productivity crop pointed that pulsed irrigation to a mean depth of 58% of the ETc corresponds to the results obtained with the application of the depth equivalent to 100% of the ETc by continuous irrigation, consequently with reduced input costs.</jats:p>",

Drawing on decision-making theory and organizational information processing theory, we conceptualize two patterns of BDA usage for supply chain (SC) activities (BDA use for SC optimization and BDA use for SC learning) and report two complementary channels via which the two BDA usage patterns impact a supply chain organization’s BDA-enabled decision-making capability. An analysis of questionnaire data from supply chain managers representing 157 companies based in North American suggests that BDA use for SC optimization is directly associated with better decision-making capability. In contrast, the influence of BDA use for SC learning does not impact decision-making directly but indirectly, as its effect is fully mediated by organizational integration. We discuss the implications of these findings for future academic research and for managers in practice who seek to maximize business values from BDA implementations.</jats:p>"

This study mainly discusses the Internet of Things supervision system and supply chain financial supervision method based on blockchain technology. The whole blockchain network is a decentralized system, which consists of six layers: data layer, network layer, and consensus layer. These three layers are the foundation layer; the other three layers are incentive layer, contract layer, and application layer. The interface of the platform needs to be conceived in combination with the business of building materials. According to the functional differentiation, the required interfaces mainly include information generation interface, information verification, information retrieval, and other information interfaces. Smart contracts can process data, operate asset transactions, manage smart assets, and expand the ability of blockchain to use data. In this way, the blockchain technology can trace the source of the data, so as to ensure the authenticity and security of the data. Blockchain technology can be used in data tracking. Specifically, in the building materials industry, with the help of blockchain technology, building material mixing enterprises can see the raw materials such as sand and gravel purchased under the order, the region where they are produced, the time point of transportation, the carrier, etc. In the process of supply chain financial supervision experiment, when the pledge rate of building materials is within the range of [0.4206,1], the bank income under the block chain mode is higher. The system designed in this study realizes the certification and traceability of building materials and has good use value.</jats:p>",

Objective prerequisites for the use of centralized heating sources, as well as levels of development of heat supply systems of settlements are identified. It is determined that the development of heat supply systems largely depends on climatic conditions and the climatic characteristics of certain cities of Ukraine are considered. The main stages of construction of district heating systems in localities of Ukraine are formed. Types of heat supply of cities of Ukraine are identified. The genesis of development of heat generation and heat supply processes in Ukraine is researched. The peculiarities of formation of the national legislative framework for regulation of issues on production and consumption of heat energy are analyzed. The provisions of the Concept for the implementation of the State policy in the sphere of heat supply are analyzed. Based on the carried out analysis, it is determined the following: firstly, the imbalance of financial capabilities and needs for financing investment projects of heat supplying enterprises, as well as a shortage of investment resources, which requires careful substantiation of investment programs, directions and order of modernization and reconstruction of available capacities; secondly, shifting the focus to the powers of local authorities (through decentralization of public administration), which received broad powers to license and set tariffs for heat energy, but at the same time received a wider range of obligations to maintain heat supply systems in working condition; thirdly, the lack of medium- and long-term planning for the development of heat supply systems in localities, which largely explains the current state of the heat supply sector. It is substantiated that such features of the current state of heat supply in Ukraine require the development of new approaches to planning and implementation of works on organizational-technological modernization of heat supply in conditions of limited financial resources.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we compare and analyze the impact upon soil moisture movement and water infiltration after the shift of irrigation method from flood irrigation to mulched drip irrigation under mulch through setting up in-field in-situ observation points and carrying out groundwater depth dynamic observation. The results show that compared with mulched drip irrigation under mulch, flood irrigation has a stronger response to rainfall infiltration and a quicker response time in the rise of underground depth. With the decrease of groundwater level, the effect of rainfall infiltration to replenish groundwater is significantly weakened. In the flood irrigation area, the groundwater depth at about 8 m already has no obvious response to a small amount of rainfall. However, the groundwater depth at 6 m in the area of mulched drip irrigation under mulch already has no response to rainfall. Therefore, when groundwater extraction is carried out in irrigation areas, reasonable groundwater extraction levels should be designated in light of different irrigation methods to maintain the sustainable utilization of groundwater.</jats:p>",

Breakage statistics for pipelines with a diameter of 25 to 1100 mm during the last five years were calculated. As a result of segmental analysis, it was found that the main types of damage to the pipes of water supply system are through fistulas of steel pipes – 54.4% and corrosion – 25.6%; loss of integrity of cast iron pipes on joints – 9.7%, fractures and cracks of cast iron pipes – 6.1%; fractures in joints of polyethylene pipes and other damages – 4.2%. To characterize the reliability of the municipal water supply networks, the pipeline failure flow parameter ω was used. It was defined as the ratio of the number of failures of the water supply network section to the observation period and the length of pipe network sections of the corresponding diameter. The calculation of interval estimates for the failure rate parameter ωо for steel and cast iron pipes of the water distribution network of Kropyvnytskyi was carried out. According to the operational organization 84% of the network was laid using these pipes and analytical expressions were obtained to determine average values of ω0ср depending on their diameter. Significantly higher values of ω0ср were noted in comparison with similar ones given in the literature for other cities, which can be explained by a significant excess of the standard service life of 85% of steel and 50% of cast iron pipes in the water supply network of Kropyvnytskyi. To increase the reliability of water supply networks, it is recommended to implement the experience of European countries and replace 2% of the network per year and use polyethylene pipes. To reduce the failure factor of water supply networks, particularly in those areas where overtime pipes are used, the expediency of partial installation of water-air dampers for pressure fluctuations directly in the pipeline, in which there is a gradual and complete damping of the shock wave. Approbation of a prototype of a hydraulic shock absorber of this design was carried out in the hydraulics laboratory at Central Ukrainian National Technical University and its efficiency and high efficiency at full shock wave damping was confirmed.</jats:p>"

Paralleled with the decline of MMR has been the expansion of hospital bed supply as well as substantial reduction in hospital bed distribution inequalities, which were thought to be significant contributors to the reduction in MMR. However, evidences on the impact of hospital bed supply as well as how its distribution inequality has affected MMR remains scarce in China. Addressing this uncertainty is essential to understand whether efforts made on the expansion of healthcare resource supply as well as on improving its distribution inequality from a geographical perspective has the potential to produce measurable population health improvements.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Panel data of 31 provinces in China between 2004 and 2016 were extracted from the national statistical data, including China Statistical Yearbooks, China Health Statistical Yearbooks and other national publications.

The average hospital bed density increased from 2.28 per 1000 population in 2004 to 4.54 per 1000 population in 2016, with the average Gini coefficient reducing from 0.32 to 0.25.

The digital transformation process has received a certain impetus for development in conditions of self-isolation. The active use of modern digital technologies made it possible to solve a number of important problems. In conditions of self-isolation, due to the fall in real incomes of the population, the structure of consumption has changed, the population is reorienting to the consumption of food products that are more affordable. The article shows that digitalization is being actively implemented in the life of every person who is directly related to the food supply system. The effective functioning of the food supply system for the population of the region presupposes an increase in the level of self-sufficiency in food products, as one of the important indicators of food independence of the regions of Russia. In the course of the study, the prerequisites, restrictions on the development of the food supply system for the population of the region in the context of digitalization were identified. An assessment of the state and use of agro-resource potential, the level of self-sufficiency of the population with basic food products of the subjects of the Baikal region is given. It was revealed that the agro-resource potential of the Republic of Buryatia and the Transbaikal Territory is not used effectively. The Irkutsk Region has a higher innovative potential, has certain competitive advantages, in particular, low electricity tariffs, etc., this creates favorable conditions for the development of the food supply system of the region. The barriers hindering the development of the digital transformation process in the food supply system have been identified: a low level of agribusiness margins, a lack of financial resources, an underdeveloped infrastructure, and a lack of highly qualified personnel. Strategic directions for the development of the food supply system for the population in the context of digital transformation are proposed</jats:p>"

The current state of rural power supply is characterized by a high degree of deterioration of electrical equipment, long distance overhead power lines, low reliability of low-voltage electrical networks, and a higher accident rate. With an aim of ensuring food security and export orientation of the industry for the next 5 years, it is necessary to implement a set of measures to improve the efficiency of energy supply to agricultural production. This task will be hampered by a constant rise in prices and tariffs for energy resources. Thus, over the last 20 years, energy costs have increased from 3-5 % to 30-40 % in agricultural production. The specific capital investment (per 1 kW of power) and the cost of 1 kWh of electricity were reported to depend on a type of local energy source and its capacity. The paper proposes a method for marking out the economic boundaries of the effective use of local power supply arrangements to replace a standard central station. A power gen-set supplying energy to an agricultural holding is capable of operating in two modes subsequent upon utility (central station) electricity – autonomous and parallel. The authors compared the cost of electrical and thermal energy produced by the power gen-set and tariffs for these types of energy. Calculations have shown that it is advisable for an agricultural holding to have a local power supply system being a power gen-set based on gas engine-generators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study focuses on digitalization strategies within the realm of supply chain management, wherein the focus is set on the specific economic environment of companies in the supply chain of critical infra­structure providers. Digitalization strategies are within this paper discussed concerning supply chain management and its relevance to the ongoing and influential COVID-19 crisis, where digital strategies of collaboration and management became imperative. To address the research question about the state of implementation of digital strategies within this specific indus­try, a qualitative empirical study was conducted. Experts from companies acting as suppliers of critical infrastructure were interviewed in an online setting regarding their own experiences with the implementation of digital strategies and according to challenges. Within the analysis of these inter­views, it became obvious that digital strategies pre-crisis were only rarely implemented, with only one out of seven experts reporting about more ad­vanced strategies. The COVID-19 crisis is described to be an accelerator re­garding digitalization, although specific challenges resulting from unclear legal situations and frameworks are reported.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: to assess the potential for the functional implementation of a micro-hydropower station in the design of a sprinkler machine to meet the in-system needs for electrical energy.  Materials and methods: the study was carried out on the basis of an example of calculating the installation of a micro-hydropower station by A. G. Chernykh and the formulas presented in the handbook on hydraulics. To construct the multiple regression equation, the inverse matrix solution method was used. The calculation of the economic efficiency of the micro-hydropower station was carried out using the method of technical and economic analysis of possible options for electrification by S. G. Obukhov.  Results and discussion: based on the results of the verification energy calculations, the effective power on the hydraulic turbine shaft with average technical parameters of low-pressure sprinkler machines was 1.202–15.648 kW. At the same time, linking the operation of the micro-hydropower plant to the irrigation systems of the North Caucasus territory has the potential to get 2596.32–33799.68 kW of generated electricity per year at a cost of 1 kW·h of 0.6204 rubles.  Conclusions: the introduction of a micro-hydropower station in the design of sprinkler equipment will provide the ability to generate electricity within the available hydraulic characteristics. With this in mind, for the operation of hydropower equipment, it is necessary to have or create an additional water pressure. The multiple regression equation obtained on the basis of verification calculations of the parameters of the energy block of a microhydroelectric power plant showed that an increase in the water pressure per 1 m Н2О leads to an increase in effective power by an average of 0.611 kW.</jats:p>"

Resting phosphorylation potential (PCr/inorganic phosphate) was also higher proximally (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). The surrogate for fibre type, carnosine content measured by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H MRS, did not differ between distal and proximal TA (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.884). Performing intermittent exercise to avoid exercise ischaemia, still led to larger <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>PCr</jats:sub> proximally than distally (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.013). In conclusion, the spatial <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>PCr</jats:sub> gradient is strongly associated with the spatial variation in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply. It cannot be explained by exercise‐induced ischaemia nor by fibre type. Our findings suggest it is driven by a higher proximal intrinsic mitochondrial oxidative capacity, apparently to support contractile performance of the TA.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The design of urban water supply and disposal systems is associated with overcoming various uncer-tainties of an economic, technical, natural and anthropogenic nature. Among them, the estimated loads for water consumption and discharge are the most significant. If water supply and disposal systems are designed and built for loads higher than the actual values, the water and runoff flow rates will cause quiescent area, pipeline silting and even plugging. If the actual load exceeds the designed load, this will lead to significant hydraulic pressure losses, overstated operating costs and considerable equip-ment wear. The risks involved with overestimating or underestimating the design loads are very high, as both would require reconstruction and immense financial investments. To minimise such risks, we propose a methodology based on a multi-stage and adaptive project implementation with minimum risks when making a decision at each step. A numerical study demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed methodology and its conformity with the domestic design process and development of water supply and disposal systems. This method allows the optimal way of system development to be chosen ac-cording to the life cycle costs.</jats:p>"

The article also deals with theoretical provisions, which can be taken as a basis for the methodology of substantiation of the optimal plan of such supply. It is noted that drinking water is an important resource in the system of food supply of military units, the lack or shortage of which for a relatively short period of time significantly affects the combat capabilities of the units. Based on this, the possibility of diversifying the sources of drinking water supply for the needs of the troops is studied. Both traditional options of drinking water supply for NGU needs and new ones, which are expected to be implemented in practice in the near future, are considered. Expanding the list of possible sources of potable water supply will contribute to increasing the reliability of water supply and reducing the cost of related logistics operations. Taking into account the presented options for providing drinking water, possible points of delivery of bottled drinking water to units that perform their tasks autonomously in difficult conditions were identified. The presence of several points of drinking water supply to units necessitates the development of a water supply plan. One of the key requirements for such a plan is minimization of total costs. It is shown that the transport problem of linear programming can be used as the basis for developing an optimal plan for supplying drinking bottled water to military units. In this case, the target function is reduced to a minimum of total costs of water delivery. The constraints affecting the processes and determining the search area of the optimal solution are formulated, the general approach to solving the formulated optimization problem is characterized.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the article is to develop a methodology for studying the influence of the level of economy monetization and the structure of the money supply on the lending activity of banks and, on this basis, to develop recommendations for the financial support of the agricultural sector of the economy. The article examines the following indicators of the structure and quality of the money supply in the economy: the level of economy monetization, the share of various aggregates in the money supply, the money multiplier and factors affecting them. The authors' attention is focused on the need for scientific substantiation of the economy's need for money and the management of the structure of the money supply to achieve the goals of state monetary policy. The role of state monetary policy in creating conditions for the resumption of growth in the agricultural sector was revealed. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators was carried out and the assessment of the impact of key factors on the state of the agricultural sector and the economy as a whole was carried out. The assessment of the level of monetization of the Ukrainian economy was carried out. The reasons for the low level of monetization of the Ukrainian economy were revealed and the ways to overcome it were formulated. Based on a critical analysis of various positions, it is shown what a balanced monetary policy should be in Ukraine. It has been proved that a significant decrease in the discount rate and an excessive increase in the money supply lead to an increase in inflation, an increase in risks in the financial sector and a destabilization of the situation in the agricultural sector, as well as in the economy as a whole. The relationship between the emission mechanism and the policy of stimulating the growth of the agricultural sector has been determined. The role of the main institutional elements of state monetary policy in enhancing the progressive development of the Ukrainian economy was revealed. Recommendations for improving the state regulation of the monetary sphere were given.</jats:p>"

Results: the adoption of the Order of the Ministry of Agriculture no. 79 dated 02.18.2013 significantly strengthened the position of institutions in the validity of the provision of services for water supply (diversion) on a paid basis, creating general conditions throughout the country, which made it possible to ensure uninterrupted water supply in the required volumes to water consumers. However, there are still many questions on this issue. As a result of the research, the priority role of the state in the restoration and stable functioning of the land reclamation complex of the country was determined. The problems associated with the underfunding of state reclamation systems operation and non-compliance with environmental legislation have been identified.  Conclusions: proposals regarding the current procedure have been developed: the conclusion of two contracts if necessary (both for water supply and diversion) between the FGBU on land reclamation and the water consumer; the imposing of costs associated with penalties in case of exceeding the permissible discharge of pollutants on the agricultural producer in the contract for water diversion; the inclusion of costs for compensation of harm caused to aquatic biological resources as a result of activities for the water supply (withdrawal) resources in the costs of providing services for water supply (diversion); differentiation of formulas for calculating the cost of services for the supply (diversion) of water to agricultural producers on irrigated lands and other consumers not for the purposes of agricultural production. It is necessary to amend the charters of the Federal State Budgetary Institution on Land Reclamation, providing for the attribution of services for the supply (removal) of water to the main partially paid types of activities, and the establishment at the legislative level of the mandatory conclusion of contracts for the provision of services for the supply (removal) of water.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Progress has been made in recent years to bring attention to the challenges faced by school-aged girls around managing menstruation in educational settings that lack adequate physical environments and social support in low- and middle-income countries. To enable more synergistic and sustained progress on addressing menstruation-related needs while in school, an effort was undertaken in 2014 to map out a vision, priorities, and a ten-year agenda for transforming girls’ experiences, referred to as Menstrual Hygiene Management in Ten (MHM in Ten). The overarching vision is that girls have the information, support, and enabling school environment for managing menstruation with dignity, safety and comfort by 2024. This requires improved research evidence and translation for impactful national level policies. As 2019 marked the midway point, we assessed progress made on the five key priorities, and remaining work to be done, through global outreach to the growing network of academics, non-governmental organizations, advocates, social entrepreneurs, United Nations agencies, donors, and national governments. This paper delineates the key insights to inform and support the growing MHM commitment globally to maximize progress to reach our vision by 2024. Corresponding to the five priorities, we found that (priority 1) the evidence base for MHM in schools has strengthened considerably, (priority 2) global guidelines for MHM in schools have yet to be created, and (priority 3) numerous evidence-based advocacy platforms have emerged to support MHM efforts. We also identified (priority 4) a growing engagement, responsibility, and ownership of MHM in schools among governments globally, and that although MHM is beginning to be integrated into country-level education systems (priority 5), resources are lacking. Overall, progress is being made against identified priorities. We provide recommendations for advancing the MHM in Ten agenda. This includes continued building of the evidence, and expanding the number of countries with national level policies and the requisite funding and capacity to truly transform schools for all students and teachers who menstruate.</jats:p>",

There is no doubt that blood is deemed one of the vital relief supplies, and ensuring smooth blood delivery may substantially alleviate subsequent impacts caused by the disaster. Taking red blood cell products as the research object, this work proposes a four‐echelon blood supply chain model. Specifically, it includes blood donors, blood donation houses, blood centres, and hospitals. Furthermore, numerical analysis is provided to test the feasibility of blood collection and distribution schemes and conduct sensitivity analysis to test the impacts of the relevant parameters (e.g., apheresis donation proportion of red blood cells (RBCs), distance between blood donors and blood facilities, and times of blood donation) on the scheme. This research provides some scientific and reasonable support for decision makers and managerial implications for emergency departments and contributes to the study of emergent blood supply chain.</jats:p>",

The demand is affected by price and the carbon emission reduction rate. The optimal decisions of pricing and carbon emission reduction rate are analyzed under four decision models: (i) centralized decision, (ii) decentralized decision without fairness concern, (iii) decentralized decision with manufacturer’s fairness concern, (iv) decentralized decision with retailer’s fairness concern. The results indicate that the profits in the centralized LCSC are higher than those in the decentralized LCSC with fairness concern. If a manufacturer pays close attention to fairness, the fairness concern coefficient will reduce the carbon emission reduction rate and the profit of the LCSC and increase the wholesale price and the retail price of the product. If a retailer pays close attention to fairness, and the preference of consumers for a low-carbon product is low, the fairness concern coefficient of the retailer increases the total profit of the LCSC and decreases the carbon emission reduction rate and retail price of the product. Otherwise, if the preference of consumers for a low-carbon product is great, the fairness concern coefficient of the retailer would lead to a lower retail price compared with the retail price in the centralized decision and decrease the total profit of the LCSC.</jats:p>"

However, some problems of the information flow, logistics, and capital flow in the supply chain remain a challenge, such as the information asymmetry between upstream and downstream, substandard quality of goods, difficulty in traceability, and default of payment. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based supply chain framework (SESCF), which solves the supply chain problems securely and efficiently. First, the use of blockchain and smart contracts ensures the information symmetry in the supply chain system. Second, the radio frequency identification (RFID) provides a unique identity of goods, which helps in real-time quality monitoring. Additionally, the immutability and distributed storage of the blockchain play an important role in tracking the origin of goods. Third, the efficient payment channel is used to solve the problem of payment defaults. Furthermore, simulations of smart contracts along with the security analyses are presented in this paper. We also implement a blockchain-based supply chain system (SescfDapp), which is built upon a Consortium blockchain. Large-scale experiments and detailed analysis prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed system.</jats:p>",

It has been proposed that 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films can provide near-ideal passivation due to their wide bandgap, lack of dangling bonds, high dielectric constant, and easy transferability to a range of substrates without disturbing their bulk properties. However, so far, the passivation of hBN has been studied for small areas, mainly because of its small sizes. Here, we report the passivation characteristics of wafer-scale, few monolayers thick, hBN grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Using a recently reported ITO/i-InP/p<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-InP solar cell structure, we show a significant improvement in solar cell performance utilizing a few monolayers of hBN as the passivation layer.

Thus, hBN may, in the future, be a possible candidate to achieve high-quality passivation. hBN-based passivation layers can mainly be useful in cases where the growth of lattice-matched passivation layers is complicated, as in the case of thin-film vapor–liquid–solid and close-spaced vapor transport-based III–V semiconductor growth techniques.</jats:p>"

Clinical and economic analysis of budgetary expenditures on drugs purchased as part of the Guaranteed amount of free medical care and in the system of mandatory social health insurance (MSHI) for the period from 2019-2021. Assessment of the effectiveness of spending budgetary funds for drugs was conducted using data on the number and cost of drugs purchased to provide outpatient care in the medical organization of Nur-Sultan.Results. A three-year analysis showed a positive trend of a 7.1% decrease in the proportion of spending on unproven drugs (index N) by 2021 compared with the previous year 2020, which was 29.54% of spending on 13 drug items, despite the expansion of lists under insurance medicine. Before the introduction of mandatory social health insurance in 2019, this figure was 8.18% of all outpatient drug coverage costs in the Guaranteed amount of free medical care, indicating an average use of drugs not included in international clinical guidelines.Conclusions. The introduction of clinical pharmacology services into clinical practice has optimized the cost of drug therapy and promoted rational use of medications. The result is a 7.1% decrease in the share of spending on unproven drugs compared to the previous year 2020, which amounted to 29.54% of spending on 13 drugs (index N) not included in the Kazakhstan National Medical Formulary and the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. However, due to the long-term training of clinical pharmacologists, including basic education in therapeutic medicine (6-7 years) and additional education at the level of residency or doctoral studies (2-3 years), there is decreased motivation of clinical pharmacologists to work in budget medical organizations due to the \"low\" level of wages. Abroad, in particular, this problem was solved by the introduction of clinical pharmacy, where training includes basic pharmaceutical education (4-5 years) with the possibility of additional training at the master's level (1-2 years) and doctoral studies (2-3 years).Keywords.

The research methodology consists in compilation of probabilistic water withdrawal by end users, compilation of a mathematical model of probabilistic flow distribution, formation of key indicators of reliability of end users provision, description of the implementation of the methodology. Based on the results of processing statistical data on water withdrawals and accidents at the sections of water supply networks of the Irkutsk-II microdistrict for previous years, using electronic models of the developed computer software, the functioning of the water supply and distribution system of the microdistrict was simulated in various operating modes. The assessment of the reliability of supplying end users with water was carried out, key indicators of the quality of providing them with a calculated and reduced level for each end user (node) of the calculation scheme were formed, sections of the network that most negatively affect the quality of feeding end users were identified, measures were proposed to optimize the operation of the system, and their impact was evaluated. The advantage of probabilistic modeling, which corresponds to the adequacy of the real processes of the system’s functioning, is the possibility of developing more precise rules for controlling the water supply and distribution system. The paper shows the effectiveness of the developed methodology and software, which, in turn, allow evaluating the performance, reliability, and controllability of the system. The developed calculation method and software is a modern and effective tool for solving many operational and design tasks for the maintenance and development of water supply systems.</jats:p>"

The MSAWG consisted of 18 thermoelectric cooler (TEC) units, 18 internal finned heat sinks, 18 external finned heat sinks, 18 direct current (DC) cooling fans, an air-conditioner mesh air filter, and an axial ventilation fan. It was found from the results that the hourly values of water production of MSAWG were proportional to the hourly rates of relative humidity, but they were inversely affected by the corresponding hourly values of the ambient temperature. Night-time and early morning were the most effective times to produce the highest amount of fresh water from Malaysia’s atmosphere using MSAWG, as the increase in the rates of relative humidity and the decrease in the values of ambient temperature occurred over these periods. Based on the varied hourly rates of relative humidity with the ranges between the minimum rate of 55% and maximum rate of 85%, an equation of Y = 0.2285X + 36.675 with R2 of 0.9404 was achieved from the 48 h experimental work to estimate the water production of MSAWG in Malaysia, where Y and X were indicated as the rate of relative humidity and the value of water production, respectively, in this equation. In conclusion, the MSAWG produced a consecutive cumulative water volume of 3.432 and 6.997 L experimentally in the periods of 24 and 48 h, respectively. The estimated cost per liter for MSAWG was USD 0.466. Some water quality parameters of the fresh water produced by MSAWG were analysed in the laboratory, which showed that they met the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards. Therefore, MSAWG can be employed as a sustainable alternative to generate annual daily fresh water from Malaysia’s tropical atmosphere and aid in mitigating the problem of unpredicted water shortage in the country.</jats:p>"

Drawing on feelings-as-information theory, this study investigates the impacts of two types of gesture-based interaction (i.e., touchscreen interaction and mid-air interaction) on consumers’ sense of touch. Results from a laboratory experiment showed that touchscreen interaction elicited a higher sense of touch than mid-air interaction when the importance of product haptic information was high. However, touchscreen interaction did not differ from mid-air interaction in terms of eliciting consumers’ sense of touch when the importance of product haptic information was low. Furthermore, consumers’ sense of touch improved their shopping experience satisfaction by reducing uncertainty about products and fostering attachment to products. Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing literature by empirically investigating the effects of gesture-based interaction on consumers’ bodily sensations, elucidating the role of the sense of touch in affecting consumers’ virtual product experience, and highlighting the impact of the interaction method on consumer behavior. This study also provides practical insights into the application of gesture-based interaction technologies.</jats:p>"

The provision of the industry with production resources is established. There is an increase in the capital intensity of production, an increase in the value of fixed assets, tools against the background of a decrease in the number of full-time employees in the industry. The supply of electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning in Ukraine is one of the most powerful, accounting for about 25% of industrial sales. This has a significant impact on trends in economic activity of enterprises, the cost and competitiveness of domestic products, quality of life and social protection. Over the past 5 years, the country's electricity production has been steadily declining. This was primarily due to a reduction in the production of thermal power plants. Assessment of the dynamics of electricity production in terms of the main sources of supply in Ukraine indicates a change in its structure. The dominant role in electricity production belongs to nuclear power plants, which consistently occupy about 50%. Production of electricity from alternative sources is growing in Ukraine, its share in 2020 is more than 10%. The article compares capacity and energy production on the basis of renewable sources of individual countries in Europe and Ukraine. According to the data of 2020, it has been established that Ukraine has mastered investments in the installation of solar panels, windmills, hydroelectric power plants, thermal springs, but they do not produce energy in accordance with their capabilities. Consumer price indices for the main groups of energy goods and services in Ukraine for 2016–2020 were monitored. There is a constant excess of prices for electricity and heat compared to the general consumer price index for goods and services. There is an increase in the price disparity in the main sectors of the economy, which requires state control and regulation. Prospects for further development of Ukraine's electricity and heat supply sector based on the use of alternative sources and the formation of priorities of the strategy of socio-economic development for energy security and energy saving in accordance with European priorities are proposed.</jats:p>"

Enterprise models of this type need to cover not only the supply chain but also the demand chain, since understanding the market is critical to formulating good business policy. To work effectively, marketing activities must be coordinated with other functional areas of the company. Specifically, managers must evaluate the trade-off between marketing and supply chain decisions to improve the performance of an overall metric: shareholder value. The article formu-lates a mathematical model that takes into account the main business functions. A mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for the integrated optimization of strategic supply chain decisions and marketing decisions. This allows you to more accurately form a financial model and estimate the value of the enterprise. Keywords</jats:p>"

Due to the analyses of the text of this pamphlet and other journalistic texts devoted to the problem of the effectiveness of the quartermaster system of the British during the Crimean War, it was managed to clarify the question of the authorship and the reason for the creation of this historical source. As part of the public discussion caused by the problems of the British army in the Crimea in the winter of 1854-1855, a number of explanations of the causes of these problems were proposed. One authors claimed that these problems had been caused by mistakes of the government, but another journalists thought that high causalities during the winter had been caused by the difficulties, that where unavoidable in case of supplying the army at a great distance from the metropolis. The research shows that the British lawyer Peter Benson Maxwell (who held a pro-government position and who was a former member of the Hospital (Cunning-Maxwell) Commission that began its work in Scutari in November 1854) criticized through this pamphlet the results of the investigation of the parliamentary «Sebastopol Committee» (chaired by John Roebuck), that began its work in March 1855. This commission laid the main blame for the sufferings of the British troops during the winter on the government of Lord Aberdeen, and Peter Benson Maxwell was disagree with this interpretation of events and tried to rebut it.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the agricultural water supply systems operation in Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan regions, Stavropol, Krasnodar and Altai regions and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District was carried out, as a result, the lack of environmental safety of water intakes of water supply systems was revealed. To solve this problem, a scientific substantiation of the environmentally sustainable operation of a specialized type of natural-technical system “natural water environment – water industry complex – agricultural water supply system” was carried out.  Conclusions. The proposed systematic approach to solving vital problems of ensuring the environmental safety of water intakes of water industry systems will ensure uninterrupted supply of the required estimated high-quality water supply to consumers under any operating modes of agricultural water supply systems (slush, suspension, plankton, dreisen, etc.). At the same time, the complex of water purification facilities will improve the river ecosystem.</jats:p>"

Electric energy supply of cities with dense buildings is provided mainly from centralized generation sources: TPPs, CHPs, NPPs, RES, and heat energy - from CHPs and gas boilers. Possibilities of energy self-sufficiency of Ukrainian cities based on use of alternative and local energy sources are analyzed. There is a global trend of increasing share of RES in cities energy supply, especially in cities and districts with cottage development. Providing cities with their own energy resources can be achieved through integrated use of renewable and local sources. Production of electricity from renewable sources in terms of return on investment EROI and normalized energy cost over life cycle of LCOE generation source is close to traditional sources indicators. Examples of RES usage to meet energy needs of houses and settlements in Europe are given. High cost of renewable energy stimulates development of this area in Ukraine. Efficiency of renewable and local sources usage in buildings is achieved only with simultaneous introduction of energy saving measures - insulation of buildings, introduction of energy control systems.

Three principles for natural monopolies tariff regulation are identified: compromise, compensatory, and Incentive based regulation. One of the Incentive based regulation methods — Yardstick Cost Method — has an advantage of regulated entities labor saving within the tariff protection. The other benefit of the method is the feasibility to grade providers from most to least economic performance and to regulate the economic performance improvement for ineffective providers specifically. Benchmarking of publicly available water supply costs data turned up that the costs of physical resources, amortization and rentals depend on specific conditions of enterprise. Therefore, the water supply costs exclusive of resource cost, amortization and rentals seems to be good as an outcome variable for Yardstick Cost Method. We calculated a formula of approximate functional relationship among three contributors and water supply costs exclusive of resource cost and amortization. The yardstick water supply costs were determined by target performance method applying the formula. Although the formula needs an upgrade, our calculations demonstrate a feasibility of Yardstick Cost Method practice for tariff regulation of Russian water suppliers.</jats:p>"

Unlike the way used in the existing MFC control algorithms, the sinusoidal voltages available in the primary network are processed according to the proposed modernized technology of \"sliding modes\". The level of discontinuous voltages is selected from the condition of minimum deviations from the target, which has a favorable effect on the spectrum of output voltages. On the selected time interval, the input primary network phase voltages and the specified output network phase voltages are sampled. A positive minimum difference between the primary network phase voltage closest to its desired value and the specified secondary network phase voltage is produced. This difference acts as a positive discontinuous control. A negative difference acts as a negative discontinuous control. Over the calculated interval, the average deviation from the specified phase voltage is zero. Owing to this feature, the smallest distortions in the MFC output voltage spectrum are obtained at arbitrary loads and evolutions of the primary network voltage frequency and amplitude. Versions of three-phase and six-phase primary sources are considered. The effectiveness of the proposed version of using \"sliding modes\" has been confirmed by simulation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Microwave technology in microstrip design is widely used in various antenna systems. The active use of phased array (PA) of this type makes developers around the world search for various options of its construction. To improve individual characteristics, in particular, expand the scanning angle, as well as optimize the configuration of the excitation of the PA, they use subarrays that combine a given number of elements of the entire array. In this paper, we considered various options for constructing microstrip PA subarrays made on a homogeneous substrate from a high-frequency laminate GIL_GML 1000, in particular, various methods for their excitation. Using modern, accurate 3D electrodynamic modeling environment and HF device analysis, we studied changes in the electrodynamic characteristics of the simulation model of a multi-element microstrip PA subarray, depending on how the excitation is organized. This article discusses three simulation models of subarrays for microstrip PA with various options for their excitation. All subarrays have a radiation pattern of a special shape. After calculating the main characteristics, the issue of the most preferred organization of subarray power supply for the developed PA was solved. It is shown that in practice, the study of parameters and decision-making on the design of complex microwave devices, possibly without expensive field modeling.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The actuality of the theme arises from the need to improve and further develop the methodological support of portfolio management processes in the context of the portfolio management introduction of collective strategies implementation in supply chain networks.  The purpose of the study is to develop a mathematical model for determining the optimal portfolio components as a means of single system implementation of collective strategies in supply chain networks (SCNs) to meet the target value of selected criteria of efficiency and cost-effectiveness of supply chains as integral objects, taking into account the possibility of presenting these criteria as stochastic variables. The given model is described in the paper in the terms of portfolio implementation optimisation, the components of which are aimed at reducing the delivery time of orders in the supply chain.  Objectives of the study: to conduct a comparative analysis of the PMI portfolio management standard versions in order to form a conceptual framework for the study and determine the knowledge base for portfolio management by the subject of the research; to formulate the problem of portfolio components optimisation for the collective strategies implementation in SCNs; to analyse and identify scientific gaps in methodological approaches to solving the problem of optimizing portfolio components of the collective strategies implementation in SCNs in the proposed formulation; to develop a mathematical model for determining the optimal portfolio components for the implementation of collective strategies in SCNs as in the case of portfolio optimisation for a collective logistics strategy implementation, the components of which are aimed at reducing the time of orders delivery in supply chain; to approve the developed mathematical model for portfolio optimisation under the operation conditions of perishable goods supply chains in Ukraine.  Utilised techniques of the research. The research is based on the concept of forming, on a single system basis, the collective strategies portfolio implementation in SCNs, which foresees the spread of portfolio management, which is defined to be an effective tool for the strategy implemention of an individual organisation, in a similar way a network of organisations, if the development conditions of the given network foresee the adoption of a collective strategy.  Based on a comparative analysis of the four known versions of the PMI portfolio management standard for 2020, portfolio management is identified as a knowledge basis for portfolio management of methods and models for portfolio optimisation and strategies implementation in organisations.  Based on the analysis of scientific and other information sources, the objective of optimizing the portfolios composition of collective strategies in SCNs is formulated as one that foresees the single system optimisation of the supply chain portfolio to meet the targets of selected criteria of efficiency and cost­effectiveness of the supply chain as a whole object, taking into account the possibility of presenting these criteria as stochastic variables.  Based on the analysis of methodological approaches to solving the problem of optimizing the portfolio composition of collective strategies in SCNs, we identified a scientific gap, including the knowledge basis of portfolio management composition, in terms of lack of models for portfolio components optimisation. They would give the possibility to assess these components from a single system position of SCNs according to the established, in general case, several criteria, taking into account the possibility to present these criteria as stochastic variables.  Based on the analysis of methodological approaches to solving multicriteria problems, taking into account the fact that some parameters may be stochastic, to solve the problem of portfolios components optimisation of collective strategies in SCNs in the proposed presentation we chose such an approach to solving multicriteria problems as establishing one (main) criterion transfering others to the rank of restraints. This gave grounds to apply the method of stochastic integer programming and to accept the condition about the random nature of individual parameters, i.e. the method of stochastic integer programming.  As a result, the mathematical model for determining the optimal composition of portfolios was introduced as a means of implementing, on a single system basis, collective strategies in SCNs according to the requirements of achieving the target values of the selected criteria as stochastic variables. This model is described in the paper under the conditions of the portfolio optimisation of logistics strategy implementation, the components of which are aimed at reducing the time of order delivery of supply chain.  The reliability of the model is confirmed by its practical approval within 2018-2020 in seven types of perishable goods supply chains, which involved companies, such as: FROZEN FRUT LLC, Handikap LLC, AIFT Ukraine LLC, Hroskhandel LLC, Olhopilske Motor Transport Enterprise LLC and Ukrainskyi Product PE.

Purpose of the study - is to analyze and take into account the peculiarities of the application of operating conditions and ITS tools in the formation of the integration platform of information support of the system \"Wheeled vehicles - Infrastructure\".  Method of the study - system analysis and logical organization of the solution of the problem of formation of the integration platform of information support of the system \"Wheeled vehicles - Infrastructure\" by means of ITS in the conditions of operation.  The system is based on the functions of monitoring, management of parameters of the technical condition and the law of motion of the vehicle and the functions of information storage and interaction with external information systems. The general view of the structural scheme of telematic support of the KTZ-I system is developed and presented, the physical architecture of which includes the structure of software, hardware of information and telecommunication technologies, peripheral equipment. The basic requirements to functioning, interaction and placement of element base of KTZ-I system as a part of physical architecture are defined. The variant of system interaction of functional elements of the KTZ-I system depending on levels of its realization is shown, and also the functionality of system for maintenance of its working capacity as a combination of the basic components is formed. The result and the most important feature of the functionality for the KTZ-I system is that in addition to the data defined by the design of the KTZ and the system of their operation in road transport infrastructure, logistic analysis of technological processes provides a full range of information for road transport.

Statistical analyses were applied to investigate possible micromorphological regional differences in their density. Five serially sectioned human TGs were prepared for CD34 and mast cell tryptase immunostaining. The following quantifications were performed in microscopic fields of three parts of the TG: microvessel density (MVD), mast cell density (MCD) and ganglionic cell count. The density of CD34-positive microvessels was not significantly different in any of the three observed parts of the TG. The distribution of neurons showed no significant statistical difference in three parts of the TG. There was no difference in the density of tryptase-positive mast cells within the TG, but there was an abundant presence of mast cells in the periganglionic dural and subdural tissues, a finding hitherto not reported. We can say that there is a homogenous vascular pattern within the TG which excludes local predominance in pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia. Second, and more important, the finding of peri-trigeminal mast cells indicates their important role in migraine pain and confirms their degranulation as the main therapeutic goal for this condition.</jats:p>"

As a result, the expectation is that the primary supply of LIB materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and nickel) will be insufficient to satisfy the demand in the next five years, creating a significant supply risk. Value recovery from spent LIBs could effectively increase the critical materials supply, which will become increasingly important as the number of spent LIBs grows. This paper reviews recent studies on developing novel technologies for value recovery from spent LIBs. The existing literature focused on hydrometallurgical-, pyrometallurgical-, and direct recycling, and their advantages and disadvantages are evaluated in this paper. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment have quantified the economic and environmental benefits of LIB reuse over recycling, highlighting the research gap in LIB reuse technologies. The study also revealed challenges associated with changing battery chemistry toward less valuable metals in LIB manufacturing (e.g., replacing cobalt with nickel). More specifically, direct recycling may be impractical due to rapid technology change, and the economic and environmental incentives for recycling spent LIBs will decrease. As LIB collection constitutes a major cost, optimizing the reverse logistics supply chain is essential for maximizing the economic and environmental benefits of LIB recovery. Policies that promote LIB recovery are reviewed with a focus on Europe and the United States. Policy gaps are identified and a plan for sustainable LIB life cycle management is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of methodological techniques for choosing the route of cargo delivery during intermodal traffic of containerized cargo based on construction of the network schedule for transportation in supply chains is considered. The basis of the network schedule, each of the paths of which corresponds to certain ways of cargo delivery by different modes of transport and their combinations, is the sequential summation of work from the initial event of formation of the consignment to the final event - its delivery to the final consumer. Each work allows you to take into account two important indicators corresponding to the time and cost of its execution, and the full path allows you to determine the present cost of cargo transportation and the lost benefit in the delivery process associated with the duration of the cargo in transit. This algorithm is demonstrated by the example of the transportation of house-hold appliances by different modes of transport on the Shanghai - Moscow route. As a generalizing determinant of the choice of the priority direction of transportation, a summary indicator is used, minimizing time, cost and present value under conditions of uncertainty, taking into account the criteria of Laplace, Wald, Savage and Hurwitz. The presented algorithm serves as a tool that allows decision makers, participants in the transportation process and other concerned parties (owners of infrastructure and rolling stock, freight forwarding and operator companies, cargo owners) to reliably assess the effectiveness of transportation options in supply chains and adequately respond to possible shifts in changing conditions throughout the period of fulfillment of contractual obligations.</jats:p>"

Lockdown was imposed in Palestine that is why it was very hard to maintain food supply chain from forms to end-users. Pandemic disturb every economy but developing economies like Palestine was more vulnerable. Although, Palestine authorities did their best by adopting best economic practices still various indicators impact the food supply chain. The aim of this article is empirically find out the impact of economic indicators on food supply chain. This is quantitative study and the questionnaire was adopted from well reputed studies. The data was collected by convenience sampling and analysed by structuring equation modelling through Smart PLS. The finding of this study revealed that inflation rate is negatively effecting the performance of food supply chain although economic indicators are not significant impacting. This study has unique findings it has been found that HDI is positively and significantly effecting food supply chain and HDI is also positively and significantly effecting the GDP but GDP is also positively impacting food supply chain but not significantly. This may be because of emerging country that heavily rely on external support and has less industrialization. This study help manages to understand that inflation is very bad for food supply chain so they must take care of inflation rate while decision making. This study help government to take necessary measures regarding interest rate and inflation rates. Next study can be conducted other parameters of economic indicators and industry to generalize the findings.</jats:p>"

As revealed by accident investigation statistics, both flawed organizational behavior and inadequate downstream resident risk awareness have affected the safety risk of reservoir dams. Multiple information transferring mode and dynamic processes perform with the characteristics of social-technical systems. Based on the system dynamics approach, this study proposed a risk causation model aiming for factor interactions involving organizational, human, and technical system levels. The derived simulation model represented the historical risk evolution process of Gouhou reservoir in China and the rationality of the proposed model was verified. To further improve the efficiency of the organizational response and monitor real-time dam safety, a software tool called Dam Emergency Response Aids (DERA) was constructed to evaluate the potential safety benefits of risk control measures, and to overcome the defects of static emergency plans. By integrating relevant professional modules and data, the mobile application (APP) has been applied on the Jinniu Mountain reservoir dam in Nanjing of China and helped to maintain its excellent safety operation until now. It shows that the risk dynamics model proposed can improve the abilities of dam operating management organization for more effective responses under emergency circumstances.</jats:p>",

This study shows that retailer’s optimal order quantity increases with MOQ level and decreases with rebate rate, while supplier’s optimal wholesale price shows an opposite tendency. Compared to the traditional bank financing model (Model T), the model N with an appropriate rebate contract will result in a larger order quantity of retailer. Furthermore, model N would benefit the entire supply chain and a Pareto zone of MOQ (or rebate rate) exists, in which, model N outperforms model T for each player. The numerical experiments are performed to illustrate that with increasing the marginal production cost of supplier, the MOQ level is decreasing while rebate rate is increasing in the Pareto zone.</jats:p>"

However, many past studies on sustainable supply chain strategies emphasized either classification schemes or various coordination mechanisms, and few of them have focused on an integrated framework for sustainable supply chains. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a strategic framework for the sustainable supply chain management. The study is based on the abductive reasoning process through literature review to establish a strategic framework which is ranked through grey relational analysis (GRA). The weighted data of various strategies collected from the elite interview prove to be comprehensive and evaluable, so it can create values for supply chain members in practice. The results further suggest that each sustainable supply chain in different fields can select the best combination of strategies through GRA to constantly facilitate performance of sustainability. The main contribution is the submission of a strategic framework which makes up the insufficiency of past research papers lacking an integrated strategic framework. At the same time, the proposed strategic framework has also been illustrated through a case study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/abstract&gt;</jats:p>"

The procedure is as follows: determining specific operational consumption of district water for hot wa-ter supply with manual direct water intake when the outside temperature changes; developing the re-quired mode of closed hot-water supply; analysis of the practically possible mode of manual consump-tion in the heat supply system; determining the operational specific consumption of hot-water supply in manual hot water systems with direct water intake, including the characteristics of the heat supply source; calculating the flow rate of direct water for water circulation in manual hot water supply sys-tems; analysing the hydraulic regime before and after the transition to a closed circuit; offering recom-mendations. The method for assessing the consequences associated with the transition to a closed-circuit hot-water supply in district heating systems showed that the amount of make-up water consump-tion from a heat source is affected by a change in the actual consumption of hot-water supply and the temperature of cold and hot water. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that there is no technical possibility of an overall transition to a closed circuit. To prepare technical reports and perfor-mance charts, it is recommended to use the actual values of heat consumption for the hydraulic calcu-lations; to use the metered values and consider a significant number of manual hot-water supply sys-tems in calculating the hot-water supply consumption standard; to include the loss of heat energy on heating towel rails, domestic losses of building services systems under a four-pipe heat supply system in the distribution pricing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In the insulation system of power equipment, the partial discharge (PD) of short period does not cause the insulation to produce the penetrating breakdown, however the long-term PD of is one of the important causes of local deterioration, and even breakdown in dielectric. Therefore, it is very important to study the location of PD source and the calibration of discharge intensity. To achieve this, in this paper we take the needle-plate discharge model for example and go through the following steps respectively. Firstly, combined with the positive correlation between the ultrasonic signal and the apparent discharge magnitude in the process of PD, the ultrasonic method to detect partial discharge can be implemented. Then, based on the principle of time difference of arrival method (TDOAM), the accuracy of location is analyzed by using quantum genetic algorithm (QGA), genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing algorithm (SAA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and generalized cross correlation method (GCC), respectively. And thus, starting from the study of the attenuation effect of sound pressure caused by the propagation loss, reflection and refraction of acoustic wave, the calibration model of PD intensity is established for the first time after determining the location of PD source with high precision. Some important findings are extracted from simulations and experimental results. First, the localization algorithm of PD source with high precision is observed. The localization of PD source by means of QGA is the most accurate, with maximum deviation of (0.27 ± 0.13) cm. Comparing with GA, SAA, PSO and GCC, the accuracy of location is improved by 33.57%, 41.51%, 32.11% and 87.26%, respectively. Second, due to the attenuation effect of sound pressure, when the measured voltage amplitude of ultrasonic signal is the same, the apparent discharge magnitude of PD source gradually increases with the test distance increasing. When the test distance is 37.80 cm, the apparent discharge magnitude of PD source is 633.83 pC, which increases by 28.51% compared with 7.00 cm. Moreover, simulation results and measurement results are compared with each other and they are well consistent. The discharge curve almost coincides with the calibration fitting curve of PD source when the test distance is 7.00 cm. Finally, it is concluded that the discharge intensity calibration model of PD source is accurate, which is of great significance in evaluating the extent of insulation damage.</jats:p>"

More intensive milking of cows in the experimental group in the new calving period had a positive effect on the tendency to increase milk yield of standard (4%) fat content and the yield of milk fat in general for 305 days of lactation by 7,4% (p&gt;0,05), compared with control. Calculations of economic efficiency have shown that the use of fractionated fat in the amount of 300 g in the ration of high-yielding cows during the milking period from 10,7 to 11,0 MJ/kg can reduce the cost of 1 quintal of milk of base fat content (3,4%) produced by cows from the experimental group for the first 120 days of lactation by 43,6 rubles. or by 1.9% while receiving additional profit from its sale in comparison with the control in the amount of 3502,5 rubles. for 1 head. Biochemical studies of the blood of cows in the experimental groups, carried out on the 120th day of lactation, revealed a tendency for a more intense course of protein and lipid metabolism in the body of cows was revealed, who received a diet with an increased to 11,0 MJ/kg level of CME in dry matter of the diet, due to the use of protected vegetable fat in an amount of 300 g.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: сurrently, the control of the technical condition of complex technical systems, such as the secondary power supply system of field communication facilities, is a long and non-automated process that is carried out by operators directly at the control facilities themselves. This circumstance has a negative impact on the timely detection of failures of the controlled object. Also, a very negative factor is the complete absence of any forecast of the technical condition of the control object, which leads to sudden disconnections of the secondary power supply system of field communication facilities, and, accordingly, a break in communication. The combination of these factors has an extremely negative effect both on the stable operation of the communication system as a whole, and on the coefficient of serviceable operation of the communication direction, in particular. The purpose of the work is to develop methods for monitoring and predicting the technical condition of the secondary power supply system of field communication facilities. Methods used: the application of the neural network approach allows you to achieve very accurate results and get high performance systems in real time. The novelty of the work is to increase the accuracy and speed of control, the ability to predict the technical condition, the integration of the secondary power supply system into the information environment of the field communication object by using neural network technologies. Result: the application of the neural network approach allows you to predict the technical condition, as well as more accurately classify the technical condition of the control object. Also, it becomes possible to centralize control, which, in turn, reduces the control time. Practical significance: the results of the work can be used in the process of monitoring and predicting the technical condition of complex technical systems, which will significantly reduce the number of accidents.</jats:p>"

Research suggests that IT-enabled supply chain information integration (IT-SCII) helps firms collaborate with suppliers and clients in broad business activities, operate in a unique context, and overcome salient challenges in BOP markets. Anecdotal evidence and research suggest that foreign and domestic firms have differing advantages: While foreign firms have considerable global experience, domestic firms have substantial local market knowledge. We draw on the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework to theorize that domestic and foreign firms leverage IT-SCII differently because of their differing ownership-based advantages in BOP markets. We hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on client business collaboration and the influence of client business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for domestic firms than for foreign firms. Conversely, we hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on supplier business collaboration and the influence of supplier business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for foreign firms than for domestic firms. We test our hypotheses in the automotive parts manufacturing BOP market comprising foreign and domestic firms in India. Partial least squares and econometric analyses of 172 firms reveal broad support for our hypotheses. By incorporating the OLI framework into IT-enabled supply chain literature, our study contributes to theory and practice by highlighting that IT-SCII has differing implications for foreign and domestic firms in BOP markets.</jats:p>"

The rating of gas exchange, biomass flow and structural characteristics were performed in dry periods and dry/rainy season, under the water supply of 30; 60; 90 and 120% of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement 4x2 (water supply and grass). The experiment was conducted in pots with capacity for 7.5 dm³, using as substrate layer of 0-0.2 m soil. There was no effect (P &lt; 0.05) between the gas exchange in the dry period, having the largest growing parameters of irrigation schemes. In the transition period of dry/rainy, we observed a reversal behavior in relation to the dry period, showing a rapid recovery of grasses under the minor water supply. It was observed quadratic behavior to concentrations of CO2 in the leaf mesophilic (Ci) with maximum point to the BRS Massai grass and minimum point to the BRS Tamani grass, where the major and minor Ci were 119 and 48 ppm in the water supply of 107 and 35% of ETo, respectively. In relation to the biomass flow, the BRS Tamani grass presented greater stem elongation rate and leaf senescence rate in relation to BRS Massai in both periods assessed. In the dry period, we observed a higher biomass production of green leaf blades in the BRS Tamani grass, while in the transition dry/rainy season, the results for this variable were similar, and at the same time that observed higher accumulation of green culm biomass to the BRS Tamani grass, which certainly affected its structure. It is concluded that the application of a minimum daily water supply of 30% of ETo allows the maintenance of BRS Massai and BRS Tamani grasses without incurring the death of tillers and reduction of regrowth vigor, whereas the water supply of 90% of ETo favors the morphophysiological characteristics, especially of BRS Tamani grass.</jats:p>"

To date the advantages of such an extensively multinucleated cellular structure in substance exchange remains poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that differentiation of trophoblasts toward syncytium triggers an endocytosis strategy, macropinocytosis, to uptake large extracellular molecules. The unique uptake machinery is strikingly boosted via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling under amino acid shortage conditions, which is essential for fetal survival.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>NATO project G 5233 “Portable energy supply” was executed by 4 teams (Institute for Energy Technology, Norway and 3 Institutes of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). G5233 Project was focused on the development of hydrogen fueled portable energy supply systems integrating hydrogen generation and storage units based on use of light metals, metal and complex hydride materials and portable fuel cells. The weight efficient energy supply device was developed by using these selected materials and performance-optimised NaBH4 complex hydride. Besides, various new relevant units of equipment for the samples preparation and characterization were ordered and accommodated in the participants labs and the program of training of young scientists at IFE, Norway was accomplished. Different types of materials for hydrogen generation were synthesized and characterized (activated aluminium alloys, Mg-Al alloys, MgH2 and their composites, NaBH4 with catalytic additives). The challenging objective of reaching a completeness of the hydrolysis of MgH2 was achieved; the reaction conditions were optimized and the particular focus applications integrating efficient hydrogen generation systems were identified. The mechanism and the kinetics model of the hydrolysis process of MgH2 in water solutions have been proposed which successfully describe the experimental data. In parallel with the hydrolysis reaction resulting in hydrogen generation and formation of Mg(OH)2 , the process involves passivation of the MgH2 surface by the formed Mg(OH)2 precipitate followed by its re-passivation with the rate constants of these processes being established. Increase of the concentration of MgCl2 leads to just a minor increase in the rate constant of the interaction of MgH2 with water but leads to a sharp increase of the rate constant of the repassivation of MgH2 surface. To achieve efficient hydrolysis of NaBH4 , different types of catalysts (heterogeneous on the basis of Pt and \"homogeneous\" - salts of Ni+2 and Co+2) were studied and optimized. Several systems were selected as candidates to provide the required hydrogen flow to operate a 30 W fuel cell over a given time exceeding 1 hour, based on a use of inexpensive and affordable hydrogen-containing materials and catalytic additives. 3 individual hydrolysis workstations (1 in Norway and 2 in Ukraine) were built, tested and optimized. The plan of the work to reach the objectives of the Project G5233 “Portable energy supply” is completely accomplished, all the milestones are successfully fulfilled and the overall goal of the Project is reached.</jats:p>"

In particular, it explains how assuring confidence in measurement may be used to accelerate economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic including in emerging sectors such as the digital economy. Recommendations are made for providing near term support for national economic recovery whilst also demonstrating the advantages of sustained development of the measurement infrastructure in the medium-term to maximize the potential of future innovative and disruptive technologies. These recommendations, whilst focused on consideration of the UK, should apply globally.  References:  [1] G. Tassey, \"Underinvestment in public good technologies,\" J Technol.

The verification is done by calibrating the specified parameters and comparing with the requirements stated in the standard. The parameters that should be calibrated are the ratios of the residual voltages to the rated voltage, the accuracy of the phase angle at switching, and the rise time, fall time, overshoot and undershoot of the switching waveform. A specially built adapter is used to convert the high voltage output waveforms of the generators to lower level signals to be acquired by a digital oscilloscope. The other circuits required for the testing are also provided. In addition, the paper discusses the uncertainty evaluations for the measured parameters.  References:  [1] T. Williams, and K.

In order to validate the photometric method, several micropipettes of different capacities from 0.1 µL to 1000 µL were calibrated using both methods (gravimetric and photometric) in two different laboratories, IPQ (Portuguese Institute for Quality) and Artel. These tests were performed by six different operators. The uncertainty for both methods was determined and it was verified that the uncertainty component that has a higher contribution to the final uncertainty budget depends on the volume delivered. In the photometric method for small volumes, the repeatability of the pipette is the largest uncertainty component, but for volumes, larger than 100 µL, the photometric instrument is the most significant source of uncertainty. Based on all the results obtained with this study, one may consider the photometric method validated.  References:  [1] ISO 8655-1/2/6/7, Piston-operated volumetric apparatus, 2002.

Greeff  NCSLI Measure | Vol. 13 No. 1 (2021) | doi.org/10.51843/measure.13.1.5 Publisher: NCSL International | Published February 2021 | Pages 46-56   Abstract: The additive manufacturing of products promises exciting possibilities. Measurement methodologies, which measure an in-process dataset of these products and interpret the results, are essential. However, before developing such a level of quality assurance several in-process measurands must be realized. One of these is the material flow rate, or rate of adding material during the additive manufacturing process. Yet, measuring this rate directly in material extrusion additive manufacturing presents challenges. This work presents two indirect methods to estimate the volumetric flow rate at the liquefier exit in material extrusion, specifically in Fused Deposition Modeling or Fused Filament Fabrication. The methods are cost effective and may be applied in future sensor integration. The first method is an optical filament feed rate and width measurement and the second is based on the liquefier pressure. Both are used to indirectly estimate the volumetric flow rate. The work also includes a description of linking the G-code command to the final print result, which may be used to create a per extrusion command model of the part.  References:  [1] T. Wohlers, I.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facilitating the uptake of established methodologies for risk-based decision-making in product conformity assessment taking into account measurement uncertainty by providing dedicated software is the aim of the European project EMPIR CASoft(2018–2020), involving the National Measurement Institutes from France, Sweden and the UK, and industrial partner Trescal (FR) as primary supporter. The freely available software helps end-users perform the required risk calculations in accordance with current practice and regulations and extends that current practice to include bivariate cases. The software is also aimed at supporting testing and calibration laboratories in the application of the latest version of the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standard, which requires that“…the laboratory shall document the decision rule employed, taking into account the level of risk […] associated with the decision rule and apply the decision rule.” Initial experiences following launch of the new software in Spring 2020 are reported.</jats:p>",
