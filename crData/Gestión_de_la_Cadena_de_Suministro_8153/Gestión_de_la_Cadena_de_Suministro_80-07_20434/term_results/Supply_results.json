Like other nations in the Third World, Tanzania offers the prospect of a rapidly expanding market for the multinational pharmaceutical industry. However, this market has been to a large extent developed by the intense promotional activities of the drug companies themselves. In addition to normal marketing methods, these companies indulge in techniques which would be neither acceptable nor legal in developed countries. As a result, expensive proprietary drugs are overpurchased and overprescribed, mainly in the large urban hospitals, with consequent deprivation of other health care facilities, particularly those for the rural peasants who form the majority of the population. The activities of the multinational pharmaceutical companies in the Third World are therefore an important component in the continuing underdevelopment of health in these nations. </jats:p>",

Only limited information is available. The objective of this research was to determine the relation between plant P status and the portion of the roots supplied with P on plant P influx and root growth and morphology. Two solution culture experiments were conducted in controlled climate facilities. Phosphorus influx was measured on 18‐day‐old corn plants that had been starved for P for 1 to 6 days. Split‐root experiments were used to measure the effect of P distribution on root growth and P uptake. Starving the plant for P reduced P concentration in the shoot and root and this resulted in a 55% increase in the maximum P influx, Imax. Supplying P to only part of the root system also resulted in a lower plant P concentration and higher Imax by the roots in P solution. When less than 50% of the roots were supplied with P, root growth rate in the P solution was 25% greater than in the minus P solution. Phosphorus uptake was correlated with root surface exposed to P (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.88).</jats:p>",

An attempt was made to determine whether this improvement in seed set was due to improvement in plant nutrition or to NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> poising the soil E<jats:sub>h</jats:sub> above that at which phytotoxic ethylene is produced. Two pot experiments were carried out in a controlled environment chamber at diurnal temperatures 27/12 °C and slightly above field capacity. NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N or NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N with N-Serve <jats:sup>®</jats:sup> were applied to Manitou wheat at rates of 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N/ha in the first experiment, and to Manitou wheat and Conquest barley at rates of 23, 45, 90, 180 and 360 kg N/ha in the second. N-Serve successfully maintained the nitrogen in the NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> form throughout the experiment. In both experiments, the seed set of the primary and secondary florets of wheat was directly proportional to the NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N rate. Wheat plants fed NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N exhibited significantly higher seed set than the NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N-fed plants at the low nitrogen rates. Seed set of lateral spikelets of barley was unaffected by rate, but the NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N-fed plants tended to produce slightly higher seed set. Ethylene was not detected in any of the soils. Since NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-N corrected the seed set problem even at low levels of nitrogen, it was concluded that poor nitrogen nutrition and not the production of soil ethylene was responsible for poor seed set of wheat. </jats:p>",

A mathematical programming model is developed to determine the optimal trade-off between the benefits of land-use development and those of solar-energy utilization. The measure of this trade-off is the extent to which access to sunlight should be guaranteed to prospective solar-energy users. The methodology is illustrated by numerical applications of a simplified model. </jats:p>",

Nitrogen, either supplied as nitrate or as ammonium, reduced the cavity formation by the roots. This reduction was most apparent at nitrate concentrations above 2 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>. Cavities were increasingly formed when the nitrate concentration was decreased and they reached their largest dimensions in roots growing in water. Thus, inadequate availability of nitrogen leads, under acrated conditions, to deterioration of cortex cells and cavity formation in the maize roots. It is suggested that cavity formation in these roots is connected with reduced nitrogen assimilation.</jats:p>",

During this period, massive international efforts will be made to accelerate the provision of domestic water supply and sanitation facilities for the rural population of developing countries. Certain concepts and approaches are being developed and promoted as guiding themes that will help to steer and coordinate the activities of the Decade. Among them are ‘appropriate technology’ ‘community participation’ and a ‘village level’ or ‘user-choice’ approach. The validity and importance of these concepts are discussed. It is concluded that these concepts are often applied in an over-simplified manner and that they divert attention away from the fundamental political and administrative realities that primarily determine the success or failure of rural water and sanitation programmes.</jats:p>",
