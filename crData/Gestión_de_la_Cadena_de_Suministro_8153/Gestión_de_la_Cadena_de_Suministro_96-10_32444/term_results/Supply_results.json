It points out that the obstacle to a successful exploitation of coalbed methane is the low permeability of the coal seams. Further, the stress constraint of the seal structure with gas saturated fractures is the primary cause of the low permeability of the coal seams in China. The critical depth that is affected by this cause, based on the existing coalbed exploration technology, is calculated in this paper.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction - Characteristics of Porous Structures of Coal Seams</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Coal rocks are organic rocks with cleats and pores being very mature. Most coal matrix contains very fine and interconnected micropores with pore diameters in the order of less than 100 angstroms. The porosity of the micropores is about 3 to 5%, and the permeability is in the range of microDarcy. Coal seams have very mature cleats that can be classified in two types. One type is the primary cleats, the other type is the secondary cleats. The primary cleats are formed as a result of volumetric shrinkage of carbogel during the carbonization process under temperature and pressure. Therefore, the distribution density of the primary cleats is related to the rank of the coal as shown in Fig. 1(c). The primary cleat systems usually consist of two orthogonal cleats. The dominant cleats are referred to as the face cleats.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Compared to the other cleats, called butt cleats, the face cleats have better interconnection such that the cleat porosity is 2% to 3%, and the permeability is in the milli-Darcy range. Conceptually, we can represent the face cleats by a dual-porosity system as shown in Fig. 1(b).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The secondary cleat system is formed by the tectonic setting and in-place stress changes. The density of distribution and the geometric configuration of the secondary cleats depend on the structural movement and the direction of the primary stress. Sometimes the coal matrix may contain middle to large size pores that may also contribute to the permeability. These pores are classified into five types according to their diameters. Each type of pores has a different effect on the diffusion and osmosis of methane as listed in Table 1. Furthermore, based on the proportion of pore types the structure of coal seams is divided into three categories: open, transition, and closure (Fig. 2).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The open coal seam contains many large and mid pores. These pores provide a good osmotic path for the methane desorbed from micropores and transition pores and can be drained easily. Due to the lack of large and mid pores in closure seams, it is difficult for the methane to be drained since it must pass through a long and narrow path in order to diffuse and migrate into the fractures. Methane from transition seams is less accessible than that from the closure seams but not as easy to drain as from the open seams. Measured porosity distribution results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the cleat system is the main contribution to the permeability. The micropores are rarely permeable.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>With large amount of micropores and cleats, coal rocks have huge specific surface areas in their seams. The internal surface area of one gram of coal may reach 100 to 400 m2. Methane in coals is either absorbed on the coal surfaces, or as free methane molecules in fractures and large pore spaces (some are dissolved in ground water stored in the coal structures). About 80% to 90% of the methane is absorbed onto the huge internal surfaces of the coal. The adsorption and desorption of methane molecules equilibrate under certain pressure and temperature.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 295</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Although these wells produced high volumes of clear water on initial completion, during field start-up most wells produced poor quality water, and only at much reduced rates. A stimulation program to restore the productivity of water supply wells was initiated. The program included injection of 15 wt% HCl along with a friction reducer and a corrosion inhibitor. Samples of all injected and produced fluids were collected to analyze the solid particles present in the samples, and measure the concentration of key ions in the acid returns. The results of these analyses have been used to determine the mechanism by which damage to the wells occurred.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper we present conclusive evidence, drawn from analyses of the returned acid cleaning fluids, which indicates that biomass and microbial corrosion products, produced by active sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) populations during shut-in periods, were responsible for much of the damage experienced by these wells. The investigation has highlighted an absolute requirement for an effective downhole SRB control program to prevent subsequent damage to water supply wells which have been restored by the cleaning program.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Based on the results of this investigation, an optimized cleaning procedure which will restore water productivity, and at the same time will minimize casing corrosion, has been developed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of essential services including water and sanitation in many megacities of the economically developing countries of Asia cannot keep pace with their rapidly growing population and accompanying urban and industrial development. The inadequate water supply and poor sanitation services lead to contamination of their water supply through the input of sewage water into groundwater. This paper examines the problem of contamination of water supply in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan with a population of over 12 million and growing at 6 percent per annum. The paper presents the data on water quality from various sources, mainly municipal water supply, vendors and well water; the three major sources of water for domestic use in Karachi. Except municipal water from some areas and during certain periods, water from most other sources contains coliform bacteria, and in many cases faecal coliform, in amounts several magnitudes higher than any standards permit. Many samples have also been found to contain heavy metals including chromium, lead, nickel and arsenic in amounts excessive of permitted standards. The probable sources of contaminants for the various types of water (piped, vendors, wells) indicate that groundwater may be the main contributor. The very source of this groundwater is predominantly from sewage. The paper also evaluates the solutions that are being practised, proposed or may be feasible, as well as those that are evolving.</jats:p>",

The energy requirement of the brain is 20–30% of the whole organism at rest, although its weight is only 2%. The energy stores in the brain are extremely small when compared with the high rate of glucose utilisation: thus the brain is reliant on a continuous glucose supply. Only about 30% of glucose is required for direct energy production; much of the remainder is used for the synthesis of amino acids, peptides, lipids and nucleic acids (Siebert, Gessner &amp; Klasser, 1986). Thus a source of glucose is essential for the synthesis of physiologically active amines such as serotonin, noradrenaline and acetylcholine. Although it is well accepted that hypoglycaemia can result in the disruption of cognitive functioning, this is a rare phenomenon and it has usually been assumed that levels of blood glucose, within the normal range, do not influence intellectual functioning. This assumption is discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",

Synchronization between food supply and reproduction was expected to be positively related to fitness components. We measured deviation from maximum food supply using a parameter that we called “time‐lag”, which quantifies the degree of synchronization between the date of maximum food requirements by the nestlings and the date of maximum caterpillar supply in the habitat. This parameter was expected to be related to reproductive success as measured by the number and body‐condition of fledglings. The predictions were that time‐lag should be negatively correlated with the proportion of nestlings raised to fledging and the size of the fledglings. These predictions have been tested in different types of habitat. The results demonstrate that caterpillar supply during a critical nestling period can have a strong influence on fitness components. As predicted, synchronization with caterpillar supply is positively related to the number and body size of fledglings. Since there is large between‐habitat variation in the timing of food supply, the key issue seems to be the adjustment to local patterns of food availability.</jats:p>",

This may reflect the insufficient supply of dietary glycine. In this randomized study, the influence of a glycine‐rich diet on whole body protein turnover rates in eight male preterm infants (29‐32 weeks, 1,200‐2,540 g birthweight) using the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N‐tracer technique on days 21 and 28 of life was investigated to evaluate the necessity of supplementing preterm infant formulas with proteins rich in glycine. Before and during the study, the infants were alternately fed with a commercial available preterm infant formula (I, 2% protein, 40 mg glycine/dl) and a variety of this formulation with glycine‐rich proteins (II, 2% protein, 130 mg glycine/dl). The protein‐turnover rates were computed after <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N‐single‐pulse labeling with the help of the three‐compartment model (TCM) and the urinary ammonia end‐product method (AEPM). The tracer used was [<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N]glycine (dosage: 2 mg <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N/kg). For the determination of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N‐excess‐excretion kinetics, fractionated urine specimens were collected over a 36‐h period. The protein‐turnover rate calculated by TCM was 8.8 ± 1.6 g/kg/day (formula I) and 7.7 ± 2.0 g/kg/day (formula II); using AEPM, the rate was 8.7 ± 2.5 g/kg/day and 7.5 ± 1.5 g/kg/day, respectively. We conclude that the presaturation of the precursor pool by an adequate glycine intake minimizes drawbacks that may arise when using [<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N]‐glycine as a tracer in preterm infants, and a protein concentration of 2%, as in formula I, and consequently, a 170% glycine content when compared with the same human milk volume, meets the glycine requirement.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The potential exists for improving the system efficiency and reliability while reducing the on-line operational manning requirements. To this end the paper presents modelling and simulation studies of the current semi-manual and the proposed fully automatic pressure control schemes for the Zelenograd water supply system. Dynamic operational simulations are an essential feature of the project. However, it was necessary to enhance the network hydraulic simulator, to include pressure feedback controls, in order to produce acceptable results. Analyses of the operational requirements and the simulation results provide a basis for the design of an improved controller using an expert system approach. A major part of the paper covers the methods in use for obtaining an adequate set of control rules for the Zelenograd system. Extended time period operational simulations are used to verify the rules and to compare the results with those of existing practice. There are expectations of immediate benefits in terms of operating economies. Typically these will arise from reductions in water leakage, electricity charges and control manpower. Work is now proceeding on actual implementation using a combination of expert system and fuzzy logic methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A basic requirement of all photosynthetic organisms is a balance between overall energy supply through temperature‐independent photochemical reactions and energy consumption through the temperature‐dependent biochemical reactions of photosynthetic electron transport and contiguous metabolic pathways. Since the turnover of photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers is a limiting step in the conversion of light energy into ATP and NADPH, any energy imbalance may be sensed through modulation of the redox state of PSII. This can be estimated in vivo by chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> fluorescence as changes in the redox state of PSII, or photosystem II excitation pressure, which reflects changes in the redox poise of intersystem electron transport carriers. Through comparisons of photosynthetic adjustment, we show that growth at low temperature mimics growth at high light. We conclude that terrestrial plants, green algae and cyanobacteria do not respond to changes in growth temperature or growth irradiance per se, but rather, respond to changes in the redox state of intersystem electron transport as reflected by changes in PSII excitation pressure, We suggest that this chloroplastic redox sensing mechanism may be an important component for sensing abiotic stresses in general. Thus, in addition to its role in energy transduction, the chloroplast may also be considered a primary sensor of environmental change through a redox sensing/signalling mechanism that acts synergistically with other signal transduction pathways to elicit the appropriate molecular and physiological responses.</jats:p>",

The phytotron was programmed to recreate an artificial climate similar to that at a high elevation site in the Inner Bavarian forest, and trees were grown in 40 1 containers of soil (pH 3.5) fertilized to achieve two levels of potassium nutrition; well fertilized and K‐deficient. Foliar nutrient analyses performed at the beginning of the exposure indicated that the fertilization programmes achieved their goal without significantly altering the levels of other nutrients or the soil pH. At the beginning of the fumigation, foliar K concentrations were 7–9 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>d. wt for well fertilized trees and 4–5 <jats:italic>mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup></jats:italic> d. wt for trees receiving no supplemental K. Over the course of the season, differences between K treatments intensified so that by the end of the experiment there was a five to sixfold difference between foliar K concentrations. This was associated with slight, but significant (P &lt; 0.05), decreases in S and Zn (and of Cu in the 1989 needle year age class) and higher levels of C, N and Mg in K‐deficient trees. Foliar N concentrations were low for all trees (9–15 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>needle d. wt) but were similar to levels found in the field.</jats:p><jats:p>Elevated O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> was found to decrease significantly the C (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) and N (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) content of both current‐year (1989) and previous‐year (1988) needles independent of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration, but apart from some minor changes in the concentrations of Cu and Mn in the current‐year needles no other effects of the pollutant on plant nutrient status were found. In contrast, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment resulted in significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) lower concentrations of K and P (effects on Mg were also on the borderlines of statistical significance) in current‐year needles, but there was no influence on the nutrient composition of the previous‐year needles (although effects on N were on the borderlines of statistical significance). CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment also increased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) the C:N ratio of both current‐year and previous‐year needles. One factor contributing to the decline in foliar K at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> appeared to be a marked increase (25–30%) in the rate at which cations were leached from the canopy by repeated simulated acid mist (pH 4.0) events, and this effect occurred independently of the O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> concentration. The information presented will aid the interpretation of parallel studies examining the effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and/or O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on seasonal changes in photosynthesis, non‐structural carbohydrate content, antioxidants, tree growth and water use efficiency, and sheds further light on the growing scepticism concerning the role of O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> in the development of Mg and K‐deficiency symptoms characteristic of certain types of forest decline in central Europe.</jats:p>",
