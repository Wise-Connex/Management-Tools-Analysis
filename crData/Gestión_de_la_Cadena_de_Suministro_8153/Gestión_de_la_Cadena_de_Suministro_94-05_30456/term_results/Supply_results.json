Soils from these fields were analyzed for exchangeable K by ammonium acetate extraction, and for K release rate by a 7 day incubation procedure (1:10 soil:. 01 M CaCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at 25°). Soil K release rate was more highly correlated with tissue K at midseason than was exchangeable K. These soils were further examined for K fixation capacity.

Percent K fixation ranged from 0 to 82%.

Acclimation of leaves and upper stems prior to the August test, in most cases, was not stimulated by reduced water content, while the response of lower and middle stems was cultivar and location specific. The lower water content treatment after August 30 generally increased freeze tolerance of all plant parts regardless of the previous watering regime. The higher water content treatment after August 30 either prevented or delayed acclimation.</jats:p>",

Marigold `Discovery Orange' was grown for six weeks from sowing in a hydroponic system. Hoagland's all nitrate solution was used at 0.25X for the first three weeks and 0.5X for the final three weeks. P was applied continuously in the control and was eliminated for the first one or three weeks in the two stress treatments. Weekly mot and shoot dry weights indicated: a.) P stress caused an increase in root/shoot ratio with roots larger than in the control plants and b.) restoration of P after a P stress resulted in a rapid shift of root/shoot ratio back to the control level with final root and shoot weights less than in the control plants. A continuous marginal P stress or a stress near the end of seedling production is suggested. Tomato `Marglobe' was grown for five weeks and impatiens `Super Elfin White' for six weeks in a 3 sphagnum peat moss: 1 perlite substrate in 288 cell plug trays.

Some fraction of this gap is averted, depending on the propensity to avert unwanted births, D. Although none of these components is observed directly, we can estimate each indirectly under strong assumptions. Decline in N*/s accounts for twice as much of the decline in fertility as does an increase in D. Natural fertility rose during the period. Unwanted births increased slightly, despite a tripling of births averted. The most important causes of decline in N* were increases in female labor supply, real income, and health workers. A rising level of education is the most important cause of increasing propensity to avert births. Demand-side changes were important causes of the transition, but changes in readiness to contracept also were important, as was the interaction of the two.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Steady‐state two‐ and three‐dimensional ground‐water‐flow models coupled with particle tracking (fluid‐particle pathline analysis) have been evaluated to determine their relative effectiveness in delineating contributing areas and particle traveltimes to public‐supply wells in two contrasting stratified‐drift aquifers of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Several contributing areas delineated by the three‐dimensional pathline analysis do not conform to simple ellipsoidal shapes that are typically delineated by use of two‐dimensional analytical and numerical modeling techniques. They also include discontinuous areas of the water table and do not surround the supply wells. Because two‐dimensional area! models do not account for vertical flow, they cannot adequately represent many of the hydrogeologic and well‐design variables that complicate the delineation of contributing areas in three‐dimensional flow systems on Cape Cod, including the presence and continuity of discrete zones of low hydraulic conductivity, large anisotropic ratios of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity, partially penetrating supply wells, shallow streams and lakes, and low (less than about 0.1 million gallons per day) pumping rates.</jats:p><jats:p>Particle traveltimes calculated by the two‐dimensional models are longer than those calculated by the three‐dimensional models, and time‐related capture zones determined by the two‐dimensional models underpredict the size of the land area contributing water to simulated wells. It appears that the two‐dimensional models do not accurately represent shallow, partially penetrating wells, or heterogeneous and anisotropic sediments for the purposes of simulating contributing areas and traveltimes in complex ground‐water systems.</jats:p>",

The male population was split into two sets, both at pup stage (the most and the least swift and efficient of each group to overcome uncomfortable situations), and at adult stage (carriers and noncarriers of food in each group tested). Our results showed an important relation between these pup and adult behavioral profiles: the swiftest and most efficient individuals of a group at pup stage adopted more often a food carrier behavioral profile at adult stage. Assumptions about the predictive value of some behavioral features of a young rat in regard to its adult behavioral profile are discussed.© 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",
