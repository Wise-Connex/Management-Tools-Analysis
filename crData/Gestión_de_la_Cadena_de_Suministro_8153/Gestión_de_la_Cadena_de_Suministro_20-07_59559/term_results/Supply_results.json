      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Supply chain management (SCM) implementation in selected drought-stricken areas in Zimbabwe has been negatively influenced by the marginalisation of indigenous leaders and an intolerant political system.Objectives: This study examines the influence of culture and leadership attitudes, as well as the political, economic and legal framework, on the effectiveness of the humanitarian supply chain (HSC) during droughts in Zimbabwe. The effect of culture, leadership attitudes, and the political, economic and legal framework on HSC effectiveness in Zimbabwe has not been explored by researchers.Method: The study adopted a quantitative exploratory research design utilising the case study approach. The study sample consisted of 130 respondents comprising government and non-governmental organisation (NGO) officials whose primary responsibilities are drought disaster operations.Results: The study results revealed that the culture, leadership attitudes and political state did not positively influence the effectiveness of the HSC in Zimbabwe. In addition, the economic state and legal framework positively influenced the effectiveness of the HSC on drought management. Accordingly, the empirical results found that the existing legal framework positively influenced the effectiveness of the HSC. Furthermore, an association between educational background and work experience had an impact on the reduction of transport and warehouse costs, which are critical components of a humanitarian relief supply chain.Conclusion: This study is expected to significantly contribute to the crafting of effective HSC and intervention strategies. The study also adds to the body of knowledge in HSC and disaster management as there is a shortage of empirical data in this field of study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Supply chain management (SCM) was introduced as a remedy to irregularities of the past procurement models in public sector. Since its inception, literature has exposed a number of irregularities and deficiencies in the acquisition management processes within SCM in this sector.Objectives: This article explores a case study of KwaZulu-Natal to ascertain the current status of SCM in the aspect of acquisition of goods and services in relation to issues of good governance and human resource capital. It aims to determine the underlying factors that have given rise to the reported irregularities and deficiencies.Method: This article draws on quantitative data collected using a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, from ‘1’ strongly disagree to ‘5’ strongly agree. The study sample consisted of 129 participants. The data collected were analysed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences tool.Results: The findings of the study indicate that there is (1) a notable human resource deficiency, (2) inadequate knowledge regarding the processes employed in the acquisition of goods and services within SCM and (3) a lack of adequate training. The study also notes best practices such as (1) a high level of accountability, (2) conformity of relevant laws, (3) transparency, (4) responsiveness and (5) participation.Conclusion: This study rejects the current assumptions that the acquisition process of the SCM system is flawed, and rather confirms the forever growing assumptions related to human resources capacity, knowledge and skills deficiencies as possible root causes of the reported irregularities and deficiencies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Construction industry has a vital role in Indonesia’s economic growth. Infrastructure projects have been the priorities in the past five years consistent with RPJMN (National Medium Term Development Plan). It’s evident in the percentage of contribution of the construction industry, i.e. 10.2%, to Gross Domestic Product (PDB) and 6.34 million employments (5.3% national labors). However, it isn’t followed by efficiency of the construction industry. Increased cost, implementation, delay, conflict and dispute are some problems which arise from fragmentation and causes the construction industry to be known as an inefficient industry. A possible approach to solve fragment problem is studying the supply chain of the construction industry. The present study aimed to measure supply chain performance of construction using SCOR (supply chain) method, the impact and mitigation. The result was that the handling performed in TSM Bali project resulted in 5.56% of indirect waste, 8.63% of direct waste, and 443,711 tonCO2 of carbon footprint</jats:p>",

Using event study methodology and regression analysis, we find statistically significant negative share price responses to announcement of supply chain disruptions for the affected firm and its competitors, but not for consumer and supplier firms. Competitors in more concentrated industries, with higher growth prospects, or with higher debt ratios, are more impacted by disruptions by peer firms.

Online orders are forwarded to the brick-and-mortar store to make the fulfillment, which is a new distribution strategy in a dual-channel supply chain. However, there is little research on the value of using such distribution strategy in dual-channel setting. To fill this gap, this article considers a manufacturer marketing a product through a dual-channel supply chain, comprised of an online channel and an offline retail channel. We develop a game theory model to investigate the pricing decisions and the distribution strategies, as well as to examine the impacts of the new distribution strategy on price competition and the dual-channel supply chain member's profits. By comparing the results of the traditional distribution strategy and the new distribution strategy, we find that the new distribution strategy can soften price competition when the proportion of the revenue generated by the direct channel is high enough, while if the proportion is low enough, it may intensify price competition. We also find that the supply chain members can achieve a win-win situation when the wholesale price is higher, and the proportion is greater under the new distribution strategy.</jats:p>",

Therefore, two research questions arise: RQ1. What are the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices adopted by companies under the different levels of priority assigned to sustainability (i.e., OW, MQ and DA)? and RQ2. How does supply uncertainty influence the choices regarding the SSCM practices to adopt or vice versa? We addressed these questions through a two-step methodology that includes 10 exploratory case studies in different industries and four explanatory cases in the furniture industry. Six research propositions are developed, and we show how some sustainable practices are common to all companies in the sample, while others are only applicable when sustainability is an MQ or an OW. Moreover, in contrast to the suggestion in the literature, we observed that companies with sustainability as an OW implement sustainability practices despite increasing exposure to supply uncertainty. However, when sustainability is a DA or an MQ, companies might implement sustainable practices with the aim of reducing supply uncertainty rather than for sustainability goals. The cases show that investment in these practices can trigger a transition towards a situation in which sustainability is an OW.</jats:p>"

This article develops a multi-agent simulation model to explore price, subsidy and bundling decisions for competing mobile phone supply chains with network externality, where each chain includes one mobile phone manufacturer and one service operator. There are two bundling strategies: free or bundled. The results indicate that: 1) if the impact of network externality is not too small, then competitive differentiation can be formed when one party adopts a bundled one. If bundled scenario is adopted by both, the total profit is reduced. Consequently, both service operators and manufacturers choose (accept) different bundling strategies; 2) network externality and consumer heterogeneity both increase the advantage of bundled scenario in the asymmetric setting; 3) when the effect of network externality is sufficiently small, free scenario is dominant; and 4) consumer heterogeneity can alleviate competition in the symmetric settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Worldwide, the aviation industry facilitates the efficient movement of passengers and goods across borders to support economic access to various local, regional and international markets. As an indirect stimulus for other economies, the aviation industry is known for distinct economic competitiveness, low profit margins and vulnerability to macro-environment fluctuations. Although many studies have focused specifically on scheduled airline’s operations, this study of commercial flight operations in South Africa encompasses both airline operations and charter/on-demand operations.Objectives: The key research objective was to critically review stakeholders’ perceptions on the macro-environment’s influences on the flight operations subsector of South African aviation industry.Method: As research methodology to explore manifest and latent meaning in dialogue, qualitative content analysis was employed in this study. Data were collected through interviews with the stakeholders of South African aviation industry and analysed using qualitative content analysis.Results: This study revealed stakeholders’ views on the effects of political, economic, sociocultural, technological, legal and ecological (PESTLE) framework embedded in the macro-environment of commercial flight operations in South Africa.Conclusion: Although the macro-environment is uncontrollable by the industry, each of the PESTLE framework’s dimensions presents challenges as well as growth opportunities. Continuous monitoring and a comprehensive understanding of the probable impacts of the macro-environment are necessary to remain competitive.</jats:p>"

The traditional approach has been to subsidise first local authorities and then housing associations to produce additional social housing. Later the emphasis shifted to introducing private finance and recycling past subsidy to provide a range of affordable housing products. Additionally, the planning system was modified to make it possible to require the provision of affordable housing on residential development sites. Allocation principles have also changed, moving away from accommodating lower-income working households to emphasising provision for vulnerable households of all types. Here we examine the impact of changing financing mechanisms on the capacity to add to the housing stock; the types of provision; and the rents that are charged across the country. We also consider the impact of Right to Buy and other approaches to transferring accommodation between tenures. Finally, we look to comparable international experience.</p>",

Firms are increasingly implementing environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. During the implementation, they check the collaboration efforts for getting information outside of the organizations to develop and improve both firm and supply chain performance. Due to drastic changes in the business environment, firms face uncertainty. This study aims to analyze the impact of sustainable supply chain management and collaboration under the supply chain uncertainty on firms' performance. Based on the literature review the conceptual framework was developed. To test the research hypotheses, multi-item scales and survey questionnaires were adopted from prior research. The research is based on a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey. We obtained 240 usable questionnaires from 112 companies. The Partial Least Square method was used to test the proposed conceptual model. The results show that sustainable supply chain management is positively associated with supply chain performance and supply chain collaboration. Also, we found that supply chain collaboration has a positive effect on supply chain performance. Supply chain performance is positively associated with firm performance. Furthermore, supply chain uncertainty moderates the relationship between collaboration, sustainable supply chain management, and supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research highlights opportunities to study collaborations between established firms and startups from a buyer–supplier relationship perspective. However, before firms can leverage startups’ resources and capabilities in a buyer–supplier relationship, they need to identify, evaluate, and select suitable startups as their suppliers. As prior research has only studied how buying firms select established firms as suppliers, it is unclear which processes, tools, or organizational approach firms use when selecting startup firms as suppliers. These suppliers are markedly different in that they lack organizational routines, financial resources, and operational capabilities, posing a significant risk for buying companies. This inductive, qualitative case study research collects data from 20 established buying firms and investigates how they select startups as suppliers. We first identify five design themes distinguishing buying firms’ selection strategies. Based on these themes, we develop a typology of three supplier selection archetypes. The results suggest that firms that are willing and able to adapt their selection approach to startups are expected to show a higher selection performance, meaning that they are more likely to select suitable startups as suppliers. The results extend the supplier selection literature and provide new insights into the emerging field of new venture suppliers.</jats:p>",

The relationship between participation and elasticity is not in all cases positive, but parallel to labour market integration, the time since migration increases the elasticities of women. Elasticities indicate the potential to increase participation; therefore, it is especially important for non-Western female migrants to remove barriers to flexible wage responses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this fast growing world, everything needs to change and upgrade with the technology to survive in this rapidly changing environment. The Food Supply Chain system is one of them. In traditional supply chain management functions, it is hard to manage the flow of traceability information of products timely and effectively among upstream to downstream stakeholders.This gap in the flow of information and untrusted traceability of product causes to generate food contamination hazards and also increasing the network of modern FSC systems is still challenging to provide quality, privacy, and integrity of traceability mechanism. HACCP and Blockchain-based FSC provide various functions to enhance the FSC process such as traceability,transparency, security among all stakeholders. In these functions, some most important functions of the Food Supply Chain system are traceability, amount of data sharing, and privacy of data of products among stakeholders.&#x0D;\nIn this paper, we are going to provide an Enhanced Food Supply Chain Traceability system based on Federated Blockchain with HACCP using smart contracts. This model will manage by pre- selected leaders’ nodes. These leaders’ nodes have the right to control the action of middle nodes and lower nodes. The amount of data sharing can also be controlled by the leaders’ nodes.So, any particular transaction is restricted to perform by middle and lower nodes because the Federated Blockchain is partially decentralized. This model overcomes the issue of privacy concern which remains unsolved by blockchain-based FSC and makes a better and enhanced Federated Blockchain-based FSC traceability system.</jats:p>"

This research study intends to explore the impact of SC practices/rehearses on the competitive advantage (CA) on account of the Brewery Industry in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). Data for investigation were collected through field survey through questionnaire based on five-point Likert scale from 119 respondents from one industry. Current study employed the variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis by utilizing Smart-Partial least squares (PLS) 3.0 software for data analysis. The results showed that SCM practices have significant impact on competitive advantage. The results show that customer relationship and strategic supplier partnership are significantly and positively related to competitive advantage of the manufacturer but not relationship between information sharing and competitive advantage. The findings of the current study give experiences into mangers with respect to how to expand the SC rehearses for getting additional advantages. The outcome of this study analysis adds to the literature on SC practices by breaking down the impact of association between customer/client relationship, information/data sharing, and strategic supplier partnership on the CA towards a firm capacity in a particular Ethiopian Brewery Industry context.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of consumers stockpiling certain goods and the slow reaction of retailers to ration them exposed the limitations of cost-efficient and streamlined supply chains to be agile and adapt to unforeseen shocks. This suggests that changes may be needed to make the supply chain more resilient. Specific problems arose from the closure of parts of the catering sector and the lack of agility in redistributing supplies from this sector to retail outlets or the food donation/charity sector. This was due to challenges in packaging availability, logistics and labelling requirements; leading to an increase in food loss. Agricultural food producers and the wider supply chain may have incurred significant losses from the impacts of COVID-19. Food processing facilities have been responsible for a number of localised COVID-19 outbreaks. This may be influenced by a range of factors, including the proximity of workers for prolonged periods, the need to speak loudly to communicate over the noise of the machines or the shared welfare spaces external to the factory setting. The immediate effects of COVID-19 on the food supply system are the current policy concern, but the longer-term food system issues highlighted as a result of the pandemic will have to be addressed by considering how to build resilience to possible future shocks.</jats:p>"

The results show that relationship quality has a direct and positive impact on supply chain quality performance; but after introducing mediating variable—supply chain integration, relationship quality indirectly affects supply chain quality performance through supply chain integration. This means that a good relationship quality can promote supply chain integration and ultimately improve supply chain quality performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The risk created by government policymaking can be daunting, but little is known about the extent to which this risk is disruptive to business in general and to supply chain operations in particular. Because government is a powerful and omnipresent entity, scholars and executives alike could benefit from greater understanding of how firms react to risk emanating from the policymaking process. To help address this gap, we use resource dependence theory to develop hypotheses concerning the accumulation of inventory by firms to buffer against their exposure to potential policy changes and how such a link might be moderated by macro‐level and industry‐level factors. Data from 19,634 firm‐year observations reveal that firms accumulate more inventory as a buffer against policy risk under conditions of high policy uncertainty and high industry dynamism. Overall, our findings support the predictions of resource dependence theory and refine understanding of supply chain responses to macro‐level uncertainty by demonstrating the contingent influence of government policy. In doing so, our study provides a foundation for future research to explore the intersections between government actions and supply chain activities and offers insights for managers and policymakers about how to factor government into their decision calculi.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world finds itself facing unprecedented conditions as the global pandemic of the COVID-19 virus has led to fundamental changes in the global supply chains. This paper aims to assess the initial response undertaken by Central European companies in the early stages of the outbreak. The survey was conducted as a research method to collect data from a large number of companies. Since it takes time to assess long-term effects of the pandemic and related measures, various changes in supply chains are examined as the early results of the COVID-19 crisis and measures implemented by companies. The study examines how different economy sectors were changed due to this situation. The changes in operating volumes were identified as the most commonly used measures to accommodate new market developments. However, developing the new supply chain partnership was the most successful measure. This measure correlates with an increase in revenues and an increase in the number of customers. In some cases, disruptions in supply chains had positive effects on revenues as a reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. Cross-country examinations found that all Polish companies implemented at least one new measure to tackle this crisis. Nearly 20% of Slovak companies and nearly 30% of Czech companies made no changes in their operations during the early stages of the crisis. However, overall, the supply chains in Central European countries turned out to be quite resilient, since most companies managed to survive the supply chain disruptions and in some cases even show signs of overcoming them completely.\nAcknowledgement This contribution was supported by the project No. 1/0757/18, “Consumer behavior in buying goods of daily consumption with an emphasis placed different contents of goods offered on markets of selected EU countries”.</jats:p>",

In this regard, all activities and processes within supply chain, starting from supply of raw materials until to the delivery of final products at the market, must be organized bearing in mind the aim of the supply chain. The focus of the paper is on upstream supply chian, and on solving the dilemma of supplying from single or muliple sources. The significance of this part of supply chain arises from the fact that any potential disorder or disruption in supplying can jeopardize making the value for consumers and the survival of the whole chain. Considering that due to the reduction in the complexity of upstream supply chain management, there is a trend of supplier base reduction, the aim of the paper is to determine how much this trend is present in the Republic of Serbia, with a special emphasis on the food industry.

Where supplies are diversified, there can be greater certainty as to the continuity of good quality supply, even in an emergency. As one of each country’s systems of critical infrastructure, the collective water supply system (CWSS) should be protected, with the diversification of supply treated as a basic tool to raise levels of security among consumers. This article, therefore, presents a method from the authors’ by which diversification may be assessed, including by reference to basic and key elements of the CWSS capable of affecting the continuity of water supply. Sample calculations using the proposed method are also presented here for selected Polish cities. In the event, as only one Polish CWSS can be assigned to the category representing excellent diversification, the suggestion is clearly that Poland’s systems must still progress with the diversification of water supply, in order to further reduce the risk of water shortages.</jats:p>"

We predict that the electron flow is realized through the electron flow device (EFD). We suppose that there are several versions of the SET. Two of them are described below [Structure of Aerobic Glycolysis (SET-AG) and Structure of Oxidative Phosphorylation (SET-OP)]. The hypothesis is based on the atom properties of the protonated adenine molecule and the docking computations of molecular mechanics involved, suggesting that two ascorbate molecules may occupy the empty NADPH pocket, preferably binding to the adenine binding site. We hypothesize that the adenine originates from uric acid (UA), resulting in an ATP-UA-ADP-ATP-UA cycle. It would also mean that UA is one of the oxygen sources in aerobic glycolysis.</jats:p><jats:p>We also suppose that the EFD contains the well-known molecules of the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) supplemented with two additional UA-originated adenine molecules, two L-ascorbic acids, and two D-glucose molecules. Based on all this, we surmise that a tetra adenine octo phosphate ring (TAR) exists, in which the UA originated adenine molecules form a ring. The molecules are linked to each other through the N7-C2 and C8-N1 atoms of the adenine molecules by H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>e-</jats:sup>molecules. The four N10 atoms of the adenine molecules bind one flavin, one nicotinamide, and two L-ascorbic acid molecules. Six D-glucose molecules complete one Unit of the structure. Both Fe-S and cytochrome clusters, as well as dehydrogenases, ensure the continuous operation of the Unit. The synchronized function of the three-stoke, three twin-cylinder engine results in continuous energy, ATP, and H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>production. Eukaryotic cells are equipped with the SET-AG and the SET-OP; thus, they can live in an anoxic and oxygenized environment. It is hoped that the SET concept developed here will help the better understanding the way of action regarding the cancer treatment with Vitamin C or glucose deprivation.</jats:p>"

Patterns of microbial diversity have been characterized across a wide range of different environmental settings, but the mechanisms generating these patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we use mathematical modelling to investigate fundamental connections between chemical power supply to a system and its biological diversity and community structure. We reveal a strong mechanistic coupling between biological diversity and the diversity of chemical power supply, but also find that different properties of power supply, such as substrate fluxes and flow and Gibbs energies of reactions, affect community structure in fundamentally different ways. Moreover, we show how simple connections between power supply and growth can give rise to complex patterns of biodiversity across physicochemical gradients, such as pH gradients. Our findings demonstrate the importance of taking into account energy fluxes in order to reveal fundamental connections between community structure and environmental variability, and to obtain a better understanding of microbial population dynamics and diversity in natural environments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Oxygen field evaluation is important in modeling and simulation of many important physiological processes of animals, such as angiogenesis. However, numerical simulation of the oxygen field in animal tissue is usually limited by the unusual coupling of different mechanisms, the nonlinearity of the model, and the complex geometry of refined blood vessel networks. In this work, a fast numerical method is designed for the simulation of oxygen supply in tissue with a large-scale complex vessel network. This method employs an implicit finite-difference scheme to compute the oxygen field. By virtue of an oxygen source distribution technique from vessel center lines to mesh points and a corresponding post-processing technique that eliminate the local numerical error induced by source distribution, square mesh with relatively large mesh sizes can be applied while sufficient numerical accuracy is maintained. The new method has computational complexity which is slightly higher than linear with respect to the number of mesh points and has a convergence order which is slightly lower than second order with respect to the mesh size. As an example, the oxygen field of a tissue irrigated by a blood vessel network with more than four thousand blood vessels can be accurately computed within one minute with our new method. The new method will definitely promote further researches based on evaluation of oxygen field, such as modeling of angiogenesis and pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p>"

Reusing retired batteries in distributed energy systems (DES) offers resource-circular solutions. We propose an optimisation framework to model the emerging supply chains and design strategies for reusing the retired EV batteries in DES. Coupling a supply chain profit-allocation model with a DES design optimisation model, the framework maximises the whole chain profit and enables fair profit distribution between three interactive sectors, i.e., EV, DES, dismantling and recycle (D&amp;R) sectors. Our research highlights the system implications of retired batteries on DES design and new modelling insights into incentive policy effectiveness. Our case study suggests significant potential value chain profits (2.65 million US$) achieved by deploying 10.7 MWh of retired batteries in the DES application with optimal retired battery price of 138 US$/kWh. The revenue support on D&amp;R sector is suggested as a promising incentive scheme than tariff support.</jats:p>"

In this study, we characterized two cultivars ‘Bluemoon’ and ‘Balin’ distinctly in morphological, chromosomal, physiological and molecular attributes to N supply.<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>Bluemoon was more tolerant to low N than Balin by exhibiting higher turf quality (TQ), photosynthetic ability, activities of N reductases and synthetases and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Gene expression profiling showed that there were 968 and 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after eliminating genetic background differences in Bluemoon and Balin respectively during low N stress, and these DEGs highly enriched in ‘Nitrogen metabolism’, ‘Pyruvate metabolism’ and ‘Carbon fixation in photosynthetic’ pathways. The identified genes related to carbon (C) metabolism highly expressed in Bluemoon, which could generate more NADPH then result in more N reduction comparing with Balin. Moreover, <jats:italic>R2R3-MYB</jats:italic> transcription factors were predicted to bind the promoter of <jats:italic>GS</jats:italic> to enhance the efficiency of <jats:italic>GS/GOGAT</jats:italic> cycle.<jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>These results could be crucial molecular regulations for improving the tolerance to low N and NUE in Bluemoon. The climate and geography in origins may shape the N assimilation patterns in Kentucky bluegrass via long-term domestication. Taken together, the findings help elucidate the low N tolerance mechanisms in Kentucky bluegrass and would be valuable for the genetic improvement of NUE aiming to promote low-input turfgrass management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the growing global interdependence of companies, their scope of responsibility for the environmental, social, and human rights impacts associated with their activities is also growing. In this context, companies are increasingly held accountable for social and ecological issues that lie within the sphere of action of their suppliers and sub-suppliers. They are thus faced with the challenge of meeting these demands for transparency, traceability, and compliance with standards in their Supply Chains (SCs). Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions.</jats:p>"

The megatrend of digitalization enables new possibilities, but also requires research on its appropriate monitoring considering digital transformation. In supply chain planning, todays methods are mostly qualitative. Thus, this study analyzes how the impact of digitalization can be quantified scoped to this field of application.&#x0D;\nBased on the literature streams supply chain planning performance measurement, digitalization assessment and digital technologies the authors develop a holistic framework for quantitative digitalization measurement (QDMF). The framework comprises three dimensions: ‘Man’, ‘Technology’, and ‘Organization’. These itemize to 22 measurands specific to the context. The logic allows the comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of digitalization projects and provides reliable, informative value for decision-making by the quantitative scaling. The framework is applied by conducting expert interviews for customization and data collection, whereon analytics calculates the measurands. In the end, experts interpret the results.&#x0D;\nFor verification and validation, the framework is deployed to the empirical use case of Infineon Technologies AG, Europe’s largest semiconductor manufacturer. The study concludes that quantitative digitalization monitoring is promising and can deliver new insights for effective managerial decision-making. Obstacles as limited data availability and constrained explanatory power are investigated and provide options for further studies.</jats:p>"

Traditional agri-food production system doesn’t offer easy traceability of the produce at any point of the supply chain, and hence, during a food-borne outbreak, it is very difficult to sift through food production data to track produce and origin of the outbreak. In recent years, blockchain based food production system has resolved this challenge, however, none of the proposed methodologies makes the food production data easily accessible, traceable and verifiable by consumers or producers using mobile/edge devices. In this paper, we propose FoodSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block), a blockchain technology based framework, which digitizes the food production information, and makes it easily accessible, traceable and verifiable by the consumers and producers by using QR codes. We also propose a large scale integration of FoodSQRBlock in the cloud to show the feasibility and scalability of the framework, and experimental evaluation to prove that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is so important to use resources in a reasonable, sustainable manner and to be aware of the impact of our activities on the environment, which in the next stage translates into trying to limit negative impacts to the environment. Aspects of sustainable supply chain (SSC) have become more and more popular in the last years. Entrepreneurs pay more attention to the aspect of sustainable development in their activities, especially to exhaust emissions. The rational use of resources is also a very important topic. Not only economic aspects but also environmental and social topics are taken into account in company politics, which is characteristic of sustainable development. The main purpose of this article is to show the benefits of SSC. For this purpose, the simulation models showing the supply chain and the sustainable supply chain will be built. The benefits of SSC in economic and environmental aspects will be presented using a computer simulation tool. Using a simulation tool fits in with sustainability; thanks to modeling supply chains in their virtuality and analysis, many resources can be saved in reality (for example, thanks to the consolidation of freight).</jats:p>"

Among the respondents 53% regard the quality of the water they receive as satisfactory, while a quarter see it as only average. However, respondents are relatively satisfied with the corporate response when supplies are interrupted, as methods and means of notification are judged effective by 60%. Continuing with work to assess possibilities for water companies to improve their performance in crisis situations, the present study generates an Analytical Hierarchy Process allowing recipients to determine importance criteria where quality of service is concerned. This could facilitate management by water companies, providing for centralised control and comparison that help secure services of appropriate quality. The process can also help protect different groups of recipients, as safety is evaluated through analysis of functioning, and of failures and losses.</jats:p>"

However, the retailer may not provide all information to the manufacturer. This research introduces the use of the advanced technology Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) in a retailer’s shop to obtain exact information about customer demand. A consignment policy is used to increase the manufacturer profit, and a fixed fee is offered to the retailer to generate more profit in coordination with the manufacturer. This study is conducted with and without the effect of RFID to show the benefit of SCM even when the retailer is unreliable. Both models are solved using the classical optimization technique. Numerical findings prove that SCM can benefit from the outcome of this study even for unreliability.

A new algorithm entitled ‘Drinking Water Source and Treatment Selection’ (DWSTS) to more sustainably select and compare water sources and treatment methods is introduced and demonstrated. Sustainability factors included in DWSTS include economic, social, and technical. DWSTS charts produced using this new method are an improvement over more traditional performance measures since they compare water sources based on a spectrum of considerations. The DWSTS method is demonstrated in a representative town. In water-scarce Muslim communities, the practice of ablution offers an opportunity for gray water reuse. Treating and reusing ablution gray water (AGW) was evaluated as part of the new DWSTS algorithm. Investigatory tools included in the new method were: household water use surveys, opinion leader interviews, an AGW collection device prototype design, treatment identification and testing, and comparison of attributes to those of existing water sources. Treatment methods examined were locally-made clay pot filter, coagulation and settling using moringa tree seeds, and P&amp;G™ Purifier of Water. The DWSTS charts developed indicate AGW reuse could be socially acceptable, has potential to provide quality water, and would be financially competitive with existing sources. The DWSTS resulted in a more robust and environmentally sustainable solution than the conventional approach of simply considering cost.</jats:p>",

Consequently, this question was raised that what are the impacts of adopting SSCM practices on environmental performance (EP) in Iranian manufacturing companies? According to the results of this study, the following outcomes have obtained: there is a positive relationship between sustainable purchasing and sustainable logistics and internal environmental management (IEM). On the contrary, sustainable production and sustainable design have not a significant relationship with IEM.

Taking advantage of the learning from incidents (LFI) models traditionally used in the risk and safety management area, this paper proposes an information management system to support organizational learning from technical inconveniences in a military supply chain. The approach is discussed with reference to the Italian context, in line with international and national standards for technical inconvenience reporting. The results of the paper show the benefits of adopting a systematic LFI system for technical inconveniences, providing related exemplar business intelligence dashboards.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing agricultural production is essential to improving food availability and farm household incomes in developing economies. This study investigated the dynamic supply responses of major cereal crops to price and nonprice factors in Ethiopia using the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey (ERHS) panel dataset from 1994 to 2009. According to the Nerlovian expectation and adjustment approach in conjunction with the system GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator, both the planted areas and produced yields of major crops (teff, wheat, and barley) are influenced by price and nonprice factors in Ethiopia. The supply of major cereal crops is affected positively by their own prices and negatively by the prices of substitute crops. Nonprice factors such as education, farm size, fertilizer, land quality, and precipitation also affect supply of major cereals. Both the short-term and long-term acreage and yield response elasticities of teff and barley are positive. Moreover, the adjustment coefficients are positive for teff, barley, and wheat. The results suggest that Ethiopian farmers are capable of analyzing market signals and responding positively to price increases of staple crops. The findings also imply that the Ethiopian agricultural sector has been responsive to the cereal price increases observed since 2006. The remarkable growth of Ethiopian agriculture over recent decades is partly explained by the increase in agricultural prices. This study recommends that a fine-tuned balance between government interventions and market solutions is important, in addition to improving farmers’ agronomic practices, for increasing agricultural production.</jats:p>"

Uranium concentration varied from 0.19 to 9.29 μg l−1 with a mean value of 1.58 μg l−1, a standard deviation of 1.95 μg l−1 and a median of 0.82 μg l−1. Uranium concentrations in all the samples were found to be lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) prescribed limit of 30 μg l−1 and AERB India proposed a radiological based limit of 60 μg l−1. Based on permissible limits, all the samples were suitable for human consumption. The annual effective dose was determined by taking the recommended water intake values of different age groups. The mean annual effective dose for all age groups was well within the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended reference dose level of 1 mSv y−1. The highest dose was calculated for infants, which makes them the most crucial group of the population.</jats:p>",

Following the prescribed “keep it sensibly simple” rule for practitioners and the lack of any empirical evidence to support better alternatives, a partial adjustment framework is used to describe the dynamics of fish export behavior. The appropriate functional form was decided by testing the nested Cobb–Douglas (CD) hypothesis within the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) specification and the result supports the CD specification. The models were estimated using ordinary least square (OLS). The descriptive statistical results indicate market heterogeneity in species preferences. The empirical results suggest some degree of inertia in adjustment in the EU and SEA markets. The negative impact of the “export ban” on the EU market suggests a “trade-off” between the protection of domestic consumers and the revenue forgone. The export is price elastic in the short-run for the EU market. The impact of the “trawl fishing ban” on the EU and GCC markets was negative and positive, respectively. The significance of “production capacity” for the GCC and SEA markets signals that future enhancement strategies of exports should be aligned with the long-term sustainability of fish resources. The error-correction model could be considered to check the robustness of the present findings. An examination of the sensitivity of export-supply to potential risks should also be useful. </jats:p>",

Creative leadership in the relief supply chain can be of great help to the enhancement of internal strengths, provision of creative solutions to potential threats, and maintenance and promotion of public health. The present study aimed to provide a Structural equation model of creative hospital leadership.\nMETHODS: The present exploratory research was conducted on 215 cases that were selected as the sample size using Cochranchr('39')s formula. The data collection tool was a standard questionnaire which was completed by managers, supervisors, and experts of hospitals in Isfahan province. The reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was assessed using SPSS software based on Cronbachchr('39')s alpha test, which indicated the high reliability of the research tool.\nFINDINGS: A hierarchical structure was established using DEMATEL software, which is a variety of decision-making methods based on pairwise comparisons, and benefiting from expert opinion in extracting the factors of a system and their systematical structuring based on the principles of graph theory.\nCONCLUSION: Finally, the effectiveness and affectability of the components were expressed as the output of DEMATEL software in a way that their interaction effect was denoted as numerical values. Thereafter, the data were analyzed in linear structural relations (LISREL) software using structural equation modeling, and the creative leadership model was designed.</jats:p>",

Covering the Polish, Slovak, and Portuguese organizations with the research process resulted from the fact that in recent years in these countries, an increase in the diversity of food demand and fragmentation of the food market has been observed. This forced food supply chains to be strictly focused on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of production and distribution systems, as well as taking into account customer requirements and the implementation of sustainable solutions.

The supply of demand response capacity was price-inelastic, with elasticities of 0.5 for residential customers, 0.6 for commercial customers, and 0.4 for industrial customers. These estimates are long-run supply elasticities because utility customers could enter or exit demand response markets. Also, residential customer supply of demand response capacity was heterogeneous, affected by characteristics such as customer education, urban residency, and home space heating fuel. These findings will be of interest to regulators, utility resource planners, and program administrators who want to increase demand response capacity. </jats:p>",

Indicators are powerful tools for understanding this phenomenon. However, in order to get more information about the drought, multivariate indices were introduced for simultaneous evaluation of multiple variables. In this study, a combined drought index (CDI) based on three drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Streamflow Drought Index (SDI), and Standardized Water-level Index (SWI), is defined. Then, the Entropy method is used to determine the weight of each indicator. Among the calculated weights, SDI and SPI had the highest and lowest weight, respectively. The CDI is utilized to identify drought characteristics, such as duration and severity. In addition, the joint distribution function of drought characteristics is formed by copula functions and consequently the probability of different droughts is calculated. For the study area, data and information from eight regions located in Golestan province in the northern part of Iran are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed index. Four categories of drought were defined and their return period calculated. The shortest return period of severe drought was observed in the east and then in the west. In the south and center, the return period of severe drought was longer. Over the course of 30 years, all parts of the province experienced all drought categories.</jats:p>",

So, an accurate performance model of the air supply system is needed for the control of air flow rate and the reduction of air starvation. The performance modelling of a regenerative blower, which is used for the air supply of a 5 kW SOFC system during power generation, is proposed based on the methods of random forest (RF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). The performance model is first built through the RF method. The BO algorithm is then used to adjust the hyper-parameters of the model. The developed model can predict the outlet air flow rate through the operation data of regenerative blower, i.e. the rotation speed of impeller, the inlet and outlet pressure, humidity and temperature, without specific geometrical parameters. A series of operation data obtained from an experimental test rig are adopted to train and validate the presented method. Finally, the prediction performance of the developed algorithm is compared with different machine learning methods, such as decision tree regression, deep neural network. Results show that the proposed method can predict the outlet air flow rate under different working conditions with minimum prediction errors within 3.5% and acceptable computational cost. Therefore, the developed algorithm is promising for performance modelling of the blower, which can be used to predict the outlet flow rate and control the air supply system at SOFC in our next research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agroindustry needs further attention from the relationship between supply chain actors to improve efficiency in terms of partnerships and the application of modern technology today. Supply chain management in agroindustry emphasizes a management approach to a network of facilities and distribution channels that includes procurement of materials, production, and delivery of agroindustry products to end consumers. The research methodology used is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, which is the literature review method that identifies, evaluates, and interprets all findings on a research topic, to answer research questions. The results of the study imply that in order to manage the agroindustry supply chain the entire supply chain structure must be well understood by focusing more on the quality of external relations with supply chain actors and who focus actor on partnership, trust and sustainability in conducting agroindustry supply chain activities. Agroindustry managers must investigate why they must manage, what must be managed and how to manage agroindustry supply chains. To explore the agroindustry supply chain that a manager must integrated the system, examine the nature, linkages and dependencies between business operations in the agroindustry supply chain. Suggestions from researchers that this four-step approach to meeting sustainability must be implemented in the agroindustry supply chain, and optimalized or later all organizations will adopt the SCM concept in achieving competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

For, today’s customers are a different lot than what they used to be decades ago.  They are no longer willing to be content with the ‘take it or leave it attitude’ of the traditional business units. They are demanding, aggressive and are determined to have the best product at a price &amp; quality, which they are willing to pay and what they consider it to be right in their own perspective. This paradigm shift in the attitude of the customers’ is forcing the organizations to be innovative and create value for the customers such as injecting technology to provide services to the customers on 24x7x365 basis across the world and assisting the customer in placing the order for a product while he is in US and to have it delivered in India at a time and place as ‘dictated’ by him. But, all this emphasis on creating customer value and of providing services round the clock, has the backbone of an effective, efficient and efficacious Supply Chain Management System. For, without, this core aspect, the focus on customer value goes for a toss. Thus, business units of today are keenly studying, analyzing, innovating and implementing myriad measures so as to ensure customer value satisfaction.\n\nThis is a conceptual case study, based on the corporate experience of the authors. The domain of the case study is the automobile sector. Initially the case study covers the basics of Supply Chain Management System and gradually it transcends to an establishment of Supply Chain Management System\n\nFinally the problems at the end are focused more on the usage of analytical skills rather than the usage of the theoretical concepts of Supply Chain Management System.\n\nKEY WORDS: Attitude, Backbone, Customer, Innovative, Value</jats:p>"

The hydropower industry's benefits have led to its development and growth around the world. Nonetheless, climate change is expected to disturb the future performance of hydropower plants. This study looks at the Seimareh Hydropower Plant to assess the potential vulnerability of hydropower plants to climate change. Results indicate that climate change will affect the area's hydrological variables and suggest an increase in temperatures and decrease in precipitation during a 30-year future period (2040–2069). It is predicted that Seimareh Dam's inflow will decrease by between 5.2% and 13.4% in the same period. These hydrological changes will affect the Seimareh plant's performance: current predictions are that the total energy produced will decrease by between 8.4% and 16.3%. This research indicates the necessity of considering climate change impacts in designing and maintaining hydraulic structures to reach their optimal performance.</jats:p>",

The thermophysical characteristics of various blowing agents are compared; the superiority of cyclopentane in both thermophysical and environmental parameters is shown.&#x0D;\nThe basic technologies for the production of pre-insulated pipe wires are considered. The advantages of «conti» technology using a diffusion barrier are highlighted. It is shown that for polyurethane foam, the main factor that suppresses heat transfer through PUR type thermal insulation is the low thermal conductivity of the gas mixture, which is \"sealed\" in the foam cells.&#x0D;\nThe analysis of the influence of “aging” of the heat-insulating shell, namely, the diffusion of oxygen molecules into the structure of polyurethane foam, is carried out, and its negative effect on the thermal characteristics of the heat-insulating material is shown. Oxygen diffusion leads to a gradual increase in the value of the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the heat-insulating shell, and as a result, increases heat loss by the pipeline. The results of predictive calculations confirmed the effectiveness of the use of diffusion barriers in the manufacture of PIP. It is shown that when using PIP with a diffusion barrier, unproductive heat energy losses decrease on average by 20–21%, which, in turn, leads to a decrease in the amount of payments to end consumers and an increase in the quality and efficiency of district heating systems.&#x0D;\nIt is also noted that polymer pre-insulated pipelines are practically not inferior in strength and reliability to steel PIP and at the same time, they have several advantages over steel PIP. It is recommended to increase the use of polymer PIP in the reconstruction of heating networks of the district heating system.</jats:p>"

This study is conducted based on panel \n  dataset of four different types of houses in Malaysia from 2002Q3 through 2016Q4. Although housing supply has been theoretically assumed to be positively and linearly \n  related to house price, we observed that the number of new houses build in Malaysia has declined despite the increasing house prices. Hence, we posit that housing supply \n  and house price are nonlinearly related. The results from pooled mean group estimation show the existence of inverted U-shaped housing supply curve. The threshold level of \n  house price index is found at 186.92 where the effect of house price on housing starts will become negative after this point. We also find that the marginal effects of \n  house price evaluated at the minimum and maximum levels are positive and negative, respectively, and statistically significant. This paper suggests that the squared term \n  of house price should be included in estimating housing supply in Malaysia. The evidence of inverted U-shaped housing supply curve in Malaysia shows that housing authorities \n  have taken steps to overcome the challenges of oversupply by reducing the approvals for housing development projects.</jats:p>",

Eggshell biowaste was used as a denitrification biosorbent for water and groundwater. The results showed that the highest removal of nitrate was at pH 6.0–7.5, eggshell particle size in the range 90–710 μm, drying temperature at 45 °C, incubation temperature of adsorbent/adsorbate mixture at 37 °C and contact time of 24 hours. At the optimum conditions, the maximum amount of nitrate removed was 8.25 mg/g eggshell, when 1,500 mg/L of NO3− was applied. It was found that the eggshell biosorbent could be recovered and reused for removing the nitrate with removal capacity of 0.79–0.92 mg/g eggshell (79–92%) in the case of washed samples while the removal capacity was 0.79–0.92 mg/g eggshell (89–93%) in the case of unwashed samples when 100 mg/L of NO3− was applied. Results using the eggshell column method showed a nitrate removal efficiency of 90% at a flow rate ≤2 mL/min of the eluents. The biosorbent was applied to remove nitrates in real groundwater samples from different locations in the Gaza Strip and the efficiency of nitrate removal was in the range (77.4–93%).</jats:p>",

Intermittent utilization of WDNs poses several disadvantages encompassing water quality degradation, deterioration of the water-distribution system, and extra operational and maintenance costs due to frequently interrupted supply, unfair water distribution among consumers, and reduction of system serviceability. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model to address the negative consequences of intermittent water shortages. The model is intended to maximize the quantitative and qualitative reliability and the fairness in water supply, and to minimize the frequency of supply interruption. The developed model also considers pragmatic limitations, water quality, water pressure, and supply reservoir's constraints to plan the operation of intermittent water distribution systems under water shortage. The model's efficiency is tested with a WDN in Iran and compared with a standard operation policy (SOP) for water distribution. According to the evaluated efficiency criteria concerning reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability of water quality and quantity of water supply, the developed model is superior to the SOP rule and improves the performance of the network under intermittent operation. In addition, the results demonstrate there is a tradeoff between the uniformity of water distribution and the frequency of supply interruption that shows operators’ and customers’ conflicting priorities.</jats:p>",

The Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test was applied to evaluate the stationarity of the rainfall series. This basin annually faces onslaughts of varying year-end flooding conditions. The trend analysis was applied for monthly, seasonal and yearly rainfall series between 1989 and 2018. The temporal analysis results showed that both increasing and decreasing trends were detected for all rainfall series. The spatial analysis results indicated that the northern region of the Kelantan River Basin showed an increasing trend, whilst the southwest region showed a decreasing trend. It was found that almost all the rainfall series were stationary except at two rainfall stations during the Inter Monsoon 1, Inter Monsoon 2 and yearly rainfall series.

The characterization of adsorbent is investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) technique. To optimize the effective factors, response surface methodology (RSM) through using Box–Behnken design (BBD) is applied. By proper running of the Desirability function option in MINITAB software, the optimum conditions were found as pH 3.2, adsorbent mass (m) 11 mg, contact time of nine minutes (t), and initial dye concentration (Cd) of 30 mg L−1. Isotherm studies of the adsorption process are carried out where the Langmuir isotherm shows the maximum monolayer capacity (qmax) is 431 mg g−1. The kinetic studies including pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models indicate that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model describes better the adsorption kinetic behavior.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modeling the global markets is complicated due to the existence of uncertainty in the information available. In addition, the lithium supply chain presents a complex network due to interconnections that it presents and the interdependencies among its elements. This complex supply chain has one large market, electric vehicles (EVs). EV production is increasing the global demand for lithium; in terms of the lithium supply chain, an EV requires lithium-ion batteries, and lithium-ion batteries require lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. Realistically, the mass balance in the global lithium supply chain involves more elements and more markets, and together with the assortment of databases in the literature, make the modeling through deterministic models difficult. Modeling the global supply chain under uncertainty could facilitate an assessment of the lithium supply chain between production and demand, and therefore could help to determine the distribution of materials for identifying the variables with the highest importance in an undersupply scenario. In the literature, deterministic models are commonly used to model the lithium supply chain but do not simultaneously consider the variation of data among databases for the lithium supply chain. This study performs stochastic modeling of the lithium supply chain by combining a material flow analysis with an uncertainty analysis and global sensitivity analysis. The combination of these methods evaluates an undersupply scenario. The stochastic model simulations allow a comparison between the known demand and the supply calculated under uncertainty, in order to identify the most important variables affecting lithium distribution. The dynamic simulations show that the most probable scenario is one where supply does not cover the increasing demand, and the stochastic modeling classifies the variables by their importance and sensibility. In conclusion, the most important variables in a scenario of EV undersupply are the lithium hydroxide produced from lithium carbonate, the lithium hydroxide produced from solid rock, and the production of traditional batteries. The global sensitivity analysis indicates that the critical variables which affect the uncertainty in EV production change with time.</jats:p>"

Johansen’s test of co-integration confirmed that farm, wholesale and retail prices are co-integrated in the long-run. A causality test revealed that prices were found to be at wholesale levels for both the upstream and downstream markets. The asymmetry error correction model (ECM) has discovered short-run and long-run asymmetry in price transmission in the vertical supply chain where both producers and consumers were being affected due to positive and negative asymmetry. Threshold autoregressive (TAR) and momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) models have confirmed threshold co-integration as well as threshold effect on asymmetry in price transmission.

This power supply configuration represents the concept of the microgrid system. The research work proposes reliability improvement of the emergency power supply by introducing distributed energy sources and large-scale energy storage systems. The proposed system was modeled with reliability block diagrams (RBDs) and analyzed with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to evaluate the system's reliability in terms of loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The analysis takes into consideration the failure probability of the components combined with the power unavailability due to the intermittent energy sources.

There is little evidence, however, that these studies have informed rural water supply planning in anything but a qualitative way. In this paper, we describe a new web-based decision support tool that planners or community members can use to simulate scenarios such as (1) price, quality, or placement changes of existing sources, (2) the closure of an existing source, or (3) the addition of a new source. We describe the analytical structure of the model and then demonstrate its possibilities using data from a recent study in rural Meru County, Kenya. We discuss some limits of the current model, and encourage readers and practitioners to explore it and suggest ways in which it could be improved or used most effectively.</jats:p>",

This applies especially to dielectric transparent coatings which are relatively thick and for which sputter yields and rates can be rather low. These materials are usually sputtered from dual magnetrons using medium frequency (sine wave) or bipolar (square wave) power supplies at frequencies up to 100 kHz. Frequencies at 50 kHz or higher are beneficial for suppressing arcing on the target surface, and the power required to achieve viable sputter rates is often high, making the power consumption a significant cost contribution. In this study we look at the effect of the power supply technology and frequency on the sputter rate and the sputtered layer thickness per electrical energy input. The tests were carried out with aluminum dual planar targets and with TiOx dual rotary targets. At low frequencies around 20 kHz, the bipolar generator can yield about 10% higher sputtering rates at the same input power. At about 40 kHz, which is often chosen to minimize arcing, the rates from the two power supplies are about equal.</jats:p>",

This is a conceptual paper which uses a multi-theoretical approach to create a framework outlining how organisations which possess different characteristics of culture within the CVF will work to achieve SCRES. Secondary analysis of four case examples as discussed in the supply chain and resilience literature are then used to support the development of propositions from this framework in more detail. The paper suggests that ‘flexibility focused’ cultures will create weaker situational strengths for supply chain partners when managing disruptions, while ‘stability focused’ cultures will create stronger situational strengths in the same scenarios. ‘Internally focused’ cultures may use coercive power with supply chain partners when managing disruptions, while ‘externally focused’ cultures will prefer non-coercive power in the same scenarios. The four case studies from the literature highlight that each type of culture within the CVF can enable an organisation to achieve SCRES. The practical implications of the findings are that managers should take into consideration how their organisation’s culture will influence their relationships with supply chain partners, depending on their application of power and situational strength. However, future research is required to empirically test the propositions.</jats:p>"

Single-use plastic packaging is frequently chosen for its food safety and convenience attributes; however, the material format is under scrutiny due to concerns over economic waste and environmental impact. A circular economy could transform linear make-use-dispose supply chains into circular systems, ensuring the cycling of valuable plastic resources. However, there has been limited research into how consumers will behave within circular economic systems. Understanding consumer behaviour with packaging disposed out of the home could aid designers in developing solutions society will adopt in the transition to a circular economy. This study evaluates the application of behaviour research methods, and the behavioural insight outputs, with stakeholders from the UK food-to-go packaging supply chain. A novel co-design workshop and business origami technique allowed multiple stakeholder groups to collaboratively discuss, evaluate, and plan how consumer behaviour techniques could be used within their supply chain packaging development process. Although all stakeholders identified strengths in incorporating behaviour studies into the development process, providing essential knowledge feedback loops, barriers to their application include the cost and time to implement, plus the existing inconsistent UK waste infrastructure.</jats:p>"

The proposed method is similar to the probability matching method (PMM), except for being based on truncated data pairs. A truncation value is introduced to the log-transformed data in order to remove those in the low rain rate zone as well as to introduce Gaussian distribution. The parameters are then estimated by comparing the first- and second-order moments. The proposed method is applied to a total of six rainfall events observed by the Beaslesan Radar in Korea from 2014 to 2017. Summarizing the results, first, the truncation value should be applied to the horizontal reflectivity (dBZh) data. In this case only, the other two data, the rain rate (dBR) and the differential reflectivity (dBZdr), follow the Gaussian distribution well. It is also important to consider rather severe rainfall events for the parameter estimation. The parameters for only the severe rainfall events are all estimated rather reasonably. On the other hand, for the other moderate and light rainfall events, the parameters are estimated as being rather far from their normal ranges. This is mainly due to the relatively small variance of dBR compared to that of dBZh. That is, the variance of dBR is found to be greatly dependent on the peak rain rate, but the variance of dBZh remains almost unchanged, regardless of the peak rain rate. As a result, the peak rain rate plays a dominant role in the reasonable parameter estimation. These findings are also consistent with many previous studies.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, a waste analysis needs to be done using the Lean supply chain approach so that it will improve the efficiency of the manufacturing system. This approach is carried out by describing the flow of company information through Value Stream Mapping (VSM) tools. Company activities will be classification in value added, non value added, and necessary non value added. From the VSM mapping it is seen that a lot of waste occurs in the supply chain flow. This can be seen from the delay in the arrival of main material from the supplier resulting in the process stalled, a sudden change in production plans, disruption of production scheduling caused by a long lead time. Therefore, effective and efficient efforts are needed to minimize waste in the supply chain flow in order to meet customer expectations. This research succeeded in detailing the value added time is 2,025 minutes, the total necessary but non value added time is 335 minutes so that the total supply chain lead time is 2,360 minutes.</jats:p>"

Pourtant, il est dur d’anticiper comment cela se fera et quelles conséquences seront engendrées. Cet article avance que l’étude de l’histoire énergétique aide à comprendre la flexibilité des systèmes énergétiques. À partir du cas de Montréal, il analyse la fluctuation de l’offre et de la demande en électricité et en gaz entre la Première Guerre mondiale et la Grande dépression, une période marquée autant par l’expansion que par la stagnation des systèmes énergétiques. En étudiant les activités de la compagnie énergétique monopolistique de la ville ainsi que les pratiques des consommatrices et consommateurs d’énergie, cet article propose une typologie de quatre différents types de flexibilité énergétique : flexibilité à la hausse menée par les fournisseurs, flexibilité à la baisse menée par les fournisseurs, flexibilité à la hausse menée par les consommateurs, flexibilité à la baisse menée par les consommateurs. Les conclusions de cette analyse ont des répercussions importantes sur l’analyse des mégaprojets énergétiques futurs et sur le façonnement de la consommation d’énergie. Elles montrent aussi comment l’histoire énergétique révèle la manière dont les structures héritées du passé influencent les décisions futures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fractal analysis of time series is an important tool for describing complex systems and solving nonlinear problems based on time series datebases, of which the core is believed that the geometric bodies composed of various parts of the system have self-similarity and scale invariance. Supply chain management uses integrated thinking, from the perspective of system, to design, plan and control the logistics, capital flow, and information flow in the supply chain for minimizing internal consumption, improving competitiveness or welfare levels, and achieving win–win cooperation. Whether or not the supply chain enterprises cooperate is essentially a game between the enterprises; according to the game theory, the profit of an enterprise depends not only on its own behavior, but also on the behavior of another enterprise with which it deals. On basis of summarizing and analyzing of previous research works, this paper expounded the current research status and significance of the game model of supply chain management, elaborated the development background, current status, and future challenges of the fractal analysis of time series, introduced the methods and principles of fractal dimension calculation and replicator dynamic equation, established a game model of supply chain management based on the fractal analysis of time series including scale-free area determination and model optimization solution, and conducted the fractal analysis of the game model of supply chain management and discussed the equilibrium and statistical similarity of this proposed model. The final simulation experiment showed that the game model of supply chain management based on the fractal analysis of time series applied the phase space reconstruction principle to the data sample selection of fractal prediction algorithm in supply chain, which solved the problem of low similarity between data samples taken by fractal prediction objects with fuzzy self-similar characteristics and periodic ambiguity, and improved the prediction accuracy of the fractal prediction algorithm when predicting objects in the game model of supply chain management. </jats:p>",

For the reconfiguration of two platoons a heuristic and a reinforcement learning (RL) based models have been developed. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply an RL-based decision model to solve the problem of controlling platoon cooperation. Vehicle exchange between platoons is provided by a virtual hub. Depending on the various input parameters, the efficiency of the model was examined through numerical examples in terms of the target function based on the transportation cost. Models using platoon reconfiguration are also compared to the cases where no vehicle exchange is implemented. We have found that a reinforcement learning based model provides a more efficient solution for high incoming vehicle numbers and low dispatch interval, although for low vehicle numbers heuristics model performs better.</jats:p>",

Together with deforestation, degraded forests are contributors to the greenhouse gas emissions from the forestry sector, so it needs to be controlled. Furthermore, degradation affects the forest’s productivity, and thus will affect the performance of the company which owns the licence for the utilization of its timber forest products. The objective of this research was to be able to identify aspects in Green Supply Chain Management and Life Cycle Assessment which are considered the most relevant to be applied in the management of degraded forest, and further to be structured in form of framework. The method used in this research is a qualitative approach with a case study PT XYZ as the holder of a Business License for the Utilization of Timber Forest Products in Natural Forest, in East Kalimantan. Research data obtained through literature studies, field observations, and interviews with key personnel in the company. Data is then analyzed through reduction and concluded. The results showed that internal supply chain activities, namely forest planning, forest development, log production, and marketing, play a significant role in the process of greening the supply chain. The proposed GSCM-LCA Framework includes Green Planning, Green Operations, Green Distributions, and Green Marketing with LCA observations focusing on evaluating and analysing environmental impacts caused by their harvesting and transportation activities. The design of the framework in this study emphasizes strategic-fit, as an effort to adjust the company resources and abilities towards the opportunities in the external environment.     </jats:p>"

By a circuit analysis with an equivalent circuit model, it was found that a parasitic wiring inductance between the diode and switching element induces the resonance.

The findings indicate that institutional requirements, lack of awareness by stakeholders, and port-centric supply chain integration all significantly impact supply chain projects that have been designed to offer maximum value to customers at a low cost. Other crucial barriers include the absence of benchmarking standards and lack of an innovation culture. The policy and managerial implications are explained.</jats:p>",

As banking intermediation ensures efficient allocation of excess capital, but stable availability of deposit resource helps banks to manage long‐term capital structure portfolio. Unlike conventional banks, Islamic banks also have to meet the Shari'ah requirements. This study works under the domain of Islamic economics and intends to explore the demand and supply model of deposits of Islamic banks using data from financial statements, World Development Indicators and Thomson Reuters. The results using panel feasible generalized least squares model with two‐way fixed effect showed that deposits are supply‐elastic and demand‐elastic with respect to returns to deposits. While other factors like inflation, money market rate and knowledge significantly affect supply of deposit and banking profitability and Islamic financial development significantly affect demand for deposits. This study concludes that the global Islamic banking deposit market is stable and converging hence, banks must ensure their relationship with price while devising a strategy to attract deposits.</jats:p>",

Quantity functions with linear price elasticity have been used in economics before but only to a limited extent since they have not been sufficiently theoretically studied. This paper overcomes this gap by identifying and studying all possible functional forms with linear price elasticity as well as their inverses, actually plotted as demand and supply curves. We find that quantity (demanded or supplied) as a function of price with linear price elasticity is a product of an exponential and a power function of price, while the price as a function of quantity involves the <jats:italic>Lambert W function</jats:italic>. Hence, the class of functions with linear price elasticity is heterogeneous: it contains reversible and irreversible functional forms as well as convex and non-convex functional forms. The class’ heterogeneity provides several modelling and research opportunities.</jats:p>",

Simulated runoff under three landuse scenarios in all months demonstrated that the runoff achieved from scenario 1 was smaller than scenarios 2 and 4. In scenario 4, the runoff amount increased by 3–21% and 0.8–13% in Kordkheil station compared to those of scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively. Furthermore, the increase in runoff for scenario 4 is 3–19% and 2–12% in Rig Cheshmeh station relative to those of scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively. Nonetheless, the maximum change in runoff was only 6% under climatic variables. Hence, landuse had more significant impacts on the runoff compared to climatic variables.</jats:p>",

Information is limited on the effect of dietary NCG on the reproduction performance of the late-gestation dairy cows. The objective of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of NCG to cows during late gestation alters uteroplacental tissue nutrient transporters, calf metabolism and newborn weight.\nResults\n\nThirty multiparous Chinese Holstein cows were used in an experiment with a randomized complete block design. During the last 28 d of pregnancy, cows were fed a diet without (CON) or with NCG (20 g/d/cow). The mRNA expression of genes related to arginine, glucose, and fatty acid transporters, angiogenesis factors and the mTOR pathway in the placentome were analyzed. Blood samples of calves were collected for analysis of plasma parameters, amino acids, and metabolites. The newborn weight (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and plasma arginine concentrations (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.07) were higher in NCG calves than in CON calves. The mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose transport, angiogenesis and the mTOR pathway in the placenta was upregulated (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) in NCG-supplemented cows. In addition, 17 significantly different metabolites identified were mainly involved in arginine and proline metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and the citrate cycle.\nConclusions\n\nThese results suggest that the increased expression of angiogenesis factors and glucose transporters and the activation of mTOR signaling pathways in the uteroplacenta that occurs through changes in gene transcription under NCG supplementation may be contribute to an increased nutrient supply and improved amino acid metabolism and urea cycling in the fetus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The prediction of nitrous oxide (N2O) and of dinitrogen (N2) emissions formed by biotic denitrification in soil is notoriously difficult, due to challenges in capturing co-occurring processes at microscopic scales. N2O production and reduction depend on the spatial extent of anoxic conditions in soil, which in turn are a function of oxygen (O2) supply through diffusion and O2 demand by respiration in the presence of an alternative electron acceptor (e.g. nitrate).  This study aimed to explore controlling factors of complete denitrification in terms of N2O and (N2O+N2) fluxes in repacked soils by taking micro-environmental conditions directly into account. This was achieved by measuring micro-scale oxygen saturation and estimating the anaerobic soil volume fraction (ansvf) based on internal air distribution measured with X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT). O2 supply and demand was explored systemically in a full factorial design with soil organic matter (SOM, 1.2 and 4.5 %), aggregate size (2–4 and 4–8 mm) and water saturation (70, 83 and 95 % WHC) as factors. CO2 and N2O emissions were monitored with gas chromatography. The 15N gas flux method was used to estimate the N2O reduction to N2.   N-gas emissions could only be predicted well, when explanatory variables for O2 supply and oxygen demand were considered jointly. Combining ansvf and CO2 emission as proxies of O2 supply and demand resulted in 83 % explained variability in (N2O+N2) emissions and together with the denitrification product ratio [N2O/(N2O+N2)] (pr) 72 % in N2O emissions. O2 concentration measured by microsensors was a poor predictor due to the variability in O2 over small distances combined with the small measurement volume of the microsensors. The substitution of predictors by independent, readily available proxies for O2 supply (diffusivity) and O2 demand (SOM) reduced the predictive power considerably (50 % and 58 % for N2O and (N2O+N2) fluxes, respectively).  The new approach of using X-ray CT imaging analysis to directly quantify soil structure in terms of ansvf in combination with N2O and (N2O+N2) flux measurements opens up new perspectives to estimate complete denitrification in soil. This will also contribute to improving N2O flux models and can help to develop mitigation strategies for N2O fluxes and improve N use efficiency.\n                        </jats:p>"

The status of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) cement industry has dominated the cement market share in Indonesia after the holding strategy, but the data shows that the market share of Semen Indonesia sales has continued to decline. Another problem is that the accumulated cost of revenue has increased sharply, especially since the income growth is not significant, so that gross income has decreased. This research presents integration activities that occur at the corporate and functional level in the marketing and supply chain directorates. The case study method is used in this research to track the integration of marketing and supply chains as an effort to improve the company's sales performance. Data was collected through in-depth interviews in the Marketing Research &amp; Analysis section of PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk and secondary data in the form of company annual reports. The results of this study indicate that PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk integrates marketing and its supply chain through a strategy of unifying the two functions in one directorate. The marketing and supply chain functions at each Operating holding have been revoked, all of them directly managed by the Holding Company. The supply chain is centrally integrated in the form of transportation, distribution and procurement functions. In the marketing aspect, the Holding Company integrates the marketing planning and marketing control and marketing functions as well as the sales function.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Strategy; Integration; Marketing; Supply Chain; Holding Company</jats:p>"

The particular case of the technology of the Spanish company ZELEROS was studied. Based on previous technical specifications related to both the first prototype and a commercial system, different options were analyzed. We selected the use of a linear motor driven by a single power electronic converter, a distribution scheme comprising different sections along the acceleration area of the track, and an energy storage system based on supercapacitors for the energy supply. The power/energy ratio and the cycle capability are the reasons to become a feasible and competitive solution. A preliminary design methodology for the energy storage requirements is presented in the paper. Once the type of linear motor was selected, the power supply scheme was presented, based on a motor-side power electronic converter and a DC/DC converter which connects to the energy storage devices. An additional low power grid-tie converter for the recharge of the energy storage system was also used. Different track sections were defined, connected to the power electronic converter through corresponding switches, being supplied sequentially when the capsule presence is detected along the track. The particular characteristics of this application, with relatively short traction track area, as well as the high energy recuperation ratio due to the low losses, make more suitable the use of energy storage systems as the source of power supply than the direct connection to the grid.</jats:p>"

The study found that the participatory approach was effectively exercised in Kannahipuram CBO managed water supply scheme to ensure a sustainable system at the village level. However, it was observed that the quality of water is not in a drinkable condition for drinking purposes, and the water source has been contaminated, particularly in the Shallow-well due to climate change, increased demand, and seasonal drought in the region.

Internet of things (IoT) comes with a solution to manage a complex, scalable supply chain system, but to provide and attain enough security during information exchange, along with keeping the privacy of its users, is the great inherent challenge of IoT. To fulfill these limitations, this study designs and models a scaled IoT-based supply chain (IoT-SC) system, comprising several operations and participants, and deploys mechanisms to leverage the security, mainly confidentially, integrity, authentication (CIA), and a digital signature scheme to leverage potentially secured non-repudiation security service for the worst-case scenario, and to leverage privacy to keep users sensitive personal and location information protected against adversarial entities to the IoT-SC system. Indeed, a scaled IoT-SC system certainly opens new challenges to manage privacy and security while communicating. Therefore, in the IoT-SC system, each transaction writes from edge computing nodes to the IoT-SC controller is thoroughly examined to ensure the proposed solutions in bi-directional communication, and their robustness against adversarial behaviors. Future research works, employing blockchain and its integrations, are detailed as paces to accelerate the privacy and security of the IoT-SC system, for example, migrating IoT-centric computing to an immutable, decentralized platform.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaysia is in the process of liberalising its electricity supply industry (ESI) further, with the second reform series announced in September 2018. If everything goes as planned, Malaysia would be the third country in the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) to have a fully liberalised ESI after the Philippines and Singapore. A number of initiatives have been in the pipeline to be executed and a lot more will be planned. At this juncture, it is important for Malaysia to look for the best practices and lessons that can be learnt from the experience of other countries that have successfully liberalised their ESIs. Being in the same region, it is believed that there is a lot that Malaysia can learn from the Philippines and Singapore. This paper therefore presents and deliberates on the chronological development of the countries’ progressive journeys in liberalising their ESIs. The aim is to discern the good practices, the challenges as well as the lessons learnt from these transformations. Analysis is being made and discussed from the following four perspectives; legislative framework, implementation phases, market components and impact on renewable energy penetration. Findings from this study would provide useful insight for Malaysia in determining the course of actions to be taken to reform its ESI. Beyond Malaysia, the findings can also serve as the reference for the other ASEAN countries in moving towards liberalising their ESIs.</jats:p>"

The community was actively involved in this development program in the form of building indoor wells, implementing Clean and Healthy Behavior (PHBS), and establishing a committee to maintain and manage the facilities as an integrated program sustainable towards universal access (100-0-100). The central government, represented by the Ministry of PUPR, has run the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation (PAMSIMAS) program. This research was conducted using a qualitative approach. The content analysis was done through in-depth interviews, documentary review, and observation. The subjects of this study were regency work unit, partnership committee, district coordinator (DC), co-DC, data entry and administration officer, community facilitator, community self-help group, implementing unit, drinking water management facility management group, Belabori Village government, the village head, sanitarian, and the water-using community in Belabori Village, Parangloe District, Gowa Regency, totaling 25 people. The data were collected by questionnaires. The results showed that the processes of planning, implementing, and maintaining the PAMSIMAS program in Belabori Village were carried out by the community through deliberations. Besides, there had been a change in community behavior. The community’s awareness of healthy and clean living and their participation level in overseeing the program at all the stages can be seen from the maintenance of the PAMSIMAS program since it was launched in 2017 until 2020. Therefore, it can be concluded that the PAMSIMAS program has a positive impact on the community: the community can easily access clean water at Rp3.000/m3 and stop doing open defecation. Changes in the community behavior and attitudes and their participation level as a form of their sense of belonging to the facilities built in Gowa Regency have occurred</p>"

Quality water for human consumption is a primary duty of the government but they have failed. Also, current cost of boreholes installation has increased beyond their capacity due to Naira devaluation in the world market. Water resources management requires constant monitoring in terms of its qualitative-quantitative values. This study presents potential impact of the Project Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) mathematical model software development for the supply of domestic well-water treatment plant. After testing software against the values then, the 37days calculated Expected Time (ET) is unreliable because the risk involved in this project is (100 – 34.23) % = 65.77 %. However, a new completing date can be predicted by PERT mathematical model for supply of domestic well-water treatment plant by varying probability of completion to predict new date of completing the plant. Therefore, concerning this research the Initial probability was moved from 34.23% to 90%. By interpolation with 37 days; the new acceptable date was 97.28 days. The risk involved now (100 – 90) % reduced to 10%, a very good comfortable zone for the project. This information has really helped in two ways: for easy computation and decision making in water supply scheme project. This result is useful in industrialization, individuals, housing estate, small and medium scale industries where quality domestic well-water for crops production is a necessity.

Indeed, there is a specific way to achieve this integration in the supply chain and there are differences in how one company does it compared to another. More recently, an alternative based on the Lean and Agile paradigms has been presented. The implementation of the Lean and Agile models to the supply chain aims to improve and simplify the production and the process of minimizing or eliminating wastes of all kinds, raise the productivity of the supply chain, increase the capability to respond quickly to unpredictable and changing customer demands and to take advantage of the uncertainty and the volatility of the market in the medium term. The main objective of this paper is to conduct an impact study on the implementation of Lean and Agile models in the supply chain, based on a review of the scientific literature concerning the models implemented to improve the productivity of the supply chain. We aim to identify and analyze the research carried out regarding the implementation of Lean and Agile models in order to improve the supply chain management, the results achieved and future research directions. Although the Lean and Agility paradigms are distinct and can be developed differently, they can be successfully integrated into a well-designed supply chain integration that involves a substantial degree of ambiguity in terms of significance and level of application across different supply chains, in order to increase the capacity to act, react and adapt to changes in demand and supply.</jats:p>",

However, due to the high cost and low profit of green investment, a large number of small and medium-sized firms can be deterred from their implementation. Value co-creation has become a key measure to solve this problem. This article explores the relationship between the green supply chain (GSC) strategy, value co-creation, and corporate performance in the manufacturing environment, and considers the regulatory effects of internal environmental factors and external environmental pressures on this relationship. Based on data from 115 manufacturers in China, we tested the hypotheses, explained the statistical results, and identified key concerns for implementing GSC through value co-creation. The findings reveal that the GSC strategy can promote a high level of firms’ value co-creation with their supply chain partners, and different value co-creation modes have different effects on firm performance (i.e., operational performance, innovation performance, and financial performance). In addition, the findings indicate that macro-level external pressure and micro-level internal support could enhance such effects. This study enriches the literature with value co-creation modes and GSC management by integrating GSC strategies and value co-creation strategies, providing confidence to the firms and their supply chain partners in value co-creation, thus helping them to better implement a GSC strategy.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to determine the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), during the pandemic and to compare these patient numbers with Japan’s overall intensive care capacity. Results : Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 who had undergone mechanical ventilation and ECMO between February 15 and June 4 2020, to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan. In total, 17968 ICU days, 15171 mechanical ventilation days, and 2797 ECMO days were attributable to patients with COVID-19. There was a median (interquartile range) 143 (63-255) patients in ICU, 124 (51-225) patients on mechanical ventilation, and 18 (15-36) patients on ECMO machines. During the epidemic peak in late April, 11443 patients (1.03 per 10000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034 per 10000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028 per 10000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056 per 10000 adults) were on ECMO machines per day. The number of infected patients at the peak of the epidemic was 651% of total designated beds and the number of patients requiring intensive care at the peak of the epidemic was 6.0% of total ICU beds in Japan, 19.1% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan and 106% of total designated medical institutions for Category II infectious diseases in Japan, respectively. Conclusions : Following the state of emergency declaration on April 7 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 and the number of critically ill patients continued to rise, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity. Urgent nationwide and regional planning is needed to prevent an overwhelming burden on ICUs in relation to critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Japan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For a long time, the mismatch between material flow and capital flow in the supply chain operation management practice is very prominent, which has led to the inefficiency of supply chain operation and hindered the exertion of supply chain’s advantages. In the field of supply chain management theory research, the information completeness in capital market has long been a hypothetical premise, which has led to the separation of corporate financing and operational decision-making research. In addition to production, inventory, procurement, pricing and other strategies in supply chain operations, payment options and credit incentives are also important decisions for both parties, especially for products with long production and sales cycles; different payment methods directly affect corporate capital flows and the enterprise’s long-term development. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous works, this paper analyzed the research status and significance of supply chain financing and operational comprehensive decision-making, expounded the development background, current situation, and future challenges of the fractal dimension of fractional Brownian motion; elaborated the principles and methods of the scaling properties of fractional Brownian motion and the phase space reconstruction of time series, established a financial management analysis model based on the fractal dimension of fractional Brownian motion, performed the analysis of the agglomeration degree, time series and multi-fractal characteristics of supply chain financing, explored the coupling relationship between the comprehensive operational decision-making and Brownian motion’s scaling properties. The final empirical analysis showed that when own funds are sufficient, the production should be carried out with the goal of maximizing profits, and full consideration should be given customer channel stickiness, relative costs of offline and online channel products, and product profitability; the proposed analysis model can achieve the optimal order quantity in supply chain, and reach risk and benefit sharing among financial institutions, retailers, and suppliers by setting the financing interest rate, wholesale price, repurchase price and other parameters, thereby improving supply chain performance. This study results of this paper provided a reference for further researches on the application of fractal dimension of the fractional Brownian motion to the supply chain financing and operational comprehensive decision-making. </jats:p>",

ANC and delivery services at health facilities, however, have been underutilized in Kenya. One potential strategy to increase the demand for ANC services is to provide health interventions as incentives for pregnant women. In 2013, an integrated ANC program was implemented in western Kenya to promote ANC visits by addressing both supply- and demand-side factors. Supply-side interventions included nurse training and supplies for obstetric emergencies and neonatal resuscitation. Demand-side interventions included SMS text messages with appointment reminders and educational contents, group education sessions, and vouchers to purchase health products. <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: To explore pregnant mothers’ experiences with the intervention, ANC visits, and delivery, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) at pre- and post-intervention. A total of 19 FGDs were held with pregnant mothers, nurses, and community health workers (CHWs) during the two assessment periods. We performed thematic analyses to highlight study participants’ perceptions and experiences. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: FGD data revealed that pregnant women perceived the risks of home-based delivery, recognized the benefits of facility-based delivery, and were motivated by the incentives to seek care despite barriers to care that included poverty, lack of transport, and poor treatment by nurses. Nurses also perceived the value of incentives to attract women to care but described obstacles to providing health care such as overwork, low pay, inadequate supplies and equipment, and insufficient staff. CHWs identified the utility and limitations of text messages for health education. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>: Future interventions should ensure that adequate workforce, training, and supplies are in place to respond to increased demand for maternal and child health services stimulated by incentive programs.</jats:p>"

Ensuring that supports for disaster victims arrive on time and precisely in quality and quantity is the responsibility of all the supply chain elements, particularly government board which handled the logistic support. The activities of the supports supply chain when a disaster occurs have several risks that must be asses and the most prioritized risk will need the mitigation design to minimize the impact of these risks. This study aims to investigate risk events and risk agents in the supply chain activities in relation to disaster management in Aceh. This study employs three government boards at the key stakeholder’s group who play a significant role in the disaster risk mitigation in Aceh. Data obtained from questionnaires are used for analysing the supply chain activities using the SCOR model and Fuzzy-Based House of Risk method. The study reveals that there are 25 risk events ad 27 risk agents which might occur in the supply chain activities during disaster in Aceh. The mitigation strategy is proposed in mind map models with a long term solution for each risk agent related to the potential risk events.</jats:p>",

The latter will be the subject of this paper. This paper addresses the improvement of continuity of supply in radial distribution grids in rural areas, where traditional reinforcements cannot be carried out because they are located in secluded areas or in naturally protected zones, where the permits to build new lines are difficult to obtain. When a contingency occurs in such a feeder, protection systems isolate it, and all downstream users suffer an interruption until the service is restored. This paper proposes a novel methodology to determine the optimal location and size of micro-grid systems (MGs) used to reduce non-served energy, considering reliability and investment costs. The proposed model additionally determines the most suitable combination of DER technologies. The resulting set of MGs would be used to supply consumers located in the isolated area while the upstream fault is being repaired. The proposed methodology is validated through its application to a case study of an actual rural feeder which suffers from reliability issues due to the difficulties in obtaining the necessary permissions to undertake conventional grid reinforcements.</jats:p>"

Toxic contamination of such water could result in large-scale health effects. A great proportion of groundwater suffers from the problems of nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic contamination. Thus, the present research was aimed to remove these contaminants from the water. Hydrous bismuth oxide based adsorbents exhibited high adsorption capacities towards nitrate, fluoride and arsenic. However, As (V) removal was found to be more effective as compared to nitrate and fluoride. The removal efficiencies are 52, 72 and 92% for nitrate, fluoride and As (V), respectively, during concurrent removal of the same. Ion exchange with chloride ions was the probable mechanism for the concurrent removal of the above three anions from water. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for the characterization of HBO12mix adsorbents. The results of the present study indicated that HBO12mix has the potential for concurrent removal of nitrate, fluoride, and As (V) from groundwater. Hence, hydrous bismuth oxide can be used in the drinking water treatment process at a domestic level.</jats:p>",

The zinc accumulation was dose dependent in vegetative parts of wheat, which was increased with increase in zinc supply levels. The low and high zinc content in wheat shoot inhibited pigments content and activity of antioxidative enzymes like catalase and peroxidase. The mobilization of zinc in grains was lower at elevated and low zinc-supply levels in contrast to their accumulation in vegetative parts. The zinc mobilization efficiency index (ZnMEI) was higher at normal doses of zinc as compared to low (0.01 mg l-1) and elevated zinc levels (5 mg l-1). In the present study, maximum increase of 15, 25 and 18% was observed in the dry matter yield, shoot length and total chlorophyll content, respectively following exposure of 1.0 mg l-1 of zinc. At this zinc treatment, protein content in the seeds was elevated by 10% with zinc enrichment by 73%.

However, it shows low efficiency in cases of high pressure losses, usually requires large volumes of water, and does not remove incrustations. Air scouring is known for being very effective in particle removal with minimal impacts from pressure loss, requiring little water and improving hydraulic capacities by removing soft incrustations. Flushing sequences of unidirectional flushing and air scouring were performed in similar conditions on 18 pipe sections from four water distribution networks located in the province of Quebec, Canada; unidirectional flushing was also performed on 14 additional pipe sections located in three other water distribution networks. Total suspended solid concentration of flushed water, water flow and pressure were recorded to estimate the amount of flushed particles, the required water volume and the evolution of hydraulic capacities. Within the studied networks, the water requirements for air scouring were approximately 8-fold less than for unidirectional flushing and did not significantly improve the hydraulic capacity of the cleaned pipes.</jats:p>",

The two case-study villages (Pongluek and Bangkloy ) have experienced severe draughts in the last decades, and therefore water supply has become a major issue. A stand-alone 15.36 kW solar power and a 15 kW solar submersible pump were installed along with the input power generated by solar panels supported by four solar trackers. The aim is to lift water at the static head of 64 and 48 m via piping length of 400 metres for each village to be stored in 1,000 m3 and 1,800 m3 reservoirs at an average of 300 m3 and 400 m3 per day, respectively for Pongluek and Bangkloy villages. The case study results have shown that the real costs of electricity generated by SWSS using solar PV systems intergraded with the solar tracking system yield better performance and are more advantageous compared with the non-tracking system. This study illustrates how system integration has been employed. System design and commercially available simulation predictions are elaborated. Construction, installation, and field tests for SWSS are discussed and highlighted. Performances of the SWSS in different weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, and rainy days were analysed to make valuable suggestions for higher efficiency of the integrated solar water supply systems.</jats:p>"

This paper studied the influence of the cost misreporting behavior on the supply chain members’ decisions and profits. By use of the game theory, in the scenarios including the supplier misreporting to other supply chain members and the supplier colluding with the platform, the paper analyzed the optimal pricing decision, misreporting coefficient decision, and platform’s service fee decision and further compared the profits of the supply chain and its members. The results show that the capacity provider tends to overstate the production cost for gaining more profits, which exerts negative effects on profits of other members and the supply chain. Compared with the case of misreporting to both the manufacturer with insufficient capacity and the platform, the case of colluding with platform is more favorable to the profits of the manufacturer, the platform, and the supply chain, while the supplier prefers to choose the former situation. When the sales revenue-sharing proportion, cost-sharing proportion, and service fee satisfy certain conditions, the sales revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contract can avoid the capacity provider’s cost misreporting behavior and coordinate the supply chain.</jats:p>",

A total of 100 turkey raisers were surveyed following convenience method of sampling technique. The primary data were collected, analyzed accordingly and tabular presentation method was applied with the help of simple descriptive statistical measures e.g. frequency distributions, percentage, sum and means to illustrating the results. Profitability analysis was done on the basis of variable cost, fixed cost, return by using arithmetic means and percentages. The study revealed that 87 male and 13 female respondents were surveyed, of them cent percent found educated. About 56% turkey keeper’s main occupation was business, 27% service and 12% in farming while 88.57% involved with farming as secondary sources of income. Average landholding for homestead, cultivable and non-cultivable was 24.40, 129.71 and 29.47 decimal, respectively. About 59% farms started for commercial purpose, 32% for non-commercial purpose and 9% for both. About 60% respondents kept less than 50 turkeys and only 2% kept 501-1000 turkeys. Among the surveyed farms55% stopped their operation and 45% farms found running their business. Among the running farms cent percent were small-scale group. The average feed intake was 192.13 grams per day per bird at 20 weeks of age. Turkey laid on an average 139 eggs a year irrespective of variety and for hatching poults, the fertility and hatchability rate found between 65 to 100% and 50 to 90%, respectively. About 28% farmers experienced the deaths of turkey because of Cold, Pox, Ranikhet, Bird flu and unknown cases and 69.47% farmers took veterinary advice from Upazila Livestock Hospital and rest from other sources. Farmers to consumers were the most common and widely used marketing channel for egg, chick and adult turkey. The market intermediaries of turkey farm carried out different marketing functions e.g. buying and selling, pricing, transportation, sorting, distribution and market information. The average net return and benefit-cost ratio was BDT 127838.04 and 1.38, respectively for 50 turkeys per year. In the study, turkey rearing found some comparative benefit over chicken and ducks e.g. higher weight gain, forage eater, lower diseases rate and suitability for the country. The main problem of turkey rearing identified as market instability, lack of quality turkey feed, higher feed price, lack of proper marketing facility and training on turkey farming. In conclusion, the small-scale turkey farming could be a viable source of income for the rural people of Bangladesh after taking some remedial steps by the Government of Bangladesh for the aforesaid hindrances faced by the turkey farmers.</jats:p>"

In Naoli River Plain (NRP), an important agricultural cultivation base and wetland in China, the trend of groundwater dynamic change is complicated under natural climate and human activities. Based on the methods of the Mann–Kendall test, Sen's slope estimation and correlation analysis, groundwater hydrodynamic characteristics and causes were identified. Within 68 observation wells from year 2000 to 2015, there are 28, 30 and 10 wells, accounting for 41.2%, 44.1% and 14.7%, that belong to rising, declining and relatively stable change trends, respectively. The average groundwater rising and declining rates are 0.19 m/year and 0.26 m/year respectively. The groundwater level was increasing or stable in the areas where there was no intensive groundwater exploitation, such as wetland, mountain foregrounds, residential lands and dry farmland. The groundwater level was declining obviously in the paddy fields with groundwater as the source of irrigation water. Thus, the groundwater dynamics in NRP were affected both by human activities of groundwater irrigation and climate change. The carrying capacity of groundwater for agricultural cultivation has been overloaded in some areas, and a conjunctive utilization of surface water and groundwater is needed urgently in NRP.</jats:p>",

As a developing country, Malaysia recognizes building as one of the main contributors to the economy of the country. Hence, being one of the economic drivers, the construction industry needs to ensure it remains important and competent by venturing successful strategies applied by other sectors. The implementation of supply chain management, especially in the manufacturing sector, has been positive and has produced the expected benefits such as cost reduction, competitive advantages, improved productivity, value creation and better relations between parties. This study aims to review reported outcome on Bumiputera contractors’ supply chain network. Additionally, this study also intent to analyse the main categories of risk that affect the Bumiputera contractors’ project performance which related to their approach on supply chain management. Current research papers on relevance to the issue were critically reviewed. The results from the structured literature review managed to identifies that supply chain is not used extensively among the Bumiputera contractors. Additionally, risks associated with the supply chain network in construction industry can be further categorised into external and internal factors such as cooperative risk, financial risk, technology risk and economic risk. The result have aspired a better understanding between the supply chain management with sustaining project performance among Bumiputera contractors. This study is a part of an on-going contract research with the overall aim to model supply chain network using risk parameters which will be identified at later stage of this research.</jats:p>",

Characterization was carried out to NFC and CNC by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), showing excellent structural properties and high availability of surface functional groups. The influence of different parameters on the adsorption process was evaluated through batch-type adsorption experiments. The results showed effective lead removal reaching adsorption equilibrium at 180 min. Isotherms results showed maximum adsorption capacities (Qmax) of 80.02, 84.64, and 87.10 mg/g for NFC at 25, 30 and 45 °C, respectively. Results of Pb(II) adsorption isotherms by CNC showed a Qmax of 17.90, 28.20, and 30.36 mg/g at 25, 30 and 45 °C, respectively. Isotherm data were best described by the Langmuir–Freundlich model for NFC, and the Freundlich model best-described CNC isotherm. Lead adsorption mechanisms were different for both biosorbents. The thermodynamic parameters of the process were calculated. Endothermic reactions were observed for both materials. NFC and CNC materials have great potential as biosorbents for the removal of lead ions from water.</jats:p>",

Two on-board tanks are forecast to store CH4 and water, useful for feeding both a combustion chamber (designed to provide the heat required by the system) and a multi tubes Pd-Ag MR useful to generate pure H2 via methane steam reforming (MSR) reaction. The pure H2 stream is hence supplied to the FC. The flue gas stream coming out from the combustion chamber is used to preheat the MR feed stream by two heat exchangers and one evaporator. Then, this theoretical work demonstrates by a 1-D model the feasibility of the MR based system in order to generate 5 kg/day of pure H2 required by the FC system for cruising a vehicle for around 500 km. The calculated CH4 and water consumptions were 50 and 70 kg, respectively, per 1 kg of pure H2. The on-board MR based FCV presents lower CO2 emission rates than a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle, also resulting in a more environmentally friendly solution.</jats:p>"

The cost of renovating these systems is high. However, customized management models can facilitate the maintenance and rehabilitation of hydraulic infrastructures by optimizing the use of resources. The implementation of current Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring systems allows decisions to be based on objective data. In water supply systems, IoT helps to monitor the key elements to improve system efficiency. To implement IoT in a water distribution system requires sensors that are suitable for measuring the main hydraulic variables, a communication system that is adaptable to the water service companies and a friendly system for data analysis and visualization. A smart pressure monitoring and alert system was developed using low-cost hardware and open-source software. An Arduino family microcontroller transfers pressure gauge signals using Sigfox communication, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN). The IoT ThingSpeak platform is used for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, the system can send alarms via SMS/email in real time using the If This, Then That (IFTTT) web service when anomalous pressure data are detected. The pressure monitoring system was successfully implemented in a real water distribution network in Spain. It was able to detect both breakdowns and leaks in real time.</jats:p>"

In their production planning, the company applies a method of estimating or predicting so that production results cannot meet production demand. This is the background of the researchers to make production planning based on forecasting methods and determine the quantity of glass bottle orders to meet demand. In forecasting the demand for production of the 220 ml glass bottle packaging, the methods used are Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Linear Regression by comparing the size of forecasting errors using Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). To determine the supply of glass bottles used the EOQ (Economy Order Quantity) method to determine the purchase of the most economical glass bottles. Base on the data, the Moving Average method (n=9) was the best forecasting used to predict the 220 ml glass bottle packaging demand for the next period of 233,862 crates with MAD forecasting error of 13,680, MSE of 561,420,907, and MAPE 5.49% which is the smallest value of the three methods. The application of the EOQ method results in the most economical order of glass bottles that is 136,234 crates for one message with a total repurchase frequency of 21 times a year.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The complexities of modern supply chains present significant challenges in maintaining efficiency, reducing operational costs, and adapting to market fluctuations. Traditional supply chain management approaches often struggle to anticipate disruptions and align with dynamic demand patterns, leading to costly inefficiencies and suboptimal decision-making. This paper explores the integration of machine learning-driven predictive analytics as a transformative solution for optimizing supply chain efficiency. By leveraging diverse data sources—such as historical demand, real-time inventory levels, transportation data, and external factors like weather or economic indicators—machine learning models can uncover patterns, forecast demand, and streamline inventory management. Key methodologies examined include time series forecasting, classification algorithms for demand and supply adjustments, and clustering techniques to identify optimal stock levels and transportation routes. The research further evaluates model performance using accuracy, mean absolute error, and precision metrics to determine the effectiveness of different predictive models in real-world applications. Through case studies in manufacturing and retail supply chains, we demonstrate how predictive analytics can improve inventory management, reduce lead times, and increase resilience against supply chain disruptions. This study provides insights into the practical implementation of machine learning in supply chain systems, outlines challenges related to data quality and model interpretability, and suggests directions for future research, emphasizing the potential of predictive analytics to drive cost-efficiency and responsiveness in global supply networks.</jats:p>"

The study shows that moderate subsidies will increase the recovery rate under both supply constraints. However, high subsidies will increase the output of new power batteries, leading to oversupply, which is not conducive to environmental protection.

Setting sustainability reporting boundaries has subpolitical properties in producing and framing those risks, whilst is simultaneously limited by the inherent politicisation of such an exercise.

There is a need to prepare detailed measures according to cargo type given the high correlation between the types of dust-producing cargo primarily managed at ports and local industries. This study attempts to establish the attributes of the cargo handled at ports and the relationship between supply chains built for local key industries and the air quality of the local community. It aims to ascertain which cargo needs managing preemptively at the local level, based on the major cargo types handled in a port. A correlation analysis and Granger causality test were performed to investigate the causality between the factor of cargo and fine dust concentrations. The results in this study indicate the necessity for intensive management of scrap metal cargo among the major cargo handled at the target port, which confirms the large effect of management on fine dust reduction, as well as on reduction efficiency. The results suggest requirements to expand the regulations on the emissions of supply chains by cargo type, not by industry type. Additionally, it is required to minimize the blind spots of management and form an eco-friendly supply chain by introducing green technology. The preparation of emission control measures is also necessary. The findings provide useful insights for the sustainable operations of the local supply chain around the target port and will help the strategic agenda for future improvement.</jats:p>"

Four energy-efficient houses in the Brest region (Republic of Belarus) with apartment heat supply and a mechanical ventilation system with heat recovery were selected as the object of study. The research methodology of the heating and hot water supply systems of the houses consisted of the following stages: study of project documentation; thermal imaging inspection of building structures and instrumental studies of the operation of heating systems and hot water supply; questionnaire of residents to analyze the nature of their use of the studied systems; processing received data. The values of the operational specific consumption of thermal energy for heating were determined, which doubled the design values equal to 43 kW·h/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The main reasons for the excess of the operating specific consumption of thermal energy for heating and ventilation over the design value is the increased heating season compared to the design average for a month and the maintenance of elevated indoor air temperatures in apartments, on average, at +21°C, which leads to increased heat losses. The functioning of the hot water supply system of energy-efficient houses is generally satisfactory for the used design solution, but sometimes due to the specific appartments’ planning leads to an excessive consumption of water and causes dissatisfaction of residents with a long waiting time for hot water with required temperature. Studies have shown that currently, the existing tariff policy in the Republic of Belarus due to low tariffs for gas and thermal energy for the population does not contribute to the efficient use of energy-efficient solutions by the masses of the population, which leads to an excessive consumption of thermal energy in modern residential buildings.</jats:p>",

Previous research has mainly focused on the direct effect of innovation on a firm's financial performance, overlooking the innovativeness and complexity of supply networks. In this research, we focus on a firm's supply base, defined as the first tier of a supply network, and investigate the relationship between the intensity of R&amp;D within the supply base and the financial performance of the focal firm. We also examine the moderating role of three aspects of supply base complexity—Number of suppliers, differentiation, and inter‐relationships among suppliers. Utilizing secondary data from Bloomberg and Compustat, we find that the R&amp;D intensity of a firm's supply base is positively associated with the firm's financial performance. Further, all three aspects of supply base complexity negatively moderate this relationship. These findings make important contributions to the literature by establishing a direct, positive relationship between supply base R&amp;D and firm financial performance, which is attenuated by complexities within the supply base.</jats:p>",

With limited water supply, several high-demand sites located far from the desalination plant and an efficient and cost-effective transmission and storage network have become critical. In many areas, desalinated water is not delivered efficiently through a pipeline and storage tank system capable of providing safe and cost-effective coverage to a wide range of demand sites. In addition, due to the limitation of transmission and storage distribution, many desalination plants are unable to achieve full production capacity. Many high-demand sites are at risk of disruption or water contamination due to single-source pipelines or desalination plants. In this study, the conceptual framework for an economically viable transmission and storage system helps decision-makers to define the requirements for the proper design of the system. The definition is introduced here to describe strategic tanks for efficient and economical supply allocation. The key aspects of setting up effective transmission and storage systems were outlined in the framework presented. To develop an efficient and cost-effective transmission and storage system, an integer linear program was constructed to solve the hub and spoke issue. A hypothetical example is presented and discussed to illustrate the advantages of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

Based upon the LLC resonant converter with multiplier, efficient power conversion and stable loop control were realized when the switch frequency was near to the resonant frequency. The driving pulses of the switches were controlled by a low-frequency PWM signal, thus realizing the intermittent operation mode. Therefore, the output voltage was in the form of pulsation, which met the requirement of the magnetron. Furthermore, the mean output power of the microwave could be regulated through the PWM duty ratio. An experimental prototype of 1000 W magnetron power supply was completed. As shown in the experiment, the soft switch of this circuit possessed excellent performance. The converting efficiency was higher than 93%; moreover, its output power could be easily adjusted.</jats:p>",

The main attention is paid to the aspects of formation of territorial heat supply systems which are the basic components of the life support infrastructure in the harsh climatic conditions of the Arctic and the Far North. Despite the predominance of energy sector in the economics of the Russian Arctic, the availability of the raw material base and an increase in the flow of investment resources to the energy industry, there is a further obsolescence and reduction of fixed assets of municipal energy supply. The highest level of heat supply and utility rates is noted here. The strengthening of these energy threats is a factor limiting the social and economic growth of the Arctic territories. The author substantiates the conclusion that some of the previously existing territorial infrastructure advantages of the Russian Arctic territories have been lost. It has led to a reduction in the total number of heat supply units, thermal energy territorial production and also the length of heat and steam networks.</jats:p>",

This paper\naims to empirically investigate whether inflation is solely caused by the increase in money\nsupply beyond what is required by the economy, as maintained by monetarists using Nigerian\ndata. Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) was used as the tool of econometric\nanalysis on Nigerian time series data for 48 years. The ARDL was chosen because unit root\ntests were conducted. The results show that variables are not integrated in the same order.\nMoney supply increment is demonstrated to be inflationary only in the short-run. The existence\nof other factors that influence inflation in the country is also evident. While money supply has\nno significant influence on inflation, the GDP and the constant have a significant influence on\ninflation in the long-run. Therefore, justification is provided for the myth of monetarist theory\nof inflation, claiming that money supply increment is a sole source of inflation, especially in\nNigeria. Even though the result of the Wald test shows that the coefficients of money supply\ncombined have a significant effect on inflation in conformity with the monetarist theoretical\narguments, such effects are limited to short-run only. The findings of the research are limited\nto Nigeria whose data are used, based on ARDL as the econometrics techniques applied, for a\nperiod of 48 years from 1970–2017. Generally speaking, explanations for theories regarding\ninflation, especially in developing nations, should not be taken for granted. The research\nempirically demonstrates that the monetarist theory of inflation is a myth and not reality by\nusing Nigerian data. It also suggests that other theories should be empirically tested to check\nwhich one best explain the nature of inflation dynamics in a country to proffer a better solution\nto a high inflation rate problem.</jats:p>"

This must also be considered in efforts to manage and save the environment, which is currently the main focus of governments and businesses to preserve the environment. In addition to internal improvements were made, improvements are also needed on the part of contractors/suppliers to support this. In this regard, this study was conducted to develop a strategy for conducting an assessment in the contractors selection/suppliers in the upstream oil and gas industry with the aim of implementing Green Supply Chain Management with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. This study maps the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria in the contractors selection and obtains the main criteria in the contractors selection for the upstream oil and gas industry towards Green Supply Chain Management. Results of the study obtain 6 criteria and 23 evaluation criteria in the contractors selection in the upstream oil and gas industry towards Green Supply Chain Management. The two most important criteria obtained are the Environmental criteria and the Health and Safety criteria, both of which have an assessment weight of more than 50% of the total assessment weight. The next criteria obtained are the Quality (Technical), Technical (Shipping), and Price (Quality) criteria, where these criteria are taken into account in the selection of contractors for the upstream oil and gas industry towards Green Supply Chain Management, so that the spirit of competition remains with the contractor and companies have many options contractor to achieve Green Supply Chain Management.</jats:p>"

Based on the monitoring data on the water quality in Suya Lake Reservoir provided by water quality environmental monitoring agencies, this paper selected typical water quality indexes such as dissolved oxygen, permanganate (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) as the water quality assessment factors, and applied the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to assess the quality of water in the Suya Lake Reservoir on the basis of single factor assessment. The result shows that the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method can accurately quantify the fuzzy assessment of water quality. The main pollution factors in Suya Lake Reservoir are TP and TN, and pollution mainly occurs in the waters on the west bank of the reservoir (between the Cold Water River and the Lianjiang River), with the Huangxi River and its inlet being the most seriously polluted. This study provides some reference for the improvement to the water quality assessment model and scientific basis for the prevention and control of water environment pollution in the reservoir area.</jats:p>",

There are three players in the game model: new energy company and traditional energy company provide energy for the market and the State Grid at the same time. The State Grid is a retailer who buys electricity from two companies and supplies to the market after converting and transmitting the power. Three companies can invest in grid management for saving energy and reducing losses. The energy loss rate is an exponential function of line loss investment. Through the bifurcation graph, Lyapunov exponent, and the basin of parameter, the complex characteristics of the investment market are analyzed. It is interesting to find the Grazing–Hopf bifurcation which usually occurs in nonlinear circuits. The mixed expectation of bounded rationality and the naive expectation is conducive to suppressing the bifurcation and chaos of the market.

Solution to overcome supply parameters according to the needs of 10,000 tons/day is to provide a bulldozer with a capacity of 36 tons on the lot-hopper route at each coalyard. The alternative is to increase the number and capacity of the bulldozers in each coalyard, i.e. HR (48.48.36) and LR (48.48.48.36) with the chute-lot route, by regulating the bulldozer working shifts and by setting the time for unloading the ship.</jats:p>",

This presents a tremendous opportunity, as does the relative lack of work bringing together all three fields. We seek to set the stage for exploiting these opportunities by first describing how incorporating a series of key supply chain concepts—omni-channel, last-mile delivery, supply chain agility, supply chain resiliency, and service recovery—could enrich entrepreneurship research. We then explain how the boundaries of key entrepreneurship concepts—opportunity, entrepreneurial orientation, optimal distinctiveness, bricolage, and fear of failure—could be extended to the supply chain context. Both of these moves bring strategic management concepts into play, as well. In accomplishing our tasks, we draw on examples from how firms attempted to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic via moves spanning entrepreneurship, supply chain management, and strategic management. </jats:p>",

Managers’ adequate and timely response to their customers is considered vital due to blood perishability, uncertainty of blood demand, and the direct relationship between the availability/lack of blood supply and human life. Further to this, hospitals’ awareness of the optimal amount of requests from suppliers is vital to reducing blood return and blood loss, since the loss of blood products surely leads to high expenses. This paper aims to design an optimal management model of blood transfusion network by a synthesis of reusable simulation technique (applicable to all bases) and deep neural network (the latest neural network technique) with multiple recursive layers in the blood supply chain so that the costs of blood waste, return, and shortage can be reduced. The model was implemented on and developed for the blood transfusion network of Khorasan Razavi, which has 6 main bases active from October 2015 to October 2017. In order to validate the data, the data results of the variables examined with the real data were compared with those of the simulation, and the insignificant difference between them was investigated by <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">t</jats:italic> test. The solution of the model facilitated a better prediction of the amount of hospital demand, the optimal amount of safety reserves in the bases, the optimal number of hospital orders, and the optimal amount of hospital delivery. This prediction helps significantly reduce the return of blood units to bases, increase availability of inventories, and reduce costs.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>"

This reference model will support the development of a distribution system in the context of the supply chain in the phase of the system’s requirements definition, as well as in the final implementation of the system in real-life supply chain operations. The reference model is crucial for the easy and effective adoption of the system into companies’ processes. Therefore, the choice of the modeling tool can strongly support the design, development and implementation of the system. In this context, the application of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was carried out in order to select the appropriate tool, utilizing a combination of the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) I method for the decision-making with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for the calculation of the weights of the evaluation criteria. The MCDA’s results showed that the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) Architect &amp; Designer Tool was the one that better met the evaluation criteria. The sensitivity analysis that followed the MCDA reaffirmed its results by revealing that this tool had the highest consistency, despite the changes in the scenarios.</jats:p>"

Here we show that five different GGPPS isoforms exist in tomato (<jats:italic>Solanum lycopersicum</jats:italic>). From these, SlGGPPS1, 2 and 3 (or SlG1-3 in short) produce GGPP in plastids and exhibit similar kinetic parameters. Phytoene synthase (PSY) converts GGPP into phytoene, the first committed intermediate of the carotenoid pathway. Gene expression and co-expression network analyses showed a preferential association of individual GGPPS and PSY isoforms in processes linked to carotenoid biosynthesis such as root mycorrhization, seedling deetiolation and fruit ripening. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SlG2, but not SlG3, physically interacts with PSY proteins. By contrast, CRISPR-Cas9 mutants defective in SlG3 showed a stronger impact on carotenoid levels and derived metabolic, physiological and developmental phenotypes that those impaired in SlG2. Double mutants with a simultaneous knockout of both genes could not be found. Our work demonstrates that the bulk of GGPP production in tomato chloroplasts and chromoplasts relies on two cooperating GGPPS paralogs, unlike other plant species such as<jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>, rice or pepper, which produce their essential plastidial isoprenoids using a single GGPPS isoform.</jats:p>"

The LC–LC RC has the characteristics of low power consumption, high efficiency and uses the voltage gain of the resonant circuit itself and a voltage doubler rectifier circuit instead of the transformer to reduce the size and weight of the overall circuit. A detailed ac analysis with fundamental frequency approximation of the LC–LC RC is presented. Expressions for converter gain, operating condition of the converter as a constant‐current power supply, and condition of the converter voltage and current zero‐phase difference are derived. In addition, RC design value conditions for the minimum resonant network size are derived. An experimental 1.05 A 120 V prototype converter is designed, developed, and tested to verify the theoretical analysis. Experimental results indicate that this circuit is suitable for use in capacitor charging to increase the stimulation performance of TMS.</jats:p>",

Biological roughing filtration combining with low energy consumption and simple operation would be a potential solution to this issue. This study was conducted to investigate ammonium removal by biological up-flow roughing filter packed with ceramic media. Low flow rate did affect the ammonium removal and higher flow rate was suggested, while intense backwashing only showed a slight impact. At 4 m/h, an average reduction of about 51% was obtained, and NH4+-N effluent concentration could be below 0.5 mg/L within a NH4+-N loading rate of 0.1 kg/(m3·d). Biomass and biological activity assessment were performed as well as microbial community analysis. High abundance of nitrifying bacteria contributed to ammonium removal with Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas accounting for 6.59% and 1.12% of the bacteria community, respectively. In addition, the roughing filter showed high turbidity removal efficiency of about 70%. This study suggested that a biological roughing filter could be employed to help rural drinking water plants adapt to the seasonal change and moderate deterioration of source water quality in terms of ammonium pollution with low-cost and simple operation.</jats:p>",

In this methodology, by proposing some criteria such as universality, equity, enforceability, adaptivity, and exclusivity, a new scheme is developed in order to determine the share of water users. For taking the available water uncertainty into account, the concept of conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used, in which the goal is to minimize an indicator of loss in low flow conditions. Also, in order to estimate the relative weights of criteria, a novel method is introduced. This method is founded on two essential information aggregation operators, namely, hybrid weighted averaging (HWA) and ordered weighted averaging (OWA). The significant property of this method is that the weighting process is done by considering the relative weights of experts and the viewpoint of the analyzer jointly. The results of the CVaR-based model are compared with those obtained from a long-term water allocation optimization model with monthly time steps. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using available data from the Solakan–Rafsanjan water transfer project.</jats:p>",

Within this aim, an in‐depth literature review on barriers was conducted by covering all supply chain stages and circular initiatives in textile industry. Then, a focus group study was implemented. In the focus group study, barriers related to supply chains that prevent companies to implement the circular economy were discussed and validated. As a result, a total of 25 barriers were classified under nine main categories such as (a) management and decision‐making, (b) labour, (c) design challenges, (d) materials, (e) rules and regulations, (f) lack of knowledge and awareness, (g) lack of integration and collaboration, (h) cost, and (i) technical infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Therefore, an adsorbent was prepared by carbonizing a dried Sargassum boveanum macroalgae. The prepared biosorbent was investigated for adsorptive removal of DMP from aqueous solution. After carbonization, the biochar derived from S. boveanum macroalgae (BCM) removed almost 100% of DMP adsorbate. Effects of contact time, solution pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent mass, and temperature have been studied. It has been found that, within the experimental conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity is 17 mg/g, rate of adsorption follows pseudo-second order kinetics and the adsorption isotherm experimental data fit the Freundlich model. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated and it has been found that the adsorption of DMP on BCM is endothermic and thermodynamically favorable, and in addition the surface of BCM adsorbent shows affinity to the DMP molecules. The BCM adsorbent has the capability to remove around 65% of DMP from high saline seawater contaminated with DMP. Moreover, the prepared BCM adsorbent was reusable for at least four times in seawater for removal of DMP contaminant.</jats:p>",

To gain more and more market share, the manufacturer and the retailer implement unconditional return strategy, which does not affect secondary sales. We build a differential game model for the optimal advertising and the optimal advertising cost sharing proportion for centralized and decentralized OAO (Online and Offline) supply chain considering customer returns rates. We further analyze how the returns rates affect the optimal decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer. The results show that the returns rates, the brand reputation and the influence factors of retail channel goodwill on demand of online direct channel strongly influence the optimal advertising decisions. Furthermore, the retailer does not support for the manufacturer advertising efforts in Stackelberg game. Compared with the centralized OAO supply chain, the decentralized system results in channel inefficiency. To coordinate the channels, we design a two-way advertising cost-sharing contract. By this contract, each member of the supply chain reaches a win-win situation and is willing to cooperate. Numerical studies verify the conclusions of this paper.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, many vegetable growers are already facing relatively long unprecedented precipitation-free periods. In many growing regions, irrigation is only available to a limited extent or not at all, and the cultivated plants will suffer from moderate water stress more often. Therefore, we examined the effects of moderately-reduced water supply on the chemical composition of pickling cucumber, cultivated in an open field and in a separate greenhouse trial. In the field trial, the reduced water supply treatment (RWS) provided 85–90% of the total water amount of the well-watered control treatment (CTR), applying a randomized block design with six replications comprising two consecutive weekly harvest periods. In fruits obtained by cultivation with reduced irrigation, levels of malic acid, calcium, and magnesium significantly increased, while those of phosphate, phosphorous, nitrogen, and iron decreased based on dry matter. Fresh matter-related results additionally revealed a decrease of myo-inositol and zinc, while sugars and total phenols remained unchanged. In the greenhouse experiment, the RWS obtained 60% of the irrigation amount of the CTR. Here, single cucumber compartments (exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp) were examined. Chemical compositions changed in a similar, but more pronounced, manner as compared to the open field trial. The levels of individual, nutritionally relevant carotenoids in the peel of pickling cucumber, like lutein and β-carotene, were affected by RWS. Regarding the nutritional quality of fresh marketable cucumber fruits, malic acid, certain minerals and trace elements, as well as the carotenoids were shown to be sensitive to moderate water reduction.</jats:p>"

Smart cities have successfully applied the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in many sectors. Moreover, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can analyze and process large data sets produced by IoT sensors in real-time. Traditional business processes are too rigid in expressing the dynamic behavior of water supply systems. Every execution path must be explicitly specified. On the other hand, declarative business processes allow execution paths that are not prohibited by the rules, providing more flexibility for water supply managers. This paper joins together IoT, CEP, and declarative processes to create a powerful, efficient, and flexible architecture (REFlex Water) to manage water supply systems. To the knowledge of the authors, REFlex Water is the first solution to combine these technologies in the context of water supply systems. The paper describes the REFlex Water architecture and demonstrates its application to a real water system from a Brazilian municipality. Results are promising, and the managers from the Brazilian water company are expanding the use of REFlex Water to other sectors of their water supply system.</jats:p>"

Recent years, financial risk analysis for SMEs attracts lots of attentions from financial institutions.\n\nHowever, the financial risk analysis for SMEs usually suffers data deficiency problem, especially for the mobile financial institutions which seldom collect credit-related data directly from SMEs.\n\nFortunately, although credit-related information of SMEs is hard to be acquired sufficiently, the interactive relationships between SMEs, which may contain valuable information of financial risk, is usually available for the mobile financial institutions.\n\nFinding out credit-related relationship of SME from massive interactions helps comprehensively model the SMEs thus improve the performance of financial risk analysis.\n\n\n\nIn this paper, tackling the data deficiency problem of financial risk analysis for SMEs, we propose an innovative financial risk analysis framework with graph-based supply chain mining.\n\nSpecifically, to capture the credit-related topology structural and temporal variation information of SMEs, we design and employ a novel spatial-temporal aware graph neural network,  to mine supply chain relationship on a SME graph, and then analysis the credit risk based on the mined supply chain graph.\n\nExperimental results on real-world financial datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposal for financial risk analysis for SMEs.</jats:p>",

Organizations are making significant effort to understand customer needs and subsequently align them to the business goals for achieving market leadership. It is imperative for the longevity of the organization that goods and services be made available to the customer at the most appropriate place, time, and price. Supply chains are contributing to achieving this organizational goal. A paradigm shift was observed in the past few decades when organizations competed as supply chains in the market more than an individual brand. This shift brought forward the importance of collaborative supply chains. Researchers in this study have presented the impact of IoT origins on real-time data on a collaborative supply chain model, including internally and externally aligned parameters. The study recommends the best model basis for the goodness of fit from the customer and vendor perspective for the automotive industry in India.</p>",

Particular attention should be paid to the processes of crops’ productivity formation under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors. The goal of our study was to provide new theoretical knowledge about the dependence of vegetable crops’ productivity on water supply and heat income. The study was conducted in the irrigated conditions of the semi-arid cold Steppe zone on the fields of the Institute of Irrigated Agriculture of NAAS, Kherson, Ukraine. We studied the historical data of productivity of three most common in the region vegetable crops: potato, tomato, onion. The crops were cultivated by using the generally accepted in the region agrotechnology. Historical yielding and meteorological data of the period 1990–2016 were used to develop the models of the vegetable crops’ productivity. We used two approaches: development of pair linear models in three categories (“yield – water use”, “yield – sum of the effective air temperatures above 10°C”); development of complex linear regression models taking into account such factors as total water use, and temperature regime during the crops’ vegetation. Pair linear models of the crops’ productivity showed that the highest effect on the yields of potato and onion has the water use index (R2 of 0.9350 and 0.9689, respectively), and on the yield of tomato – temperature regime (R2 of 0.9573). The results of pair analysis were proved by the multiple regression analysis that revealed the same tendencies in the crop yield formation depending on the studied factors.</jats:p>"

Variables including medical council codes, GP names, surnames and national ID codes were used for data linkage among the three sources. Three sources CRC method was applied using log-linear models to estimate the total number of active GPs in STATA software.\r\nResults: Overall, 27,048 GPs were identified after removing the duplicate records. Based on CRC three sources data, the total number of GPs were 53,630 in 2015-2016. Distribution of GPs per 1,000 population among the provinces indicates that provinces of Kohgiluyeh &amp; Boyer Ahmad, Mazandaran, Golestan and Yazd with ratios of 1.28, 1.28, 1.21 and 1.17 physicians rank the highest proportion of GPs and the provinces of Sistan &amp; Baluchestan, Ilam, Zanjan, Alborz, North Khorasan with corresponding ratios of 0.24, 0.40, 0.40, 0.43 and 0.45 GPs ranked the lowest.\r\nConclusion: CRC method is known to be the best and rapidest method to estimate active GP due to its compatibility for the current situation of databanks in Iran.

Through 18 cases, the aarticle addresses the different types of static SC complexity faced by the different tiers of the SC. For the focal company, the complexity is both upstream and downstream: for first‐tier suppliers, it is upstream, and for second‐tier suppliers, the complexity is largely downstream. These various types of complexity require the adoption of different sustainability practices: for the focal company, these involve sourcing and organizational practices; for the first‐tier suppliers, they involve sourcing practices; and for the second‐tier suppliers, organizational practices.</jats:p>",

Through measurement of soil moisture content, the spring wheat growth and yield index, the influences of deficit irrigation on soil moisture distribution and spring wheat growth were studied. Results showed that, in the soil layers 0–100 cm below the ground, the soil moisture content under full irrigation at 100% ETc (ETc denotes actual water demanded by crops) and that under deficit irrigation at 80% ETc increased with the increase of soil layer depth; specifically, soil moisture under deficit irrigation at 60% ETc was mainly distributed in the subsurface layer (20–40 cm) and the middle layer (40–60 cm). The spring wheat yield was not greatly influenced by the deficit irrigation at 80% ETc, showing a decrease of merely 5–13% compared with that under full irrigation, while deficit irrigation at 60% ETc had greater impact on the growth and yield of spring wheat, cutting the yield by 10–37% in comparison with that under full irrigation. In the study area, the deficit irrigation treatment at 80% ETc was adopted, wherein the irrigation norm in the growth period was 288 mm. This irrigation system had little adverse impact on spring wheat growth and yield, and therefore, water-saving irrigation could be realized.</jats:p>",

When developing the system of criteria, we moved away from the hierarchical approach related to the three pillars of sustainability; therefore, a wide range of notions were assessed based on a population representative survey data collected in Hungary. We used algebraic methods to explore the internal structure of the set of criteria that had been previously defined by means of social sciences, while the importance weights were specified by applying the method of analytic network process.

Fractal originally is a general term for a graph, structure or phenomenon that does not have a feature length but has a statistically significant self-similarity; fractal theory is an emerging edge science that describes the complex system with a random structure and has been widely used in physics, chemistry, geography, economics and many other fields. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous published literature works, this paper expounded the research situation and significance of risk measurement in supply chain finance, elaborated the development background, current status and future challenges of fractal theory, proposed the improved fractal volatility model and financial evaluation model, performed risk analysis of supply chain finance through evaluation modeling and elastic fractal dimension, constructed a financial risk measurement model based on fractal theory, and discussed the importance of model parameter estimation, residual test and accuracy examination in risk measurement of supply chain finance. The final empirical analysis shows that the improved fractal volatility model and the proposed financial risk measurement model has better risk measurement ability under different out-of-sample prediction periods, and obtain more accurate conclusion of asymmetry determination of financial assets gains under the common inspection level. The study results of this paper provide a reference for the further researches on risk measurement of supply chain finance based on fractal theory. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, debris flows often self‐organize into distinct surges, but the factors controlling the magnitude and frequency of these surges, including sediment supply and grain size, are poorly constrained. We use a combination of numerical modeling and debris flow monitoring data from Chalk Cliffs, Colorado, USA, to explore how sediment supply influences rainfall ID thresholds for debris flows and surge properties. Results suggest that rainfall ID thresholds only become sensitive to sediment supply below a sediment thickness threshold. Surge magnitude is a nonmonotonic function of sediment supply (i.e., channel bed sediment thickness and grain size) with the largest surges tending to form at intermediate values of sediment availability with intermediate grain sizes.</jats:p>",

LY-B cells derive from a CHO line in which serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), thus<jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>SL synthesis, is suppressed, while maintaining the capacity of taking up and metabolizing exogenous sphingoid bases from the culture medium. In the present study LY-B cells were adapted to grow in a fetal bovine serum (FBS)-deficient medium to avoid external uptake of lipids. The lowest FBS concentration that allowed LY-B cell growth, though at a slow rate, under our conditions was 0.04%, i.e. 250-fold less than the standard (10%) concentration. Cells grown under limiting SL concentrations remained viable for at least 72 h. Enriching with sphingomyelin the SL-deficient medium allowed the recovery of control LY-B cell growth rates. Studies including whole cells, plasma membrane preparations, and derived lipid vesicles were carried out. Laurdan fluorescence was recorded to measure membrane molecular order, showing a significant decrease in the rigidity of LY-B cells, not only in plasma membrane but also in whole cell lipid extract, as a result of SL limitation in the growth medium. Plasma membrane preparations and whole cell lipid extracts were also studied using atomic force microscopy in the force spectroscopy mode. Force measurements demonstrated that lower breakthrough forces were required to penetrate samples obtained from SL-poor LY-B cells than those obtained from control cells. Mass-spectroscopic analysis was also a helpful tool to understand the rearrangement undergone by the LY-B cell lipid metabolism. The most abundant SL in LY-B cells, sphingomyelin, decreased by about 85% as a result of SL limitation in the medium, the bioactive lipid ceramide and the ganglioside precursor hexosylceramide decreased similarly, together with cholesterol. Quantitative SL analysis showed that a 250-fold reduction in sphingolipid supply to LY-B cells led to a 6-fold decrease in membrane sphingolipids, underlining the resistance to changes in composition of these cells. Plasma membrane compositions exhibited similar changes, at least qualitatively, as the whole cells with SL restriction. A linear correlation was observed between the sphingomyelin concentration in the membranes, the degree of lipid order as measured by laurdan fluorescence, and membrane breakthrough forces assessed by atomic force microscopy. Concomitant changes were detected in glycerophospholipids under SL-restriction conditions.</jats:p>"

In the present study, a pulse DC power supply is used to energize the electromagnet of magnetorheological (MR) finishing tool. The experiments have been conducted on EN-31 flat workpiece surface with and without pulse DC power supply using a magnetizing current (MC) 2.5 A, a working gap (WG) of 1.5 mm and a rotational speed of the tool (RST) of 500 rpm with a feed rate of workpiece of 50 mm/min. The study has been carried out to analyse the effect of the duty cycle on the response percentage reduction in surface roughness. It has been observed that an improved response percentage reduction in surface roughness has been found with pulsating DC power supply as compared to the response percentage reduction in surface roughness obtained with DC power supply without pulse at the same process parameters. After conducting the preliminary experiments, the statistical analysis was done to analyse the effect of various process parameters on the response percentage reduction in surface roughness using response surface methodology (RSM) at 0.16 duty cycle.</jats:p>",

First, the heat transfer models of FPCs and PTCs were constructed by a lumped parameter method and validated by experiments. Then, the performance of collectors and the operating modes of different thermal utilization methods were obtained. Finally, by inputting the meteorological parameters of Tianjin, the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) The evaluation indices of UCE and PER were consistent when evaluating different collector systems. The FPC system was more appropriate for hot water supply and heating, and the PTC system was more suitable for cooling and heating and cooling. (2) The hot water supply had the best energy saving and was economical compared to other solar thermal utilization methods with FPC and PTC systems, as its UCE was 0.19 RMB/kW h and 0.28 RMB/kW h and PER was 1.38 and 1.17, respectively. (3) The operating ratio of both the hot water supply and cooling was higher than 50% in both collector systems. The heating system had the lowest operating ratio, less than 40%, which was related to its load characteristics.</jats:p>",

A comparative analysis of the competencies reveals that, although some of the competencies required by the jobs are taught adequately at the universities, a few key concepts and topics are not covered at sufficient depth as needed by the jobs. The research also shows that many traditional analytics topics are being over-taught at the universities when compared with the demand, whereas some key soft skills are not addressed at a sufficient level in many programs.

Detailed multiphase contaminant fate and transport models linked to hydrodynamic models are ideal for determining the potential impact of oil spills on drinking water sources. However, sufficient data are often unavailable to simulate spills scenarios. Thus, a simple semiquantitative modeling approach is proposed that is based on documented pipeline spills recorded in scientific literature. A risk matrix was used to combine the consequences of a spill with the probability that it would contaminate drinking water sources. The new Pipeline Spill Risk Assessment Framework was applied to 26 drinking water intakes located in the greater Montreal area (Quebec). The proposed framework allows for transparency and facilitation of public discussions with regard to oil spill risks and decision‐making for source water protection and water safety plans.</jats:p>",

Groundwater can be an important nonpoint contributor of phosphorus to surface water bodies. Most groundwater phosphorus is in the form of orthophosphate and orthophosphate concentrations in California groundwater vary temporally and geographically. This study quantifies orthophosphate concentrations in water samples from public supply wells in California, evaluates temporal trends (both step and monotonic trends) in orthophosphate concentration for different areas of the state, and explores potential explanatory factors for the trends observed. Orthophosphate concentrations are low in 42 percent of the groundwater used for public supply in California, moderate in 43 percent, and high in 15 percent of this groundwater relative to reference conditions and a goal expressed by the USEPA for streams overlying the aquifers. The findings also suggest that orthophosphate concentrations increased in approximately one-third of this groundwater during the study period (2000 to 2018). The timing of orthophosphate increases observed in time-series evaluations coincided approximately with the timing of increases observed in step-trend evaluations, with both suggesting that the increasing trend occurred mostly before 2011. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the statewide dataset indicates that orthophosphate concentrations are antithetically related to dissolved oxygen (DO), and weakly associated with boron, arsenic, and fluoride. Step trend and time-series trend analyses using PCA were inconclusive.</jats:p>",

The Romani car industry grew quite a bit after the 1990s. The arrival of the world’s major car companies has cemented the domestic sector in adopting best practices in the supply chain. This has led to improved competitiveness and increased quantum exports. However, the Romanian car industry must operate in a unique environment that still presents challenges for the supply chain.

The sales from the online channels inevitably incur spillover effect to the traditional offline channels. This paper develops a dynamic pricing game model on the basis of a long-term gradient adjustment mechanism for a multichannel supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and an e-tailer and focuses on examining the impacts of spillover effect, agency fee, and adjustment speed on the stability and complexity of the dynamic game system. The results show that both a greater spillover effect and a higher agency fee can make the dynamic game system more stable, and a higher adjustment speed can destabilize the dynamic game system through period doubling bifurcation. Furthermore, it is interesting to find that the destabilization of the game system benefits the e-tailer and the supply chain while having little influence on the manufacturer, and thus the dynamic adjustment strategy may improve the supply chain efficiency.</jats:p>",

In this manuscript, we also introduce the concept of bounded ethicality and how it is incorporated into the role‐play scenario debrief phase.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) has successfully combated modern-day slavery by transforming the ways that over a dozen major brands, including Taco Bell, Subway, and Wal-Mart, manage their supply chains. The CIW’s efforts over more than 20 years have effectively stopped enslavement practices, including abuses such as wage theft and peonage indebtedness. We conducted a field ethnography, interviews, and archival analyses to understand this success. We find that the CIW employs a decentered, egalitarian, and ensemble approach to their multiplicities of alliances by collectively “animating” themselves and their partners through ensemble leadership. This combination of alliances, along with worker-driven monitoring, brings life to the CIW motto “We are all leaders.” Translating this motto into daily practice is how the CIW virtually eradicates enslavement practices in corporate supply chains. </jats:p>",

Using dynamic theory, the complex behaviors of the dynamic system are discussed; besides, the parameter adaptation method is adopted to restrain the chaos phenomenon. The conclusions are as follows: the stable scope of the green supply chain system enlarges with decision makers’ risk-aversion level increasing and decreases with service value increasing; excessive adjustment of price parameters will make the green supply chain system fall into chaos with a large entropy value; the attraction domain of initial prices shrinks with price adjustment speed increasing and enlarges with the channel service values raising. As the dynamic game model system is in a chaotic state, the profit of the manufacturer will be damaged, while the efficiency of the retailer will be improved. The system would be kept at a stable state and casts off chaos by the parameter adaptation method. Results are significant for the manager to make reasonable price decision.</jats:p>",

By formulating the problem as a multiperiod stochastic inventory model, we demonstrate that its optimal inventory policy is an order‐up‐to level policy. We develop an effective algorithm combining scenario‐based optimization and Lagrangian relaxation for quickly and approximately calculating the order‐up‐to levels.

Iron is a key element in the Earth climate system as it can enhance the marine primary productivity in the High-Nutrient Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions where, despite a high concentration of major nutrients, the chlorophyll production is low due to iron limitation. One of the main Fe sources to the ocean is Aeolian dust. For this reason, ice cores provide a sensitive and continuous archive for reconstructing Fe fluxes over the last millennia. Here we show the first Northern Hemisphere Fe record retrieved from the NEEM ice core, which offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the past Fe fluxes in the Arctic region over the last 108 kyr. Holocene Fe fluxes to the Arctic were three times lower than the average recorded over the last glacial period. They were greater during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4). Comparing our data with palaeoceanographic records retrieved from the HNLC North Pacific, we demonstrated that during the coldest periods, characterized by the highest Fe fluxes, marine productivity in the subarctic Pacific Ocean did not increase due to a greater sea-ice extent and the absence of upwelling nutrient supply. This supports the hypothesis that Fe-fertilization was more effective in other regions, such as the transition zone of the North Pacific, where a closer relationship between marine productivity and the Aeolian Fe fluxes was observed.\n                        </jats:p>"

Peroxone is an effective advanced oxidation process, which combines ozone with hydrogen peroxide to create hydroxyl radicals that decompose organic compounds. 2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is one of the significant taste and odor causing compounds, which can be removed with the peroxone process. In this study, removal of a 2-MIB compound by peroxone process was investigated in a pilot-scale treatment plant and optimum operational conditions were determined. For safety reasons, it is important that residual O3 and H2O2 concentrations in the water leaving the reactor should not exceed 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. Results indicate that while dissolved ozone concentration was below the indicated limit for all experiments, concentrations over 0.5 mg/L residual H2O2 were observed during the experiments with an H2O2:O3 ratio of 0.5. This limit exceedance affected the decision on the ideal peroxone ratio along with the 2-MIB removal results. Therefore; optimum H2O2:O3 ratio was determined as 0.3. 2-MIB removal efficiency of 81% was achieved at the optimum H2O2:O3 ratio with a contact time of 15 min. According to the results, 2-MIB removal rate had a linear correlation with the contact time.</jats:p>",

The export value of textile and garment products in recent years has ranked number two in the country’s total export revenue. In this scenario, an attempt was made to examine the service quality at the manufacturer – distributor interface of the textile supply chain and provide clear guidelines for benchmarking of service quality in multi-unit services. A sample of 144 distributors from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in major regions of South Vietnam was selected. Exploratory Factor Analysis was used to identify the critical factors of service quality. This research applies the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to the computation of a measure of overall service quality and benchmarking when measuring service quality with the Service Performance model. Dealing with the five dimensions of Service Performance (SERVPERF) as outputs, the proposed approach uses DEA as a tool for multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), in particular, the pure output DEA model without inputs. Data envelopment analysis measures the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) and identifies a set of corresponding efficient DMUs that can be used as benchmarks for the improvement of inefficient DMUs. The findings shed valuable insights on measures and critical underlying dimensions of service quality in the context of the supply chain in the textile industry, specifically from the distributor perspective. The results also give the best performer in textile SMEs and set the benchmarking guideline within each group among SEMsKeywords: service quality, data envelopment analysis, SERVPERF</jats:p>"

Due to that reason fast food industry has to face various types of supply chain uncertainties and risk than ever before. The supply chain uncertainty and risk have significant impacts on organizational performance in the fast food industry because most of the procedures are associated with the human interactions and mostly it depends on the forecasted data. Even though the supply chain uncertainty and risk have an impact on the organizational performance, as people they perceive it differently according to their perception. The workers who work in the fast food outlets may have a different perception on the impact of supply chain uncertainty and risk on their organizational performance. This is called Perceived Organizational Performance. The purpose of this paper is to present how workers who work in the fast food outlets perceive the impact of supply chain uncertainty and risk on the organizational performance in their outlets. The research study was done specifically to Anuradhapura district. The empirical data was collected from the fast food outlets’ workers within the Anuradhapura District. The main focus in here is to identify the impact that each source of supply chain uncertainty and risk have on the Perceived Organizational Performance. They are (1) Logistic uncertainty and risk, (2) Information uncertainty and risk, and (3) Customer related uncertainty and risk and (4) Environmental uncertainty and risk. These results contribute to the supply chain uncertainty and risk literature. In addition, it provides an insight into future researches relating to the fast food industry and Perceived Organizational Performance.</jats:p>"

We used small area data from the 2001 and 2011 English censuses to measure the prevalence and intensity (i.e. the number of hours of informal care provided) of informal care in the population. We controlled for changes in age structure, health, deprivation, income, employment and education. The effects of the change in formal social care provision on informal care were analysed through instrumental variable models to account for the well-known endogeneity. We found that informal care provision had increased over the period, particularly among high-intensity carers (20+ hours per week). We also found that the reduction in publicly-funded formal care provision was associated with significant increases in high-intensity (20+ hours per week) informal care provision, suggesting a substitutive relationship between formal and informal care of that intensity in the English system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) on the financial performance of firms. Academic/practical relevance: The GEJE was characterized as the most significant disruption ever for global supply chains. In its aftermath, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains, and there were calls to redesign and restructure supply chains. Methodology: We empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices of firms. Our analyses are based on a global sample of 470 firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify affected firms, as well as 382 firms that are not mentioned in the business press but are in industries potentially subject to contagion or competitive effects. Results: We estimate that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the GEJE lost on average 5.21% of their shareholder value during the one-month period after the GEJE. For Japanese firms, the effect was much more severe with an average 9.32% loss in shareholder value. Non-Japanese firms averaged a 3.73% loss in shareholder value. We also find that upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects from the GEJE are negative, and the contagion effect on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative. For firms in the rebuilding industries or competitors to firms affected by the GEJE, the competitive effect from the GEJE is positive. Managerial implications: The loss suffered by both Japanese firms and non-Japanese firms experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the GEJE is economically significant. Although the loss is more severe for firms whose operations were directly affected by the GEJE, it is also significant for firms who experienced indirect effects from their upstream and downstream supply chain partners, further confirming the importance of supply chain risk mitigation strategies. </jats:p>",

On the basis of these three power supply modes, the indexes of AC-DC hybrid distribution network are extracted, and the comprehensive evaluation index system is established. A comprehensive evaluation model of AC / DC hybrid distribution network suitable for new energy access is proposed, which aims to maximize economic benefits. The example shows that the optimal power supply mode can be selected through the evaluation model when the proportion of new energy is different, which can lay a foundation for the future distribution network to better serve users on the premise of distribution network profitability.</jats:p>",

The creation of relational capital (RC) within a firm is a well‐researched concept; however, few studies investigated the customer/supplier leveraging mechanisms that build relational capital in SCs. In this study, we propose a model to examine the effects of supplier and customer leveraging on the creation of RC, which impacts innovation performance (IP). The empirical data for this study were drawn from the fifth round of the Global Manufacturing Research Group survey project (data collected from 557 manufacturing plants, in 10 countries). The hypotheses were empirically tested using structural equation modelling. The findings highlight the importance of SC leveraging towards building RC, in order to enhance innovation performance. The results show that supplier and customer leveraging positively impact the RC. In turn, the RC has a significant impact on IP. We found that the effect of SC leveraging directly and indirectly (partial mediated by RC) associates with the innovation performance. These findings are underpinned by the relational view, which argues that the relationships between firms are an important unit of analysis for understanding competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

At the same time, technological and production equipment is being modernized, and timber supply chains are being optimized.  A large number of timber industry enterprises have increased the volume of transportation of round timber by water modes of transport, in particular, in rafts in the North-West Federal District of the Russian Federation in recent years.  Pile piers are used to prevent \"drying\" of rafts and fastening of forest transport units in a riverbed. In the case when the enterprise’s raid is at the mouth of the river,  the pile pier is subjected to additional loads due to freezing of ice and fluctuation of the water level in the river as a result of tidal phenomena in the spring-winter period. ВAs a result, pile pier is dismantled by ice. It leads to the annual replacement of pile dolphins in spring after passing the ice drift. According to the authors, this is not economically profitable, as it forces enterprises to spend annually labor and material resources on the manufacture and installation of pile channel piers. However, their installation should be carried out in a short time. When studying the state of the issue, a pile pier with an increased holding force has been  selected, which is additionally equipped with a holding device in the form of a driven anchor. The paper presents the results of a study of the state of the question under study, the research methodology, analysis of experimental data and the obtained mathematical dependencies.

This paper focuses on the refinement of a spatial–temporal clustering process able to encapsulate the spatial distribution of travel demand and supply. It illustrates the potential of such process to assist in the development of an objective diagnosis of the quality of the configuration of transit services. The two tools composing this process are presented in this paper, Traclus_DL and Grille_CR. A literature review is conducted on the main concepts such as corridors and grids, which will give a better understanding of the contributions proposed in this paper. Traclus_DL is a spatial clustering algorithm for desire lines (direct line from origin to destination) developed by Bahbouh. This paper will explain how this algorithm works and will also present improvements that were implemented to facilitate its usage and to give a better representation of the reality. Grille_CR is an automated smoothing tool which facilitates the visualization and the interpretation of the results produced by Traclus-DL. This paper explains how this process can be implemented and illustrates its relevance for public transport analysis and design. The major contribution of this paper is the implementation of a tool which helps better understand the spatial configuration of the demand in transport. </jats:p>",

This paper considers a coopetition supply chain consisting of an upstream original design manufacturer (ODM) and a downstream original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and proposes a dynamic Cournot game under bounded rationality. To cope with a dynamic repeated game in discrete time, a gradient adjustment mechanism is adopted. Furthermore, bifurcation diagram, largest Lyapunov exponent, basin of attraction, and critical curve are introduced to investigate the dynamic behavior of this game. The results obtained show that as the firms’ policy adjustment speeds increase, the stability region of the dynamic system gradually narrows, but one special finding is that the complex behavior of the dynamic system is alleviated as the OEM’s adjustment speed greatly increases. Moreover, when the difference between the two firms’ adjustment speeds is relatively small, the dynamic adjustment strategy is beneficial to the coopetition supply chain and both firms under certain adjustment speeds, as compared to a one-shot game. In addition, a higher product substitutability has a positive impact on the system stability, pushing the “cooperation” business alliance towards a more coordinated outcome.</jats:p>",

Discharge characteristics are discussed based on discharge current oscillation and radial–azimuthal discharge photography. A highly oscillative operation regime is found to be accompanied by radially enlarged expansion of discharge under limited electron currents. Further increases in neutral inhomogeneity lead to quiescent discharge combined with enhanced electron currents and an azimuthally separated ionization region. An axial one-dimensional classical view of electron flow is found to explain the observed electron current evolution only until moderate propellant inhomogeneity occurs. Through discharge image analysis, it is shown that plasma inhomogeneity increases linearly with respect to the input neutral particle inhomogeneity. The evolution of the inhomogeneity does not capture a stepwise increase in the electron current during discharge mode changes; however, the monotonic increase featured in each discharge regime shows that the azimuthal gradient of plasma properties can contribute to increased electron current. Lastly, the weakened magnetic barrier to electron flow resulting from axial–azimuthal variation in plasma structures is presented as another possible cause of increased electron current in nonuniform propellant operations.</jats:p>",

To cover this gap of knowledge, seeds of two different local ecotypes of C. spinosum L. originating from a coastal and a montane habitat of the island of Crete were propagated, and the obtained seedlings were grown hydroponically. The supplied nutrient solution differed in the total-N level (4 or 16 mmol L−1) and N source (NH4-N/-N/total-N: 0.05, 0.25, or 0.50). The impact of N supply level and N source ratio on the metabolism of the two ecotypes was assessed by gas chromatography–electron impact–mass spectrometry (GC/EI/MS) metabolomics combined with bioinformatics analyses. A general disturbance of the plants’ metabolism was recorded, with results revealing that the genotypic composition was the predominant factor for the observed discriminations. The montane ecotype exhibited substantially lower levels of metabolites such as fructose and α-α-trehalose, and higher levels of glucose, myo-inositol, and fatty acids compared to the coastal ecotype when both were treated with low N. Carboxylic acids and metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were also substantially affected by the N supply level and the NH4-N/total-N ratio. The obtained information could be further exploited in the breeding of cultivars with improved nutritional value and resilience to variations in N supply levels and sources.</jats:p>"

The Antarctic Peninsula has been described as a recruitment hot spot and as a potentially important source region for larval and juvenile krill dispersal. However, there has been no analysis to spatially resolve regional-scale krill population dynamics across life stages. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in krill demography using two decades of austral summer data collected along the North and West Antarctic Peninsula since 1993. We identified persistent spatial segregation in the summer distribution of euphausiid larvae (E. superba plus other species), which were concentrated in oceanic waters along the continental slope, and E. superba recruits, which were concentrated in shelf and coastal waters. Mature females of E. superba were more abundant over the continental shelf than the slope or coast. Euphausiid larval abundance was relatively localized and weakly correlated between the North and West Antarctic Peninsula, while E. superba recruitment was generally synchronized throughout the entire region. Euphausiid larval abundance along the West Antarctic Peninsula slope explained E. superba recruitment in shelf and coastal waters the next year. Given the localized nature of krill productivity, it is critical to evaluate the connectivity between upstream and downstream areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. Krill fishery catch distributions and population projections in the context of a changing climate should account for ontogenetic habitat partitioning, regional population connectivity, and highly variable recruitment.</jats:p>",

While the crisis is still playing out in the United States and around the world, it is nevertheless appropriate to begin to assess its impact. This article asks: What documentable public failures provide a deeper understanding of the U.S. government COVID-19 responses’ impact on supply chains? Case examples show that markets were adversely affected in ways that caused avoidable shortages of critical goods and supplies. Moreover, public procurement effectiveness was likely reduced by short-run efforts to obtain political advantage. The article begins with a brief review of disaster procurement, highlighting how public procurement professionals tried to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next section delineates three politically led phenomena that adversely impacted procurement’s ability to acquire the needed goods and services, including a lack of cohesive strategy in acquiring essential personal protective equipment; preference for unproven drugs and magical thinking; and cozy relationships between the public and private sectors. The article concludes by discussing the centrality of public sector procurement professionals as a critical link for effective provision of government services, especially in times of crisis. </jats:p>",

In this context, the aim of the current paper is to analyze the potential of using photovoltaic panels to power the water pumps utilized in both agriculture and supply of households in Romania and what the resulting impact would be from the ecological standpoint, as well as the economic and social one. The impact assessment follows the guideline proposed by the European House Ambrosetti latest publication regarding the socioeconomic impacts of the energy transition in Europe, but proposes a granular approach rather than a global one. The literature review of the existing publications presents an overview of the conclusions reached so far regarding water pumps powered by photovoltaic energy used for different purposes, such as the environmental and economic benefits of heat pump water heaters which are powered by photovoltaic energy or the performance comparison between photovoltaic heating systems and traditional ones. The current paper has the purpose of answering whether the utilization of photovoltaic powered water pumps in agriculture in Romania could bring economic and ecological benefits which would outweigh the costs and also, if this is the case, if there are also social benefits to be considered which would result in the use of this technology for households as well. The conclusions reach through this paper show the benefits of using the above mentioned technology for industrial purposes and its alternative potential for households. The contribution is to both the research field of renewable energy and its uses and to the policymakers to encourage investment in this direction.</jats:p>",

The present paper describes the geomorphic evolution of the tributary in the 2 years following its reconnection, with a particular focus on assessing the volumes of sediment now being supplied to the main‐stem Ehen. Structure‐from‐Motion photogrammetry was used to produce Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the newly connected tributary, with successive DEMs compared to assess topographic changes in the channel and quantify volumes of material exported. 3D errors in the DEMs were small relative to the scour and fill observed in the channel (error 0.016–0.056 m compared to up to 1.7 m vertical change between consecutive surveys). Erosion was the dominant process in the tributary channel, though this varied spatially and temporally. Over the 2‐year period, an estimated minimum of 384 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of coarse sediment was exported from Ben Gill and delivered to the confluence zone, where a new bar feature developed as a result. This estimate is twice as high as earlier ones. Analysis of the growth of this bar suggested that much of the material supplied by Ben Gill remains here temporarily, with onward conveyance constrained by the competence of the regulated main‐stem. The work shows that, thanks to the reconnection, this small (0.55 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) ephemeral tributary (flowing for only around 20% of the time) has become a key source of sediment for the main‐stem Ehen. The second in the pair of papers focuses on the geomorphic responses of the main‐stem to this renewed supply of sediment.</jats:p>",

The reasons and consequences of different temperature levels in district heating networks in Russia and Western Europe are considered. The calculated distribution temperatures in the central heating system pipeline were 75.85/49.85°C. The results show that the thermal losses of the pre-insulated pipelines increase many times depending on the soil moistening. In addition, calculations showed that in absolutely dry soil heat loss of pipelines of heat networks laid channel-free for all considered modes is less than calculated.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar como a LR pode ajudar a mitigar o desperdício nas CSAs e quais estratégias têm sido adotadas para que isso possa ser efetivado. Este trabalho se classifica como básico, descritivo e qualitativo, cujo procedimento técnico foi a revisão sistemática da literatura. Os dados foram analisados utilizando os preceitos de Bardin (1977). Os resultados mostram que há melhor aproveitamento dos resíduos alimentares quando se usa sistemas de roteirização, que otimizam o processo de distribuição e promovem a redução do desperdício. Adicionalmente, foi constatado que o comportamento das pessoas e do governo são importantes para a mitigação do desperdício.</jats:p>"

The solution pH effect on removal efficiency was investigated at acidic, neutral, and basic pH levels. All adsorbent materials showed the highest adsorption capacities at neutral pH. Experiments were used to assess efficacy for the removal of lead with the sorption kinetics and the adsorption isotherms being determined for the baseline material CZ and treated zeolites. The addition of graphene oxide and thiol functional groups increased the lead removal capacity of natural clean zeolite by 16.81% and 34.53%, respectively. Diffusion studies revealed that the overall lead adsorption process is a particle diffusion process. Theoretical calculations confirmed the pseudo-second-order model as the kinetic mechanism for lead adsorption for CZ, GOZ and CDHZ.</jats:p>",

Sometimes customers make sudden orders or increase the number of orders, so companies must change production schedules and order additional raw materials from suppliers. Not all suppliers can meet the sudden demand of the company. Compressor raw materials and other supporting raw materials often experience delays. This study aims to mitigate the causes of supply chain risk to eliminate and minimize company losses. The mapping of the company’s supply chain activities is based on the SCOR. After risk identification, risk assessment is carried out to determine severity, occurence, and correlation. Furthermore, the ARP value calculation is performed to determine the ranking and risk prioritization. Determination of risk prioritization using the HOR method. Based on the Pareto table, the highest ARP value is above 80%, there are 2 causes of risk A1 and A2 that contribute as much as 86.55% of the total ARP supply, the causes of the risk are: A1: Sudden order addition and A2: Breakdown of internal and/or external communication. These two causes of risk are the priority for prevention by the company.</jats:p>",

Today, for some market segments, the speed of production cycles is more important than the cost because short throughput time allows the flexibility to adjust to rapidly changing fashion trends in these market segments. Accordingly, choosing the most beneficial supply chain strategy has become an established research topic. However, apparel markets are complex systems. Therefore, attempts to reduce the underlying complexity in order to model these markets have limited existing research to the consideration of only selected aspects of markets (e.g., considering only homogeneous buyers, a single period, a single product, or a single manufacturer in the absence of competition) rather than taking a more comprehensive view. These limitations can be overcome by applying an agent-based simulation approach—an approach that can account for a wider range of factors, including several competing manufacturers utilizing different supply chain strategies, individual consumer preferences and behavior, word-of-mouth communication, normative social influence, and first-hand experience, as well as advertising. In this paper, the capability potential of such agent-based market simulation is demonstrated by investigating two supply chain strategies (fast fashion vs. traditional fashion) with varying product and communication strategies (product attributes and advertising) in several market scenarios.</jats:p>",

However, the independent influence of these dimensions on ESSCM has not been previously studied. Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap and to evaluate the effectiveness of these dimensions. To do this, the most significant dimensions are identified through a thorough literature review and experts' inputs. To determine their priority and cause–effect relationship, a hybrid approach of best–worst method (BWM) and decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is used. The analysis indicates that ‘total quality management’ and ‘technologies for cleaner production’ are the most important causal dimensions, and it provides several insights to the decision makers to formulate robust business strategies to the adoption of ESSCM.</jats:p>",

Iron(II) may precipitate from (ground)water by homogeneous, heterogeneous and/or biological oxidation, where the contribution of these processes, and thus the characteristics of the corresponding HFO precipitates, is a function of pH and process-conditions. Under current conditions in drinking water treatment, homogeneous oxidation dominates above pH ≈ 7.75, and heterogeneous and biological oxidation below this value. In chemical well clogging, this transition occurs at pH ≈ 7.0.

The fulfillment of the target by the control object (electric power networks, sources of electricity) can be achieved only if it’s safe. Safety management system should be developed based on synthesis. Only such an approach guarantees the achievement of the goal of activity (timely and high-quality electric power supply of the construction site). The basis of human activity is the decision of the person (decision maker). There is a need to take into account the qualifications of the manager. Human makes a decision based on a model. Therefore, it is advisable to introduce a manager’s qualification indicator into the mathematical model of managerial decision. The manager’s presence of knowledge and skills appropriate to the current situation allows timely response to emerging threats during the operation of the control object. The methodological foundations of creating a model of the managerial decision in managing the safety of the electric power supply process guarantee sustainable development in the field of construction of residential and industrial facilities.</jats:p>",

However, the status of laboratory commodity supply chain system in Jimma zone is not clearly known. Thus, we aimed to assess the overall supply chain system of laboratory commodity in selected public health facilities of Jimma zone, south west Ethiopia.\r\nMethods: A facility based cross-sectional study within 3 different strata of health facilities: hospitals, A-level health centers, and B-level health centers were conducted. About 40 basic laboratory commodities as well as all pharmacy and laboratory professionals were included for the assessment. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance with 95% confidence interval using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was performed.\r\nResults: A total of 34 facilities having totally 146 professionals were included. Among these 146 professionals only 2 pharmacy professionals took LCM training. In 16(47.1%), 12(35.3%) and 1(2.9%) facilities only 1 pharmacy, 1 laboratory and 0 pharmacy professionals, respectively were available. About 40% of facilities were found to be stocked-out (SO) on the day of visit and the mean day of SO was 51 days. The mean month-of-stock (MOS) on-hand was 5.51. Health centers were more SO than hospitals. Around 31(91.2%), 30(88.2%), 29(85.3%), and 1(2.9%) facilities responded using report and requisition form, internal facility report and requisition form, bin card, and stock card, respectively, however, practically 15(44.1%) had no report on the tools. About 33(97.1%) facilities never received all ordered quantities from their main source, pharmaceuticals fund and supply agency, and 23(67.6%) received products near to their expiry date. Six (17.6%) facilities were resupplied within 2-4 weeks lead time. Sixteen (47.1%) facilities were supervised within last month, 3(8.8%) have never been supervised and in 23(67.6%) the supervision did not include laboratory commodities. About 9(26.5%) facilities were not doing demand forecast. Thirty-three (97.06%) facilities didn`t have separate budget for laboratory commodities.                                      \r\nConclusion: Stocks availability in Jimma zone was found very low. However, MOS on hand showed a better result, though it may not be an indication of good practice. Facilities’ storage practice was less than the minimum value.</jats:p>"

İşletmelerin kendileri için uygun olan stratejileri seçerken bu stratejilerin birbirlerine olan etkilerini de göz önünde bulundurmaları gerekmektedir. Bu çalışmanın amacı Türk savunma sanayinde en yaygın olarak kullanılan risk azaltma stratejilerini ve bunların arasındaki nedensellik ilişkilerini tespit etmektir. Savunma sanayinde faaliyet gösteren bir işletmeden toplanan veriler bulanık DEMATEL yöntemi kullanılarak analiz edilmiştir. Karşılıklı ilişki ve bağımlılıkların analiz edilmesinde en uygun yöntem olması nedeniyle DEMATEL tercih edilmiştir. Ayrıca uzman yargılarının sayısal değerlere dönüştürülebilmesi amacıyla bulanık teoriden faydalanılmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlar sırasıyla en önemli risk azaltma stratejilerinin çeviklik, iş birliği, risk paylaşımı, tedarikçi seçme ve geliştirme olduğunu göstermiştir. Diğer stratejileri en fazla etkileyen stratejilerin ise standartlaştırma/ortak parça kullanımı, doğru talep tahmini ve bilgi paylaşımı olduğu görülmektedir. Diğer stratejilerden en fazla etkilenen stratejilerin ise sırasıyla stok bulundurma, çeviklik, risk paylaşımı ve esnek taşımacılık olduğu bulunmuştur. Savunma sanayisinin hassas üretim teknikleri kullanıyor olması, özel kalite standartlarına gereksinim duyması ve çok sayıda alt parçadan oluşan karmaşık ürün yapıları tedarik zincircilerinin risklere karşı hassasiyetini arttırmaktadır. Bu nedenle savunma sanayisindeki işletmelerin uygun risk azaltma stratejilerini belirlemesi önem taşımaktadır. Bu çalışma için yapılan bir literatür taraması savunma sanayi tedarik zincirinde risk azaltma stratejileri ile ilgili bir çalışmanın bulunmadığını göstermiştir.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When calculating short circuit currents in the traction network, it is necessary to take into account the input resistance of the traction substation, including the resistance of the transformers of the substation and the resistance of the power supply system. The input resistance during short circuit is determined based on the equivalent circuit of the external power supply system, of which this traction substation is an integral part. Traditionally equivalent circuit of a three-phase system has the form of a star, in which the resulting resistances in each phase are connected in series with a source of phase electromotive force, and these sources have a common point. Another equivalent circuit in the form of a triangle is possible, in which on each side the resulting resistances are connected in series with the source of linear electromotive force. It is important to note that neither one nor the other type of equivalent circuit is determined by the connection scheme of the transformer windings of the traction substation. It is only necessary to take into account the absence of a circuit for zero sequence currents. All elements of the equivalent circuit, as is known, should be brought to uniform basic conditions. If the parameters of these elements are expressed in named units, then the basic values are the effective voltage values of the main stage and the rated power of the power transformer of the traction substation. If the components of one and the other equivalent circuits are reduced to one stage of the operating voltage, for example 27.5 kV, then for the same elements of the power supply system, the resistance values in the equivalent circuit in the form of a triangle are three times larger than in the equivalent circuit in the form of a star. In this case, the input resistances of the traction substation for the one and the other equivalent circuits are absolutely identical. Therefore, in the calculation of short circuit currents of the traction network, you can use any of these equivalent circuits of the power supply system and traction substation. Formulas for calculating the resistances of the elements of the power supply system and electrical installations, given in the standards, manuals and reference books, relate to the equivalent circuit of the short circuit in the form of a star. When using an equivalent circuit in the form of a triangle, these resistances must first be tripled, and then divided by three when calculating the short-circuit currents. The meaninglessness of such an operation is obvious. The equivalent circuit of the traction substation and the external power supply system in the form of a triangle when calculating short circuits in the traction network has no advantages compared to the traditional equivalent circuit in the form of a star. The information on the linear currents on the primary and secondary windings of the traction substation transformer during a short circuit in the traction network is given, which is necessary to select the settings of its relay protection kit.</jats:p>"

In order to analyze the evolution of the area of water in Ulungur Lake (Buluntuohai Lake, Jili Lake) and the main causes of those changes, 3S technology, satellite data preprocessing, water extraction and database construction methods are combined with consideration of climatic changes and human activity in this study. The data in this study include 11 phases of remote sensing image data, field mapping data and relevant attribute data of the study area from 1977 to 2017. The results demonstrated the following. (1) Over the past 40 years, the change in Ulungur Lake's area was characterized by natural expansion, fluctuation stability, and recovery increase. Significant changes were mainly concentrated in the waters of Zhonghaizi, Xiaohaizi, Camel's Neck, and the waters near Akekule. (2) The period from 1977 to 1995 was the expansion period of the lake water area, and human activities were the main driving factors. The period from 2000–2017 was a smaller period of expansion of the lake water area, with warmer and more humid climate trends combined with human activities driving the change. (3) The water area that was extracted based on the MNDWI water index method can increase the contrast between bodies of water and buildings, which can aid in interpreting and extracting water element information from flat terrain and single types of surface features. This can provide an effective technical means for quantitative and dynamic analysis of the temporal and spatial changes in lake water area.</jats:p>",

In the context of predicting emergencies in heat supply systems this technology is the most effective. Carrying out the forecast is reduced to the problem of restoring the function in the general content of training by the teacher. Of the available machine learning tools, gradient boosting should be used. It works according to the following principle: at the first iterations the weak algorithms are used, then there increases the ensemble by gradual improvements of those data sections where the previous models have not been finalized. But when constructing the next simple model, it is built not just on reweighted observations, but in such a way as to better approximate the overall gradient of the objective function. Gradient boosting is one of the effective forecasting algorithms and the accuracy of the forecast depends on the correct input data (training sample). The subject area under study, namely the study &#x0D;\nof emergency situations on heating networks, has sufficient accumulated data to use boosting as the main tool for forecasting.</jats:p>",

One consequence of this trade‐off is the evolution of disparate egg sizes and, by extension, developmental modes. In particular, echinoid echinoderms (sea urchins and sand dollars) have been widely used to experimentally manipulate how changes in egg size affect development. Here, we test the generality of the echinoid results by (a) using laser ablations of blastomeres to experimentally reduce embryo energy in the asteroid echinoderms (sea stars), <jats:italic>Pisaster ochraceus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Asterias forbesi</jats:italic> and (b) comparing naturally produced, variably sized eggs (1.7‐fold volume difference between large and small eggs) in <jats:italic>A. forbesi</jats:italic>. In <jats:italic>P. ochraceus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. forbesi</jats:italic>, there were no significant differences between juveniles from both experimentally reduced embryos and naturally produced eggs of variable size. However, in both embryo reduction and egg size variation experiments, simultaneous reductions in larval food had a significant and large effect on larval and juvenile development. These results indicate that (a) food levels are more important than embryo energy or egg size in determining larval and juvenile quality in sea stars and (b) the relative importance of embryo energy or egg size to fundamental life history parameters (time to and size at metamorphosis) does not appear to be consistent within echinoderms.</jats:p>",

Wind energy cadastre principal characteristics of the region are studied (average longterm wind speeds, seasonal distribution in average monthly speeds, wind speed frequency, etc.). There is a winter wind speed peak in coastal areas, which coincides with the cold season peak demand for heating power and electricity. This is the main prerequisite for the successful joint operation of current boiler rooms with wind power plants (WPP), which are able to provide a significant part of the heating load. It is shown that the use of wind energy will save (displace) a significant amount of expensive imported fuel and significantly reduce the working cost of heat generated. The climatic characteristics of the region are studied, and the values of reduced (taking into account the wind) outdoor temperature are estimated. The way how the wind strains the initial picture of the distribution of average annual air temperatures is shown.

The worldwide consensus that physical distancing is an effective instrument for mitigating the spread of the virus has led policymakers to temporarily limit the freedom of movement of people between and within countries, cities, and even neighborhoods. These public health-related restrictions on human mobility yielded an unprecedented fragmentation of international and national food distribution systems. Focusing on food retailing - usually being modestly oligopolistic - we take a micro-economic perspective as we analyze the potential consequences this disruption has for the physical as well as for the economic access of households to food at the local level. As the mobility constraints implemented substantially reduced competition, we argue that food retailers might have been tempted to take advantage of the implied fragmentation of economic activity by exploiting their temporarily raised market power at the expense of consumers and farmers. We illustrate our point by providing empirical evidences of rising wholesale-retail as well as farm-retail price margins observed during the Covid-19 crisis. Subsequently, we review existing empirical approaches that can be used to quantify and decompose the micro-economic effects of crises on food demand and supply as well as the size and structure of the market, costs of trade, and economic welfare. The employment of such approaches facilitates policymakers’ understanding of micro-economic effects of public health-induced mobility restrictions on economic activity.</jats:p>",

In this study, the authors propose a new bi‐level optimisation strategy for service restoration (SR) to minimise the final cost of the restoration process and to re‐energise the maximum number of customers. The proposed method considers different power resupply methodologies, such as topology reconfiguration‐based restoration, islanding operation of DG, and the application of TESS for SR, along with their optimal combination, to minimise the financial costs. The primary level comprises a reconfiguration approach and a genetic algorithm to optimise the islanding partition of an active distribution system; the second level consists of the fuzzy logic procedure to set up the combination of energy resources. In addition, this study considers the objective problem formulation as a combination of different subtasks, which represent the financial costs of various components during the restoration process. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 39‐bus distribution network, where the validity and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated.</jats:p>",

We calculated annual mean water supply zone PWS-fluoride concentrations from monitoring data for 1995–2015, stratified by fluoridation scheme-flagging. We allocated annual 2005–2015 mean PWS-fluoride concentrations to small area boundaries to describe population exposure within five concentration categories (&lt; 0.1 to ≥ 0.7 mg/L). We compared zone-level 1995–2004 and 2005–2015 mean PWS-fluoride concentrations using Spearman correlation. Most (72%) of the population received PWS with &lt; 0.2 mg/L fluoride and 10% with ≥ 0.7 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations in 1995–2004 and 2005–2015 were similar (median 0.11 mg/L (lower quartile–upper quartile (LQ–UQ) 0.06–0.17) and 0.11 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.07–0.17), respectively) and highly correlated (coefficient 0.93) if un-fluoridated but differed (1995–2004 median 0.78 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.59–0.92); 2005–2015 0.84 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.72–0.95)) and correlated weakly (coefficient 0.31) if fluoridated.

A particular problem is the increase in water demand and wastewater production, which can compromise the balance of ecosystems. As many authors point out, there is a research gap in the comparative analysis between available water resources and the demand associated with tourism. In this respect, the main objective of this work is, on the one hand, to assess the water needs linked to the tourism industry and the capacity of natural resources to meet such a demand and, on the other hand, to estimate the economic cost of the water supply associated with the growing tourist demand in a territory, such as the island of Ibiza in Spain. It has been determined that the resources available are not sufficient to meet the water demand of the resident population at this destination, which is why it is necessary to resort to producing desalinated water. Therefore, the additional requirements associated with tourism must be met fully with desalinated water, which results in an increased cost of water management for the region. This paper also points at water losses in distribution networks and tourism seasonality as two phenomena that aggravate this issue.</jats:p>"

In order to prevent its spread, many governments have enacted stringent measures. Supply chains around the world are facing major disruptions and difficulties adjusting to the new demands and needs of a locked down world. In this paper, we will address the relationship between supply chain operations and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Given current global shortages in essential goods such as medication, we explore the connection between said shortage and supply chain issues, such as the lack of supply chain transparency and resilience, as well as unsustainable just-in-time manufacturing. To mitigate the effects of these issues and protect supply chain operations, we propose some recommendations, such as nationalizing the medical supply chains, adopting a plus one diversification approach, and increasing safety stock. These recommendations are given to not only mitigate current consequences in relation to the ongoing crisis, but also to suggest measures that will provide firms the resiliency needed to weather similar potential shortages in the future.</jats:p>"

However, the key issue in both traditional human-to-human (H2H) traffic and emerging Tactile Internet is the energy conservation network operation. Therefore, a power-saving method should be instrumental in the wireless retransmission-enabled architecture design. Toward this end, this paper firstly proposes a novel energy-supply paradigm of the FiWi converged network infrastructure, i.e., the emerging power over fiber (PoF) technology instead of an external power supply. Then, the existing time-division multiplexing access (TDMA) scheme and PoF technology are leveraged to carry out joint dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) and provide enough power for the sleep schedule in each integrated optical network unit mesh portal point (ONU-MPP) branch. Additionally, the correlation between the transmitted optical power of the optical line terminal (OLT) and the quality of experience (QoE) guarantee caused by multiple hops in the wireless frontend is taken into consideration in detail. The research results prove that the envisioned paradigm can significantly reduce the energy consumption of the whole FiWi system while satisfying the average delay constraints, thus providing enough survivability for multimode optical fiber.</jats:p>"

This work proposes a framework to coordinate different planning levels and event-based models to manage the forest-based supply chain. In particular, with the new methodology, the resilience and flexibility of the biomass supply chain is increased through a closed-loop system based on the system forecasts provided by a discrete-event model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Apart from periodontal ligament fibroblasts, immune cells like macrophages also play an important mediating role in orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). Upon orthodontic force application to malpositioned teeth, macrophages in the periodontal ligament get exposed to both mechanical strain and hypoxic conditions (via a compression of blood vessels). In this study, we assessed the relative impact of orthodontically induced mechanical strain and hypoxic conditions on macrophages for the mediation and regulation of OTM. Macrophages were stimulated with physiological orthodontic compressive forces of 2 g/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for 4 h and 24 h on gas-impermeable or gas-permeable cell culture plates under normoxic or hypoxic cell culture conditions.

Furthermore, we analysed HIF-1<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>, prostaglandin-E2, and VEGF protein expression via immunoblotting or ELISA. Mechanical strain and oxygen supply both differentially affected expression of genes and proteins involved in inflammation and angiogenesis. In this context, we found that HIF-1<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> protein levels were elevated by combined mechanical strain and hypoxic conditions, whereas gas-permeable plates providing sufficient oxygen supply prevented HIF-1<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> stabilization at the protein level after pressure application on macrophages. Our results thus indicate that macrophages involved in the mediation of OTM are affected by and respond differently to hypoxic conditions and mechanical compressive strain, which occur concomitantly during OTM, than periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF), thus indicating different roles of these cells in the regulation of OTM at the cellular-molecular level. We further observed that contrary to PDLF HIF-1<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> stabilization in macrophages is rather induced via the decreased oxygen supply associated with OTM than via mechanotransduction by mechanical strain.</jats:p>",

Eight adult giant anteater cadaveric specimens were used in this study.

The heart lied in the median plane of the thoracic cavity and corresponded to a cone‐shape structure with a rounded apex facing left. The internal chambers of the heart comprised the same structures described in other mammals. Two different patterns of coronary blood supply were observed in the giant anteater. Hence, it can be concluded that the three species of Xenarthra share the same heart structure described in other mammals to date. Aortic arch branches and variations in coronary blood supply in this study have been described in carnivores, particularly the cat and the galea.

One of concern in construction project was finance management. The benchmark for construction project success is satisfaction from owner and impact to the environment. Lack of material suply in a project can be deficit for the owner or the contractor. This research identified few factors and variables in supply chain that can affected financing management construction project in DKI Jakarta and identify efficiency for using supply chain that can affected to cost management. This research uses many literature and previous relevant research in focus on supply chain, financing management project for building in Jakarta, efficiency for supply chain to financial management, and other previous research for last 10 years. Financial management project can be assumed that some process to ensure that project can be finished in aproved estimation of cost. This research is using qualitative and quantitative method. This research uses primary and secondary data. We can identify a supply chain factor and financial management project for completed this project.</jats:p>",

Nowadays with the development of G10.5 lines, this supply mode is gradually limited: the increase of liquid crystal consumption leads to frequent replacement of liquid crystal bottle and longer equipment maintenance time, resulting the decrease of equipment's run time and increase the risk of bringing in external particles. In high generation lines more head number in one equipment needs more liquid crystal bottles, which causes more waste of liquid crystal and higher cost.

In this review, the use of emulsifiers as food additives is discussed, and the current estimations of exposure to, and safety of, emulsifiers are critically assessed. Food additive emulsifier research is complicated by heterogeneity in additives considered to be emulsifiers and labelling of them on foods globally. Major limitations exist in estimating food additive emulsifier exposure, relating predominantly to a lack of available food occurrence and concentration data. Development of brand-specific food additive emulsifier databases are crucial to accurately estimating emulsifier exposure. Current research on the health effects of food additive emulsifiers are limited to in vitro and murine studies and small, acute studies in humans, and future research should focus on controlled human trials of longer duration.</jats:p>",

Particularly, the management of olive orchards in Lazio region generates a considerable amount of biomass that is currently unexploited, but it could represent a valid source of solid biofuel for energy production in the Lazio region (Italy). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach entirely based on open source software, five suitable areas (A, B, C, D and E) have been selected as eligible for hosting and feeding a 1 MWe power plant. Harvesting and transportation costs were also calculated. The harvesting operation costs were EUR 96.79 Mgfm−1 in A, while they ranged from EUR 49.83 Mgfm−1 (E) up to EUR 56.51 Mgfm−1 (D) for the other sub-areas. Sub-area A showed also higher transport costs, EUR 21.55 Mgfm−1 while the same value ranged from EUR 14.75 Mgfm−1 (E) to EUR 16.59 Mgfm−1 (B) in the other sub-areas. However harvesting costs resulted higher than those reported in the literature, mainly due to the low pruning yield per surface unit, an aspect which is directly related to the olive grove’s management in the region where annual pruning is the usual practice. Future developments of the present study should encompass the social and environmental aspects of residual biomass supply chains herein proposed.</jats:p>"

Considering government subsidy and consumer preference for ESPs and a random demand, we develop a four-stage Stackelberg game model to research the optimal strategies of the information investment and sharing of the retailer and the energy-saving R&amp;D of the manufacturer. The results show the following: (1) When incurring a low information investment cost, the retailer is willing to invest in information acquisition techniques, while the retailer agreeing to share market information is related to the government subsidies and the probability of a high demand. The optimal strategy for the retailer is to share information when the probability of a high demand is less than 50% and the government subsidies for ESPs are high. Otherwise, the optimal strategy is not to share information. (2) The manufacturer not always expects the retailer to share information, which depends on the probability of a high demand and manufacturing cost. Especially, when the probability of a high demand is less than 50%, only a manufacturer incurring high cost will expect. (3) If the retailer refuses to share the information, the manufacturer can motivate the retailer to change his/her decision by sharing the information investment cost.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>he sub-optimal performance of state-owned refineries in Nigeria has led to a significant gap in the supply of refined petroleum products (RPPs) in the country. More so, the growing demand for these products has further widened the gap to the range of 500,000 –600,000 barrels per day (bpd). Consequently, most of the imports for RPPs in Nigeria are being filled from the United States and North-Western Europe at the expense of the Nigerian economy. However, given the abundance of petroleum resources in Nigeria and its long history in the production of oil, it is unfortunate that the local refineries are hardly maintained to meet the needs of the local population. In addition, the inability of the Nigerian state to build additional refining capacity to cushion its domestic supply gap for RPPs has become a major concern. With more than 40 licenses issued to private companies since 2002, only two companies (Niger Delta Petroleum Resources Refinery and Dangote Oil Refinery) have made noticeable progress in new refinery construction.This paper is focused on investigating the current challenges of refinery construction in Nigeria. This is done with a view of comparing the drivers and enablers of productivity in construction in this sector during the period of 1965 –1989 and how they differ from the current period of 2000 -2019 in Nigeria.A systematic literature review within the academic journals, source documents from the industry, relevant interviews from published news media and consulting organisations were used to identify and categorise these challenges. The findings of this study were validated by interviews from experts across key industries in this sector.The study reveals that change of ownership structures from the government sector to the private sector between the two eras, present additional challenges. These challenges cut across availability of capital, inconsistent government priorities and access to land for construction. Others include cronyism and corruption, weak political will, unstructured refinery licensing scheme, security challenges and economic factors regarding the regulated downstream market inNigeria. Key recommendations proffered to help solve these problems include a private sector-led partnership with the government in the form of public private partnerships (PPPs), a review of existing methods for licensing refineries for private organisations, the development of local manpower with relevant technical skills to help lower the cost of expatriate labour and the establishment of more designated clusters as free trade zones within the oil-producing Niger Delta. These recommendations will help lower the entry barriers for private organisations in this sector</jats:p>"

We developed a solution for immediate use: a mask adaptor, outfitted with a quarter section of an N95 respirator that maintains the N95 seal standard, thereby quadrupling the N95 supply. A variety of designs were 3D-printed and optimized based on the following criteria: seal efficacy, filter surface area and N95 respirator multiplicity. The final design is reusable and features a 3D-printed soft silicone base as well as a rigid 3D-printed cartridge to seal one-quarter of a 3M 1860 N95 mask. Our mask passed the computerized N95 fit test for six individuals. All files are publicly available with this publication.

The purpose of this research is to take into account the social dimension of sustainability into manufacturing industries. The social dimension of  sustainability as compared to other sustainable, has severe adverse impact across supply chains. In order to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of  social sustainability in supply chain management, a sample of 53 practitioners of Pakistani manufacturing companies has been selected to prioritize and evaluate the SCSS criteria by applying a decision-making multi-criteria method called the best worst method (BWM). The criteria of the study are ranked according to their  average weight achieved through BWM. The criterion employment practices has been chosen as the most significant criterion while cultural values criterion is considered as least important.  The results of this study are helpful for industry managers, practitioners and decision-makers to take the decisions for the implementation of social criteria to enhance the social sustainability that lead to sustainable development.</jats:p>"

A four-stage symmetrical Cockcroft–Walton voltage multiplier circuit is adopted to produce 300 kV direct current high voltage. A two-stage 360 kV isolation transformer system is used to drive the ion source power supply. The high voltage power supply and the isolation transformer system are integrated in an epoxy bucket with a size of ϕ360 × 700 containing No. 25 transformer oil. The maximum output voltage of the power supply can reach 300 kV. The variation in the high voltage power supply is less than 0.5% when the power supply works at 300 kV/6 mA with an input voltage variation of ±8%. Meanwhile, the isolation transformer system can withstand more than 360 kV, with its output power being about 2.5 kW. No overvoltage protection devices are used in the power supply, and the protection resistors are connected in series to two pairs of rectifiers at the highest and lowest potential terminals and to the output terminal of the voltage multiplier to prevent overcurrent.</jats:p>",

The water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) concept represents the maximum socio-economic scale that can be supported by water exploitation without causing an irreversible impact on the ecosystem. In this paper, three-level framework is put forward to illustrate and quantitatively evaluate the WRCC. The first level is the principal body, which focuses on the study of water resources systems. The second level is the carried object, including the socio-economic system, water ecological system, and environment system. The third level is the coupling of the principal body and carried object to calculate the WRCC. This three-level WRCC model was applied to the load conditions of the Shiyang River Basin (SRB). The results show that the SRB is overloaded, and only 1.99 million people can be carried at the modern carrying level. The WRCC could be increased by optimizing industrial structures and improving water efficiency. This method provides a tool to help policymakers develop sustainable approaches to environmental management and planning.</jats:p>",

Many available renewable sources are hardly harnessed due to high conversion cost and sophisticated technical need. Solar is one of the reliable renewable resource and it is environment friendly and easy to convert into other forms i.e. heat and electric. The electricity generation in solar is based on silicon technology and its production and implementation is of low cost. And embedding the pros of other related technology can increase the productivity which can be used to recharge a battery pack in less duration. In the present era of electric vehicle implementation need for stored electrical energy reserve is increasing but its supply chain is not developed efficiently. To replace the petroleum-based vehicles completely the electric battery supply system should be implemented in large and efficient quantity with low investments. The main issue is of recharging the battery which is economically infeasible with domestic power supply system. In present digitalized world these resources are expected to be a mobile service and automated system. In this paper we mainly propose an effective solution for these problems with the use of image processing and robotics technologies. In the paper the solution is validated implementing a prototype of the proposed system and presenting its performance analysis.</jats:p>"

Unlike existing studies, we focus on the optimal dynamic pricing of the platforms under imbalance between supply and demand caused by market fluctuation. Dynamic models are constructed based on the state change of supply and demand by using optimal control theory, with the aim of maximizing the platform’s total profit. We obtain the optimal trajectories of price, supply, and demand under three ride demand situations. The effects of some key parameters on pricing decisions, such as coefficient of demand fluctuation, service quality, and fixed commission rate, are examined. We find the optimal dynamic price can improve the match of supply-demand in ride-hailing market and enhance the revenue of platform.</jats:p>",

In the process of executing a contract, both the company and the farmer are running the risk of great uncertainty. This paper studies the coordination of agricultural supply chain in terms of the uncertainty of agricultural output and market demand. First of all, the random output volatility factor and the market demand volatility factor as two random variables are used to represent the uncertainty of the agricultural output and market demand, and revenue functions are set up, respectively, for the company and the farmer with the objective of maximizing expected returns. The theoretical derivation of these revenue functions proves that there is an optimal targeted yield in a centralized decision-making supply chain system and a single optimal solution that maximizes farmers’ revenue can be obtained in a decentralized one, but the centralized decision-making supply chain is superior to the decentralized and uncoordinated counterpart for overall benefit. Secondly, a revenue-sharing-plus-margin contract mechanism is proposed to coordinate income distribution between the two parties of the supply chain through the revenue-sharing coefficient and margin. Thirdly, calculation examples are given and solved by MATLAB based on the assumption that both the agricultural output volatility factor and the market demand volatility factor are uniformly distributed, and the theory and result are then verified consistently. Finally, the numerical analysis of the coordination mechanism of the revenue-sharing coefficient and the margin on both sides of the supply chain provides an optimal value range so that Pareto improvement on the company’s and the farmers’ income can be achieved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rapid growth of China’s energy consumption and the great pressure on reduction of carbon emissions, natural gas is an increasingly valuable energy source for enhancing energy and environmental sustainability. To sustain external natural gas supply, China has constructed a series of gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals for the increasing gas importation. This article identified five gas corridors of China: Central Asia–China gas pipelines, Myanmar–China gas pipelines, Russia–China gas pipelines, Australia/Southeast Asia–China seaborne LNG shipment, and Middle East/North Africa–China seaborne LNG shipment. It then proposed a group of indicators that may influence the security of China’s external gas shipment from a supply chain perspective, and composed them into a Risk Index for assessing the corridors of China’s natural gas importation using the Fuzzy AHP and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. The results indicate that (a) transport distance, geopolitical risk, and resource risk are the major obstacles for China’s natural gas importation; (b) China’s natural gas importation is experiencing a mid-level risk, and the gas pipelines from Central Asia, Myanmar, and Russia are the most secure gas corridors for China, while LNG shipment from Middle East and North Africa has the greatest risk index. (c) China’s diversification strategy has been successful, but a more balanced strategy is suggested to deal with the high gas dependence on Turkmenistan and Australia, as well as Russia when the cross-border gas pipelines are completed and fully utilized in the near future. </jats:p>",

An interdisciplinary  construct  is    derived  using  a  three  step  methodology  and  wide  range  of theories  from  a  comprehensive  literature  review.  These  theories  range  from  relational marketing to relational contracting and construction project management. A conflict process model  is  used  to  outline  the  association  of  conflict  and  relationship  quality  in  construction projects. Concepts such as psychological meaningfulness, psychological availability, resource availability, aligned-commitment, teamwork, performance satisfaction and trust are attributed to  relationship  quality.  An  interdisciplinary  construct  with  antecedents,  core  attributes  and outcomes  are  achieved.  Conflict  is  demonstrated  as  a  potential  antecedent  of  relationship quality.  Finally,  moderating  factors  such  as  actions  and  strategies,  some  of  which  could  be used in conflict management are identified as moderators of relationship quality. By identifying and mapping all the possible components in relationship quality, its different constructs and potential interactions can be recognised. This is extremely important in future investigations of relationship quality in relation to construction project issues and trainingproject teams. The choices of components for the construct are extracted from existing literature; however other components may be of effect which are not included and explored in the future. The model can be used to achieve project integration goals and joint problem solving strategies.</jats:p>"

Several techniques such as 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatization-HPLC and solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) have been applied for trace short-chain aldehydes analysis in water. However, to study the taste and odor contributors in drinking water, it would be helpful to obtain an extract with representative odor from water samples for further studies, such as GC-olfactometry analysis or sensory test. Therefore, the above techniques still have some constraints due to the derivatization process or complex operating procedures. In this work, we developed a solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled to dispersive liquid–liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) method to study short-chain aldehydes in ozonated water samples (LOQ = 1 ppb, RSD% = 12–45%). This method enables us to obtain an extract with representative odor from water for further volatile components analysis and sensory evaluation. Pair-wise nose clip sensory evaluation on the taste and odor of ozonated water indicated a high correlation between odor and taste of ozonated water. The SPE-DLLME method enabled a reliable study, for the first time, on correlations of volatile carbonyls and taste &amp; odor performance for ozonated water by applying a series of statistical models.</jats:p>",

Based on spatial data and statistical data, we mapped eight key ES supply between 2005–2015 in the Huailai mountain-basin area. Using data from 507 survey questionnaires, we identified the ES demand and the public perceptions of the changes in ES. In addition, we also reveal the characteristics of the spatial distribution of ES demand, analyze the spatial supply–demand matching of ES, and explore the relationships between ES supply–demand and human well-being. From 2005 to 2015, a general upward trend was observed in the supply of four types of product provisioning services, which is different from the trend perceived by the stakeholders. An increasing trend was observed for carbon sequestration and forest recreation, which was in line with the perceptions of change. A spatial mismatch existed between the ES demand and supply, whereby the supply of carbon sequestration, soil conservation, habitat quality, and forest recreation services exceeded the demand in townships in the mountainous and hilly regions. On the other hand, townships located in the valley plains experienced a high imbalance between the demand and the supply. For the four types of product provisioning services, most towns and villages showed a balance in demand and supply. Linking ES supply–demand and human well-being showed that a threshold may exist in the supply–demand imbalance of regulating and supporting services before it begins to impact human well-being. Our study would enrich the theory and methodology research on relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being, and support knowledge to land allocation and management.</jats:p>"

Subjects performed a maximum breath-hold, then breathed for 90 s (through a mouthpiece connected to room air) in five skin-exposure conditions. The first trial was out of water for Control (suit zipped, hood on, mask\n off). Four submersion conditions included exposure of the: Partial Face (hood and mask on); Face (hood on, mask off); Head (hood and mask off); and Whole Body (suit unzipped, hood and mask off).<jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Decreasing temperature and increasing skin exposure reduced breath-hold time\n (to as low as 10 ± 4 s), generally increased minute ventilation (up to 40 ± 15 L · min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and decreased predicted endurance time (PET) of a 55-L helicopter underwater emergency breathing apparatus.

The operation of this project will raise the upstream water level, which means the sediment transport rate will decrease and lead to deposition problems. In order to find out the deposition area and development trend, we carried out the suspended sediment deposition test on an existing physical model. The study shows that the upstream sediment is mainly deposited in the reaches near the two deltas. Some special topographic features are more likely to cause siltation, such as the wide and deep thalweg and the backflow areas at the downstream of convex banks. After the operation of the project, the erosion trend of the upper reaches of the central and southern branches will change to siltation, and the siltation of the upper reaches of the Western branch will be further strengthened. Fifteen years later, with the decrease of the upstream sediment intensity, the sediment siltation phenomenon will gradually move downstream, however, this will be a long process.</jats:p>",

This study built a response model of water quality to land use. The research results are as follows. First, the proportion of farmland is positively correlated to the total phosphorus (TP) value and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) value, which indicates that the water quality deteriorates as the area of farmland increases. Second, the proportion of woodland is negatively correlated to the permanganate index, the trophic state index, total nitrogen (TN) value, TP value and BOD value, which means the water quality improves as the area of woodland increases. Third, the proportion of grassland is negatively correlated to the water quality indices and the correlation coefficient is large, which indicates that the water quality improves as the area of grassland increases. Fourth, the proportion of land used for buildings is positively correlated to the trophic state index and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value at the 0.05 significance level, which means that the water quality deteriorates as the area of land for buildings increases. This study is expected to provide a basis for optimization of the land use and effective pollution control in the nine plateau lake watersheds.</jats:p>",

Using fluorescent spectroscopy, we investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of DOM compositions, as well as their properties, for two of the major four regulated rivers—Han River (HR) and Geum River (GR) in South Korea. We collected eight sampling sites, four from each of the two rivers (from close to the weirs) in order to observe the integrated effects of different land use (terrestrial input) during the monsoon (July) and post-monsoon periods (September). High integral values of DOM compositions (July: 30.81 ± 9.71 × 103 vs. September: 1.78 ± 0.66 × 103) were present in all eight sites after heavy rainfall during the monsoon period, which indicated that Asian monsoon climates occupy a potent role in the DOM compositions of the rivers. Regarding DOM compositions, tryptophan-like and fulvic acid-like components were predominant in HR and GR, especially in GR with high integral values of protein-like and humus components. However, the properties of terrestrial DOM between HR and GR are markedly different. These results considered due to the different land use, where the terrestrial DOM shows a low degree of humification due to a high percentage of agriculture and urban land use in GR. Furthermore, these two rivers are typical regulated rivers, due to their weir constructions. High values of DOM components were present in the downstream of the weirs; however, increasingly high patterns appeared in the HR because of heavy rainfall (511.01 mm in HR; 376.33 mm in GR). In addition, a lower increasing trend of humic-like component was present in the GR due to a low percentage of forest land use/cover. These results suggest that the effect of the weir on rivers can be highlighted by the different percentages of land use/cover under the conditions of the monsoon period. Hence, DOM fluorescence can serve as an effective indicator for providing an early signal for the complex impacts of the different land use and rainfall in the regulated river systems.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a pinch analysis technique is introduced to solve the challenge to implement the integrated power plant with methanation. The main drawback of the system is to deliver a sustainable and optimize capacity of hydrogen for methanation of carbon dioxide. Cascade pinch analysis is done which has been adopted from ESCA to calculate optimal hydrogen supply and hydrogen storage. From the analysis, after five iteration, the hydrogen supply capacity is obtained which is 281.38 Wh. The hydrogen storage capacity can also be determined which is 1352.52 Wh. Through the case study presented, it has proven that pinch analysis provides a simple methodology to solve the optimization issue of hydrogen supply and demand for integrated power plant with methanation system.</jats:p>",

The photosynthetic light use efficiency of leaves is lower in dynamic light than in uniform irradiance. Research on the influence of environmental factors on dynamic photosynthesis is very limited. Nitrogen is critical for plants, especially for photosynthesis. Low nitrogen (LN) decreases ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and thus limits photosynthesis. The decrease in Rubisco also delays photosynthetic induction in LN leaves; therefore, we hypothesized that the difference of photosynthetic CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation between uniform and dynamic light will be greater in LN leaves compared to leaves with sufficient nitrogen supply.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>To test this hypothesis, soybean plants were grown under low or high nitrogen (HN), and the photosynthetic gas exchange, enzyme activity and protein amount in leaves were measured under uniform and dynamic light. Unexpectedly, dynamic light caused less photosynthetic suppression, rather than more, in LN leaves than in HN leaves. The underlying mechanism was also clarified. Short low-light (LL) intervals did not affect Rubisco activity but clearly deactivated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), indicating that photosynthetic induction after a LL interval depends on the reactivation of FBPase and SBPase rather than Rubisco. In LN leaves, the amount of Rubisco decreased more than FBPase and SBPase, so FBPase and SBPase were present in relative excess. A lower fraction of FBPase and SBPase needs to be activated in LN leaves for photosynthesis recovery during the high-light phase of dynamic light. Therefore, photosynthetic recovery is faster in LN leaves than in HN leaves, which relieves the photosynthetic suppression caused by dynamic light in LN leaves.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec><jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Contrary to our expectations, dynamic light caused less photosynthetic suppression, rather than more, in LN leaves than in HN leaves of soybean.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disasters accompanied by heavy casualties and huge economic losses directly result in the disruption or delay of economic development. Considering the urgent need for reducing losses and accelerating the process of social recovery, international nongovernment organizations (INGOs) and local NGOs (LNGOs) with different resource endowments should achieve organizational coordination to improve the relief efficiency and sustainability of the humanitarian supply chain. Due to conflicting interests and expectations, this coordination is hard to achieve. In this study, we first establish an evolutionary game model between INGOs and LNGOs to determine the influencing factors and explore the interaction of NGOs in a dynamic way. Our results show that: (1) coordination by resource sharing can improve the sustainability of the humanitarian supply chain; (2) coordination willingness is affected by the behavior of other players, which can nevertheless achieve equilibrium under certain conditions; and (3) the important factors and optimal strategies of players are highlighted in the dynamic model. This study provides several insights into the theory of organizational coordination in the humanitarian supply chain regarding sustainability.</jats:p>"

A 10 W two‐stage X‐band gallium–nitride monolithic microwave integrated circuit (PA with a peak power‐added efficiency of 55%, is tested with drain supply modulation from 10 to 20 V with an increase in efficiency and substantial degradation in linearity. In this work, the authors characterise the two‐stage PA dynamically to develop shaping functions for both gate bias voltages. They demonstrate that gate modulation can improve back‐off gain and linearity, specifically when gate biases of the two stages of a PA are independently modulated. Simultaneous gate and drain modulation results in 15 percentage point improvement in efficiency over a static supply, and a consistent improvement in noise power ratio over a static supply, for a 20 MHz noise‐like signal. Results with a 20 MHz long‐term evolution signal show comparable improvement in efficiency while maintaining adjacent channel power ratio near the level of the PA with a static supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the advancement of lubrication technology, precise prediction of performance characteristics of bearings is the first and inevitable step for stability of mechanical systems. Most of the existing theoretical analyses of hydrostatic thrust bearings lubricated with non-Newtonian fluids have considered the lubricant inertia, only in the recess and land regions but did not account either for the inertia of lubricant in the supply region or the surface roughness of the bearings. This could be a cause for the deviation between the theoretical results and the experimental data under certain conditions. In this work, combined influence of surface roughness as well as lubricant inertia in the supply region, on the static properties of a hydrostatic stepped thrust bearing lubricated with a non-Newtonian fluid, has been discussed using Rabinowitsch fluid model. Surface roughness effects have been accounted for using Christensen theory of rough surfaces. It is expected that the current study could bridge the gap between the experimental and theoretical studies. Solution for momentum equation has been obtained by means of average inertia approach. Analytic expressions for film pressure have been derived for radial and circumferential roughness patterns. Mathematica 11.0 has been used for numerical computations, wherever necessary. Results for film pressure and load carrying capacity have been plotted and discussed. It is observed that the present results are in a better agreement with the experimental data. </jats:p>",

In cities in developing countries, the pursuit of rapid economic growth has ignored residents’ demand for LSs, thereby leading to a high demand for and short supply of these services. However, due to the lack of relevant research data, few studies have focused on the spatial mismatch in the supply and demand of LSs in urban areas. As typical representatives of multisource geographic data, social sensing data are readily available at various temporal and spatial scales, thus making social sensing data ideal for quantitative urban research. The objectives of this study are to use openly accessible datasets to explore the spatial pattern of the supply and demand of LSs in urban areas and then to depict the relationship between the supply and demand by using correlation analysis. Therefore, taking Beijing, China, as an example, the LS supply index (SI) and societal needs index (SNI) are proposed based on open data to reflect the supply and demand of LSs. The results show that the spatial distribution of the LS supply and demand in Beijing varies with a concentric pattern from the urban center to suburban areas. There is a strong correlation between the supply and demand of commercial and multifunctional services in Chaoyang, Fengtai, Haidian and Shijingshan, but there is no obvious correlation between the supply and demand of ecological and cultural services in Beijing. Especially in Dongcheng and Xicheng, there is no obvious correlation between the supply and demand of all services. The proposed approach provides an effective urban LS supply and demand evaluation method. In addition, the research results can provide a reference for the construction of “happy cities” in China.</jats:p>"

In order to settle conflicts and ensure industrial stability, it is important for river basin managers to develop a water allocation plan. In addition, there is a correlation between water demand and output in different industries, which affects water allocation plans. From the perspective of river basin government, this paper constructs a flow distribution model among the three major industries of industry, agriculture, and service. River basin government allocates water resources to the stability of the three major industries. The water consumption of various industrial sectors is centered on their own vital interests. Different industries have different characteristics and restrictions on water consumption. The study also considers transactions in different industries on the water market, using dynamic programming methods to simulate this water allocation. This allocation model is different from the traditional industrial water allocation model, and considers the correlation between the water demand and output value of different industries. The results show that a reasonable understanding of the interrelationships between industries will be more helpful to decision makers and a fundamental guarantee for sustainable use of water resources.</jats:p>",

It is necessary in order to enhance membrane life and is critical in managing the cost of pure water. The estimation of optimal backwash conditions is very important for improved hollow fiber membrane (HFM) operations. A unique feature in HFM backwash operations is the lumen side pressure drop, which leads to variation in backwash water flow across the fiber length. In this work, the effect of fiber diameter, membrane structural properties and backwash water pressure and temperature on flow distribution across the membrane length is studied for HFM modules. An analytical model for HFM backwash is developed, and model predictions are compared with measured backwash water flow variation over the fiber length. Experimental results show that the backwash flow variation over the fiber length is minimized by maintaining low backwash water pressure. Simultaneously, minimum backwash flux for effective cleaning may be achieved by increasing backwash water temperature. Homogeneous flow distribution during backwash improves backwash efficiency or forward flow rejuvenation, which can also be achieved by optimizing fiber diameter and membrane permeability. The validated mathematical model may be used for the optimization of backwash operating conditions and HF dimensions to achieve homogeneous backwash flow distribution across the membrane length.</jats:p>",

This article presents a study for improving sustainability practices in the coffee supply chain, using emerging technologies, of two localities in the Frailesca region from Chiapas, Mexico, based on the current situation, expectations and actions expressed by 165 coffee producers and 12 representatives of two coffee producers’ organizations. Based on Mentzer theoretical support, the technology roadmaps, knowledge management and digital compass were used to draw coffee supply chain processes to identify concrete actions and explore technologies. The results show that the technological route must be focused on renewing and improving coffee quality, getting quality certifications and access to specialized markets. Digital quality management and advanced statistical process control seem to be the appropriate emerging technologies for enhancing the acquisition of resistant varieties, proper pest management, improvement in the collection of coffee beans, the right time and way to plant a coffee plant, soil analysis and for the management of weeds and water conservation and harvesting as sustainable practices in this region. In addition, statistical correlation showed that digital technologies can be better adopted, on average, by producers with 4–6 family members, aged between 40–44 years and without additional crops. The findings propose sustainable practices linked with emerging technologies, based on a technology roadmap and knowledge management methodologies for this region.</jats:p>"

However, neglecting the environmental impacts of production equipment, technical building services and energy supply might lead to sub-optimization or burden-shifting and thus reduced effectiveness. As an established method used in sustainability management, Life Cycle Assessment aims at calculating the environmental impacts from all life cycle stages of a product or system. In order to cope with shortcomings of the static character of life cycle models and data gaps this approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with manufacturing system simulation. Therefore, the two life cycles of product and production system are merged to assess environmental sustainability on product level. Manufacturing simulation covers the production system and Life Cycle Assessment is needed to relate the results to the final product. This combined approach highlights the influences from dynamic effects in manufacturing systems on resulting life cycle impact from both product and production system. Furthermore, the importance of considering indirect peripheral equipment and its effects on the manufacturing system operation in terms of output and energy demands is underlined. The environmental flows are converted into impacts for the five recommended environmental impact categories. Thus, it can be demonstrate that Life Cycle Assessment can enhance the process simulation and help identify hot-spots along the life cycle. The combined methodology is applied for analysing a case study in fourteen scenarios for the integration of volatile energy sources into energy flexible manufacturing control.</jats:p>",

This study used shower hoses as the model system and investigated the contribution of biofilm and microbes in fresh water to the bacterial growth in water under different stagnation times from 6 to 24 h. Bacterial counts in water were observed to increase significantly after 12 h stagnation but longer stagnation did not lead to further increase, indicating different mechanisms contributing to bacterial growth during stagnation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Sourcetracker2 further confirmed that the contribution of fresh water to the microbial core community did not increase significantly with stagnation time, whereas the contribution of biofilm increased significantly after 24 h stagnation (53.5%) compared with 6 h stagnation (11.2%) (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The present results differentiated the contribution between planktonic and biofilm phase to the bacterial growth during stagnation, and provided insights into its mechanism. These findings serve as a framework for future development of strategies to manage biological water quality at the distal end of the building water supplies.</jats:p>",

There are few early warning methods based on the combination of rainfall threshold and geological environment conditions. In this paper, we presented an early warning method for debris flow based on the infinite irrelevance method (IIM) and self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM), and applied it to Liaoning Province, China. The proposed model consisted of three stages. Firstly, eight geological environmental conditions and two rainfall-inducing conditions were selected by analyzing the factors affecting the development of debris flow in the study area, and the rainfall threshold for debris flow outbreak was 150 mm. Secondly, the correlation between various factors was analyzed by IIM, which prevented the blindness of parameter selection and improved the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, SOFM was employed to predict the test data. Experimental results showed that the IIM-SOFM model had a strong early warning ability. When 25 samples of low-frequency debris flow area were selected, the accuracy rate of the IIM-SOFM model with optimized network structure parameters was 100%, which it was obviously superior to the rainfall threshold method, BP neural network and competitive neural network. Consequently, it is feasible to use the IIM-SOFM model for early warning of debris flow, outperforming traditional machine learning methods.</jats:p>",

It allows developing indices and ranking alternatives, based on multiple combinations of normalization methods and aggregation functions. Given the steadily increasing importance of accounting for multiple preferences of the decision-makers and assessing the robustness of the decision recommendations, this tool is a timely instrument that can be used primarily by non-multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) experts to dynamically shape and evaluate their indices. The <jats:italic>MCDA Index Tool</jats:italic> allows the user to (i) input a dataset directly from spreadsheets with alternatives and indicators performance, (ii) build multiple indices by choosing several normalization methods and aggregation functions, and (iii) visualize and compare the indices’ scores and rankings to assess the robustness of the results.

A case study for the assessment of the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios is used to illustrate the application of the <jats:italic>MCDA Index Tool</jats:italic>.

The particle descending velocity, particle segregation behaviour, void distribution and gas distribution were investigated. The results show that the CGD affects the particles descending velocity remarkably as the burden falling down to the slot. Particle segregation can be observed under the inverse ‘V’ burden profile, and the influence of CGD on the particle segregation is unobvious on the whole, which causes the result that the voidage is slightly changed. Although the effect of CGD on solid flow is not significant, the gas flow in shaft furnace has an obvious change. Compared with the condition without CGD, in the case with CGD, the gas velocity is improved significantly, especially in the middle zone of the furnace, which further promotes the center gas distribution. Meanwhile, the pressure drop in the furnace with the installation of CGD is increased partly.</jats:p>",

An incentive negotiation mechanism is proposed for agents in supply chains to improve their strategies. Multiple items, multiple attributes, and multiple echelons are involved in the proposed model. In addition, this research takes both the commerce and the environmental attributes into account. The environmental attributes were transformed into rewards or penalty by setting reward factors or penalty factors, and were taken into account during the calculation of the profits. The simulation results show that the proposed model was feasible to solve the complex negotiation problems, and had a good performance. The green factors of agents in the green supply chain network are increased when the agents have low initial green factors. Moreover, the proposed model can effectively reduce the carbon dioxide emissions as well. The proposed model can be seen as a “win–win” solution from the perspective of both business and environmental protection. The total profit of the green supply chain network is improved, and the harm to the environment is decreased as well. </jats:p>",

Therefore, to improve the management of water resources, water security should be properly evaluated. This study established a comprehensive evaluation index system for evaluation. Furthermore, it analyzed the impacts of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP), which fully reflects the impact of human activities on the spatial distribution of water resources and is an innovation. The results showed that the state of water security in the Jing-Jin-Ji district generally had an increasing trend, and the score of the overall evaluation was increased by 65.8%. The Middle Route of the SNWTP had played a major role in water security in resources criterion, which increased by 28.53% in 2015 and 13.64% in 2016. With social development, the general state of water security in the district was improving. These findings could provide a scientific basis for regional water resources management.</jats:p>",

First, renewable energy development and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will contribute significantly to GDP in terms of their impact on air quality improvement by 0.99% and 0.54%, respectively, in 2050. Second, due to differences in labor composition, air pollution has, and will continue to have, the greatest impact on sectors with a higher proportion of male and lower-educated workers — such as the coal sector, and it will have the least impact on sectors with a higher proportion of female and higher-educated workers — such as the public administration sector. Third, the different impacts of sector output will increase economic inequality. </jats:p><jats:p> Highlights • The economic impact of climate change and air pollution is assessed. • A CGE model with disaggregated labor sectors is developed. • The secondary industry is most affected by pollution from a health perspective. • Low-income groups suffer the largest loss of income due to pollution. • A low carbon policy will improve air quality and economic equity. </jats:p>",

Efforts are underway in the country to eliminate industrially produced TFAs from the food supply in keeping with the priority targets of the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2019‐2023. We reviewed the TFA content reported in industrially produced foods and discuss the regulatory landscape for TFAs, to facilitate the required policy changes in Pakistan and ultimately eliminate the TFA burden from industrial food products. The study components include review of published research and product labels as well as review of prevailing food regulations for TFA‐related information. A set of recommendations was also prepared to eliminate TFAs from Pakistan after national consultation workshops conducted in year 2019. Vanaspati ghee (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil), bakery shortening, hard margarines, and fat spreads are identified as the major sources of TFAs. Federal and provincial food authorities have recently established the limits for TFAs in few products; however, the TFA regulations are insufficient and not in line with global best practices. This study informs a comprehensive national strategy for TFA elimination based on knowledge of TFA prevalence associated regulatory control. We recommend to (1) promote actions toward replacement of traditional vanaspati ghee/bakery fats with healthier alternatives; (2) develop and implement best regulatory practices in line with WHO recommendations; and (3) amend food labeling laws so that clear information will be provided to inform consumers healthy food choices.</jats:p>",

We investigate an inventory transshipment game with two newsvendor‐type retailers under limited total supply and check whether the retailers are better off than the case without transshipment. We derive the ordering strategies for the retailers and show that unlike the unlimited supply case, a pure Nash equilibrium only exists under certain conditions. Furthermore, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we show that inventory transshipment may not always benefit both retailers. Although one of the retailers is guaranteed to be better off, the other could be worse off. The decision criteria are then provided for the retailers to determine if they will benefit from the exercise of inventory transshipment. Numerical study indicates that the carefully chosen transshipment prices play an important role in keeping inventory transshipment beneficial to both retailers. Subsequently, a coordinating mechanism is designed for the retailers to negotiate transshipment prices that maximize the total profit of the two retailers while keeping each of them in a beneficial position.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macro‐nutrient required for plant metabolism and growth. Low P availability could potentially limit plant responses to elevated carbon dioxide (eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), but consensus has yet to be reached on the extent of this limitation. Here, based on data from experiments that manipulated both CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and P for young individuals of woody and non‐woody species, we present a meta‐analysis of P limitation impacts on plant growth, physiological, and morphological response to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. We show that low P availability attenuated plant photosynthetic response to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> by approximately one‐quarter, leading to a reduced, but still positive photosynthetic response to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> compared to those under high P availability. Furthermore, low P limited plant aboveground, belowground, and total biomass responses to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, by 14.7%, 14.3%, and 12.4%, respectively, equivalent to an approximate halving of the eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> responses observed under high P availability. In comparison, low P availability did not significantly alter the eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced changes in plant tissue nutrient concentration, suggesting tissue nutrient flexibility is an important mechanism allowing biomass response to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> under low P availability. Low P significantly reduced the eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced increase in leaf area by 14.3%, mirroring the aboveground biomass response, but low P did not affect the eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced increase in root length. Woody plants exhibited stronger attenuation effect of low P on aboveground biomass response to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> than non‐woody plants, while plants with different mycorrhizal associations showed similar responses to low P and eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> interaction. This meta‐analysis highlights crucial data gaps in capturing plant responses to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and low P availability. Field‐based experiments with longer‐term exposure of both CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and P manipulations are critically needed to provide ecosystem‐scale understanding. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative baseline to constrain model‐based hypotheses of plant responses to eCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> under P limitation, thereby improving projections of future global change impacts.</jats:p>",

Implementing BOPS in the dual-channel low-carbon supply chain (DLSC) can not only improve low-carbon manufacturers’ profit but also reduce energy consumption in it. This paper focuses on how to design the contract which can ensure the implementation of BOPS in the DLSC consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer considering consumers’ low-carbon preference. Based on the analysis of game theory, two kinds of BOPS contract (MW contract with the dominant manufacturer making decision on wholesale price and RW contract with the dominant retailer making decision on wholesale price) with fixed compensation are designed and compared to obtain the better contract which is more effective on the implementation of BOPS. The findings show that MW contract is better than RW contract for the DLSC to implement BOPS. When consumers’ low-carbon preference and BOPS preference and the anti-cross-price elasticity are high enough, the DLSC can implement BOPS under the MW contract because it has Pareto efficiency on the profit of the original DLSC. We further find the sales price is decreasing in consumers’ low-carbon preference and anti-cross-price elasticity, while the wholesale price is increasing in consumers’ low-carbon preference. Finally, the results are verified by numerical examples.</jats:p>",

The TE status is analyzed mass‐spectrometrically in serum and different tissues. Furthermore, gene and protein expression of TE biomarkers are assessed with focus on liver. Iron concentrations are most sensitive toward a reduced supply indicated by increased serum transferrin levels and altered hepatic expression of iron‐related genes. Reduced TE supply results in smaller weight gain but higher spleen and heart weights. Additionally, inflammatory mediators in serum and liver are increased together with hepatic genomic instability. However, global DNA (hydroxy)methylation is unaffected by the TE modulation.</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusion: Despite homeostatic regulation of most TEs in response to a low intake, this condition still has substantial effects on health parameters.

Three components of GSCM orientation were examined, that is, strategic emphasis, management support and resource commitment. Data were collected from a sample of 296 manufacturing firms in China. The results indicate that the most important motivation is environmental concern, followed by customer requirements, cost saving, and competitive pressure, whereas legal requirements were not a significant factor. The results confirm that strategic orientation plays a mediating role between motivations and the actual practices. Within the three components of strategic orientation, resource commitment and strategic emphasis have a stronger direct impact on practices, whereas the effect of management support on GSCM practices is indirect through resource commitment. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying the key role of strategic orientation in turning GSCM motivations into actions.</jats:p>",

This paper addressess the speed profile optimization problem for MSM train operations by integrating the power supply system and train control system under various constraints. Unlike the model for optimizing the mechanical energy of the train, this approach aims at the lowest energy consumption of the substation for the MSM system. First, a speed profile optimization model for the MSM train is built by combining the mathematical control model of the long stator synchronous linear motor and dynamic equation of train, in which the stator current is the control variable. Next, a dedicated dynamic programming approach is proposed to solve the optimization model. The results of the numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the model that only considers the train mechanical energy, and the energy consumption is reduced by 10.3% and 6.5% in the two case studies, respectively. Furthermore, the relationship between energy consumption and travel time is analyzed to reflect the optimal results of the proposed model limited to different fixed travel time. </jats:p>",

This work investigated therefore the physicochemical and water quality parameters of Hulun Lake, and that of the inflowing Crulen River and Orshen River through winter, to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of water quality without impact of algal bloom, atmospheric deposition, wind or allochthonous nutrient input. Results showed that the prevention of wind-induced sedimentary resuspension accompanied with the minimized volume of tributary inflows is supposed to predominate the eutrophication alleviation. The formation of ice cover had a slight concentrative effect on water ion content. However, ice cover resulted in an increasingly homogenous distribution of phosphorus and oxygen-depleting organic matter over the entire lake. The two headwater streams demonstrated limited impact on water quality in estuaries in winter without showing evident coordination in upstream water nutrient level. It is suggested that the prevention of wind disturbance by ice cover and the subsequently modified hydrodynamic and water ecological processes are the determinant factors on water quality in Hulun Lake during winter.</jats:p>",

In the present article, the authors have tried to understand the overall feasibility of PRO-RO combination in such estuarine systems with appreciable variation of seasonal salinity. The article first discusses the feasibility of pretreating the feed of PRO using RO and later understanding the feasibility of PRO as supplemental technology to existing RO units. It was found that pretreating the PRO feed in such estuarine systems was energetically infeasible. However, PRO as supporting technology was found to produce energy of around 0.0994 kWh for 50% recovery. It was also concluded that with a fraction of RO permeate used for PRO, energy savings increase for estuarine systems with seasonal salinity variations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing homogeneous product market has made more competition among companies to focus on improving customers’ experience. In order to get more competitive advantages, companies often launch discount products to attract consumers. However, stimulated by discount products, the perception of anticipated regret is becoming stronger, which is an inevitable issue in front of companies with price discount strategy. Considering the impact of anticipated regret for discount products, this paper quantitatively describes the utility functions and deduces the demand functions of original price products and discount products. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are used to analyze centralized and decentralized models of supply chain for discount products. On its basis, the revenue-sharing contract is designed to optimize the profits of supply chain. This paper finds that the price of products increases first and then decreases with the increase of regret sensitivity coefficient and consumer heterogeneity. When the regret sensitivity coefficient and consumer heterogeneity are lower, companies in the supply chain can adopt the “skimming pricing” strategy in order to obtain more profits. When the regret sensitivity coefficient and consumer heterogeneity increase, companies in the supply chain can adopt “penetrating pricing” strategies to stimulate market demand. For high regret consumers, manufacturers can adopt a “commitment advertising” strategy to promise price and quality, and retailers can adopt a “prestige pricing” strategy to reduce consumer perception of regret. In response to products with higher differences in consumer acceptance, manufacturers can adopt a “differentiated customization” strategy to meet different types of consumer demand and retailers can adopt a “differential pricing” strategy for precise marketing.</jats:p>",

In this study, supply schedules and operational challenges were characterized in intermittent areas of the Arraiján, Panama distribution network based on one year of pressure and flow monitoring in four study zones, analysis of three years of pipe break data, and observations of system operation. Service quality was found to vary among users and supply schedules were often irregular and unpredictable. Direct causes of unanticipated supply outages included pump failures, chronic pipe breaks in specific parts of the system, transmission main breaks, irregular valve operations, and treatment plant outages. The extent and duration of these outages were often increased by high rates of water loss, insufficient storage capacity, and difficulty detecting and resolving infrastructure failures. Factors associated with intermittent supply, such as intermittent pumping, appeared to be associated with a higher frequency of pipe breaks. However, the analysis did not indicate a strong general correlation between intermittent supply and pipe breaks. Pressure and flow monitoring in intermittent supply areas, similar to that undertaken in this study, could be a valuable tool to improve regular operations as well as longer-term planning and prioritization of system improvements. Water loss reduction and adequate distribution storage capacity could also mitigate the effects of operational failures. Investments in monitoring and data analysis have the potential to improve the reliability of intermittent supply in cases where continuous supply is not immediately feasible.</jats:p>"

The model can reflect the randomness of water inflow under different climatic conditions while taking into account the interests of different decision makers at the upper and lower levels and the two contradictory objectives of maximizing economic benefits and minimizing water demands to improve water distribution efficiency and reduce the complexity of water resource distribution systems. The results showed that under the three climatic scenarios of RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, the agricultural water supply accounted for 90.04%, 87.66%, and 84.15% of the total regional water supply, respectively. In the process of building the model, considering the importance of sewage treatment in water safety evaluations, the cost of sewage treatment is included in the upper-level benefits of the model. The sustainable development of water resources should be guaranteed while rationally allocating water resources and pursuing economic benefits.</jats:p>",

These  factors  play  a  significant  role  in  the  decision-makers'  attitudes towards risks management. Many previous studies regarding the management of construction projects have focusedon the factors contributing to the success of risk management.  However, little attention has been given to factors severely affecting the decision-makers' risk attitudes with particular reference to an individual's risk factors in the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors affecting contractors' risk attitudes and then determine its  relationship  with  government  policy.  Theoriesof  planned  behaviour  and organisational control wereused to develop the theoretical framework that investigated G-7 contractors in the  Kuantan  Pahang,  Malaysian  construction  industry.    A  review  of  relevant  literature  and questionnaire  was employedto  identify  the  factors  affecting  contractors'  risk  attitudes (personal  factors). 112copies  of  a  structured  questionnaire  were  analysed  with  a  response rate of 80%. Structural Equation Modelling SEM was utilised to test the hypotheses developed for the study. The results of this study,through SEM,proved that personal factors (working experience, professional competence  and physical  health)  have  a  significant  influence  on contractor risk attitudes in the Malaysian construction industry. The findings of this research also  confirm  that  government  policy  (rules  and  regulations)  plays  a  moderating  role  in enhancing  the  relationship  of  personal  factors  affecting  contractors’  risk  attitudes  in construction companies in Malaysia. The findings of the study provide more understanding of the  personal  factors  that  affect  contractors'  risk  attitudes  to  facilitate  contractors'  decision-making process and serve as a useful reference for further studies in the field of construction project management.</jats:p>"

The current water-conservation policies focus on implementing new technologies and management strategies at important spatial nodes while neglecting the significance of the response from the community and the public. In this paper, the elements that influence the public participation of water conservation within the community are analyzed and divided into three levels: the internal world elements of the residents, the different individual characters of the residents, and external world elements. Among these three levels, the internal world element level, including the desire to realize oneself, is crucial, as it will significantly strengthen an individual's participation activity once motivated. Based on Maslow's five-level theory of human needs, to establish a model of public participation in water-conservation communities, economic benefits, environmental improvement benefits, and the self-fulfilling satisfaction of participation will become the motivation for the model to function. In a new project, reclaimed water landscapes are established in the community, and eco-recreational activities with water-conservation themes are organized to guide and encourage public participation to foster water-conservation consciousness and to establish aging water-conservation guiding policies and implementation methods in the community.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green innovation for supply chain has attracted much academic attention. Yet, there is no adequate understanding of how spillover and cooperation can impact the enterprises’ green innovation decisions in the presence of free-rider. Besides, the dynamic impact of green innovation on emission is still lack of attention. We develop a differential game model that explicitly considers a supply chain with two types of manufacturers (i.e., green innovation and free-riding) to examine the dynamics of green innovation. The analysis reveals that under the noncooperation mode, the emissions and profits of free-riding manufacturers are found to be lower than that of innovating manufacturers, but technology spillovers will narrow the gap between them. Under the cooperation mode, there would be greater innovation efforts of green manufacturers and lesser efforts of green suppliers. Moreover, technology spillovers will have less impact on optimal decision changes. The profit of free-riding manufacturers is higher than that of innovating manufacturers, but the initial market power will affect the changes in their sales and profits. Meanwhile, cooperation will increase the total emission amount and long-term profits of the green supply chain, and technology spillovers of green manufacturers will help narrow the emission gap and broaden the profit gap, while that of the suppliers will have the opposite effect. The present study provides a new perspective for research on green innovation decisions for supply chain.</jats:p>",

Regardless of this, certain electrical equipment in one room and OFF in another room would be on, several times. This causes considerable disturbance to our routine work. This paper is intended to test the availability of any live phase, and will only link the load to the specific live phase. There is only one phase available, and then the load will still be ON. The idea is conceived with ARDUINO. This controller continually checks the live state of all connected phases, using a Relay the load is connected to active phase by controller. Transistor is operated the relay.When two or more phases are active but load is only connected to phase 1,that active phase number is display in LCD for observation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>High‐quality perovskite single crystals with large size are highly desirable for the fundamental research and high energy detection application. Here, a simple and convenient solution method, featuring continuous‐mass transport process (CMTP) by a steady self‐supply way, is shown to keep the growth of semiconductor single crystals continuously stable at a constant growth rate until an expected crystal size is achieved. A significantly reduced full width at half‐maximum (36 arcsec) of the (400) plane from the X‐ray rocking curve indicates a low angular dislocation of 6.8 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> and hence a higher crystalline quality for the CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>(MAPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) single crystals grown by CMTP as compared to the conventional inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method. Furthermore, the CMTP‐based single crystals have lower trap density, reduced by nearly 200% to 4.5 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, higher mobility increased by 187% to 150.2 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> V<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and higher mobility–lifetime product increased by around 450% to 1.6 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> V<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, as compared with the ITC‐grown reference sample. The high performance of the CMTP‐based MAPbI<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> X‐ray detector is comparable to that of a traditional high‐quality CdZnTe device, indicating the CMTP method as being a cost‐efficient strategy for high‐quality electronic‐grade semiconductor single crystals.</jats:p>",

Then, this study primarily used fairness preference theory and game theory to analyze the impact of fairness preference on the pricing decision, recycling and remanufacturing strategy, and coopetition model selection. The results show that (1) enterprises’ fairness preference would increase the wholesale price and retail price, and the stronger the degree of fairness preference is, the more obvious the trend is; (2) enterprises’ fairness preference is not conducive to recycling and remanufacturing, and the higher level of fairness preference is associated with the lower recycling rate of waste products; (3) enterprises’ fairness preference would not affect the model selection but would benefit the overall profit.</jats:p>",
