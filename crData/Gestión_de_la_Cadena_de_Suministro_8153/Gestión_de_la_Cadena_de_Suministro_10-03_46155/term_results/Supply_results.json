It is well established that in drinking pipe systems Pressure Reducing Valves (PRV) are used as a mean for excess energy dissipation for the purpose of pressure control. This type of solution can be adopted, as a mitigation method to control the system losses, in particular, the available overload, which must have to be dissipated to avoid leakage or rupture occurrence in the pipe system. The use of micro-hydro systems seems to provide a better approach as a sustainable solution in terms of controlling the system pressure as well as to provide a non-negligible income by producing clean energy. Computational simulations, experimental research and engineering project development are carried out to analyse and compare the hydraulic system behaviour between a PRV and a pump working as a turbine (PT). This research creates an important challenge for seasonal stabilization of the energy supply by using water supply systems, due to the stochastic nature of river-hydro resources.</jats:p>",

The diversity of allotment-scale diurnal water use patterns directly impacts on network dynamics. Demand management and rainwater tanks are likely to impact upon the diurnal patterns of water flows in a water supply network. Results presented in this study suggest that rainwater tanks with mains water trickle top-up produce diurnal “mains water” use patterns different to “household” water use patterns, and when simulated correctly, significantly reduced peak hour “mains water” demand. This outcome impacts upon water supply network design criteria and provided opportunities to offset water infrastructure costs. There is a need to investigate diurnal mains water use patterns resulting from source control measures, such as demand management and rainwater tanks, on peak hour mains water demand in water supply distribution systems and their impact on network design criteria.</jats:p>",

In most cases the condensate has become contaminated with unwanted particles or with product carryover making it unfit for direct reuse in the process or as boiler makeup water. Conventional methods use heat exchangers for partial recovery of the heat content to be followed by ion exchange or reverse osmosis limited to 30–40°C feed temperature. By using the Duratherm® High Temperature compatible membranes in RO and NF, it is now possible to process the condensate at temperatures up to 80°C thereby maintaining the calorific value of the stream. Many plants also produce a product using evaporation. The overheads from the evaporators usually contain a small amount of their product that must either be recovered by an additional evaporation step or disposed of in a waste treatment plant. These reverse osmosis or nanofiltration systems allow concentration of the product, produce high quality water suitable for reuse, and reduce the load on the waste treatment plant. The treated condensate can then be used for various utility operations including boiler &amp; process makeup.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study is to examine the institutional organization of the water sector. The Mediterranean area provides very diverse examples of water sector organization. This paper focuses more particularly on two aspects, the recent introduction of private sector participation and the institutional framework. Five countries have been reviewed in detail: Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Jordan. For each of these countries, the paper analyzes institutional arrangements for the water sector. It presents the theoretical legal framework but also the practice. It shows that ‘independent’ regulatory agencies have been set up in only a few countries. However, a closer look confirms that these regulatory agencies are rarely independent. The study also reveals that in most of the countries, the management of water supply suffers from political interference and is overly centralized. Experience with corporatization has also been limited. While the corporatization of local operators has been legalized in most countries, few have implemented it. Experience with private sector participation in water supply has been relatively positive and is, therefore, expected to expand in the future.</jats:p>",

The total demand for Teakwood during 2000-2001 was 96,294 m3, which was 4.7 per cent of the total demand for all timbers. Among the timber-using sectors, housing was the largest Teakwood-using sector. Teakwood export to other States within the country was 13,812 m3 of which 6335 m3 was Teak poles. The international export was only 113 m3. Of the total Teakwood supply, forest plantations accounted for 52 per cent, import 15 per cent and areas outside forests contributed the remaining 33 per cent. Production and consumption of Teakwood was more or less matched, with only a small deficit of 667 m3. Kerala, a traditional exporter, has now become a net importer. Shortening of the rotation age of forest Teak plantations to 50 years has reduced the production of larger girth logs. A policy for increasing the rotation age of forest Teak plantations must be adopted to make available high value larger girth logs for the national and international markets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The calibration process of water distribution system models allows for accurate and reliable hydraulic analysis results. Thus, calibration is of utmost importance if adequate operation and maintenance model-based procedures are sought. However, in emerging economies, there is a series of factors that make it more difficult to construct accurate models, including very poor information management, unusually high leakages and the presence of a large number of illegal connections. While some of the model variables are assumed to be known under normal circumstances, these factors make it necessary to consider them for calibration as well. This paper presents a calibration methodology flexible enough to address such problems allowing the calibration of pipe diameter, roughness and minor losses, and nodal demands and leakages. A genetic algorithm was implemented as well as a constraint programming algorithm that makes direct use of hydraulic criteria to advance in the solution space. The methodology was tested on a real system in Colombia with a satisfactory outcome. The use of these techniques results in major reduction of calculation time and similar or superior results in comparison to manual methods.</jats:p>",

With these optimum conditions total degradation was observed after 15 minutes of reaction time. The application of sunlight was also efficient as total degradation was achieved after 60 minutes. The optimum dosage using only TiO2 as catalyst was 1,000 mg l−1, obtaining the maximum degradation at 20 minutes of reaction time. On the other hand, the addition of 0.02 M of H2O2 to a lower dosage of TiO2 (10 mg l−1) provides the same degradation. The ozonation treatment achieved complete degradation at 30 minutes of reaction time. On the other hand, it was observed that the degradation was faster by adding H2O2 (H2O2/O3 molar ratio = 0.5). In this case, total degradation was observed after 20 minutes.</jats:p>",

Some theoretical advantages of CDD approaches include: (1) community choices are more attuned to local needs; (2) sustainable O&amp;M is more likely; (3) social capital is built; (4) more participation yields better oversight and less corruption; and (5) communities become active partners in development, itself a worthy objective. Using quantitative and qualitative data from a water supply and sanitation project in Punjab, Pakistan, the study finds that the CDD approach, consistent with expectations, has done well in extending water supply, drainage, and sanitation coverage to the poor rural communities, and demonstrated outcomes that are only achievable through CDD—including water tariff and cultural changes. The project was also effective in promoting local participation and ownership, particularly by women's groups, and is therefore likely to have sustainable operation and maintenance (O &amp; M). This study uncovers two dimensions of CDD in water and sanitation as means to an end: political reform, by proposing implementation strategies of decentralisation; and cultural reform, by providing an approach to break cultural barriers.</jats:p>",

Experiments were carried out under natural sunlight conditions in winter and summer. A parabolic solar collector (PC) was applied to concentrate solar energy. HS were characterized by UV254 absorbance, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and molecular weight (MW). As a result of solar irradiation, decreases of DOC up to 14% in winter and 58% in summer were observed. A comparison of adsorption isotherms and chromatograms of the irradiated and non-irradiated HS confirmed that smaller molecules formed during solar irradiation were preferentially adsorbed by GAC. A dramatic MW change upon solar irradiation was observed in HS irradiation in PC in summer experiment and almost no UV254 detected components were remaining in solution after adsorption (GAC dose 400 mg/L), as measured with high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The combined solar irradiation-GAC adsorption method proved to be effective in enhancing HS removal by GAC with no additional energy and chemicals consumption.</jats:p>",

Most of the installed plants use RO process to produce industrial and even potable water. In this study, Nanofiltration (NF) technology was employed for Karoon River desalination as an economic and energy saving treatment process. Unstable quality and high turbidity of Karoon River results in fouling on NF/RO membranes, leading to chemical washing once a month and replacing membranes within 6 month or per year. Thus, unlike of many water treatment plants which benefit traditional pretreatment processes; ultra-filtration (UF) has been used as an effective and helpful pretreatment process. To make the proposed system reliability more clear, UF-NF results after three month of operation were compared with an equivalent RO system. In fact, UF-NF system benefits a lower pressure drop due to lower fouling on membranes and also more suitable permeate quality for drinking than RO. Hence, the promising results of the present practice may offer a reasonable solution to solve potable water supply problems in some deprived and arid regions.</jats:p>",

Either the fifth lumbar vertebra shows assimilation to the sacrum or the first sacral vertebra shows a lumbar configuration, resulting in 4 or 6 lumbar vertebrae, respectively. Etiologically, lumbar nerve root syndrome is diagnosed by comparing the anatomical level of the disc herniation to the compressed nerve root and to the pattern of the peripheral sensory and motor deficit. In case of a variation in the number of lumbar vertebrae, defining the lumbar nerve roots becomes difficult. Variations in the number of lumbar vertebrae make the landmarks (the twelfth rib and the first sacral vertebra) unreliable clues to define the nerve roots.

Management Sci. 41(4) 577–594) initiated a stream of research on supply chain flexibility, which was furthered by Graves and Tomlin (Graves, S. C., B. T. Tomlin. 2003. Process flexibility in supply chains. Management Sci. 49(7) 907–919), that examined various structures for achieving horizontal flexibility within a single level of a supply chain. In this paper, we extend the theory of supply chain flexibility by considering placement of vertical flexibility across multiple stages in a supply chain. Specifically, we consider two types of flexibility—logistics flexibility and process flexibility—and examine how demand, production, and supply variability at a single stage impacts the best stage in the supply chain for each type of flexibility. Under the assumptions that margins are the same regardless of flexibility location, capacity investment costs are the same within and across stages, and flexibility is limited to a single stage of logistics (process) flexibility accompanied with necessary process (logistics) flexibility, we show that both types of flexibility are most effective when positioned directly at the source of variability. However, although expected profit increases as logistics flexibility is positioned closer to the source of variability (i.e., downstream for demand variability and upstream for supply variability), locating process flexibility anywhere except at the stage with variability leads to the same decrease in expected profit. </jats:p>",

Counterfeit drugs do not meet quality standards and do not declare their real composition and/or source for the purposes of fraud. They may be generic or innovative, they may contain genuine constituents in a fake packaging, or wrong ingredients, or inactive ingredients, or an incorrect quantity of the active substance. In Croatia, no cases of counterfeit medicines have been detected so far, but the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices has received 34 samples of medicines and other products for testing from Zagreb City Police. The samples included medicines for erectile dysfunction: sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. Twenty-three samples of tablets without marketing authorisation in Croatia were tested with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the declared sildenafil and tadalafil content. Samples labelled 1 (batch T/33), 3 (batch T/33), 5 (batch 4), 6 (batch M0016J), 10 (batch T-070235), 12 (batch T-070544), 15 (batch 314833201), 16 (batch 832718474), and 17 (batch 504830028) containing sildenafil and samples labelled 20 (batch 070356), 21 (batch 05668), and 22 (batch T 378 5) containing tadalafil did not contain the active substance within the acceptable 95 % to 105 % margin of deviation from the declared content. While most samples cannot be described as fake with a reasonable amount of certainty, there is still a suspicion of counterfeit.

This can be addressed adequately using a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To attain an effective and efficient CLSC, it is necessary to imbibe a holistic performance measurement approach. In order to achieve this, there is a need to adopt a specific approach for a particular product rather than being generic. Since sustainability has direct environmental footprints that involve organizational stakeholders, suppliers, customers and the society at large, complexities surrounding supply chain performance measurement have multiplied. In this study, a suitable approach has been proposed for CLSC performance measurement in the automotive industry, based on reviewed literature. It is believed that this approach will result in increased effectiveness and efficiency in CLSC performance measurement.</jats:p>"

Unlike a warehouse, which offers storage, a cross‐dock is a high performance rapid transit point that does not provide storage. Although cross‐docks have been studied with some thoroughness, what has not been seen clearly is that a cross‐dock does not operate in isolation and therefore can't be optimized independently from the upstream and downstream processes. To be successful, cross‐dock optimization makes demands for high performance on all members of the supply chain in terms of speed, effective planning, high reliability, near error‐proof processes and a high degree of transparency, visibility and information‐sharing; accordingly, the article refers to this integrative perspective as a “cross‐dock based supply chain.” To make clear this interdependency between the cross‐dock and the chain based on it, a new definition that classifies types of cross‐dock based supply chains is offered. To assist scholars analyzing and industry management choosing a cross‐dock approach, cross‐dock based supply chains are classified as falling into three different types. Lastly, based on field work in industry and on literature review, nine critical success factors for cross‐dock based supply chain operations are offered.</jats:p>",

In the present study, a method was developed for analysis of NCl3 concentration in water using headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS–GC/MS). For quantification of NCl3, m/z of 51 was selected because other major m/z of NCl3 were also observed as fragments of trichloromethane (CHCl3) and the peaks of NCl3 and CHCl3 overlapped on the chromatogram. The limit of quantification for NCl3 was set to 15 μg-Cl2/L. The calibration curve of NCl3 was expressed as a quadratic curve because of the partial NCl3 decomposition. NCl3 concentrations in chlorinated ammonium solution were determined by HS–GC/MS and titration using N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine and ferrous ammonium sulfate (DPD/FAS), and the results using the two methods were similar at pH 6 and 7. However, at pH 8, NCl3 was detected using HS–GC/MS, but not using DPD/FAS titration. NCl3 concentrations in nine tap water samples were determined using HS–GC/MS and ranged from &amp;lt; 15 to 46 μg-Cl2/L. The results of the present study indicated that HS–GC/MS is applicable to determination of NCl3 in drinking water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is common for a retailer to sell products from competing manufacturers. How then should the firms manage their contract negotiations? The supply chain coordination literature focuses either on a single manufacturer selling to a single retailer or one manufacturer selling to many (possibly competing) retailers. We find that some key conclusions from those market structures do not apply in our setting, where multiple manufacturers sell through a single retailer. We allow the manufacturers to compete for the retailer's business using one of three types of contracts: a wholesale-price contract, a quantity-discount contract, or a two-part tariff. It is well known that the latter two, more sophisticated contracts enable the manufacturer to coordinate the supply chain, thereby maximizing the profits available to the firms. More importantly, they allow the manufacturer to extract rents from the retailer, in theory allowing the manufacturer to leave the retailer with only her reservation profit. However, we show that in our market structure these two sophisticated contracts force the manufacturers to compete more aggressively relative to when they only offer wholesale-price contracts, and this may leave them worse off and the retailer substantially better off. In other words, although in a serial supply chain a retailer may have just cause to fear quantity discounts and two-part tariffs, a retailer may actually prefer those contracts when offered by competing manufacturers. We conclude that the properties a contractual form exhibits in a one-manufacturer supply chain may not carry over to the realistic setting in which multiple manufacturers must compete to sell their goods through the same retailer. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the consequences of any decision at the strategic level are propagated to the tactical and even the operational levels. In order to support highly efficient flexibility while avoiding infrastructure over-sizing, resource saturation and poor coordination of activities and resources, it is important to consider the cause—effect interaction of strategic decisions with operational ones. In this paper, a discrete-event system simulation approach to evaluate the influence of the internal interactions among material, people, information and financial resources on the success of a Spanish optician supply chain is introduced. The emergent dynamics are analyzed and a redesign of the business and distribution network is proposed to foster synergy among supply chain actors. </jats:p>",

This paper extends the definition of such a measure by incorporating the detailed information of the supply chain structure, the number of variants offered by each node in the supply chain, and the mix ratios of the variants at each node. The complexity measure is then applied to finding the optimal assembly supply chain configuration given the number of variants offered at the final assembler and the mix ratios of these variants. The optimal assembly supply chain configuration is theoretically studied in two special scenarios: (1) there is only one dominant variant among all the variants offered by the final assembler, and (2) demand shares are equal across all variants at the final assembler. It is shown that in the first scenario where one variant dominates the demand, the optimal assembly supply chain should be nonmodular; but in the scenario of equal demand shares, a modular supply chain is better than nonmodular one when the product variety is high. Finally a methodology is developed to find the optimal supply chain with/without assembly sequence constraints for general demands.</jats:p>",

Hydrogen peroxide (6%) was applied to find the lymphatic vessels by using a surgical microscope. The vessels were injected with a radio‐opaque mixture and dissected. During the dissection, several sites of paralymphatics arteriole nutrient (PAN) vessels were found in close proximity to collecting lymphatic vessels in the medial aspect of the leg. The caliber of the lymphatic vessels was about 1 mm. The caliber of PAN vessels was &lt;0.1 mm. The blood vessels were seen running along the lymphatic vessels. Some of them crossing the lymphatics and supplying the fatty tissue nearby and some running parallel on the lymph vessel walls. Histology sections show different‐sized PAN vessels containing blood cells situated close to the lymphatic wall and within the lymphatic vessel wall. PAN vessels have been found and described.

Telecommunications companies are less likely to provide such communities with needed infrastructure because of their lower population densities; these communities also tend to have lower levels of factors known to influence the access decision, such as education and income.This study looks at the broadband Internet setting in Oklahoma over a 3-year period, examining the diffusion of infrastructure and access rates. A nonlinear decomposition technique allows for measurement of how characteristics such as the availability of infrastructure contribute to observed metropolitan—micropolitan or metropolitan—noncore digital divides.The results suggest that although differences in infrastructure are consistently only minor contributors to the divide, their importance has increased as knowledge about the Internet has diffused. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The overuse of its currency processing facilities by depository institutions (DIs) has motivated the Federal Reserve (Fed) to impose its new cash recirculation policy. This overuse is characterized by the practice of cross-shipping, where a DI both deposits and withdraws cash of the same denomination in the same business week in the same geographical area. Under the new policy, which came into effect July 2007, the Fed has imposed a recirculation fee on cross-shipped cash. The Fed intends to use this fee to induce DIs to effectively recirculate cash so that the societal cost of providing cash to the public is lowered. To examine the efficacy of this mechanism, we first characterize the social optimum and then analyze the response of DIs under a recirculation fee levied on cross-shipped cash. We show that neither a linear recirculation fee, which is the Fed's current practice, nor a more sophisticated nonlinear fee is sufficient to guarantee a socially optimal response from DIs. We then derive a fundamentally different mechanism that induces DIs to self-select the social optimum. Our mechanism incorporates a fairness adjustment that avoids penalizing DIs that recirculate their fair share of cash and rewards DIs that recirculate more than this amount. We demonstrate that the mechanism is easy to implement and tolerates a reasonable amount of imprecision in the problem parameters. We also discuss a concept of welfare-preserving redistribution wherein the Fed allows a group of DIs to reallocate (amongst themselves) their deposits and demand if such a possibility does not increase societal cost. Finally, we analyze the impact of incorporating the custodial inventory program, another component of the Fed's new policy. </jats:p>",

International and sometimes national agencies stipulate financial justifications for infrastructure funding. Expansion of drinking water network with external funding therefore requires explicit economic estimates. A methodology suitable for local condition has been developed in this study. Relevant field data were collected for estimating the cost of supply. The artificial neural network technique has been used for cost estimate. The willingness to pay survey has been used for estimating the benefits. Cost and benefit have been compared with consideration of time value of money. The risk and uncertainty have been investigated by Monte Carlo's simulation and sensitivity analysis. The results in this case indicated that consumers were willing to pay for supply of drinking water. It has been also found that supply up to 20 km from the treatment plant is economical after which new plants should be considered. The study would help to plan for economically optimal improvement of water supply. It could be also used for estimating the water tariff structure for the city.\n                    </jats:p>"

The aim is to compare conventional disinfection with advanced oxidation processes (O3, O3/H2O2, O3/TiO2 and O3/H2O2/TiO2) used for the removal of nonylphenol compounds present in natural water. Furthermore, a study is carried out of the by-products (THMs) generated as a consequence of the presence of natural organic matter. Preoxidation by chlorine completely oxidizes 4n-nonylphenol and technical nonylphenol. It can be seen that the best of the advanced oxidation processes is the O3/H2O2, achieving an average oxidation of 55%, although the differences among the processes were not very significant. Furthermore, the use of post-chlorination guarantees the total removal of nonylphenol compounds.</jats:p>",

While their early to late development has been studied in great detail, processes underlying the caryopses’ diurnal adaptation to changes in light, temperature, and the fluctuations in phloem-supplied carbon and nitrogen have remained unknown. In an attempt to identify diurnally affected processes in developing caryopses at the early maturation phase, we monitored global changes of both gene expression and metabolite levels. We applied the 22 K Barley1 GeneChip microarray and identified 2,091 differentially expressed (DE) genes that were assigned to six major diurnal expression clusters. Principal component analysis and other global analyses demonstrated that the variability within the data set relates to genes involved in circadian regulation, storage compound accumulation, embryo development, response to abiotic stress, and photosynthesis. The correlation of amino acid and sugar profiles with expression trajectories led to the identification of several hundred potentially metabolite-regulated DE genes. A comparative analysis of our data set and publicly available microarray data disclosed suborgan-specific expression of almost all diurnal DE genes, with more than 350 genes specifically expressed in the pericarp, endosperm, or embryo tissues. Our data reveal a tight linkage between day/night cycles, changes in light, and the supply of carbon and nitrogen. We present a model that suggests several phases of diurnal gene expression in developing barley caryopses, summarized as starvation and priming, energy collection and carbon fixation, light protection and chaperone activity, storage and growth, and embryo development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine the use of consumer cash mail‐in rebates offered by a manufacturer in a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader and the retailer is the follower. Our analysis indicates that rebates are profitable for manufacturers if consumers are inconsistent in the sense that their rebate valuation when they make purchase decisions is independent of their redemption probabilities when they make redemption decisions. If the manufacturer keeps the wholesale price unchanged, then the rebate increases the retailer's profit by a larger amount than the increase in the manufacturer's profit. If the manufacturer jointly optimizes the wholesale price and rebate, then the increase in the manufacturer's profit is twice the increase in the retailer's profit. The retailer responds to rebates by increasing the retail price, which increases the margin paid by consumers who do not redeem the rebate. On average, consumer surplus decreases when it is optimal for manufacturers to offer rebates. We suggest incentive schemes that make it worthwhile for retailers to limit the price increase. In these incentive schemes, the manufacturer imposes a negative relationship between the rebate value and the retail price. We show that such incentives increase supply chain profits. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability is playing a larger role in how we construct buildings. Many organizations are trying to reduce the life-cycle costs of their buildings by using “green building” practices. Currently, the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program dominates the building certification scheme. Most new construction projects require a substantial amount of wood. The only approved wood source that can help qualify new construction for LEED certification is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified wood. Given the dramatic increase in new green construction, this study assessed the availability and use of FSC wood in LEED certification projects throughout New York State (NYS). We surveyed architects working on LEED projects to determine how FSC-certified wood was used and if they were having difficulty acquiring such wood. We suspected a green supply chain bottleneck at the sawmill level may impact end users in the LEED certification process. Our results indicate that architects are very knowledgeable about FSC wood and would like to incorporate it into their designs. We found no issues in sourcing FSC wood for LEED projects. Although architects prefer to buy locally, many must procure FSC wood outside of NYS. Many architects are paying a premium price for FSC wood, which may impact their decision to use it on future LEED construction projects.</jats:p>",

The different sectors are coordinated with each other, while enterprises within each compete in order to optimize their own objectives. This research studies the impacts of competitive and cooperative relationships between the enterprises on the dynamics of the TSC under quantity competition. Simultaneous non-cooperative games are used to model the competitive quantity decisions between enterprises in the same sector. A sequential game is established between the three sectors to coordinate tourist numbers. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to examine the dynamics of the supply chain in terms of several operating parameters, such as operating costs, sector size and product differentiation. Among the key findings are that member enterprises in one sector can benefit from intensified competition in a complementary sector in the same layer and that the upstream enterprises in the tourism supply chain prefer package holiday product differentiation strategies. </jats:p>",

In 2003 the test was selected for incorporation into a scheme for acceptance of CPDW in the framework of implementation of the European Construction Product Directive and Drinking Water Directive. The pass/fail criterion for the BPP test is based on the sum of microbial growth in water and in biofilm caused by substances released from CPDW. The test is performed at a surface-to-volume contact ratio (S/V) of 0.17 cm−1, that is quite different from the practice in buildings and domestic installations, where the usual ratios are 2.1 cm−1 for 3/4 inches pipe, 1.6 cm−1 for 1 inches pipe or 1.0 cm−1 for 1.5 inches pipe. The goal of the study was to evaluate the importance of S/V ratio for performance of the BPP test and for correct assessment of the growth promoting properties of CPDW. The BPP of 10 pipe products were compared under the S/V ratios of 0.17 cm−1 and 1.7 cm−1. The BPP of most polymer products were higher under the S/V ratio of 1.7 cm−1 in individual trials, but the differences were insignificant. However, the planktonic biomass concentrations were 4–14 fold higher at larger S/V ratio and this can be important from hygienic point of view. For acceptance of CPDW, besides a pass/fail criterion for the BPP, the planktonic biomass concentration could be taken as a second criterion for evaluation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are faced with the problem of expanding urban growth and demographic shift, necessitating the need to achieve a sustainable rate of positive economic growth. To move toward a sustainable future, many reforms have been implemented, including in the energy sector. Reforms in the energy sector will lead to a secure future energy supply, open globalised energy market, as well as providing basic energy needs. Unfortunately electrical energy production within SSA countries is primarily by wood fueled power stations and large hydroschemes (with oil and gas to a lesser extent). Large hydropower systems are environmentally destructive, and the combustion of wood generates millions of tons of carbon dioxide and green house gas emissions. The recent price fluctuations of crude oil and natural gas and the inconsistent and insufficient power supply have further increased public dissatisfaction. This paper demonstrates how the SSA region with its natural resources is capable of producing a stable electrical energy supply sector through renewable energy technologies (RETs), extending electricity supply to off-grid areas via photovoltaics (PV) and maintaining a continuous energy supply, with no significant impact on the environment and detriment to health of the local population. The most common characteristics of weak and unstable grids in SSA countries and their energy generation are investigated. Distributed generation technologies for rural electrifications (PV off-grid systems) as well as the grid-connected PVs are evaluated. This paper also demonstrates the possibility and merits of promoting specific RETs such as combined solar thermal energy systems for hospital equipment sterilization and powering solar air-conditioning systems in SSA countries, thus offsetting dependence on current power supply networks.</jats:p>",

Residual chlorine was undetectable in 100% samples. Salmonella was detected in 4 samples by enrichment culture technique in Selenite F broth followed by plating on Salmonella-Shigella Agar. A total of 10 isolates were identified as Salmonella (S. Paratyphi, 10% and non-typhi, 90%) by conventional biochemical test. The majority of the isolates were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials tested; however, resistance was observed to amoxicillin (70%), cephalexin (20%) and ceftizoxime (14.28%). There was no significant relationship between coliform and Salmonella positivity (P = 0.366). The microbiological quality of urban water supply system is poor and indicates chances of outbreak of Salmonella infection.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water utilities have experienced increasing pressure to minimise the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), as reflected in the increasingly stringent regulations and guidelines for the concentrations of DBPs in drinking water. Understanding the disinfection characteristics and molecular weight (MW) distribution of natural organic matter (NOM) will assist in the optimisation of drinking water treatment processes to minimise the formation of DBPs. This study investigated the disinfection behaviour of MW fractions of NOM isolated from a Western Australian source water. The NOM was fractionated and separated using preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the fractions were chlorinated in the presence of bromide ion. The larger MW fractions of NOM were found to produce the highest concentrations of DBPs (trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, and haloaldehydes), with the low MW fractions still producing significant amounts of these DBPs. The results also showed a trend of an increasing proportion of brominated DBPs with decreasing MW and aromatic character. Considering that the smaller MW fractions of NOM produce significant amounts of DBPs, with a higher relative contribution from brominated DBPs, water treatment processes need to be optimised for either bromide removal or the removal of aliphatic, small MW fractions of NOM, in order to meet DBP guidelines and regulations.</jats:p>",

This article presents a new Supply Chain Resilience Framework to help businesses deal with change. The conceptual framework is based on extant literature and refined through a focus group methodology. Our findings suggest that supply chain resilience can be assessed in terms of two dimensions: vulnerabilities and capabilities. The Zone of Resilience is defined as the desired balance between vulnerabilities and capabilities, where it is proposed that firms will be the most profitable in the long term. We identified seven vulnerability factors composed of 40 specific attributes and 14 capability factors from 71 attributes that facilitate the measurement of resilience. The article concludes with managerial implications and recommendations for future research.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, prior to a message exchange, partners adopt one particular message specification that constrains message structure and syntax to implement compatible application message interfaces. However, in open, dynamic supply-chains, the applications need to interact even though their message interfaces are based on different, yet incompatible message specifications. To achieve such interactions, we propose the Message Metamodel-based semantic reconciliation of B2B messages. The Message Metamodel is a novel, ontological form that provides for common representation of B2B message specifications and messages of various syntaxes, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The experimental investigation showed that proposed semantic reconciliation architecture built atop the Message Metamodel (1) insulates the reconciliation activities from the specific message syntaxes, (2) supports the reconciliation of messages irrespective of message standards used, and (3) enables seamless interoperable message exchange between heterogeneous supply-chain applications. </jats:p>",

After a brief introduction, the paper begins by tracing the history and evolution of the semiconductor industry including the two seminal enterprises: Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory and Fairchild Semiconductor. Starting from the invention of the transfer resistor (transistor) by three Nobel laureates (John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain and William Shockley) and the founding of the \"most successful failure\" in Silicon Valley, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory and the Fairchild Eight, the paper discusses some earliest entrepreneurial attempts in the industry and how these attempts influenced over seventy semiconductor companies in Silicon Valley, including Intel Corporation, National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices. The paper then examines the industry's developing business models, from the vertically integrated model to the integrated device manufacturing model to the development of the foundry model. Finally, the paper looks at the industry's growing trend of globalization together with its outsourcing/off-shoring and supply chain management developments. The authors believe that such a multi-disciplinary approach to study an industry provides valuable insights into the evolution and development of an entire industry and the approach can be generalized to study other industries to enhance understanding at the industry level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Shortages of family physicians, specialists and other personnel working within the realm of conventional medicine (CM) concern citizens in many regions and municipalities in Canada. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches (such as chiropractic, holistic, homeopathic, naturopathic, massage and acupuncture) are increasingly used in conjunction with, or in some cases as replacements for, conventional medicine. Thus, to get an idea of ‘total’ health care supply in a jurisdiction and to draw comparisons between locations, it is useful to understand the spatial tendencies of both CM and CAM offices. With the use of a sample that contains the location, employment and sales of 4,955 CAM and 8,709 CM offices, this study details the spatial patterns of health care supply in the Canadian province of Ontario. The analysis comprises three main parts. First, the geographic tendencies of CAM and CM office activity are revealed in per capita terms and while regional differences are detectable, the main contrast is that CAM displays a much more even distribution across the urban‐rural continuum in comparison to CM. Second, through the use of location quotients and a local spatial autocorrelation analysis, it is shown that certain municipalities (especially in Ontario's southwest and south‐central regions) specialize in CAM and the most outstanding spatial feature is an ‘81 municipality CAM cluster’ that represents arguably the pinnacle of CAM activity in the province. CM specialization is rarer and is biased towards the more populated municipalities. Third, a Spearman's correlation analysis suggests that CAM and CM health care supply are associated with community well‐being indictors and urban density measures</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

According to the ABR, only medical physicists who are graduates of a Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs, Inc. (CAMPEP) accredited academic or residency program will be admitted for examination in the years 2012 and 2013. Only graduates of a CAMPEP accredited residency program will be admitted for examination beginning in the year 2014. An essential question facing the radiation oncology physics community is an estimation of supply and demand for medical physicists through the year 2020. To that end, a Demand &amp; Supply dynamic model was created using STELLA software. Inputs into the model include: a) projected new cancer incidence and prevalence 1990–2020; b) AAPM member ages and retirement projections 1990–2020; c) number of ABR physics diplomates 1990–2009; d) number of patients per Qualified Medical Physicist from Abt Reports I (1995), II (2002) and III (2008); e) non‐CAMPEP physicists trained 1990–2009 and projected through 2014; f) CAMPEP physicists trained 1993–2008 and projected through 2014; and g) working Qualified Medical Physicists in radiation oncology in the United States (1990–2007). The model indicates that the number of qualified medical physicists working in radiation oncology required to meet demand in 2020 will be 150–175 per year. Because there is some elasticity in the workforce, a portion of the work effort might be assumed by practicing medical physicists. However, the minimum number of new radiation oncology physicists (ROPs) required for the health of the profession is estimated to be 125 per year in 2020. The radiation oncology physics community should plan to build residency programs to support these numbers for the future of the profession.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.90.+y, 87.53.‐j</jats:p>",

To detect the both indicator and diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) a method was developed using the Colilert® Quanti-Tray/2000 system and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 619 samples were collected from springs (33), boreholes (24), taps (5), rivers (36), streams (8), domestic storage containers (253), raw sewage (1), final effluents (5), stool (149), soil (5) and toilet seat swab (100) samples from various provinces in South Africa. E. coli was enumerated using the Colilert® Quanti-Tray's/2000 and DNA extracted from E. coli positive wells and used as template for a multiplex-PCR targeting genes specific to entero-pathogenic- (EPEC), entero-haemorrhagic- (EHEC), entero-invasive- (EIEC), entero-toxigenic (ETEC) and entero-aggregative E. coli (EAEC). The internal control was detected in 99% of positive E. coli samples. EAEC was detected in 17%, EIEC in 4%, ETEC in 11%, EHEC in 9% and EPEC in 21% of the E. coli positive samples. It is shown that this method can be used for the detection of DEC from a wide range of samples enriched with Colilert® Quanti-Tray's/2000.</jats:p>",

The preliminary results showed UV irradiation and MO had a strong synergetic catalytic effect on ozonation. We also studied the effect of UV lamp power, MO dosage, O3 dosage, initial 4-CP concentration, pH value and temperature. The results showed that high pressure mercury lamp (HPML) was more favorable for the degradation of 4-CP than low pressure mercury lamp (LPML). The optimal MO and O3 dosages were 2 g/L and 2 g/h respectively. When the 4-CP concentration was over 15 mg/L, the decrease of degradation efficiency accelerated. The acid condition was favorable for the degradation of 4-CP by UV/MO/O3. The reaction temperature could not be over 50°C. Through the mechanism discussion, we found that Mn2 +  was the most important species to catalyze the ozonation. In addition, UV irradiation could also accelerate the degradation by promoting the production of ∙OH.</jats:p>",

We first outline a base case scenario with a validated system dynamics simulation model, using supply chain characteristics as reported by a real firm, in this case a Mexican electronics supplier to U.S. automobile assemblers. We find, surprisingly, that a lower Bullwhip Effect Index (BE) does not always lead to lower costs in the supply chain studied. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis suggests some interesting, counterintuitive results. The implications of these findings are further developed as we test how lead time reduction can also reduce the Bullwhip Effect in the simulated setting.</jats:p>",

Particular attention was given to Cyanoprokaryota and presence of cyanotoxins in the water samples. Twenty-nine species belonging to six divisions (Cyanoprokaryota, Chlorophyta, Zygnemophyta, Dinophyta, Euglenophyta and Bacillariophyta) were identified. The microscopic examination of the phytoplankton samples showed the dominance of Ankyra judayi, Oocystis lacustris (Chlorophyta) and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Cyanoprokaryota) in July 2006, and Microcystis pulverea, Synechococcus elongatus (Cyanoprokaryota), Radiococcus planktonicus (Chlorophyta) and Melosira varians (Bacillariophyta) in September 2006. A blooming event due to Aphanizomenon flos-aquae was observed in July 2006. The reservoir exhibits a tendency to shift from an oligotrophic environment to a state of mesotrophy. Presence of cyanotoxins such as anatoxin-a, microcystins and saxitoxins were analyzed by HPLC and ELISA methods. Our results demonstrated the presence of anatoxin-a and microcystins (0.09 µg/L) in the raw water samples from July 2006, and saxitoxins (2.5 µg/L) and microcystins (0.18 µg/L) in the raw water samples from September 2006. The study underlines that permanent monitoring programs of Cyanoprokaryota in the reservoirs used as sources of drinking water and toxicity assessments should be implemented. Indirect exposure and transfer of cyanotoxins through food chains must also be considered.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the authors extend the technology acceptance model (TAM) to incorporate the state of the technology environment (technological turbulence) and the extent to which other supply chain technologies have already been adopted by the firm (technological breadth). A series of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) were used to analyze survey data from 195 respondents. The results show that in technologically turbulent environments, the relationships between the firm's perceived usefulness and ease of use and the firm's intention to use a supply chain technology are stronger. The study also finds that the relationship between the firm's intention to use a supply chain technology and the implementation of the technology is weaker in firms with greater technological breadth.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The antiquity of the potsherds places them within the oldest pottery production sequences in the Iberian Peninsula, which adds to the interest of this study. Ten potsherds from level II and five from level III are analysed for their petrographic and chemical characterization. The petrographic data show two different methods of raw materials manufacture—intentionally tempered pottery (ITP), using calcite and/or limestone and grog, and naturally or non‐intentionally tempered pottery (NTP). According to the matrix paste features, on the basis of the amount, shape, and average or size range of the mineral inclusions, clayed (<jats:italic>type A</jats:italic>) and sandy (<jats:italic>type B</jats:italic>) paste types were established and related to two different source areas. The chemical features also indicate two raw material sources and are in agreement with the petrographic paste types. The absence of significant chemical and mineralogical differences between the pottery from levels II and III suggests two contrasting areas for raw materials supply that lasted for at least 600 years.</jats:p>",

Time series forecasting analysis based on the secondary data was carried out to identify the past, present and future trends of rice production, prices and self sufficiency level. Focus group discussions and field observations used to construct the rice trading pattern. Primary data on consumer attitudes on government rice risk management obtained through the field survey. The study locations include both major rice growing areas (Hambantota, Anuradhapura and Pollonnnaruwa) as well as important consumer hubs (Colombo, Ratnapura, Galle, Matara and Hambantota). Cultivated and harvested land extends and yield have positive increasing trend while simple time series modeler explains the increasing trend of retail prices. Private sector is playing a very important role in rice marketing channel where government intervention is minimal. Behavior of the rice processors has direct impact on the availability of rice and the pricing in dome market. Consumers have negative attitudes on government rice risk management and they are not confident on state intervention. Key words: Rice;  Sri Lanka; time series forecasting; consumer attitudes.

As such, this research was developed to explore the important concept of supply chain integration through strategic governance theory development.

In rat duodenum, iron gavage resulted in the relocation of DMT1 to basal domains and the internalization of basolateral FPN. Considerable FPN was also found in apical domains. In Caco-2 cells, the apical-to-basal movement of cyan fluorescent protein-tagged DMT1 was complete 90 min after the addition of iron. Steady-state membrane localization studies in Caco-2 cells revealed that iron status determined the apical/basolateral membrane distribution of DMT1 and FPN. In agreement with the membrane distribution of the transporters, <jats:sup>55</jats:sup>Fe flux experiments revealed inward and outward iron fluxes at both membrane domains. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to DMT1 or FPN inhibited basolateral iron uptake and apical iron efflux, respectively, indicating the participation of DMT1 and FPN in these fluxes. The fluxes were regulated by the iron supply; increased iron reduced apical uptake and basal efflux and increased basal uptake and apical efflux. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of intestinal iron absorption based on inward and outward fluxes at both membrane domains, and repositioning of DMT1 and FPN between membrane and intracellular compartments as a function of iron supply. This mechanism should be complementary to those based in the transcriptional or translational regulation of iron transport proteins. </jats:p>",

Owing to the bedrock morphology of this highly irregular rocky coast, two main types of valleys are defined by topographic rocky highs parallel to the coastline: 1) wide and rather shallow incised valleys offshore from a topographic sill, 2) narrow and relatively deep valleys between the sill and the coast (ria-type valley). The sedimentary infilling in both types of valleys becomes highly differentiated as the transgression advances onto the coastal area. In the wide valley seaward of the topographic sill, the infilling consists mainly of offshore heterolithic facies while, in the ria-type valley, most of the infill is composed of brackish mudflat deposits and estuarine tidal muddy sands. As the transgression proceeds, the rocky highs are flooded and the whole area is finally covered by the offshore facies. Radiocarbon dating indicates that: 1) the marine ravinement surface is highly diachronous (a few thousand years cross-shore); 2) the top of the offshore facies, coarser and very shelly, represents an episode of condensed sedimentation from about 3000 to 4000 years ago, amalgamating the maximum flooding surface (MFS) and the highstand systems tract (HST). However, we observe a muddy drape, strongly bioturbated in places, in the most proximal areas, overlying the offshore facies. It is thought to represent the modern and most recent stage of sedimentary infilling. This mud cover is made of fine-grained sediments of fluvial and biological origin, and is interpreted as a prograding HST. It reflects an increased influx, partly due to human activities. Finally, the main features of incised valley sedimentary infilling in a rocky coast context with low sediment supply can be characterized by (i) the very strong control of bedrock morphology, (ii) the diachronous character of the transgression, (iii) the late position of the MFS, and (iv), the highly reduced volume of the HST.</jats:p>",

This strategy was experimentally proven to be successful in arachidonic acid fermentation, relatively high arachidonic acid production (15.9 g/L) and dry cell weight (42.5 g/L) was achieved by applying this strategy. The arachidonic acid productivity (2.27 g/L/d) was also successfully improved by 50.3 % and 28.9 %, respectively, compared with fermentations in which agitation speed was kept constant at 180 rpm and under a two‐stage agitation speed control strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water-supply companies monitor the state of their pipe networks and ensure that the pipes are clean and free of inert loose deposits by flushing and pigging. Flushing involves forcing high speed water through the pipes so as to carry away particulates, pigging consists of forcing an object (the pig) through the pipe so as to push or wipe away the loose material. Both systems have drawbacks; the first tends to use very large volumes of water, and it may be impossible to get the required velocities in large-diameter pipes. The second requires purpose built launch and receive stations and may run the risk of damaging the pipe walls. This paper presents an innovative alternative to water flushing or conventional pigging for the potable-water-supply industry. This alternative uses a phase change material (ice—water slurry), which can be introduced into and removed from existing pipe networks with minimal alterations. The underlying concept is that when an ice slurry is propelled through pipes at modest speeds, the wall shear is two to four orders of magnitude higher than that which would have been achieved had water (only) been travelling in the pipe at the same speed. Thus, even with relatively low speeds, the ‘ice pig’ is able to achieve efficient cleaning and removal of loose materials. This technology has the advantage that the ice pig changes its shape to fit the containing topology, hence it is able to navigate bends, contraction/expansions and partly open vales, while cleaning the containment walls and transporting particulates. Lastly, the ice pig is guaranteed never to get stuck, as it will simply melt away, if left for sufficient time. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper presents laboratory experimental data, qualitatively demonstrating the capability of the technique and quantitative data enabling engineers to scale and size the ice pig for full scale trials. Finally, preliminary work from full scale trails on live water trunk mains is briefly presented and discussed. </jats:p>",
