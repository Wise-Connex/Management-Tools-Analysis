The possible forms which the role of demand might have taken are specified and examined both theoretically and empirically. While demand factors cannot be ruled out altogether, they were definitely of a secondary order of importance. Neither exogenous increases in the demand for manufactures, nor induced technological change are likely to have been a factor of decisive importance. A macroeconomic interpretation of the “demand hypothesis” is examined and rejected.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Neolithisation’ as defined in this paper is the process whereby populations of Southern France modified their patterns of settlement and economic behaviour from the sixth to the third millennia bc. In moving from dependence mainly on varied seasonal resources to dependence on mainly humanly manipulated and stored resources, they created the possibility of surpluses for exchange. The main emphasis of this paper is on raw materials and changes in their use and exchange over time. Three time periods can conveniently be chosen to illustrate this change:</jats:p><jats:p>1—<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 5500 to <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>4000 bc The assemblages dating to this period and considered here belong to the Cardial culture.</jats:p><jats:p>2—<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 4000 to <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>2500 bc The assemblages dating to this period can broadly be assigned to the Chasseen culture.</jats:p><jats:p>3—<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 2500 to <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>2000 bc The varied assemblages dating to this period have been described as Chalcolithic. However, since little copper is known in relation to stone, it will be described here as Late Neolithic.</jats:p><jats:p>The assemblages are conveniently illustrated in Courtin 1975.</jats:p>",
