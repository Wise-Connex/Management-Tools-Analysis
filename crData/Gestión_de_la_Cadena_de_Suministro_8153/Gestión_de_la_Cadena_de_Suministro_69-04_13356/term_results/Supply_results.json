Results are presented as annual cost differences between the alternatives as functions of voyage length, with other significant factors as parameters. These results confirm the general belief that distillation is to be preferred, even if shore water did not typically require redistillation before use. Circumstances in which shore water might nonetheless be an attractive alternative are pointed out.</jats:p>",

The embryos show extensive developmental modifications involving in particular the posterior cerebral artery anterior cerebral artery, ophthalmic artery, and mesencephalic artery. The posterior cerebral arteries of both sides fuse to form the common ethmoidal artery, which forms a connection with the anterior cerebral artery. A portion of the latter then degenerates posterior to the common ethmoidal artery; the posterior cerebral arteries thus become the sole intracranial source of supply for the naso‐olfactory regions. The ophthalmic artery functions only during early embryonic stages and is later replaced by the orbital artery. The formation of flexures in the brain influences the development of the embryonic mesencephalic artery and causes the posterior ramus of this vessel to become the stem of the definitive mesencephalic artery.</jats:p>",

The model is applied to data consisting of a sample of Massachusetts towns, separate functions being estimated for household and industrial demand. Two cross sections are estimated, one for 1962 and one for 1965, the beginning and the end, respectively, of the New England drought.</jats:p><jats:p>As far as household demand is concerned, price, uncertainty as measured by supply variance, and particularly housing space are significant, whereas for industrial demand only the first two variables are significant. The results also indicate that firms are more responsive than households to both price and uncertainty and that their response to uncertainty lessened as a result of the drought, an implication that agrees with the theoretical model.</jats:p>",
