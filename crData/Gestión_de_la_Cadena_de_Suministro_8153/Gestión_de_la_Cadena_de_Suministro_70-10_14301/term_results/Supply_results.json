      "abstract": "<jats:p>A costing procedure was developed in the desalt studies made in Texas so that calculations of the cost of water supply produced by saline water conversion could be compared to the cost of providing an alternative freshwater supply from a conventional source. In studies made by the Texas Water Development Board, the cost of desalted water is generally higher than the cost of water from alternative sources. For desalting, the elements included in the costing procedure were: well fields for saline feedwater supply; intake system and pumping station; pipelines; pretreatment for saline water; the desalting plant ; and brine disposal. For a conventional water supply system the elements of cost included were raw water cost; well field or intake system; pipeline and required pumping stations; and a conventional water treatment plant. The final economic justification of a desalt project may include such factors as chemical quality comparisons, secondary benefits, and project life comparison to future availability of alternative supply. The Texas Water Development Board considers that desalting is a very practical solution to the interim water supply problems that exist in many areas of the state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes a method for cost-effectiveness studies of civil engineering works and illustrates it by an example of its application to an urban-systems problem. This approach tries to bridge the dichotomy of objectives that often exists between the policy levels of government and the engineering agencies, and that leads to frequent impasses for implementation. The process first broadens the traditional terms of reference for public-works design, which are usually governed by engineering standards only tenuously related to the multiple objectives of a facility. Second, a procedure is suggested for generating alternative configurations for the system and its components. Finally, a means is presented for exploring alternative time-phased strategies of development. The paper presents a case study of the application of this approach to the planning and design of New York City's Third City Water Supply Tunnel, and discusses its lessons. </jats:p>",
