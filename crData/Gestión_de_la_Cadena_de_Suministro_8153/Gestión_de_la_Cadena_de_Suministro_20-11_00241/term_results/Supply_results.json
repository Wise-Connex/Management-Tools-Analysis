      "abstract": "<jats:p>The literature has extensively discussed whether and how public organizations differ from private ones. Publicness theory argues that the degree of publicness is determined by ownership, funding, goal setting, and control structure of an organization. However, these theoretical ideas have not yet been extended to the interorganizational level. The need for further research is reflected in the sustained debate on the applicability of for‐profit management approaches in public contexts and supply chains. Starting from the premise of the dimensional publicness theory, this study focuses on theory elaboration. We focus our empirical study on the criminal justice supply chain, which encompasses the process of bringing a criminal case to court. This chain provides an interesting public case to explore how specific dimensions of publicness affect or limit supply chain integration mechanisms. The results of our series of embedded cases focusing on Dutch criminal justice supply chains show that control structures, embodied in laws and regulations, define the governance of relationships between supply chain partners. In addition to these formalized ties, extensive known for‐profit information and operational integration mechanisms can be observed, along with limited relational integration. Surprisingly, although similar integration mechanisms are used as in for‐profit contexts, integration serves a different role in several of the relationships investigated: dealing with tensions stemming from the specific goal setting and stakeholders of criminal justice chains. Although our findings specifically relate to criminal justice supply chains, they have important implications for other supply chains using contracts and laws and those being selective in applying supply chain integration in cases of contrasting objectives. Moreover, we provide a stepping‐stone for the extension of publicness theory to the interorganizational level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Automation is a collection of a whole set of theories and methods to make a system work automatically as intended, in our case the urban water supply system. A critical feature of automation is the feedback principle: a sensor is measuring a certain variable, e.g. a concentration; a computer tests that the measurement is valid; a computer algorithm calculates and decides what should be corrected; a pump or valve or some other device transforms the decision to action. All of this is untouched by human hand. The ‘intention’, or the goal, must be provided to the controller. The key component of automation is the system that can represent any component or process in the water supply system and even the complete system. Automation technology always must be combined with a true understanding of people at all levels. Otherwise, there is a high risk for misunderstandings and failures. Three categories of problems are highlighted, where automation can contribute: uncertainty, feedback, and complexity. A key challenge is the handling of disturbances. Integrated management of the whole urban water cycle will be required in future urban areas to acquire sustainable operations. Automation is a crucial condition to make integration possible in complex systems.</jats:p>",

It must be optimal both thermally and economically, an indicator of which there are the costs. Graphical and analytical dependences are given. The research results substantiate the maximum effect when different thermal insulating materials are used. The aim is to increase the efficiency of energy saving measures, reduce their cost by optimizing the cost of thermal energy and insulating materials, determining the optimization criteria and justification for choice the optimal insulating material and its thickness, and determining the optimal thermal resistance, identifying ways to improve energy efficiency and substantiation of the calculation method. One of the most common thermal renovation measures, namely insulation of external walls, is considered. An economic assessment has been conducted, which is an important factor in a certain energy-saving proposition. The solution of the problem is presented, which includes two stages. The result of the first stage is the selection of the optimal heat-insulating material. The second stage is a substantiation of economically expedient thickness of the heatinsulating material. The obtained results make it possible to increase the efficiency of energy saving in thermal renovation of buildings taking into account both energy and economic aspects. In this paper the results of mathematical provement of such factor importance as the thermally conductive cost of the heat-insulating material at their thickness optimization are presented. Determining for the establishment of the normative thermal resistance in the future is the ratio of the cost of thermal energy to the thermal conductivity of the insulating material.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water Supply and Sanitation has been a priority of Government of Nepal. Various types of urban and rural water supply and sanitation projects are now being implemented within the Government, private and NGO sectors. The normal practice of measurement of satisfaction by service providers is to measure consumers’ satisfaction on past performance. The survey design could vary from survey questions to unstructured interviews and everything in between using comparative and non-comparative scales. In comparative scaling, the respondents are asked to compare one product against the other while non-comparative scaling is used to evaluate a single product. In this study, Likert Scales is used in this study for measurement of customer satisfaction on water supply. The higher level of satisfaction with water supply is expected to be positively related to several factors such as satisfaction with water quality, and other parameters such as hours and timings of water supply, tap pressure, quantity of water supplied, responsiveness and communication of management and water tariff. The respondents’ level of satisfaction indicates that about 41 percent of respondents were neutral, they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with water services, while about 36 percent of respondents were satisfied with water services. The satisfaction scale of overall satisfaction with water services was 3.29 while 1.0 indicates strongly not satisfied while 5.0 indicate strongly satisfied. The various aspects that influence satisfaction among users which include hours and timings of water supply, tap pressure, quantity of water supplied, responsiveness and communication of management and water tariff as well as redresses of customer complaints have been examined. This study focused on the users’ satisfaction of Lekhnath small town water supply and sanitation project and the study was undertaken to analyze the current users’ satisfaction of the Lekhnath small town water supply and sanitation project. The result showed that the satisfaction level of users’ is above neutral but these were not in satisfying level. The characteristics/aspects of the service that contributed to users’ satisfaction including hours and timing, pressure, quantity and quality of water while there was slightly less satisfaction with regard to complaints about water supply.</jats:p>"

The article presents the results of theoretical and experimental studies of air velocity determination in the distribution of air by round and compact jets in the boiler room. Graphical and analytical dependences are given. The research results substantiate the higher accuracy of the average air flow velocity determination in small boiler rooms. The aim of the work is to develop a method for experimental determination of the efficiency of the ventilation system in the boiler room; to increase of the accuracy of the average velocity determination of the round and the compact air jets in the plane of the supply nozzle to ensure the normative air exchange of the boiler room and to substantiate of the calculation method. The characteristics and patterns of development of round and compact air jets in the premises are established and the calculated dependences are obtained. The unitless integral air velocity for the round and compact air jets in the boiler room is established. Calculation dependences for determining of the air flow rate in the boiler room have been obtained. It is substantiated that the application of the proposed method will significantly increase the accuracy of air exchange determination in the boiler rooms to ensure the required value in accordance with regulatory requirements. Also it is substantiated that to obtain satisfactory experimental results on speed measurements in the boiler room, it is necessary to measure the speed in the center of the supply nozzle several times with maximum accuracy. Then multiply the result by the relative average velocity: for a round jet vav = 0,26 and for a compact jet – vav = 0,2025. The obtained results allow to avoid a significant error (19 %) in determining the required air exchange ventilation of the boiler room. Recommendations for the practical determination of the calculated values to ensure proper ventilation of the boiler rooms are given.</jats:p>",

Through the literature, the article found that (1) the policy environment lags behind university interventions, which resonate with international evidence; (2) international evidence reveals that multiple directions for managing travel demand for university precincts; and (3) there is a need to reform the mobility and access policies for university precincts in South Africa (SA).Conclusion: In essence, the literature review presented heterogenous contexts and techniques to specify mobility and access problems and redress them. This enhanced the quality of policy design, evaluation and implementation particularly for integrated transport planning in SA.

Therefore, analysis of water hammer surge-waves initiated into such piping systems deserves investigation. The 1-D pressurized-pipe flow model embedding the Ramos formulation was used to describe the flow behavior in the elastic and plastic pipe-based hydraulic system. Numerical computations were performed using the method of characteristics. First, the numerical solver was validated against experimental data, available from the literature. Then, the proposed solver was applied to explore the transient pressure-wave behavior resulting from the power failure to a pumping station. Results evidenced the severity of such a scenario with regards to induced positive and negative pressure-wave magnitudes. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggested that plastic pipe-wall materials allowed a significant attenuation of pressure-wave magnitude in conjunction with the expansion of the pressure-wave oscillation period. It was also found that the observed attenuation and expansion effects depended strongly upon the plastic material type. In this respect, the results revealed that LDPE provided a better trade-off between the two last effects than HDPE.</jats:p>",

The target population of the study consisted of five prequalified accredited service providers’ contractors in Bungoma County with a total composition of 293 staff from which a sample size of 169 was drawn from the entire population.The data collection tool was the questionnaire which was subjected to pre testing through piloting before actual data collection. The data was analyzed descriptively and inferentially with the aid of SPSS tool and presented by use of tables. Correlation analysis was performed to establish the relationship between variables and multiple regressions to determine the cause effect of the variables.&#x0D;\nFindings: Result of multiple regressions revealed that supply chain drivers jointly and independently influence performance of NGCDF funded projects in Bungoma County, Kenya. The study findings showed that all study variables (ICT β=0.136, p&lt;0.05, material management β=0.140, p&lt;0.05, supplier selection β=0.317, p&lt;0.05 and contract β=0.280, p&lt;0.05 were significant to performance of NGCDF funded projects in Bungoma county. Therefore the study concluded that supply chain practices of ICT, material flow, supplier selection and contractual capacity affects the performance of funded projects.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that the county government management in Kenya need to invest in constant training of their employees on effective supply chain practices to enhance their performance and appropriate measures put in place that ensure that potential risks regarding contract management and detected in advance and mitigated to enhance operational performance.</jats:p>"

The research was carried out among 116 companies from the water supply sector operating in Poland that includes water supply and sewage. The results indicate which elements were perceived by managers as key factors for survival and further functioning. It is clear that the most frequent managerial decisions made were reducing investments and sending employees for home office work, as well as prolonging the payment deadlines. Interestingly, investment reductions were accompanied by sustaining the R&amp;D expenses, as the researched organisations desired to stay competitive and innovative right after the crisis. Only a few of the water supply companies decided to make workers redundant, as the majority declared the intent to protect the workforce, e.g. by sending employees on leave. The research has also shown that the companies approached the coronacrisis rather methodologically and systematically, which indicates a good level of managerial decision-making under pressure, overall enterprise preparedness for crisis situations, as well as staff involvement. Based on our research, we offer some recommendations concerning how the water supply sector organisations can prepare for similar crises in the future. Our research indicates that the decisions made had the following goals in mind: protecting workforce and sustaining cash flow, as well as securing competitive position after the crisis. Our research also focuses on the necessary decisions to be made in water supply companies before the next crises.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>BACKGROUND: Recent studies concerning supply chain management have shown that topics such as supply chain risk management (SCRM) and supply chain resilience (SCRes) are the new trends in supply chain management. Initial studies in the early 2000s developed frameworks to identify, measure and mitigate risks and assess/evaluate the degree of resilience of a company or supply chain. Recently, a large variety of studies has emerged, including more conceptual and review studies as well as more sophisticated, quantitative studies. However, studies on human-related factors are still lacking, and there is no systematic method to answer questions such as “What literature is available concerning human factors related to SCRM and SCRes?”, “Which human factors contribute to SCRes?” and “Which human factor can amplify SC Risks?” OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to identify human factors that impact supply chain resilience and supply chain risk management. METHOD: This study was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The objective of using this review protocol is to ensure that the review has the minimum amount of bias due to research expectations. RESULTS: This study highlighted a summary of human-related risk and resilience factors as well as a discussion about these preliminary findings. CONCLUSIONS: As our main conclusion, we highlight that human factors may generate significant risks in the supply chain, nevertheless, there are other human factors that must be nourished to obtain SCRes.</jats:p>",

However, the role of the private sector in disaster management operations (DMOs) is not as prominent as the role played by (inter)governmental agencies. This article aims to investigate the relationship of collaboration and resilience in disaster management supply networks (DMSNs).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Supply network resilience criteria were defined as robustness, flexibility, velocity and visibility based on the literature review. DMSN capabilities were identified characterising each resilience criterion through the development of the Collaboration–Resilience (COLRES) Analysis Framework for DMSNs. This theoretical model was then applied to an empirical case study in the Philippines using semi-structured interviews for data gathering.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>A total of 46 cross-sector collaboration activities were identified across four disaster management phases and linked to the resilience criteria. A causal analysis of each collaboration activity and its outcome was conducted to identify relationships between collaboration types and resilience constructs. Based on these results, patterns were identified, and dependencies between collaboration and resilience were defined. Collective DMSN resilience (DMSNRES) enabled by existing cross-sector collaboration activities was evaluated against a future disaster scenario to identify resilience gaps. These gaps were used to recognise new cross-sector collaboration opportunities, thereby illustrating the continuous process of resilience building.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research provides new insights on how private sector is involved within a DMOs through collaboration with the government and other NGOs. It augments existing literature on private sector involvement in DMOs where common perception is that the sector is only involved in short-term response and recovery activities. This study finds that the private sector can be operationally involved not just in post-disaster activities, but also in mitigation and preparation phases as well. This then sets a new baseline for further research on private sector involvement within DMOs. As this study provided a novel framework to analyse collaboration activities and its impact to DMSN resilience, future work could be done by applying the model to further cases such as other countries'. DMSNs, or to more specific contexts such as inter-organisational collaborations rather than big sectors. A more detailed assessment method against a future disaster will prove relevance for the model in providing practical insights on how resilience can be built in DMSNs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research proposed a novel DMSN collaboration-resilience (COLRES) model (Figure 11) to analyse existing processes in preparation for specific disasters. Practitioners may be able to use this model with the goal of identifying resilience gaps to fill and continuously improve their processes. The model also provides practitioners the lens to improve processes with the perspective on collaboration to complement government and NGO efforts and expertise with those of the private sector. For the private sector perspective, this research provides new insights on how they can be more involved with the community to provide more sustainable and long-term contributions to the society.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>With disasters becoming more complex and frequent by the day and as humanitarian actors focus on improving their expertise, the need for every piece of the society to contribute to disaster risk reduction is continuously intensified. This research shows that each sector of the society can take part in disaster management operations to reduce unpredictability, lives impacted and increase speed of response and recovery. Each sector of the society can be of great contribution not only during post-disaster response and recovery but also during pre-disaster mitigation and preparedness phase. As such, this research echoes the call for everyone to be involved in disaster risk reduction and mitigation as a way of life.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research ultimately finds that cross-sector collaboration builds resilience in DMSNs through capacity building, redundancy sourcing, information reliability and logistics responsiveness.

Bearing in mind that water is only one of a number of vital natural resources, it is imperative that water issues are not considered in isolation. Both public and private sector managers, have to make appropriate decisions on water allocation. Water shortage, which can extensively be comprehended as the absence of access to sufficient amounts of water for human and environmental uses.&#x0D;\nThis study aims at investigating the technical, financial, environmental and social constraints that affect water supply shortages in the study area. The results and findings were based on the 359 survey questionnaires that were collected and analysed using Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 and Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS) Software version 16.0. Statistical analysis showed that all the Environmental, Technical and Financial research items were at the high and very high levels of acceptance and only all cultural research items were at a high level of acceptance. The empirical results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicate that the water supply management model fit indicates that the factors of this work are convenient and reasonably contribute to the performance of the water supply management model in the study area.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While NGO–business relationships have much in common with buyer–supplier relationships, the literature specifically indicates several additional challenges in achieving effective and efficient NGO–business relationships. The present study seeks to understand how NGOs and businesses can overcome these additional challenges. From a practitioner’s viewpoint, we not only strive to acknowledge the complementarity of NGOs and businesses for implementing successful relationship practices but also seek to understand how these understudied cross‐sector relationships can be successfully built. We use a multicase study design to investigate nine NGO–business relationships in a humanitarian context. This study contributes to the supply chain literature by demonstrating how social capital mitigates tensions within NGO–business relationships, that is, by indicating that social capital has not only a bonding, but also a bridging role when building cross‐sectoral relationships. In summary, our analysis enabled us to present a more generic process framework for creating social capital within NGO–business relationships. It shows that trust within NGO–business relationships appears to develop more naturally compared to commercial relationships, but that these relationships require more effort in terms of structural and cognitive capital to ensure that partners communicate and share knowledge efficiently, as there are inherent differences in goals and communication languages between NGOs and businesses.</jats:p>",

We provide a narrative of key actions and how they coordinated changes and offer a framework of the predictable consequences for complementary markets. We then collect data and test these predictions on outcomes in several related complementary markets. The overall findings are consistent with our framework. We show that the launch of Centrino increased the likelihood of exit from internal and external Wi‐Fi cards markets, and we find that the magnitude of the effect was largest for internal cards. We also show that the launch of Centrino's stimulated product introduction in the markets for complements overall and find that the effect varied across type of routers. Finally, we show that experience with producing Wi‐Fi cards shaped product introduction by router providers.</jats:p>",

On the demand side, families with a child make consumption, labor supply, and child-care decisions within a static, unitary household model. On the supply side, child care providers make entry, price, and quality decisions under monopolistic competition. Child development is a function of the time spent with each parent and at the child care center; these inputs vary in their impact. We estimate the structural parameters of the model using the 2003 Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, which contains information on parental employment and wages, child care choices, child development, and center quality. We use our estimates to evaluate the impact of several policies, including vouchers, cash transfers, quality regulations, and public provision. Among these, a combination of quality regulation and vouchers for working families leads to the greatest gains in average child development and to a large expansion in child care use and female labor supply, all at a relatively low fiscal cost.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This research work differentiates digital and physical cash availability based in the hypothesis that digital money is created using further virtual enterprises efficiency while physical cash, even utilizing digital supply chains, depends fundamentally of material management efficiency. This research was also considering that banks were one segment which very developed virtual integrations due to their peculiarities (high value transportation, storage, and etc.). Design Methodology: They are three different case studies. The first one about BB (Banco do Brasil), Itau, and Bradesco (the three biggest commercial banks) operations in Brazil for availability of Physical money, using official data kept by Central Bank of Brazil, IBGE, and those three above cited Banks. The digital money availability was another case study investigating the whole payment system of Brazil using POS, card, credit, debit information provided by BCB. The third case study was designed for investigating practices of digital supply chains through further usages in BB, Bradesco, and Itau. However, during the research, the original plan got no enough results, turning the last case investigation more about the same whole payment system, informing the clouding computing, the interoperability, and the reduction of physical demands like introductory results. Finding: This dissertation were able of mapping graphically how the physical money is spread across banking operations into the Brazilian territory, better saying, it shows Brazilian Bank - the total sum of Branches of BB , Bradesco and Itaú - concentrations in each municipality, and the availability of M0-Branches Reserves of those same banks across those same municipalities. The Digital money applications pointed the debit, credit, online transferring, STR, TED, DOC, intrabank operations as very used examples of digital money. Visa and Master card are the two main banner card used in Brazil, but this country has challenges of internet and mobile usages for accomplishing its ambitious project of further integration and instantaneous electronic Payments (PIX). Practical Implications: The Digital money today’s availability is not instantaneous (up to 2 workdays), it is expensive (up to R$20.00 each transaction) and not able 24 hours per day, all week (only workdays). The physical money is also compounded by hidden costs of storage, packaging, transportation and purchase, making Central Bank of Brazil spend more than R$700.00 million each year. The second tier, from BCB to Commercial Banks, has also potential of being expensive, once transportation, physical installations, third party services, surveillance, and transport represent the majority of those operational costs and should be also applied to commercial banks physical distribution</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted many industries, in particular the healthcare sector exposing systemic vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and supply chain management. A major  challenge during the pandemic was related to the increased demand of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) resulting in critical shortages for healthcare and frontline workers. The lack of information visibility combined with the inability to  precisely track product movement within the supply chain requires an robust traceability solution. Blockchain  technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology to manage and track PPE products in the supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform PPE supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We present detailed cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution for PPE supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders.&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

This document collects the main topics and the most recent approaches from the academic literature in its analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices developed by these intermediaries. The work has been structured around six recurring themes in most of the studies carried out: the new intermediaries that operate on the Internet; the role of travel agencies and tour operators in tourism sustainability; the influence of the size of the company; CSR as a disruptive innovation in this sector; the potential of the sustainable tourism supply chain; and the motivations and attitudes of the managers of these businesses when they engage with responsibility. This last topic is developed in greater detail since it is closely linked to the previous ones and dictates in most cases the meaning and function of the sustainable performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted many industries, in particular the healthcare sector exposing systemic vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and supply chain management. A major  challenge during the pandemic was related to the increased demand of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) resulting in critical shortages for healthcare and frontline workers. The lack of information visibility combined with the inability to  precisely track product movement within the supply chain requires an robust traceability solution. Blockchain  technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology to manage and track PPE products in the supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform PPE supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We present detailed cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution for PPE supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders.&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

Taking the case of Germany, we study the relationship between the embeddedness of benefit recipients in activating labor market institutions and individual labor supply. Using panel data, we estimate the effects of transitions between key institutional states with different degrees of activation on reservation wages. We show that reservation wages react to activation: the transition from gainful employment to unemployment benefit receipt leads to an average decrease of 3.1 percent in reservation wages. The transition from gainful employment to welfare benefit receipt – an institutional state with far more rigorous activation – leads to a stronger decrease of 4.9 percent. Mediation analyses show that the income associated with different institutional states is the predominant mechanism that drives the effect on reservation wages. However, subjective social status also partly mediates the effect. Implications of these findings for active labor market policies are discussed.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Amid the turbulence in the external environment, the issue of finding adaptive strategies is becoming increasingly relevant. This problem is especially acute in industrial markets. One of the most common strategies is differentiation. Numerous modern theories of differentiation rest on the distinctive features of consumer demand and often do not take into account the factors of product supply. These factors, however, serve as the basis for determining the generic development strategy of an industrial enterprise. The paper explores production differentiation and justifies the factors of supply affecting it. The theory of industrial organization, the theory of strategic management and the microeconomic approach constitute the methodological framework of the present article. General scientific methods of logic-structural analysis were used. The empirical base includes data from nine industrial markets for mechanical engineering in the Russian Federation. Having analyzed the theoretical approaches to substantiating the existence of production differentiation, we managed to identify its fundamental factors: specialization and the presence (absence) of economies of scale. To assess these factors, we propose using two indicators: the industry specialization coefficient and the indicator of absolute cost advantage. Matrixing industrial markets for mechanical engineering by the parameters “the level of industry specialization” and “economies of scale” allowed pinpointing three types of production differentiation and their corresponding generic strategies. In the presence of economies of scale and a narrow specialization, an enterprise should choose the strategy of “capturing a niche”; in the presence of economies of scale and a broad specialization, it should follow the strategy of wide differentiation. In the absence of economies of scale for broad and narrow industry differentiation, the generic strategy of a machine-building enterprise is competitive marketing. The author’s methodological approach to choosing the type of production differentiation is versatile and can be used to substantiate generic strategies of industrial enterprises.</jats:p>",

In the long run, the solution will ultimately help to reduce resources costs in production processes and throughput time of the supply chain. The Digital Twin approach can be applied in the manufacturing company and the supply chain and makes recommendations for making changes to the physical environment to meet the requirements of various specific orders. The Multitier Digital Twin approach is validated by modelling four tiers of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) company: business processes, operations workflow processes and work cells operations. The simulation study is performed to evaluate the achieved results. The guidelines are developed to connect and integrate business process tier models with operations workflow and work cell tiers models. The authors defend that the current research will help to create new digital solutions to increase manufacturing flexibility by moving toward the company’s strategic goals directly from the offer preparation stage. The authors have validated the Digital Twin approach for agile supply chain management in the fields of manufacturing. Nevertheless, the proposed approach is adaptable to other fields also, whereas the focal player or project owner selects the best KPIs that support the implementation of the chosen strategy. The paper includes a feasibility case study for the approval of findings, where small and medium enterprise (SMEs) from the manufacturing field business processes are connected to manufacturing processes and work cell models to achieve a common strategic goal of the company.</jats:p>",

Combined with the actual water supply project, under different working conditions, the theoretical calculation results and numerical simulation results were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the theoretical calculation results of the system with friction and impedance had a better fitting performance than the numerical simulation results, and the operating parameters of the air tank derived after considering the influence of friction and impedance were accurate. This method can simplify the selection process of air tank body parameters. At the same time, the shape optimization of the air tank considering friction and impedance can be improved by 40–50% compared with the results of ignoring friction and impedance.</jats:p>",

In practice, supply chains diverge significantly from the neoliberal vision of spontaneous, self-organizing market activity and more closely resemble the kind of economic planning neoliberals decry. When pressed to explain these prevalent economic forms, even neoliberals concede that economic activity is not only dependent on extraeconomic coercion from the political realm, but itself shot through with claims to authority, which is demonstrated through an interpretation of Ronald Coase’s theory of the firm. Workers and consumers who are subject to supply chains can contest these claims to authority—in the first place, by insisting on their right to freedom of association with each other—and thus begin to repoliticize the economic realm that neoliberals seek to encase.</jats:p>",

Whether such decisions are for competitive posture, cost saving or operational efficiencies, it is important to understand that supply chains integrate not only the flow of goods but also the information processes and assets and more often than not, the IT networks of the firms. Thus two developments occur. First, IT security losses of one firm collocate at the other firm's servers as information assets like demand forecasts are shared. Second, the Intranets of both firms get connected with the help of VPN or similar technologies, making it possible that a breach can travel from one firm to the other. This in turn makes IT security risks of SC firms strategically interdependent. This chapter analyzes such interdependent IT security risks and provides insights for SC and IT managers who are poised to collaborate with other downstream or upstream partner firms. </jats:p>",

This helps for supply chain industries in forecasting and managing the supply and demand of essential stocks for the future. Data is analyzed using prediction algorithms to check the actual and predicted values. The clustering algorithm along with rolling mean is used for half-yearly data of 2019 and 2020 to identify the sales of different categories of essential commodities.

The focus of the presented work is on the development of global water supplies necessary to keep pace with a growing population and global economy. With the structure of the ANEMI model, a series of experiments are conducted in order to assess: (i) the current role of water supply in the global Earth system; (ii) the level of water stress that can be expected in the future; and (iii) what are the potential effects of water quality on global surface water supply and the distribution of water supply types. The results of model simulations show that surface water resources were sufficient to meet the water demand and water quality is not shown to be a significant factor for the development of surface water supplies. Due to globally aggregated scale, these impacts are averaged and likely understated.</jats:p>"

The previous research identified antecedent rainfall as a key element that controls the non-linear behaviour of the model. The original version indirectly uses five days antecedent rainfall to identify the land condition as dry, normal or wet. This leads to a sudden jump once the land condition changes. To obviate this, the present work intends to improve the performance of antecedent rainfall-based SCS-CN models. Two forms of SCS-CN model (M1 and M2), two recently developed P-P5 based models (M3 and M4), and an alternate approach of considering P5 in the SCS-CN model (M5 and M6), as proposed here, were investigated. Based on the evaluation of several error metrics, the new proposed model M6 has performed better than other models. The performance of this model is evaluated using rainfall-runoff events of 114 watersheds located in the USA. The median value of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency was found as 0.78 for the M6 model followed by M5 (0.75), M3 (0.73), M4 (0.72), M2 (0.63) and M1 (0.61) model.</jats:p>",

The classic understanding of maritime economics (and that of the shipping industry) suggests that freight rate processes are mean-reverting and approach the level decided by the demand/supply ratio. However, statistical tests on freight rate processes often reveal these processes to be non-stationary, which means the processes would not have a mean-reverting nature. In this study, we investigated the mean-reverting nature of Panamax freight rates (Baltic Panamax 4 T/C Average) for two “means”: the actual freight rate process itself, and the deviation process of actual freight rates from estimated ones based on the demand/supply ratio. The AR (1) model can be applied to both processes, and their autoregressive coefficient φ was between 0 and 1. In the actual freight process, φ was close to 1, and a unit root test failed to reject that the process is non-stationary. By contrast, in the deviation process, φ was sufficiently smaller than 1, and a unit root test rejected that the process is non-stationary. The result can resolve the contradiction between two views on mean-reverting nature; if we focus on the actual freight rate process itself and do not consider demand/supply, the process is non-stationary and does not have a mean-reverting nature. If we focus on the deviation process of the actual freight rates from the level decided by the demand/supply ratio, the process is stationary and tends to approach zero.</jats:p>",

Research on mitochondria—156 brand new publications from 2019 and 2020—have contributed to this review. Mitochondria have been fundamental for the evolution of complex organisms. As important and semi-autonomous organelles in cells, they can adapt their function to the needs of the respective organ. They can program their function to energy supply (e.g., to keep heart muscle cells going, life-long) or to metabolism (e.g., to support hepatocytes and liver function). The capacity of mitochondria to re-program between different options is important for all cell types that are capable of changing between a resting state and cell proliferation, such as stem cells and immune cells. Major chronic diseases are characterized by mitochondrial dysregulation. This will be exemplified by cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, immune system disorders, and cancer. New strategies for intervention in chronic diseases will be presented. The tumor microenvironment can be considered a battlefield between cancer and immune defense, competing for energy supply and metabolism. Cancer cachexia is considered as a final stage of cancer progression. Nevertheless, the review will present an example of complete remission of cachexia via immune cell transfer. These findings should encourage studies along the lines of mitochondria, energy supply, and metabolism.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the results achieved provide two levels of analysis. The former highlights the impact of the adoption of blockchain in supply chains based on the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. The latter shows the positive and negative impacts of each form of sustainability. The purpose of the work is to summarize the current state of the art in order to propose a future development agenda based on the need to simulate and define a measurability for each dimension of sustainability. Finally, the study provides a broad overview of practical and managerial implications for entrepreneurs and researchers.

The operation of such a system must be managed effectively to meet up with the uncertainties, thus posing a key challenge. Unfortunately, previous information and communication technology (ICT) solutions could not provide the necessary support for applications to deal with the dynamics of the changing physical environment. Nevertheless, tremendous growth in technology offers better possibilities to enhance water supply systems’ operations. As a result, development in technology in sensing and instrumentation, communication and networking, computing and control is now jointly integrated with water supply system infrastructures to enhance the water system operations. One such technological paradigm shift is the cyber-physical system (CPS). In this paper, we present the concept of the CPS in the water system context and investigate the CPS applications to water supply system monitoring. Also, the various applications of CPSs and the application domain requirements are outlined. More importantly, research studies on its application to water system monitoring are scrutinized. As such, key challenges sounding the applications in WSSs are identified. We then outline the areas of improvement for further studies.</jats:p>"

In the present study, an attempt has been made to minimize scour depth by placing a triangular prism on the downstream side of a circular pier (35 mm dia) with one of its noses facing the direction of flow and other facing opposite to the direction of flow. Three different bed samples collected from Ghaggar, Patialki-Rao and the Kotla super-passage have been placed in a rectangular flume. Discharge values were varied from 0.0015 to 0.0186 m3/sec. Results are compared for observed scour-depth for upstream (U/S) and downstream (D/S) piers with and without protection. Arrangement with a triangular prism of 2.5 times the diameter of the circular pier in the upstream direction of the flow is very effective in reducing scour depth. Further, it is possible to reduce the scour depth with an average efficiency of 65% for Ghaggar, 56% for Patialaki-Rao and 64% for the Kotla super-passage with respect to the circular pier. The comparison of observed values of scour-depth with computed values of Lacey's scour-depth was underestimated with a maximum of ±70%. Hence, a new site-specific relationship between scour depth, discharge intensity and silt factor has been proposed. Validation of the new proposed relationship with observed data is in a good agreement ±20%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Negative changes in the environment, leading to public pressure and environmental legislation require fundamental changes in the industrial practice of business. Survey of the environment in 22 countries found that: in half of the countries surveyed, the environment is considered to be one of the three most serious problems of concern to society. In most countries, the overwhelming number of citizens surveyed indicated that the state of the environment had an impact on their health, and an even larger proportion stated that the environment had an impact on the health of their children. The article deals with the problem of increasing the level of environmental friendliness of transportation in supply chains. With the modern requirements in the integrated green supply chain, the reduction of the harmful impact of production and logistics activities on nature should be considered at all stages of the technological cycle of product development and its promotion through the supply chain. It is determined that the key technologies for reducing the anthropogenic impact on the environment are the optimization of transport processes due to the reduction of distance during transportation at all stages of the supply chain; the increase in the use of local resources (reducing fuel costs and harmful emissions); the use of modern environmentally friendly energy-efficient vehicles. The basic principles and approaches of the consolidated cargo transportation model have been substantiated, which balances environmental and economic problems and their testing has been carried out in the supply chain of the Epicenter hypermarket chain</jats:p>",

Using WTRs to remove phosphorus (P) is widely regarded as a feasible approach. However, the information is still limited on air-dried WTRs containing polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) used to adsorb P. The objectives of this study were to construct artificial neural network (ANN) models for P adsorption onto WTRs from distilled de-ionized (DDI) water solution and stormwater, to investigate the performance of ANN in predicting phosphorous adsorption, and to model isotherm adsorption, kinetics, and thermodynamics by using the index of model performance. Batch experiments were performed with different WTRs dosage, pH, initial P concentration, temperature, and time. ANN models accurately predicted the P concentration at equilibrium. Non-linearized Langmuir model fitted the isotherm data best. Pseudo second-order kinetic model provided a better fit to experimental data. The adsorption process may be at least simultaneously controlled by surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion. The P adsorption is a homogenous monolayer adsorption that is spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy production process. WTRs were found to be favorable and effective in removing P, but the P removals had significant differences in both solutions.</jats:p>",

Our research addresses the gap in knowledge surrounding the UK EV battery supply chain, as the current literature is limited whilst demands for EVs are surging. There are significant opportunities awaiting the EV battery industry, though it is crucial that companies are aware of the threats facing them. To address the gap, this research followed an exploratory qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with experienced interviewees in the industry. By applying the SWOT analysis framework and the theory lens of Resource Based View (RBV), we suggest that the UK EV battery industry should diversify its supply base into multiple regions such as India, Africa, and the US, which would reduce the reliance on sourcing from China whilst maintaining good supplier relationships and continuous innovation.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that the economic changes associated with China’s solid waste import ban increase primary refining within China, offsetting the environmental benefits of decreased copper scrap refining and generating a cumulative increase in CO2e emissions of up to 35 Mt by 2040. Increasing China’s refined copper imports reverses this trend, decreasing CO2e emissions both in China (up to 300 Mt by 2040) and globally (up to 63 Mt). We test model outcome sensitivity to supply chain disruptions and economic crises using GDP, mining, and refining shocks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, showing the results maintain impact magnitude alongside disruption effects.</jats:p>"

One of the most important hydraulic parameters of the soil is sorptivity (S), yet there is insufficient research on how it affects the mechanism of infiltration. The main scope of this study is to investigate the effect(/significance) of sorptivity on the mechanism of infiltration of water, through various types of soil medium, from both mathematical and experimental perspectives. For this scope, the absolute sensitivity analysis factor of sorptivity was obtained, while two experimental procedures were carried out in the laboratory. Each soil sample was packed into a vertical column, while a constant head of 2 mm was applied at the surface of the soil. The incoming water was measured volumetrically and at the same time, soil moisture, at certain locations, was measured using the TDR method. Sorptivity of each soil was calculated using Parlange's equation. Absolute sensitivity analysis factor of sorptivity showed that for a longer duration/period of cumulative infiltration, sorptivity strongly affects the phenomenon the more synectic the soil type. Thus, estimating sorptivity of the soil could lead to better solutions for irrigation planning, flood prediction and water saving.</jats:p>",

Mathematical optimization was used to obtain the optimum canal dimensions. The results were represented in chart form to facilitate easy design of the optimal channel dimensions with minimum cost. To demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method, a design example has been included. A comparison between the parameters and the cost of the proposed section with the conventional trapezoidal section revealed that the proposed section is more economic, and more suitable from a maintenance point of view.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 crisis has created a new set of challenges to which supply chain managers must respond. As demand for home delivery services surge, supply chains have to adapt their supply replenishment processes, their order fulfilment processes and hire new employees to be trained in the specifics of order picking and home delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a significant health risk, and countries around the world have responded with partial shutdowns of their economies to slow the pace of infections. These measures have reportedly led to massive disruptions in the global and domestic supply chains. The findings in extant literature show that supply chains during COVID-19 are more fragile for products that travel long distances before reaching their final point of sale. Our work highlights how online data can be used in conjunction with other data-sets for real-time policymaking. This paper conceptually examines the impact of COVID-19 on supply chain disruption and response strategies adopted.</jats:p>"

Although the overarching aim of supply chain 4.0 is the enhancement of production systems within supply chains, making use of global reach, increasing agility and emerging technology, with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency, timeliness and profitability, Supply chain 4.0 suffers from unique and emerging operational and cyber risks. Supply chain 4.0 has a lack of semantic standards, poor interoperability, and a dearth of security in the operation of its manufacturing and Information Technology processes. The technologies that underpin supply chain 4.0 include blockchain, smart contracts, applications of Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Each of these technologies, individually and combined, create cyber security issues that should be addressed. This paper explains the nature of the military supply chains 4.0 and how it uniquely differs from the commercial supply chain, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, dependencies and the fundamental technologies upon which they are built. This encompasses an assessment of the cyber risks and opportunities for research in the field, including consideration of connectivity, sensing and convergence of systems. Current and emerging semantic models related to the standardization, development and safety assurance considerations for implementing new technologies into military supply chains 4.0 are also discussed. This is examined from a holistic standpoint and through technology-specific lenses to determine current states and implications for future research directions.</jats:p>"

Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) and Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs), born out of the perceived loss of trust in the globalized food system, are trying to shorten the gap between farmers and consumers. Nowadays, many scholars agree that local and global food systems coexist, and consumers usually buy both in local and in global food chains. Our study aims to understand the factors that affect the development of AFNs with a specific focus on the interactions with small- and large-scale food retailing in the Lombardy region in the north of Italy. We employ an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model, on a municipal scale, in which the dependent variable measures the number of participatory activities carried out by farmers and consumers in AFNs. The main results highlight that conventional large retailers and alternative food networks are linked, and that the coexistence of the two market channels may lead to the development for both of them. Contrarily, where small stores exist, they may compete with an alternative food channel, as they offer similar products and services.</jats:p>"

By regulating the amount, the timing and the location of meltwater supply to the glacier bed, supraglacial hydrology potentially exerts a major control on the evolution of the subglacial drainage system, which in turn modulates sliding. Yet the configuration of the supraglacial hydrological system has received only little attention in numerical models of subglacial hydrology so far. Here we apply the two dimensional subglacial hydrology model GlaDS to a Svalbard glacier basin with the aim of investigating how the spatial distribution of meltwater recharge affects the characteristics of the basal drainage system. We design four experiments with various degrees of complexity in the way that meltwater is delivered to the subglacial drainage model. Our results show significant differences between experiments in the early-summer transition from distributed to channelized drainage, with discrete recharge at moulins favouring channelization and driving earlier rise in basal water pressure. Otherwise, we find that water input configuration only poorly influences subglacial hydrology, which is controlled primarily by subglacial topography. All experiments fail to develop channels of sufficient efficiency to substantially reduce summertime water pressures, which we impute to small surface gradients and short melt seasons. The findings of our study may be extended to most Svalbard tidewater glaciers with similar topography and low meltwater recharge. The absence of efficient channelization implies that the dynamics of tidewater glaciers in the Svalbard archipelago may be sensitive to future long-term trends in meltwater supply.\n                        </jats:p>"

Drawing on long-term research engagement in Burkina Faso, I examine the health-seeking practices of rural citizens and look into diagnostic routines and reporting in two rural dispensaries. I show how the routinization of diagnostic procedures combined with a strong national and global political focus on the fight against malaria create what I term a ‘supply–demand nexus’ in which rural citizens selectively ask for the health services that they know the system can supply. I argue that the routinized diagnostic practices that mainly focus on malaria serve as a ‘technology of invisibility’ by not capturing other important diseases among the rural population. Finally, I ask whether the limited healthcare services in the current context of political insecurity, instability and a global pandemic spur a process of further fragilization of the social contract between rural citizens and the state.</jats:p>",

The use of methodology and software for calculating the reliability of systems with autonomous power sources in the stage of pre-project research can contribute to more informed decision-making. In this stage, there is no need and opportunity to consider all reliability issues in detail. Here, express methods are enough to take into account the main features of the systems functioning with autonomous or mixed power sources and to compare the proposed system options within a single methodological framework. Based on this, a methodology was developed to calculate the reliability of power supply systems with autonomous and mixed power sources. The proposed methodology employs semi-Markov random processes (Markov chains) and can be used in comparative reliability analysis of power supply options with autonomous and mixed power sources.

However, a difficulty associated with binary coding is the existence of redundant codes that do not correspond to any element in the finite discrete set that the encoded parameter belongs to. A common technique used to address redundant binary codes is to discard the chromosomes in which they occur. Effective alternatives to the outright removal of redundant codes are lacking in the literature. This article presents illustrative examples based on the problem of optimizing the design of water distribution networks. Two benchmark networks in the literature and two different multi-objective design optimization models were considered. Different fixed mapping schemes gave significantly different solutions in the search space. The main inference from the results is that mapping schemes that improved diversity in the population of solutions achieved better results, which may pave the way for the development of practical and effective mapping schemes.</jats:p>",

The delivery of each batch has a fixed cost D, whereas any order delivered after its release time yields an additional delay cost equal to the waiting time of that order in the system. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost of the batches plus the total delay cost of the orders. A new algorithmic framework is proposed based on which fast algorithms for the solution of this problem are built. The framework can be extended to more general supply chain scheduling models and is based on a theoretical study of some useful properties of the offline version of the problem. An online scenario is considered as well, when at each assignment (order release) time the information on the next order released within the following T time units is known but no information on the orders that might be released after that time is known. For the online setting, it is shown that there is no benefit in waiting for more than D time units for incoming orders, i.e., potentially beneficial values for T are 0&lt;T&lt;D, and three linear-time algorithms are proposed, which are optimal for both the offline and the online cases when T≥D. For the case 0&lt;T&lt;D an important real-life scenario is studied. It addresses a typical situation when the same number of orders are released at each order release time and these times are evenly distributed within the scheduling horizon. An optimal algorithm which runs much faster than earlier known algorithms is proposed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change has become the greatest threat to the survival of world and its ecosystem. With the irreversible impact on the ecosystem, problems like rise in sea level, food-insecurity, natural resources scarcity, seasonal disorders have increased over the past few years. Among these problems, the issue of water scarcity due to the lack of water resources and global warming has plagued several nations. Owing to the rising concerns over water scarcity United Nations (UN) has acknowledged water as a primary resource to the development of societies under the ‘Water Goal’ of the sustainable development goals. As the changing climate and intermittent availability of water resources pose major challenges to forecast demand, especially in countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which has one of the highest per capita residential water consumption rates in the world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an accurate water demand forecasting technique that incorporates all significant factors to predict the future water demands of the UAE. The forecasting model used is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the factors considered are mean temperature, mean rainfall, relative humidity, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) and population growth. The LSTM model predicts the water demand forecasting in the UAE showing that the future demand will decrease from 1821 million m3 in 2018 to 1809.9 million m3 in 2027.</jats:p>"

The extraction percentage of zinc increased with the increase in concentration of surfactant. The response surface methodology (RSM) analysis identified that the optimal variable values for the maximum extraction of zinc were: external pH – 3.8, surfactant concentration 4% (vol.), internal phase concentration – 1.61N, zinc concentration – 742 mg/L, external phase to emulsion volume ratio – 0.94 and carrier concentration – 8.9%. At the optimized conditions experiment was carried out and the maximum extraction was found to be 97.4%. The perturbation plot shows that the extraction of zinc was affected by variables in the following order of effect: zinc concentration &amp;gt; surfactant concentration &amp;gt; carrier concentration &amp;gt; external pH &amp;gt; external phase to emulsion volume ratio &amp;gt; internal phase concentration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are a number of theories illustrating the relationship between money supply and gross domestic product. Money supply can be defined as the total stock of money circulating in the economy. The circulating money involves the currency, printed notes, money in the deposit accounts, and in the form of other liquid assets. Valuation of money supply helps analysts and policy makers to frame the policy or to alter the existing policy of increasing or reducing the supply of money. The valuation is important as it ultimately affects the business cycle and thereby affecting the economy. This study sought to provide answers to the question, what are the effects of money supply on the gross domestic product in Nepal? The study undertook a causal research design using time series data from the period 1974/75 to 2017/18 to critically investigate the relationship between money supply and economic growth by establishing an empirical relationship that exists between them. The study employed the Augmented Diky fuller test and ARDL- VECM model. The results indicate the existence of a significant long-run relationship between money supply and economic growth as measured by GDP. LNBM is significant to LNGDP and LNGDP is also significant to LNBM so there is bi-directional causality. There is unidirectional relationship existing between LNINF to LNGDP and LNINF to LNBM. ECTcoefficient vale are negative and the p-value of above three approaches are also less than 5 percent which is desirable for the ARDL model.</jats:p>"

The samples were pre-concentrated using the Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) technique and analyzed by using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). Organic contaminants like Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), Dichlorophenol (DCP), Trichlorophenol (TCP), endrin, and dieldrin were found in certain samples above the permissible limits. Stable isotopes like 13C, 15N and 18O were analyzed to assess the source of shallow groundwater channel contamination. Chemical and isotopic data reveal that contamination of shallow groundwater channels in the area is mainly due to wastewater irrigation and, to some extent, by seepage through unlined wastewater drains in nearby areas. The wastewater containing organic pollutants, used for cultivation, filters through the soil to contaminate the shallow groundwater channels.</jats:p>",

This study aims to examine changes in the supply of consumer goods to Bali from outside Bali in the Indonesian territory and changes in the per capita consumption of the Balinese population, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Two events were observed, namely the first event was the announcement of the first positive case of Covid-19 in Indonesia, and the 2nd event was the determination of the status of a national disaster by the Indonesian government. Data analysis was performed using a different test with the SPSS v.23 program. The results of the analysis found that there was a difference in the supply of consumer goods to Bali from outside Bali and the per capita consumption of the Balinese population in the first and 2nd events. The supply of consumer goods and per capita consumption decreased significantly after the announcement of the first positive case of Covid-19 and then further decreased after the Indonesian government declared a national disaster status. The determination of the status of a national disaster has a greater impact on reducing the per capita consumption of the Balinese population than the announcement of the first Covid-19 patient. As a result of Covid-19, it is hoped that the Bali Provincial Government needs to make policy breakthroughs to encourage the fulfillment of consumer goods needs in Bali independently so that they do not always depend on supplies from outside Bali. The Covid-19 pandemic has reduced people's income and reduced buying power, thus demanding people to be smarter in managing finances, including adjusting consumption patterns according to the priority scale of needs.</jats:p>"

After the literature review and concept clarification, the article presents quantitative research involving an online questionnaire administered among a sample of transporters in Romania. Through analysis of the data collected from 405 respondents, it was found that the most important factors when selecting a digital freight forwarder are the existence of both sales and dispatch departments. Furthermore, apart from greening the industry, a digital freight forwarder has several other advantages for all stakeholders and society. The study concludes that the concept has the potential to disrupt the entire industry through a unique combination of efficiency, transparency, and sustainability.</jats:p>"

Drawing on hypotheses about SFSC sustainability elaborated in an expert network in France, this review summarises a wide range of papers from various disciplines in the SFSC literature, written in English or French, while specifically highlighting the empirical results derived from European projects. Though the literature tends to generally agree on the social benefits of SFSCs, their economic and environmental impacts typically elicit more heterogeneous outcomes, while their health/nutrition and governance dimensions remain under-explored.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The increase in pharmaceutical waste medicines is a global phenomenon and financial burden. The Circular Economy, as a philosophy within the pharmaceutical supply chain, aims to promote waste reduction, maximise medicines value, and enable sustainability within this supply chain (increasing circularity). Circularity strategies for pharmaceuticals are not currently implemented in many countries, due to quality and safety barriers. The aim of this study was to determine whether the application of circular economy principles can minimise pharmaceutical waste and support sustainability in the pharmaceutical supply chain; Methods: a detailed narrative literature review was conducted in order to examine pharmaceutical waste creation, management, disposal, and the application of circular economy principles; Results: the literature scrutinised revealed that pharmaceutical waste is created by multiple routes, each of which need to be addressed by pharmacists and healthcare bodies through the Circular Economy 9R principles. These principles act as a binding mechanism for disparate waste management initiatives. Medicines, or elements of a pharmaceutical product, can be better managed to reduce waste, cost, and reduce negative environmental impacts through unsafe disposal. Conclusions: the study findings outline a Circular Pharmaceutical Supply Chain and suggests that it should be considered and tested as a sustainable supply chain proposition.</jats:p>"

This two groups have very different monetary structures. Engaging the dynamic common correlated effects-mean group (DCCE-MG) and pooled mean group (PMG) techniques, findings validate the hypothesis as the real deposit rate exhibits a positive and long-run impact on credit supply. Monotonic impact is not sustained. These outcomes are corroborated with robustness checks from the respective sub-samples though country-level results are mixed. Similarly, causality test shows that the real deposit rate Granger-causes credit supply in the long-run. Overall, the findings support the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis that interest rate is an essential ingredient in the intermediation role of the financial system.</jats:p>"

Supply infrastructure, providing basic services such as water and electricity, has been subjected to damage, capacity deterioration, and the bankruptcy of public providers. Often, in conflict countries such as Yemen, the continuity of basic supply is only possible thanks to adaptation efforts on the community and household levels. This paper examines the conflict resilience of water and energy supply infrastructure in Yemen during the armed conflict 2015–today. It contributes to resilience studies by linking knowledge on state fragility and conflicts, humanitarian aid, and infrastructure resilience. The paper presents adaptation responses of communities and public entities in the water and energy sectors in Yemen and critically evaluates these responses from the perspective of conflict resilience of infrastructure. The gained insights reaffirm the notion about the remarkable adaptive capacities of communities during conflicts and the importance of incorporating community-level adaptation responses into larger efforts to enhance the conflict resilience of infrastructure systems.</jats:p>"

The operation of the city MFM clusters depends on the efficiency of production and transport management considering technical, economic, environmental, and other factors. The primary goal of this paper was to identify and analyze the drivers of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) that influence or encourage the design of sustainable processes in city MFM clusters under uncertainty in supply chains. This paper presents an SSC performance model for city MFM clusters under uncertainty. The proposed model is universal and is based on material flow analysis (MFA) methodology. The presented analysis helps to determine the conditions for rhythmic deliveries with the use of the multi-IRTs. The coefficients of rhythmic deliveries for multiple intelligent reconfigurable trolleys (IRTs) and the capacity loss of freight elevators allow us to periodically assess the sustainability processes in city MFM clusters related to the flow materials. These assessments are the basis for the decision-making and planning of SSCs.</jats:p>"

The decision-making variables are provided for the water supply of the reservoir in this paper, so that water demand of the water-receiving area can be better met to alleviate the water shortage at various stages and realize the effective use of water resources. Moreover, through the constraints of reservoir operation rules and other constraints, a mathematical model is established for optimal operation of water resources in the reservoir system. Meanwhile, optimized genetic algorithms are applied to solve the model according to the characteristics of the model. After simulation tests, compared with the traditional linear binary algorithm used in the reservoir, the improved genetic algorithm studied in the paper improves the accuracy of data calculation and data convergence, which proves that the research results of the paper provide theoretical and practical significance for improving the level of reservoir water resources management and solving the problem of optimal water resources scheduling.</jats:p>",

The global regulatory efforts on climate change are centred on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fuel consumption, almost ignoring the supply side. In the absence of universal and strict emission-reduction targets, petroleum exports and carbon leakage jeopardize the effectiveness of the climate change regime.

We analyze prerequisites and practices of supply chain (SC) sustainability in a multiple case study of the German and Ethiopian T&amp;A industry. Our analysis is based on ten semi-structured interviews conducted with the managers of seven companies in the Ethiopian T&amp;A production and the German fair fashion retail industries. The contribution of expert knowledge helps in identifying SC sustainability prerequisites and practices. The chosen cases of production in Ethiopia and retail in Germany highlight the complexity of T&amp;A SCs while representing both the suppliers’ and retailers’ perspectives, which is rare in the related literature. As a major research contribution, the study adapts a framework for SC sustainability in the chemical industry and transfers it to T&amp;A SCs. Moreover, practitioners from the T&amp;A industry find useful insights into relevant practices and their prerequisites, which helps in improving SC sustainability in this sector. The study reveals that management orientation and interest groups such as customers represent the most important prerequisites for sustainability. Manufacturers rely more on internal practices such as monitoring, while retailers focus on external sustainability practices, such as supplier development. In a comparative approach, similarities and differences between T&amp;A SCs and the chemical industry are identified.</jats:p>"

We found that uranium concentrations in 21 out of 68 (30.9%) samples exceeded the WHO provisional guideline value of 30 μg L−1. The annual effective doses were estimated for different life stage groups. The highest dose was calculated for infants. From a radiological perspective, the mean cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk were found to be 4.7 × 10−5 and 7.3 × 10−5, respectively, which are lower than the permissible limit of 1.67 × 10−4 as prescribed by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, India. The lifetime average daily dose (LADD) of uranium ranged from 0.03 to 7.83 μg kg−1 day−1. Approximately 23.5% of the samples showed significant chemical toxicity risk. A positive correlation between uranium and total dissolved solids (TDS) was observed.</jats:p>",

The restriction to flow caused by the construction of a spur dike promotes local scour around the structure. In the case of a dike placed in a channel bend, the scour becomes more aggressive. The literature review found that the research work related to local scour around a spur dike located in a meandering channel is very limited or minimal. Therefore, an experimental investigation was conducted to study the local scour process around a T-shaped spur dike placed at different locations along the outer bank (or concave) of a reverse-meandering channel. Non-dimensionalized empirical equations for temporal and maximum local scour depth were developed as the function of the Froude number of approach flow and spur dike location. It is observed that local scour around the dike increases with the increase in Froude number and location in the meander (measured from the entry to meander). The formulation for the maximum scour depth was further evaluated with the experimental data related to the 180° bend, from literature, and it was found that the proposed equation's application is very much limited.</jats:p>",

This article investigates conditions for success of anti–fossil-fuel activism by comparing the fate of two proposed coal terminals on either side of the Canada–United States border. Both cases highlight that fossil fuel transport infrastructure is especially vulnerable to opposition as a result of concentrated costs and limited economic benefits in transit jurisdictions that did not produce the fossil fuels in question. Still, not all contexts are equally amenable to supply-side contestation. Institutional differences explain approval of a new coal port in Canada, while a similar US facility was rejected: a weaker environmental assessment regime and more limited opportunities for local government and Indigenous vetoes. However, the regulator’s subsequent withdrawal of the still-pending Canadian terminal’s permit five years later reveals that delay can be as good as victory for opponents when markets for fossil fuels decline.</jats:p>",

Therefore, companies should pay more attention to carbon management strategies in their supply chains. It also requires major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate change strategies through CDP. These suppliers include some large electronics manufacturers in Taiwan. The focus of this research is to understand the carbon management strategy in the green supply chain of Taiwan's electronics industry. Based on the collected strategies, a questionnaire was compiled and mailed to listed electronics companies in Taiwan to understand how Taiwanese electronics companies deal with carbon management in their supply chains. In this study, the collected data were analyzed and processed through descriptive statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson product difference correlation, and multiple stepwise regression analysis. And draw the following conclusion: Director of Electronics Industry- The views on overall green supply chain management and overall company performance are in the middle and high levels, there are significant differences in \"marriage\", \"gender\", \"age\", \"education\" and \"work experience\", there is a positive correlation between all aspects, and there are significant differences, there is a significant correlation between the two. And has the predictive ability. The results of this study also indicate that the most important strategies for large electronics companies to manage their supply chain carbon risks are \"green product design,\" \"material replacement,\" \"energy efficiency,\" and \"reducing packaging and reusability.\" And these companies have already begun to implement these carbon management strategies. Finally, based on the research process and conclusions, specific suggestions are made to provide references for Taiwan’s electronics-related industries and future researchers.</jats:p>",

Sustainability audits encompass entire supply chains and are very complex due to, firstly, the global nature of supply chains and, secondly, the expansive scope of sustainability, which may include financial, manufacturing, social, and environmental audits. Adding to this dilemma is the absence of a consensus on standards related to sustainability, resulting in differences, variations, and multiple interpretations. While the frequency, complexity, and scope of audits has increased, unfortunately so has the incident of audit fraud, which has seen increasing media coverage in recent times, often implicating major multinationals and their supply chains. We posit that this trend of increasing audit activity is causing “audit fatigue”, which, in turn, may influence the audit outcome, i.e., either audit fraud or a clean audit. This study proposes that audit fatigue is a genuine issue faced by organizations and needs to be conceptualized.</jats:p>"

The main goal of this work was to study the effectiveness of ozone (O3) for knocking down high levels of fecal pollution and to construct a prototype for low cost sanitization (O3SU Ozone gas Sanitization Unit), able to supply limited quantities of safe water to small rural communities. Ozone gas generators were tested at 7, 14 and 21 g/h and gas flow times were determined. The ozone sanitization of waters characterized by mainly fecal contamination seems to be very effective; surely the O3SU can and must be improved through, for example, the use of more powerful ozone generators, in order to reduce the duration of the treatment and through the decreasing of the electric consumptions, that would make possible to increase the daily treatment cycles. Thus, we would be able to increase the amount of clean water available to populations living in areas where the water crisis is an unlucky and grim reality.</jats:p>"

Our proposal goes far beyond simply using blockchains as decentralized systems to track the origin and delivery of goods, which is what most of the current blockchain projects on supply chains are focused on. In fact, we introduce a type of smart contract aimed to solve two of the main problems that hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chains, namely<jats:italic>trust</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>coordination</jats:italic>. Solving the problem of<jats:italic>trust</jats:italic>amounts to the capability of establishing quickly and cheaply contractual relationships based on convergent business needs among parties that may not know each other, and therefore need to protect themselves from opportunistic or incorrect behavior. Solving the problem of<jats:italic>coordination</jats:italic>consists in creating, at convenient management costs, a control system capable of directing the objectives of the supply chain as a whole, so as to achieve a greater common good in the medium term, as an alternative to the state of affairs in which each participant pursues, on its own behalf, lower but immediate returns. Our smart contracts for innovative supply chain management replace human coordinators in tackling the problems above, thus eliminating one major obstacle to their effective solution, namely the need to trust the coordinator itself. Furthermore, in this way, by automating the process of coordination, they unburden the supply chain of a considerable management cost. Contracts of this kind not only automate contract execution as in standard smart contracts, but also adjust costs and compensations of the members of a supply chain, effectively taking up the role that was of human coordinators. Thus, we refer to them as “intelligent smart contracts.” In the course of the paper, we will illustrate an innovative supply chain architecture based on intelligent smart contracts running on blockchain, we will detail the algorithmic methodologies underlying the decision-making process of these contracts and we will outline the wider socio-economic perspectives opened by our approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has received much of the attention in supply chain management, in particular the pricing decisions. Most existing models that enable CSR integration into pricing decisions in a supply chain context assume deterministic demand and focus on a single distribution channel. Despite the fact that dual-channel supply chain (DCSC) has received popularity, most pricing decisions models in DCSC assume fixed and deterministic market share distribution between channels, and no demand leakages (cannibalization). This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a CSR enabled DCSC model pricing in which the demand is considered to be stochastic and market share distribution between channels in DCSC is optimally determined using a differentiation price, and the impact of demand leakages is also taken into consideration. Unlike existing studies, which only enable pricing decisions due to deterministic demand consideration, comprehensive DCSC models are proposed that provide joint decisions framework on CSR investment, pricing, and inventories. We have also considered the extension of the demand scenario when the distribution of demand is unknown. The two most common coordination schemes, the centralized (integrated) and the decentralized coordination is explored for the three demand situations: (i) deterministic demand; (ii) stochastic with full information; and (iii) stochastic with partial information. We are able to find analytical (closed-form) solutions for most demand situations. The centralized coordination performed better compared to the decentralized for all demand scenarios. The models are benchmarked when the demand is stochastic with known and unknown distributions, as well as, the case of the deterministic demand. A detailed numerical analysis is also presented in order to study the impact of using the price differentiation for market segmentation, the demand leakage, and partial knowledge on the stochastic demand on the players’ decisions and revenues in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the channel strategy and pricing decision in a dual-channel supply chain, which consists of one supplier and one retailer. Adequate and inadequate capital constraints for the supplier are distinguished by determining whether open the retail channel to sell. The observations offer managerial insights into supply chain member. First, the results indicate that the capital constraint is a key factor affecting channel strategies and pricing decisions. With the increased value of capital constraint, the wholesale price of offline channel and the selling price of online channel firstly decrease and then remain constant. Second, the results demonstrate that, with capital constraint, the supplier pays more attention to consumers’ brand loyalty if it chooses to open the online channel only. Additionally, the price-sensitivity parameter has no effect on the strategy of opening only the offline channel. Moreover, when the channel competition is too intense, the supplier will choose to only open the online channel strategy and increase the online selling price if the capital is insufficient.</jats:p>",

The duration and timing of environmental insults or stimuli in relation to the stage of gestation influences the phenotypic outcomes of offspring. Nutrient restriction during early gestation, such as developing heifers on low-input forage-based management schemes followed by nutrient re-alimentation at pregnancy confirmation, increased late-term uterine artery blood flow relative to maternal body weight compared with conventionally developed heifers. In this study, calf birth weights were not different between low-input vs conventionally developed heifers, which may indicate a compensatory mechanism to safeguard late-term fetal growth. In comparison, nutrient restriction during early to mid-gestation (from day 50 to 180 of pregnancy) decreased uterine artery blood flow, decreased fetal weight, and increased placental blood vessel density in both Brahman and Angus heifers. Moreover, the efficiency of uterine artery blood flow relative to fetal weight was improved in nutrient restricted dams versus adequate fed as well as Brahman vs Angus. These responses indicate improved placental nutrient supply following early to mid-gestation nutrient restriction. Apart from nutritional management, season and melatonin supplementation impacts placental nutrient supply in cattle. Specifically, spring calving heifers with increased uterine artery blood flow had heavier calves at birth compared with their fall calving counterparts. Although several seasonal environmental changes can influence performance and reproductive traits, specific changes in hormone concentrations as a result of photoperiod may alter blood distribution to the reproductive tract. This is apparent when supplementing dairy heifers and beef cows with melatonin during the last third of pregnancy, which increased uterine artery blood flow and calf weaning weights compared with non-supplemented controls. Elucidating the consequences of specific supplements on the continual plasticity of placental nutrient supply will allow us to determine important mediators of fetal growth and development.</jats:p>",

Vegetables benefit farmers even more than other crops. It can play a vital role in improving the nutritional status of the chronically malnourished population of Bangladesh. There are various types of agricultural markets in Bangladesh through which agricultural products are traded. These are rural primary markets, rural assembly markets, rural secondary markets, and urban retail market. Before reaching the customers, vegetables are sold to wholesalers and retailers in Bangladesh. There is effectively a complete shortage of sophisticated vegetable handling equipment and facilities on the markets. Sorting, displaying, and selling are often performed from and into baskets at the ground level. Though Bangladeshi fruits and vegetables are exported to about 38 market destinations, the key buyers are primarily located in two regions: the United Kingdom and the Middle East. Bangladesh mostly exports fresh fruits and vegetables. However, during recent years export of processed as well as frozen vegetables had underway on a limited scale. The regular supply chain is for intermediaries to collect orders from exporters, go to production areas, collect crops from farmers/local markets, and arrange to deliver the same to exporters on the day of shipment. Owing to the opportunistic actions of sellers and consumers, the marketing cost rises, each seeking to take advantage of the other by means such as adulteration of the goods, cheating on weights and measures, and violating distribution contracts. In Bangladesh, the vegetable marketing system is challenging, awkward, and unorganized and needs to be established for the well-being of common citizens.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a methodology to calculate the supply and demand balance for Vietnam's energy systems by region, with the practical application of Corrective Module1, a piece of software which is a result of the joint research and development effort by the Institute of Energy Science, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) and the Melentiev Energy Systems Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). The findings of this study demonstrate that the energy system supply and demand balance calculated by region is the scientific basis for researchers, managers, and policymakers to get a clear vision of possible energy system development at the national and regional scale and to provide directions and policies that are consistent with the conditions of each region and the country. This approach is appropriate for Vietnam's geographical conditions, infrastructure, energy resources, load distribution, and policy framework.</jats:p>"

The aim of the survey is to investigate the companies’ perception about wine tourists’ characteristics and wine route management. Through a multivariate analysis, the reasons behind wineries’ satisfaction/discontent have been analyzed. The findings identify a close relation between the complexity of the services offered, the companies’ involvement in the wine routes management and their satisfaction about the results obtained. The more complex the services are, the more satisfied the companies. The comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses pointed out by the wineries’ keepers has allowed some general considerations about the tools to use for the improvement of wine routes management.

An effective method consists of adding properly formed booster voltages to the fundamental supply voltages using a series active filter. In the proposed solution, the booster voltages are generated by three single-phase systems consisting of inverters, LC filters, and single-phase transformers. The application of LC couplings ensures low emission of disturbances, but may provoke compensator stability problems. The article presents the current control system for a series active filter designed to suppress the dominant harmonics in the supply currents of an 18-pulse rectifier, without interference into fundamental current components. A proportional control is proposed in combination with integral terms implemented in the orthogonal coordinate systems, which synchronically rotate with frequencies equal to those of the harmonic components to be eliminated. The use of complex gains in integral terms allows a simple phase correction of the output signals. A description is given of the method to determine controller parameters based on the mathematical model of the control object. Sample results of experimental tests performed in steady-state and transient conditions are included to illustrate the quality of performance of the series active filter as compared to the results recorded for the rectifier alone, and for the rectifier with additional line reactor. The applied control method of active filter significantly reduces harmonic distortion of the grid current, which is particularly advantageous at nonideal supply voltage and low loads.</jats:p>"

The model utilizes a realistic transportation cost which is dependent on the sizes (small- or medium-sized) of trucks. It can determine suitable sizes and numbers of trucks that minimize the transportation cost. A genetic algorithm (GA) technique, implemented in MATLAB software, is used to determine the best solution to the problem. A case study in the instant noodle industry is conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model. Based on the experimental results, the VMI model has reasonable behaviors using sensitivity analysis. To reduce the inventory level of raw materials, the penalty cost may be set at a relatively high level or the upper inventory limits may be set at relatively low levels, without significantly affecting the average total cost per period of the entire supply chain. When the vendors are allowed to make decision independently, the solution is still the same as the solution from the proposed VMI model, which means that the manufacture does not take advantage of the vendors.</jats:p>",

The objective of this paper is to search the possibility of supplying the load demand with the optimum system that has the lowest net present cost (NPC) and greenhouse emission CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The simulation results show that NPC of a proposed grid/PV system, at the current grid’s tariff, is more sufficient than other configurations with a result in a renewable fraction of more than 50%, a payback time of 17 years, and 54.3% reduction in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The results also show that the integration of 62 kW PV array with the main grid is the best configuration that leads to the minimum cost of energy (COE) of 0.0688 $/kWh and the sell back energy of 9.16% of total energy consumption at Al Baha University. Besides, optimization modeling addresses that HRES-only system can supply the full load demand without power shortage (&lt;0.1%) with a major contribution from solar PV by 78.5%, wind energy shares 11.3% of load demand, and 10.2% from battery banks. The developed analysis concludes that the objective function is feasible for the selected locations. The study has three novelties. Firstly, the required load at different locations of the university’s buildings at KSA is supplied by minimizing COE. The objective function is achieved by considering a combination of HRES. Then, it applies the sensitivity analysis for several cases such as payback time, gird’s tariff variation, and load demand change. Finally, the current analyses are applicable to any university at KSA and around the world.</jats:p>",

Consequently, steviol glycosides (SVglys) concentration and profile, total phenols and flavonoids as well as antioxidant assays, have been assessed in inoculated and no-inoculated plants, grown with or without P supply and collected at different growth stages(69, 89 and 123 days after transplanting).The obtained results suggest that the synthesis of stevia secondary metabolites is induced and/or modulated by all the investigated variability factors. In particular, AMF symbiosis promoted total SVglys content and positively influenced the concentration of some minor compounds (steviolbioside, dulcoside A and rebaudioside B), indicating a clear effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on SVglys biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, only the mycorrhizal plants were able to synthesize rebaudioside B. In addition, P supply provided the highest levels of total phenols and flavonoids at leaf level, together with the maximum in vitro antioxidant activities (FRAP and ORAC). Finally, the harvest time carried out during the full vegetative phase enhanced the entire composition of the phytocomplex (steviolbioside, dulcoside A, stevioside, rebaudioside A, B, C. total phenols and flavonoids). Moreover, polyphenols and SVglys appeared to be the main contributors to the in vitro antioxidant capacity, while only total phenols mostly contributed to the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA). These findings provide original information about the role played by AMF in association with P supply, in modulating the accumulation of bioactive compounds during stevia growth. At the cultivation level, the control of these preharvest factors, together with the most appropriate harvest time, can be used as tools for improving the nutraceutical value of raw material, with particular attention to its exploitation as functional ingredient for food and dietary supplements and cosmetics.</jats:p>"

Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’ boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals.</jats:p>"

In this way, there is great necessity to have an improved and controlled smart energy distribution network (SEDN) in industries. In SEDNs, sensor information related to flow control and optimization serves as a basis for modelling of energy management systems. Therefore, it is important to ensure that sensor data are accurate and precise. However, they are affected by random noise and measurement biases, which compromise the quality of measurements. Data Reconciliation (DR) is one such approach popularly used in industries to reduce the adverse impact of random errors present in pipe flow measurements. In this study, Python-based simulations of weighted least squares (WLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) based DR techniques are implemented on the selected flow streams of SEDN, and reconciled estimates are obtained. The results show that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the best performance metric since it is more sensitive to small changes in the measurement values and the reconciled estimates. Further, it is observed that PCA-DR performs better than WLS-DR in reducing the random error (and thereby achieving greater precision of measured values).</jats:p>",

This coupled with the involvement of multitude of  wholesalers and retailers in the supply chain makes the sector attractive for forgers to produce and distribute counterfeited drugs. In order to improve patient safety and supply chain efficiency, Ethiopia has prepared a strategic plan for the implementation of pharmaceutical traceability. However, little is known how different stakeholders perceive and could react to this initiative. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess stakeholders’ perceptions on the needs, challenges and concerns of implementing a traceable pharmaceutical supply chain system. Managers (n = 137), who are presumed to play critical roles in decision making in the pharmaceutical sector were surveyed by administering questionnaires. Data were collected from August to September, 2017 and analysed using descriptive statistics. Almost all stakeholders (96.4%) agreed on the importance of having a national level tracking and tracing system for pharmaceuticals. Their reasons were: to combat counterfeiting, theft and diversion of products (92.4%); to gain supply chain efficiencies (88.5%); to improve inventory management (86.9%) and patient care (74.4%). However, they were concerned about the high start-up and operational cost (61.1%), integration and interoperability (61.3) of the existing supply chain with a traceable system, data security, getting qualified contractors or service providers (66.5%). Overall, there is a positive perception and support for the implementation of pharmaceutical traceability system in the supply chain. However, concerns such as integrating traceability with the existing supply chain system, cost, and data security, need to be resolved through continued discussions, adequate preparation and phase-based  implementation.&#x0D;\nKeywords: traceability, stakeholders, survey, pharmaceuticals, Ethiopia </jats:p>"

In addition, the availability of fish is not necessarily sufficient. This of course will require a lot of time in the process of ordering or requests made by culinary business people with suppliers. Another problem occurs with suppliers, namely when the harvest from fish farming is ready for harvest, the supplier must also be able to offer it to parties who need fish supplies.

Using the data processed from accident and failure reports in addition to water main documentation, the water supply network in Zaben was evaluated according to the failure modes and effects analysis methods. Subsequently, individual water supply lines were classified based on their structural condition. In addition, a proposed plan for financing the reconstruction of the water supply mains in Zaben was created. As such, this study provides an overall assessment of the water supply network in Zaben alongside a proposed plan for the structural restoration of the water supply system, which accounts for the theoretical service life of the system and the financial resources of the owner.</jats:p>"

The main objective is to help WSS managers to identify key issues to be treated as nonconformity and develop a program for continual improvement of energy efficiency. The procedure was built in collaboration with practitioners and implemented in a company. One of the concerns during the development of the procedure was to provide companies with a fast and user-friendly tool. Complementarily, it also complies with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standards, and is of great relevance for any company of the sector of water utility. Recommendations for enhancing the energy management in WSS are also addressed in the audit procedure. The findings derived from the evaluation of the state-of-the-art and applications have led to the identification of key issues for energy saving. The success of energy management programs will be based on energy audit and on the top managements' engagement, workers' attitude and qualification, and the financial resources available.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses the security of the supply chain management data and the overall automation of procurement value chain, providing transparency to the stakeholders involved in the entire supply chain management process. It also provides a system that is not prone to malware or data alteration. The existing system lacks trust and greater transparency. A new technology will be developed using Blockchain Hyperledger which is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). The SCM application/portal serving the request and procurement process will utilize the Hyperledger Fabric SDK or REST web service to interface with the Hyperledger Fabric network. The organizations that participate in developing the Hyperledger Fabric network are known as the \"members\". Every member organization in the blockchain network is capable to set up their peers for taking part in the network. All these peers’ needs are configured with suitable cryptographic materials like Certificate Authority and other data. Chaincode will be actualized in peers to initiate transaction invocation request. This process will result in the chaincode providing an executable smart contract. The system executes the terms of the contract (agreement) by all necessary stakeholder's peer; for example: when goods or services are completely delivered, work Completion Certificate will be issued. This will be on the blockchain network and will be transparent to all stakeholders so once invoice is presented, the verification will be automatically ascertained and payment will be made. Procurement data like invitation to tender (ITT), request for proposal (RFP), request for quote (RFQ), contract award, work completion certificate (WCC), and invoice will be distributed among the nodes uniformly at the same time, making it impossible for cyber-invasion on all the nodes at the same time. Blockchain has been identified industry-wide as the next level in SCM operations because of its greater transparency, increased efficiency, enhanced data security, reduced costs, improved traceability, smart contract and unbroken chain of transaction history. It was observed that the blockchain implementation will further enable easy audit trail, automated and transparent Issuance of ITT/RFP/RFQ to Vendors, end-to-end SCM automation with secured data, and quality reporting system. In conclusion Blockchain Technology will enhance Supply chain manpower efficiency and hydrocarbon production. Blockchain Technology in Supply chain management will present a new knowledge in the area of integrated supply chain management for procurement process transparency and end- to-end data security</jats:p>",

Epidemic outbreaks are a unique case of supply chain (SC) risks which is particularly characterized by using a long-time period interruption lifestyle, and extreme uncertainty. As international transport stands at the front of trade and is mainly dependent on travel and human interaction, the shipping industry has been affected substantially from the epidemic of COVID-19 directly and indirectly. This paper represents a review that aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the sustainability of maritime supply chains in general and also in selected geographical areas in terms of the regulations and restrictions imposed by specific organizations in some countries as well as the effect on the supply chain sustainability. In addition, the paper highlights the recent technologies that are currently applied in maritime supply chains and how they can be employed as proposed solutions to facilitate the supply chain flow, overcome the negative effect caused by the COVID-19, and provide further managerial insights to cope with this situation in the most efficient and effective way.</jats:p>",

However, as single-core SC models are not suitable for complex coal industry systems, a multicore, correlated, conditional SC model, called a supply chain network (SCN), is proposed. SCN collaborative evaluation models are discussed including industrial metabolic balance (IMB), enterprise profitability, contract execution ability and information interaction ability, for which IMB is used as the efficiency index of resource coordination of SCN, also as the constraints of the models on system levels. Further, data modeling by using BP-ANN algorithm is used to predict the profitability of supply chain network. Finally, the feasibility of the above models is illustrated by cases. The proposed evaluation models in this paper form the scientific and quantitative evaluation method of SC, which could be used for both SC planning and operations management helping detect and eliminate risks.</jats:p>"

Limited knowledge on the development of informal settlements compromises the efficacy of urban planning and policies targeting such areas. This study presents an analysis of informal urban land use in four major cities in East Africa, as well as an analysis of urban form and household conditions in a case study area in each city. The study found more compact urban form, higher levels of tenants and overcrowding, and lower levels of access to water and sanitation in the examined cities with limited informal urban land use. The study argues that government repression of informal urban development decreases informal land supply and leads to increased competition in the informal land market, causing higher costs of accommodation and consequent fewer household resources for investments in infrastructure and thereby more compromised livelihood. The study argues that governments should accept some modes of informal development, simplify the urban development administration processes, and use technological innovation in land surveys and management, in order to lower costs of accommodation and improve livelihoods for the urban majority financially excluded from the formal housing market in East Africa.</jats:p>"

This article describes the practice of supply chain mapping, an activity used to better understand the upstream and downstream components of a company's supply chain. In addition to describing how mapping works, this paper illustrates how mapping can help identify supply chain vulnerabilities and reduce risk. Moreover, it discusses a number of other mapping benefits, including transparency in sustainability commitments and idea generation</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Future annual ash EAB-induced mortalities were simulated to follow either a normal or beta distribution over 25, 50, or 75 years, with five percent of the original inventory remaining at the conclusion of each projection. Discounted present values of future ash growth, harvests, mortalities, salvage, and beginning and ending annual inventories were calculated, and economic impacts to timber receipts were determined from average real prices. The present net effects of timber product output, mortalities, and salvage resulted in benefits ranging from lows of (delivered/stumpage) $37.6/$12.8 million over 25 years when assuming a normal distribution to highs of $247.8/$97.2 million over 75 years under a beta distribution. Salvage intensity exceeded mortality accumulation by a factor of at least 2.00. Regardless of length chosen, mortality that skewed toward later years led to lower discounted volumes and less value lost to EAB. Results were sensitive to discount rate selection (constant, increasing, distributional) with the constant and increasing rates having the most similar results. Longer time horizons led to far smaller losses of overall economic returns allowing more typical harvest management despite EAB.</jats:p>",

Thus, to make organizations robust is a frequent goal of system dynamics projects. However, in recent years, the adequacy of robustness as a design criterion for systems (and, thus, of the models that represent them) has been challenged based on the ideas of antifragility, that is, the ability of a system to recover after a shock and to achieve a higher performance level than before the shock. The purpose of this article is to propose how antifragility can be interpreted and operationalized in managerial settings and to explore what consequences result from its existence for supply chain behaviour and performance. System dynamics modelling and simulation are employed, and the insights of the analyses are used for a critique of the antifragility concept. It is demonstrated that the antifragility concept can lose its unambiguous advantage in highly dynamic situations.</jats:p>",

The use of utility functions is key in our framework because it allows the decision‐maker to establish priorities by representing the heterogeneous effects of distributing supply to different demand locations (location effect) and to different individuals in the same demand location (diminishing returns effect). We propose the use of two fractional objectives with the utility functions embedded into them: an efficiency measure and a new inequity measure related to the Gini coefficient. The suggested problem has the form of a bi‐objective integer linear fractional program and our resolution optimization technique is designed to solve for multiple fractional objective measures. Novel analytical results for the worst‐case performance of the proposed resolution technique are provided. Our numerical experiments assess computational efficiency and provide concrete managerial prescriptions. Finally, an illustrative application of our approach in the context of the food crisis in Angola is presented based on an efficiency‐inequity trade‐off analysis. </jats:p>",

At each stage of the electrical complex development of the oil production enterprise, the purpose is to increase energy efficiency in order to reduce the unit cost of electricity per unit of produced well fluid volume. The electrical complex energy efficiency assessment of the oil production enterprise can be determined by the classical methodology of the energy balance. The task of increasing the energy efficiency of the electrical complex with an autonomous power supply system is to ensure a minimum of fuel costs while maintaining current oil production. Two types of the electrical complex models are proposed: with an individual electricity source and a generation center based on individual diesel generators. A method for calculating the energy parameters of the electrical complex components with installations of different types of pumps is presented. In this case, the energy efficiency is improved due to joint deep and group reactive power compensation and power factor correction by reducing the harmonic components of the current. The electrical complex simulation of a submersible electric motor has been carried out in order to determine the values of voltage and current during switching processes. The autonomous power supply system modeling of an oil production enterprise in case of voltage losses and the simulation of diesel generators with a frequency deviation of the generated voltage during load surges was carried out.</jats:p>"

Within the theoretical part we proposed to estimate the necessary number of local depots within the supply chain taking into account the direct and indirect impacts from a delivery system functioning. The indirect effect is presented with CO2 emissions. The conducted experiment has covered the pes-simistic and optimistic scenarios for delivery system states. Within the experiment along with demand attributes we assessed the range of vehicle carrying capacity from 0.5 to 2 tons. The obtained experimental results revealed the shift in necessary local depots number to guarantee the sustainable effect for delivery system and promote liveable state for the urban area.</jats:p>",

The principle of the process was based on the microorganisms activated by the bulking agent as a bio-carrier to decompose organics composition and increase the evaporation by heating. An average sludge amount of 30 kg/day was added into MK-50, with the moisture of 80.2 – 83.6 %, with the C/N ratio of around 22 - 35. The heated air with 50 oC in temperature was supplied into a rotary bioreactor during the experiment period. After every 30 days of fermentation, the results from three experiments showed that the sludge volume decreased from 83 - 85 %, the stabilization efficiency by dry weight of sludge reached at 32 - 39 %, corresponding to the average decomposition rate is 12 g/kg.day, the evaporation efficiency was more than 95 %. Sludge after stabilization process had the colour of brown-grey, pH of about 6.5 - 7.2, the humus particles with the size of less than 1 mm accounted for over 60 %, the evaluation of product indexes according to nutrients like TOC, T-N meet the standard of 10TCN 526:2002/BNN&amp;PTNT. The stabilized sludge was used for growth plant test and compared to a market organic fertilizer under the same conditions of cultivation and monitoring. The initial results of this study were a basis for research of sludge treatment technology approaches to waste recycling orientation in urban areas in Vietnam.</jats:p>"

The results show that health affects both the margins of labour supply for both males and females. From the preferred model, the results indicate that the effects of health on both the margins of labour supply are larger for females than for males. Furthermore, the results show that while at the extensive margin there does not appear to be a difference in the effect of health between the old and the young for both genders, for males the effect of health on hours worked, conditional on being employed, is larger for the old than for the young, but for females the effect on hours worked is larger for the young than for the old. The results also show that inadequately exploiting the longitudinal features of panel data might have led to bias estimates.</jats:p>",

Secondary information was also collected from published documents and reports of different agricultural organizations. Descriptive statistics were used to analyses the information. Result: The study reveals that the Gondar research center and organizations like International Seed Sector Development, Seed Business Network, Agricultural Transformation Agency and Agricultural Growth Program was the strong actors of Sesame seed supply in the study area. The supply of improved Sesame seed through formal sources is constrained with various factors like shortage of improved seeds supply, cost of improved seeds, lack of awareness and delay in seed supply. It is important to strengthen community-based improved seed multiplication centers to produce an adequate amount of Sesame seed and supply the same time to smallholder farmers at a fair price.</jats:p>"

That such supply chains often implicate China, the origin of the pandemic, has also led to claims that trading partners have become too dependent on Chinese supplies. This in turn has led to policy interventions designed to reconfigure supply chains, which if adopted broadly could revise the terms upon which international business operates. A critical evaluation of this policymaker assessment is presented, based on near-time monitoring of medical and food trade disruption induced by government policy, on fine-grained trade data on the pre-pandemic international sourcing patterns of medical goods and medicines by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, on statements from U.S. government health experts before and during the pandemic on the frequency and sources of medicine shortages, and on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s latest evidence on the causes of medicine shortages in 2020. Such evidence vitiates the adverse conclusions mentioned above, but raises important questions about the factors that determine policy towards international business during a time of intensifying geopolitical rivalry.</jats:p>",

The quality of power supply depends on many parameters, the maintenance of which at a given level (voltage, frequency deviation) is carried out using various devices. One of these devices is grid energy storages, allowing you to even out schedules of daily, weekly, seasonal and annual electrical loads. Energy storage devices can also act as an uninterrupted power supply for substations and electrical grids, provide increased dynamic and static stability, and increase the transmission line throughput. However, the use of energy storage to eliminate irregularities in the schedule of generating capacities is not a traditional way. When using energy storage devices, the most important task is to determine their total capacity and energy intensity, as well as the location of the storage devices in the energy system and the economic feasibility of these measures. The criterion for the placement of storage devices is to reduce energy losses when using grid energy storages. In the course of the research, graphic and analytical dependencies of the distribution grid loads were obtained before and after the placement of grid energy storages, depending on the average daily active load.</jats:p>",

In response there has been a range of ‘whole system’ analyses. Few studies, however, consider both abstraction (water removed from rivers) and discharge (water returned) to inform the future planning of water systems. In this work we present a systems approach to analysing future water planning options where system development prioritises the water quality of the receiving river. We provide a theoretical demonstration by integrating water supply and wastewater infrastructure, and downstream river water quality, on an open-source, stylised, systems model for London, UK, at a citywide scale. We show that models which consider either supply or wastewater separately will underestimate impacts of effluent on the water quality, in some cases by amounts that would require £1 billion worth of infrastructure equivalent to mitigate. We highlight the utility of the systems approach in evaluating integrated water infrastructure planning using both socio-economic and environmental indicators. Through this approach we find unintended impacts from planning options on downstream river quality; including benefits from water demand management and rainwater harvesting, and costs from wastewater reuse. Finally, we present a novel management planning option between supply and wastewater, which we refer to as Abstraction-Effluent Dilution (AED), that is, to reduce river abstractions during high precipitation events to dilute untreated sewer spills. The AED option is found to provide up to £200 million worth of equivalent infrastructure in river quality improvements and has minimal impact on the reliability of water supply while requiring only a change in operational decision making. This proof-of-concept study highlights that seeing our water systems differently with this holistic approach could fundamentally change the way we think about future water infrastructure planning so that it works both for people and the environment.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, our focus in this article is on joint sustainability issues in a manufacturer–supplier relationship under a contract that possibly shares sustainability‐related costs, when there exists a supplier's potentially deficient sustainability effort. We find that the manufacturer may prefer indirect (i.e., paying a higher component price to its supplier) rather than direct support (i.e., increasing subsidies for a supplier's sustainability expenditures) when consumers are sensitive to the supplier's sustainability. We further find that as consumers' sensitivity to the supplier's sustainability increases, an uncoordinated SC will gradually approach the coordinated SC. This occurs because the increased sensitivity encourages greater cooperation among SC members. Our findings will help establish a better understanding of the joint sustainability development issues in an SC.</jats:p>",

The results show that earnings may increase demand but, disruption in supplies of raw materials and finished products nullify the effect.

Globally, seaweeds represent a significant part of these non-indigenous species (NIS), with 407 introduced algal species. Furthermore, the presence of NIS seaweeds has been reported as a major concern worldwide since the patterns of their potential invasion mechanisms and vectors are not yet fully understood. Currently, in the Iberian Peninsula, around 50 NIS seaweeds have been recorded. Some of these are also considered invasive due to their overgrowth characteristic and competition with other species. However, invasive seaweeds are suitable for industrial applications due to their high feedstock. Hence, seaweeds’ historical use in daily food diet, allied to research findings, showed that macroalgae are a source of nutrients and bioactive compounds with nutraceutical properties. The main goal of this review is to evaluate the records of NIS seaweeds in the Iberian Peninsula and critically analyze the potential of invasive seaweeds application in the food industry.</jats:p>"

This is with a view to ascertaining their capacity to enhance the ability of Lagos State to meet up with the affordable housing targets of the SDGs. This is vital if target 1 of SDG 11 that focusses on affordable housing provision is to be realized. The study adopts an explanatory, sequential Quan-qual mixed-method design. For the quantitative phase, a survey based on a systematic random sampling of four hundred and one co-operative leaders was done with statistical analysis was done. For the qualitative aspect, a focus group discussion was carried out and analysed with a computer-aided qualitative data analysis system (CAQDAS). Findings show that co-operative societies are most active in land acquisition activities but their capacity to convert these lands to housing units is limited, and that co-operative societies are as constrained as other housing suppliers in meeting transaction costs. However, seven crucial success factors for co-operative societies’ involvement in housing supply were discovered in the qualitative phase; which has not been identified by previous researchers in this study. These provide fresh policy directions for the sector.</jats:p>",

The use of energy is decisive in every segment of modern human life. Without exaggeration, it can be stated that the conditions of the urbanized man living today would basically change without energy. Without electricity, nothing would work, such as control systems implemented by computing devices as well as the main and auxiliary equipment of basic power systems. It is easy to see that the absence of electricity water and gas supply would be a cut off. Ventilation systems would not work. Traffic would stop and it would be total dark at night. There would be no heating and cooling systems for the apartments. Industrial and agricultural production would stop. There would be no drinking water or food. Communication and security systems would not work. National law enforcement would not be able to fulfil its function. Lack of energy would lead to economic and social disaster. Today’s global population of nearly 8 billion people is depleting the Earth’s energy supply and destroying its natural environment at the cost of ruthless energy use. If the current energy use trend of civilization will not be moderated and modified, the conditions of humanity as a whole will be jeopardized, in the immediate future.

In this study, with regard to the design of earthquake resistance techniques, which is the third category, a seismic reliability assessment was conducted that considers the water supply system, and a plan to maximize the seismic reliability was determined as a result of the analysis. The degree of improvement in seismic reliability was quantified for water supply systems with various sources and water supply routes via modeling of seismic protection for each water supply route. Korea’s A industrial water system, which has a history of large-scale earthquakes, was divided into nine paths, and the reliability of the water supply system and the cost of earthquake resistance were calculated and compared between the different paths. A water supply path consists of a combination of pipes of various sizes and lengths, and the amount of water to be supplied differs between paths. Quantifying the effect of the water supply system and the seismic reliability of a route is intended to provide a basic methodology for identifying the critical path that should be the target of seismic protection when money and resources available for construction are limited. This methodology was used to confirm that the reliability of the water supply, the demand for water, and the cost of earthquake resistance should be considered together to establish an earthquake resistance strategy for the critical path in a water supply system. We expect that the results of this study will be used to establish detailed strategies for preliminary reinforcement against earthquake damage based on critical paths rather than all or individual pipelines in a water supply network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: A key question in socially responsible supply networks is as follows: When firms audit some, but not all, of their respective suppliers, how do the degree centralities of the suppliers (i.e., the number of firms to which they supply) affect their auditing priority from the viewpoint of the firms? To investigate, we consider an assembly network consisting of two firms and three suppliers; each firm has one independent supplier that uniquely supplies to that firm and one common supplier that supplies to both. Academic/practical relevance: Most supply networks are characterized by firms that source from multiple suppliers and suppliers that serve multiple firms, thus resulting in suppliers who differ in their degree centrality. In such networks, any negative publicity from suppliers’ noncompliance with socially responsible practices—for example, employment of child labor, unsafe working conditions, and excessive pollution—can significantly damage the reputation of the buying firms. To mitigate this impact, firms preemptively audit suppliers although resource and time considerations typically restrict the number of suppliers a firm can audit. Consequently, it becomes important to understand the impact of the degree centralities of the suppliers on the priority with which firms audit them. Methodology: Game-theoretic analysis. Results: Downstream competition between the firms drives them away from auditing the supplier with higher centrality, that is, the common supplier, in equilibrium, despite the fact that auditing this supplier is better for the aggregate profit of the firms. We show that this inefficiency is corrected when the firms cooperate (via a stable coalition) to jointly audit the suppliers and share the auditing cost in a fair manner. We also identify conditions under which joint auditing improves social welfare. Managerial implications: We have two main messages: (i) individual incentives can lead firms to deprioritize the auditing of structurally important suppliers, which is inefficient; (ii) the practice of joint auditing can correct this inefficiency. </jats:p>",

This study investigated how the loading characteristics of Cl− vary depending on storm events and land cover in a temperate region. We monitored Cl− concentrations in three study watersheds that have different compositions of urban and agricultural land uses. In addition, a Mass First Flush ratio (MFFn) was determined to quantify the effect of first flush on Cl− loading. Overall, the observed concentrations and loadings in this study were found to be less than those reported in cold northern regions. The monitoring data showed that Cl− concentrations and loads observed in an urban watershed were significantly larger than those of a rural watershed. The results suggest water management plans should focus on urbanized areas and their storm water to efficiently reduce chloride loading to downstream waterbodies. However, a further study is recommended to identify the sources and pathways of Cl− loaded to waterbodies.</jats:p>",

This study aims to determine (1) the level of marketing margin, farmer’s share dan monopoly index (MPI), and (2) the performance of the supply chain for granulated coconut palm sugar in Kulon Progo Regency. Marketing margin is the difference between the price in consumers with price at the level of producers. Farmer’s share is the percentage of share that producers get. The higher value of the marketing margin, then the farmer's share value will be lower. The structure of the market is analyzed by measuring the monopoly index (MPI). The greater the MPI values indicate a growing monopoly. The supply chain is the cooperation between the institutions to create and deliver products to consumers until the end by observing the flow of products, information flow, and money flow. Supply chain performance can be analyzed using a Likert scale questionnaire on the product flow, flow of information, and money flow. The results showed that the shortest marketing tract has the lowest margin value, and the value of the farmer’s share is highest. The highest MPI values in the longest marketing tract with Tiwi CPU as collecting traders have the highest index of a monopoly. The performance of the supply chain of granulated palm sugar in district Kokap, Kulon Progo Regency overall belongs to quite smoothly on all three channels of marketing, whether made from the dominant raw material of coconut sugar, made from sweet sap coconut sugar, or both.</jats:p>"

Generally, organizational and economic  relations are a set of relations between the participants of the dairy products chain, which are formed in the process of production, distribution and sale to consumers, as a result of which the economic interests of all its participants are realized. The  peculiarities of dairy products of the chain are systematized and the basic principles, conditions for their balanced development are determined, contributes to the coordination of the economic interests of all its participants.\nIt has been proved that economic interest is an important component of organizational and economic relations in the supply chain of milk and dairy products, and its main elements are: prices for raw materials and fnished products, costs of production, processing of raw materials, transportation, terms of mutual settlements, material interest of personnel, norms of fulfllment of contractual obligations, risks and the like. Review of the negative factors of organizational and economic relations in the dairy product chain and their impact on the eﬀectiveness of each of its participants. As a tool to increase the production of raw milk, it is proposed to optimize the raw material zones of dairy processing enterprises, develop strategic programs for the development of the industry and stimulate consumer demand, as well as create industry clusters.\nThe calculations for the distribution of costs and income between participants in the supply chain of milk and milk products prove the need to ensure the equivalence of exchange. In order to improve the efciency of the researcher, it was proposed to increase the volume of milk production and processing, as well as to establish mutually benefcial relations between its participants, connected by a single production cycle. The directions of innovation and investment development of the participants in the dairy products chain, especially the link of dairy cattle breeding, are highlighted. It is highlighted that the innovative renewal of the activities of the chain participants is a process of cyclical activities focused on the production of competitive dairy products of a new generation, which will contribute to an increase in turnover  in order to obtain the highest proft of the chain participants and satisfy the demand of consumers with diﬀerent income levels.\nKey words: dairy products chain, chain participants, exchange equivalence, organizational and economic relations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tThe practical realization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high energy density is currently limited by the poor cyclability of the lithium-metal anode. Lithium plating and stripping in the liquid ether-based electrolyte is irreversible over long-term cycling and this leads to rapid capacity fade. Due to the reducing nature of lithium, parasitic side reactions with the electrolyte also occur with considerable severity during cell operation. This eliminates a significant portion of the available lithium inventory and electrolyte supply, and the cell fails prematurely. These problems can be sidestepped by employing surplus lithium and electrolyte in the cell, but this compromises the stack-level energy density. Stabilizing lithium deposition and reducing electrolyte decomposition is of critical importance to enabling commercially viable Li-S batteries with high energy density and long cycle life.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The chemistry of Li-S batteries is unique due to the generation of polysulfide intermediates at the cathode that are soluble in the electrolyte. The polysulfides migrate to the anode side, which fundamentally alters its interfacial chemistry by forming reduced sulfide species (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) on the lithium surface. These species are known to have an intrinsically stabilizing effect on lithium deposition, although it is not sufficient to enable stable operation of Li-S batteries at reasonable current densities. Nevertheless, the modification of electrolyte-soluble polysulfide species offers a unique opportunity for tuning the interfacial chemistry of the lithium-metal anode towards stabilizing lithium deposition and reducing electrolyte decomposition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Tellurium, which sits two position below sulfur in Group 16 of the periodic table, is an excellent candidate element for modifying the composition of polysulfide intermediates in Li-S batteries and forming potentially favorable components in the lithium SEI layer. It was found that elemental tellurium (Te<jats:sup>0</jats:sup>) could be facilely assimilated into polysulfide species to form soluble mixed <jats:italic>polytellurosulfide</jats:italic> species when left in an ethereal solution of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>. This was confirmed by the characteristic isotopic signature of tellurium using mass spectrometry. The polytellurosulfide species were found to reduce on the surface of lithium metal to form red-colored lithium thiotellurate (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TeS<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>), which was confirmed by X-ray techniques. In contrast to Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TeS<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is expected to be a significantly better ionic conductor due to the reduced electron density around the sulfur atoms. This would help engender a uniform lithium-ion flux on the lithium surface, enabling homogenous lithium deposition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Based on the results above, elemental tellurium was simply added in a 1 : 10 molar ratio to the sulfur/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S cathode to modify the chemistry of Li-S batteries. During cell operation, the generated polysulfides (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>) reacted with the Te<jats:sup>0</jats:sup> additive in the cathode to form polytellurosulfide (Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>) species <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic>. The crossover of these tellurium-containing species to the anode side was confirmed by the detection of a significant amount of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TeS<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on the lithium surface. The favorable properties of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TeS<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> as a lithium SEI component enabled the formation of dense and uniform lithium deposits and significantly improved lithium cycling efficiency. In the anode-free full cell configuration, which pairs a Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S cathode with a bare anode current collector and contains zero excess lithium (N/P ratio = 1), the addition of tellurium improved cycle life by a factor of 7. The loss of the limited lithium inventory in the anode-free cell was reduced from 2% per cycle to 0.25% per cycle.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) revealed the drastically reduced electrolyte decomposition on lithium surface due to tellurium-stabilized lithium deposition. The reduced electrolyte decomposition could allow a limited electrolyte supply to be retained for a longer number of cycles, thus enabling extended cyclability under lean-electrolyte conditions. This was confirmed using large-area pouch cells employing a high-loading sulfur cathode (5.2 mg cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>), a lithium-foil anode, and a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5 µl mg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Under such stringent cell design conditions, the pouch cells could be cycled stably for nearly 100 cycles with the addition of tellurium. In contrast, the control cell failed within 25 cycles.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work demonstrates a novel, effective, and robust strategy of adding tellurium to the sulfur/Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S cathode for stabilizing lithium deposition and reducing electrolyte decomposition in Li-S batteries. This improves cycle life in energy-dense cell configurations operating with a limited lithium inventory or electrolyte supply. Importantly, this approach is scalable as no expensive or complicated pre-treatments or coatings of the lithium-metal anode are necessary. The unique chemistry of tellurium in the polysulfide-rich environment of Li-S batteries opens a new frontier in research in Li-S batteries, bringing them one step closer to reality.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"289fig1.jpg\" xlink:type=\"simple\"/>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>",

Many current solutions suffer from data fragmentation, lack of reliable provenance, and diverse protocol regulations across multiple distributions and processes. Amongst other solutions, Blockchain has emerged as a leading technology, since it provides secure traceability and control, immutability, and trust creation among stakeholders in a low cost IT solution. Although Blockchain is making a significant impact in many areas, there are many impediments to its widespread adoption in supply chains. This article is the first survey of its kind, with detailed analysis of the challenges and future directions in Blockchain-enabled supply chains. We review the existing digitalization of the supply chain including the role of GS1 standards and technologies. Current use cases and startups in the field of Blockchain-enabled supply chains are reviewed and presented in tabulated form. Technical and non-technical challenges in the adoption of Blockchain for supply chain applications are critically analyzed, along with the suitability of various consensus algorithms for applications in the supply chain. The tools and technologies in the Blockchain ecosystem are depicted and analyzed. Some key areas as future research directions are also identified which must be addressed to realize mass adoption of Blockchain-based in supply chain traceability. Finally, we propose MOHBSChain, a novel framework for Blockchain-enabled supply chains.</jats:p>",

Analytical studies were performed on the basis of experimental data obtained during the start-up tests of the circulating water cooling system of the “Hrazdan-5” power unit with a capacity of 300 MW. Studies of the circulating water cooling system were carried out at an electric power of the power unit of 200 - 299 MW, with a thermal load of 320 - 396 Gcal/hr. By circulating pumps (CP), water mixed with condensate is fed to the cooling tower, from where it is returned through the turbine for spraying by nozzles in the turbine steam condenser. An attempt to increase the water supply to the condenser by increasing the size of the nozzles did not give the expected results. The amount of the water supply to the circulating pumping station depends on the pressure loss in the circulating water cooling system. The highest pressure losses are in hydro turbines (HT), which are part of the circulating pumping station. Therefore, by adjusting the load of the hydro turbine, with a decrease in water pressure losses, you can increase the water supply by circulating pumps to the condenser. Experimental data and theoretical dependences were used to calculate the changed hydraulic characteristics of the circulating water cooling system. As a result of reducing the pressure losses in the section of the hydro turbine from 1.04 to 0.15 kgf/cm2, the dictating point for the pressure of circulating pumping station will be the turbine steam condenser. The thermal power plant cooling tower is designed to service two power units. Activation of the peak cooler sectors of the cooling tower gives a reduction of the cooled water temperature by 2-4 °С only with the spraying system.</jats:p>",

However, as an important public service facility in daily life of elderly, the research on the equity of urban parks is mostly based on the evaluation of accessibility. The equity of the elderly's access to urban parks services has been rarely discussed from the perspective of supply and demand balance. In the context of the concept of spatial equity, we used urban parks in the main city of Harbin as a case study, the actual travel mode of the elderly was considered in the evaluation, adopted an Integrated Spatial Equity Evaluation (ISEE) framework, quantitative evaluation of the equity of different levels of urban park under multiple traffic modes. In this study, the results showed that under the three modes of travel, the degree of spatial equity was higher for non-motorized trips than for the other two modes. In terms of urban parks hierarchy, the spatial equity of urban parks at district level were much higher than those at the neighborhood level and street level. The inequity between supply and demand for urban park for elderly people was significant and varies between administrative districts. The empirical evidence in this research may provide references and suggestions for urban parks planning and decision-making. In cities where the scale of land use is basically stable, such as Harbin, we can start from the spatial configuration of park green space system and public transportation system to improve the efficiency of urban parks provision.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 has now unleashed a global supply chain crisis across a huge number of organizations, stemming from a lack of understanding and flexibility of the multiple layers of their global supply chains. In addition to the lack of efficient management through unpredicted events and occasions. Drawing on extended resources based view and resilience theory, this paper attempts to shed the light on the mediating role of resilience between supply chain integration and organizational performance represented in quality, cost and delivery performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. 224 questionnaires were collected and analyzed through process macro technique proposed by Andrew Hayes to test the mediating role of resilience. The results indicated that resilience can significantly mediate the relationship between supply chain integration and quality, cost and delivery performance. Therefore, this paper contributes to both extended resources based view and resilience theory. As it empathize on how organizations can acquire a unique bundle of resources through integration, which will allow them to maintain a desirable level of performance during market disruption through building resilience. The results will practically guide organizations to invest in building resilience in order to be able to cope with unexpected events that disrupts the business environment such as COVID19.</jats:p>",

This study examines the collection rate of and decisions on the product greening improvement level in a three-level CLSC with the government’s reward–penalty and a manufacturer’s subsidy policy. Four game-theoretic models are analyzed in order to evaluate the ways in which the policy and revenue-sharing contracts (RSCs) between the manufacturer and retailer affect the CLSC members’ optimal decisions and profits. We found that a reward–penalty and subsidy policy raise the collection rate, as well as the product greening improvement level. A manufacturer’s financial conflict of interest can be mitigated using RSCs. The RSCs between the manufacturer and the retailer also increase the profit of a recycling company that successfully coordinates the CLSC. An interesting result is that, when the RSCs are used under the subsidy policy, the collection rate is higher than it is in a centralized model. We also found that the subsidy level needs to be adjusted according to the price of the recycling resources, and that increasing the value of the recyclable resources and lowering the recycling costs in the early stages of the supply chain collaboration could lead to higher environmental sustainability. These results illustrate that using an RSC can effectively coordinate the CLSC, and can thus help policy implementation by governments.</jats:p>"

The RBC was inoculated with Sulfate Reducing Bacteria consortium (predominantly Desulfovibrio species), and the performance was evaluated at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and inlet heavy metal concentrations. A feed-forward back-propagation neural network model was developed using 90 data sets obtained over a period of three months, to predict the removal of heavy metal (HMRE) and COD (CODRE). The predictive capability of the model was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination (R) and mean absolute percentage error between the model fitted and actual experimental data, whereas sensitivity analysis was performed on the input parameters by determining the absolute average sensitivity (AAS) values. The higher AAS value of the HRT compared with that of inlet heavy metal concentration suggested that the change of HRT has a significant influence on HMRE and CODRE. Overall, the results obtained from this study demonstrated that ANNs can efficiently predict RBC behaviour with regard to heavy metal and COD removal characteristics under the prevailing operational conditions.</jats:p>",

Survey areas at each shore consisted of five paired plots (cleared recruitment plots and control plots). Larval recruitment was first detected in 2004 but benthic individuals were not detected until 2 years later. The abundance and occurrence of B. glandula increased until around 2010; abundance then decreased but occurrence remained high (70%) until 2014, suggesting that the metapopulation of this barnacle approached a maximum around 2011. From 2011, the population dynamics of B. glandula changed considerably at two contrasting spatial scales: at a regional scale, the dependency of the number of larvae on stock size decreased, whereas at a local scale, the relative contribution of larval supply as a determinant of local population dynamics decreased. These findings suggest that the major driving force of population dynamics of the introduced barnacle changed in just a few years after invasion; therefore, population census data from just after an invasion, including larval recruitment monitoring just outside the invasion front, is essential to understanding invasion dynamics by sessile marine organisms.</jats:p>"

Specifically, 35, 5, 20, 48, 43, and 151 countries were selected from the American, Oceania, European, African, Asian continents, and the world respectively. Further, three hydro-socio-technology-knowledge indicators associated with demographic, technology, and knowledge dimensions were estimated with soft-computing methods (i.e. Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Regression Trees (R Trees)) for the world's continents). The GMDH model's performance was the best among the other soft-computing methods in estimating the hydro-socio-technology-knowledge indicators for all the world's continents based on statistical criteria (coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)). The values of RMSE for GMDH models for the ratio of rural to urban population (PRUP), population density (PD), number of internet users (IU) and education index (EI) indicators equaled (0.291, 0.046, 0.127, 0.199), (0.094, 0.023, 0.174, 0.137), (0.237, 0.044, 0.166, 0.225), (0.173, 0.031, 0.126, 0.163), (0.218, 0.058, 0.142, 0.196) and (0.231, 0.049, 0.167, 0.195) for America, Oceania, Europe, Africa, Asia and the world, respectively.

They are also highly perishable and as such are easily susceptible to spoilage, leading to a reduction in quality attributes and induced food loss. Cold chain technologies have over the years been employed to reduce the quality loss of fruits and vegetables from farm to fork. However, a high amount of losses (≈50%) still occur during the packaging, pre-cooling, transportation, and storage of these fresh agricultural produce. This study highlights the current state-of-the-art of various advanced tools employed to reducing the quality loss of fruits and vegetables during the packaging, storage, and transportation cold chain operations, including the application of imaging technology, spectroscopy, multi-sensors, electronic nose, radio frequency identification, printed sensors, acoustic impulse response, and mathematical models. It is shown that computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, spectroscopy, X-ray imaging, and mathematical models are well established in monitoring and optimizing process parameters that affect food quality attributes during cold chain operations. We also identified the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual representation models of a particular fresh produce (digital twins) as emerging technologies that can help monitor and control the uncharted quality evolution during its postharvest life. These advances can help diagnose and take measures against potential problems affecting the quality of fresh produce in the supply chains. Plausible future pathways to further develop these emerging technologies and help in the significant reduction of food losses in the supply chain of fresh produce are discussed. Future research should be directed towards integrating IoT and digital twins for multiple shipments in order to intensify real-time monitoring of the cold chain environmental conditions, and the eventual optimization of the postharvest supply chains. This study gives promising insight towards the use of advanced technologies in reducing losses in the postharvest supply chain of fruits and vegetables.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Electricity systems around the world are changing, with the Paris Agreement of 2015 a catalyst for much of this current change.1 The Australian Government ratified this agreement, by commiting to 26-28% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030.2 Additionally, State governments are adopting more ambitious targets to increase variable renewable energy and focusing on net emissions reductions, while the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) warns of power instabilities and load shedding3. Given the difficulties in reducing emissions in other sectors, reductions in emissions from electricity generation has become the focus of these targets. Natural gas is often referred to as a ‘transition fuel’ towards a low emissions future, but this requires that it is in abundance and cost competitive. While the majority of the electricity generated in the National Energy Market (NEM) is coal-based, a vast majority of these plants are due to retire gradually between now and 2050, and this generation loss will need to be replaced in the context of low emissions aspirations. How this is done has significant implications for how much the system will cost, with natural gas playing a pivotal role. In order to decarbonise the grid to meet targets, while building firm, dispatchable generation capacity to support the system, a new metric is required to measure success.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The changing generation mix, along with the need to maintain a competent grid, is resulting in previously acceptable cost comparison metrics being used outside of their limited range of applicability. Electricity generation facilities do not only provide energy, they also provide an array of additional services which are fundamental to maintaining a permanent and reliable electricity supply across the system. These services, corresponding costs and operational implications need to be included in the evaluation of technologies in order to ensure the grids emerge transformed, resilient and genuinely sustainable. Total System Cost is the most appropriate economic metric for analysis and decision making in a future, low emissions grid.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper explores the outputs of the MEGS model (Model of Energy and Grid Services), showing the outcomes if a single technology group is favoured. High renewables, gas and carbon capture and storage scenarios are discussed. The optimal route to power grid decarbonisation needs to be be viewed as a team sport, not a race. It's an \"and\" not an \"or\" solution. There's a range of technologies that have very different, yet important, roles to play in providing the pathway to a low emissions, competent and reliable supply at the lowest total system cost.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: When donors subsidize products for sale to low-income families, they need to address who to subsidize in the supply chain and to what extent and whether such supply chain structures as retail competition, substitutable products, and demand uncertainty matter. Academic/practical relevance: By introducing and analyzing development supply chains in which transactions are commercial but subsidies are needed for affordability, we explore different supply chain structures, with product substitution and retail competition motivated by a field study in Haiti of subsidized solar lantern supply chains. Methodology: We incorporate product substitution, retail competition, and demand uncertainty in a three-echelon supply chain model with manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. This model has transactions among the donor, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers as a four-stage Stackelberg game, and we solve different variations of this game by using backward induction. Results: The donor can subsidize the manufacturer, retailer, or customer as long as the total subsidy per unit across these echelons is maintained at the optimal level. Having more product choice and having more retail channel choice can increase the number of beneficiaries adopting the products; this increase becomes more pronounced as demand becomes more uncertain. Managerial implications: Donors must coordinate across different programs along the entire supply chain. They should look for evidence in their collective experience of more beneficiaries when subsidizing competing retailers selling diverse substitutable products. </jats:p>",

We have identified a novel domain appended to the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) of the intracellular pathogen Mycoplasma penetrans. Sequence analysis of this N-terminal region suggests the appended domain is an aminotransferase, which we demonstrate here. The aminotransferase domain of MpMetRS is capable of generating methionine from its α-keto acid analog, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB). The methionine thus produced can be subsequently attached to cognate tRNAMet in the MpMetRS aminoacylation domain. Genomic erosion in the Mycoplasma species has impaired many canonical biosynthetic pathways, causing them to rely on their host for numerous metabolites. It is still unclear if this bifunctional MetRS is a key part of pathogen life cycle or is a neutral consequence of the reductive evolution experienced by Mycoplasma species.</jats:p>"

Many significant factors create hindrances to knowledge flow in the supply chain. These factors are known as Supply Chain Knowledge Flow Barriers (SCKFBs). Therefore, most organisations wish to understand how different SCKFBs affect supply chain progress. This research aims to suggest a hybrid three-stage framework of Fuzzy Delphi (FD)–Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM)–Fuzzy Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (FMICMAC) methodology, combine abbreviated as the fuzzy DEISMI for investigating SCKFBs. This research identifies 26 SCKFBs through literature search and opinion from the experts. FD is used to finalise 15 significant barriers to knowledge flow in the supply chain. Further, ISM methodology helps to develop contextual relationships and a hierarchical model between these significant barriers. The evolved hierarchical model presents interrelationships and interdependencies among the identified SCKFBs. The FMICMAC is applied to identify the driving power and dependence power among SCKFBs. This study shows SCKFBs who have high value of driving power and low value of dependence power have strategic importance in supply chain development. These barriers are at the base of the hierarchical model, and policymakers should give significant consideration towards these SCKFBs.</jats:p>",

Metabolites released during algae growth contain a variety of organic nitrogen species, which are called N-DBP precursors. The aim of this paper is to elucidate how N-DBP precursors are released under UV radiation, as well as investigate the variations of their chemical properties. The results show that through UV radiation, the physiological metabolism of algal cells was disordered and the properties of their metabolites were changed. The dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compound concentration increased rapidly from 5.38 at the beginning to 11.11 mg/L after 30 min of radiation, and then increased steadily from 11.11 to 23.71 mg/L during a further 210 min of radiation. Derivation results of the curves for algae and DON concentration variations shows that when 1 × 1010 algal cells were destroyed, 8.31 mg DON was released into the solution during the first 30 min of radiation. Low dose UV radiation brought a slight decline of the specific N-DBP formation potential due to changes in the extracellular organic matter (EOM) structure without destroying the algal cells, which was conducive to controlling the formation potential of N-DBPs. Long-time UV radiation can bring a significant increase in N-DBP formation potential. After 4 hours of ultraviolet radiation, the total formation potential of N-DBPs in the solution increased from about 84.9 μg/L to about 213.5 μg/L, 2.5 times higher than the initial solution. The N-DBP formation potential increases obviously during the first 10–30 min UV radiation, and then decreases slightly in the subsequent 30–240 min radiation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industry experts internationally have raised concerns regarding the significant risk posed to the real estate sector by the unprecedented global pandemic of Covid-19. The influence of Covid-19 has been swift, and with emerging wide-ranging consequences. The stay-at-home-policy has stagnated real estate and other economic activities. Many lenders, buyers and estate agents are evaluating the threats and opportunities in their operations. Developers face stoppages resulting from the impact and inherent risks of the stay-at-home policies on the built environment, and real estate chain. Return on investments initiated, but not completed due to the pandemic negative effect has resulted in a financial crisis. Similarly, there are fears that income streams, such as rental incomes, and mortgage payments, which are already being affected negatively in the short-term may worsen in the long-term due to economic recession. The purpose of the study, therefore, is to identify any COVID-19 pandemic impact, its mitigation for the tenant, and across the supply chain within the real estate sector in the United Kingdom. The study is based on a qualitative descriptive research design. The required data has been collected mainly through an extensive review of the available secondary sources. Occupiers’ Sentiment Index and past recessionary financial performance were used to provide a wide-ranging insight into crisis effects on the macroeconomy of the property market. Consequently, two procedural approaches are utilised; firstly, the economic recovery scenario V, U, W and L shapes, are analysed to determine the potential recovery pattern of supply chains across the real estate sector. Secondly, the use of a legal context to mitigate the pandemic risk across the sector. The findings reveal an emerging dynamic trend, rooted in contract clause revamping, as suggestive of a mitigation approach by the industry. The significance of the study provides a robust platform on which a long-term response to any future unprecedented pandemic within the real estate-built environment can be delivered.</jats:p>"

It shows that the internally controlled strategy contributes about 70% of supply chain competitiveness. The internal infrastructure criterion that consists of software and hardware contributes 65.92% to the whole infrastructure criterion. The internal infrastructure then contributes 19.38% to supply chain competitiveness. Therefore, the internally controlled strategies and internal infrastructure contribute up to 90.08% to the supply chain competitiveness of e-commerce in Indonesia. This result implies that to attain the supply chain competitiveness, the company must carry out strategies focusing on the performance such as cost, differentiation, sustainability as well as on the internal infrastructure such as software and hardware.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In this paper, the authors limited their study to the business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) players because these two platforms have been experiencing a very rapid growth. While e-commerce business can take many platforms besides B2B and B2C, the future research should include other platform such as consumer to consumer as well. Because the focus in this study is more the information and material flows, it will be of great interest if the future research covers the platform of mobile payment as well that guarantee the ease of cashflows within supply chains. Also, with the occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic when this paper was written, in the near future, it is then of great interest to incorporate the pandemic context into the proposed model used in this study. The further study should analyze long-term changes happened as the result of pandemic such as behavioral changes of online shopping from customer side or shift in e-commerce supply chain infrastructure and inventory practice.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>With this study, it is expected that it can be determined which criteria contribute the most to the supply chain competitiveness of the e-commerce industry in Indonesia that will be useful for industry player.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>E-commerce development in Indonesia is still facing serious challenges.

In India 31% of the total population exists in urban areas. The smart city mission of India was established with the objective to deliver the basic requirements of the citizens in a sustainable manner. Madurai city located at Peninsular India with a 1.4 million population was taken for this study. The objective was to develop an integrated urban water management strategy after analysing all the components of the urban water cycle such as rainfall, runoff, groundwater and wastewater. The population forecast for 2021 was carried out for the Local Planning Area of 726.34 km2 and the water demand was calculated as 109 Mm3/year. To meet the demand, runoff from the average rainfall was estimated as 393 Mm3/yr using the SCS-CN method. The storage capacity in the water bodies to store the surface water was estimated as 156 Mm3/yr and groundwater recharge potential was estimated as 22 Mm3/yr. The integrated urban water management strategy developed, shows that there is a huge potential for rainwater storage at the surface level and subsequent recharge through artificial recharge techniques.</jats:p>",

A relatively new approach is its application to orchards as important components of human agricultural activity. The ecosystem functions they perform as regards to the volume and implementation effectiveness depend on the regional soil and climatic conditions and the technologies used. For the Samara Region, this problem is considered for the first time. Trends associated with the dynamics of the fruit and berry plantations area in the Russian Federation are discussed, including general indicators decrease simultaneously with the intensive orchards growth. At present, the Samara Region is significantly ahead of neighboring regions in the gardens area, with their minimum area in the Ulyanovsk Region. Other territorial units belonging to the Middle Volga horticultural province of the Saratov Region such as republics of Tatarstan, Bashkortostan possess significant areas occupied by the gardens. In addition to large horticultural farms, the cultivation of fruit crops in the Samara Region is widespread among the local population. Horticultural agrocenoses of industrial and individual kinds, participating in the implementation of ecosystem services do it differently not only because of their different area scale. The authors explain this provision with examples related to specific groups of ecosystem services. The main target ecosystem service, growing of fruits, in terms of assortment and volume in the Samara Region is supplied to a greater extent at the expense of the individual orchards of the population. Agrotechnical features, implying large-scale treatment of industrial gardens with chemicals, pose a greater risk of environmental pollution. A greater variety of cultivated crops, varieties and organisms trophically associated with them as well as less intensive chemicalization level provide the gardens of the population with a leading position in the conservation of biological diversity, both natural and cultivated.</jats:p>"

The experiments were carried out using pilot-scale filtration units: one with a CRS filter bed and the other with natural river sand (NRS). Both filter media were prepared in accordance with typical standards for rapid sand filtration (particle size range and distribution, and filter bed depth), and were further characterized in terms of chemical composition, particles and bulk density, porosity, acid solubility and sphericity coefficient. Over four months, 14 filter runs using filtration rates of 90, 180, 270 and 360 m3 m−2 d−1 were monitored and characterized in terms of run length, head loss increase along filter bed depth, turbidity removal along filter bed depth. Overall, the performance of the CRS filter was similar to or even better than that of the NRS filter, producing filtered water with turbidity lower than 0.50 NTU along the entire run, with head loss increasing rates and run length similar to those of the NRS filter. It is concluded that CRS presents a high potential for use as filter media for rapid filtration in water treatment, without technical or operational disadvantages.</jats:p>",

The AHP-CRITIC weighting method was applied to determine the index weighting, and WRCC dynamics during 2011–2016 were analysed and evaluated quantitatively using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The results revealed the following. (1) During 2011–2016, the comprehensive score of the WRCC was &amp;lt;0.4, indicating poor WRCC. (2) The degree membership of the average evaluation results to V1, V2, and V3 increased successively during 2011–2016. The degree membership of V2 in 2011–2013 was greater than that of V3; however, the situation was reversed during 2014–2016. (3) The indices of available amount of water resources per capita, utilization rate of water resources, water supply per capita, modulus of water supply, quota of domestic water demand, and population density were factors that affected the WRCC of Jinan unfavourably. Conversely, the indices of water demand per 10,000 Yuan industrial output value and water use rate of the ecological environment were factors that played positive roles in improving the WRCC.</jats:p>",

The agricultural industry is underdeveloped and requires a transformation in technology. Advances in processing agricultural products (agri-product) are essential to achieve a smart production rate with good quality and to control waste. This research deals with modelling of a controllable production rate by a combination of the workforce and machines to minimize the total cost of production. The optimization of the carbon emission variable and management of the imperfection in processing makes the model eco-efficient. The perishability factor in the model is ignored due to the selection of a single sugar processing firm in the supply chain with a single vendor for the pragmatic application of the proposed research. A non-linear production model is developed to provide an economic benefit to the firms in terms of the minimum total cost with variable cycle time, workforce, machines, and plant production rate. A numerical experiment is performed by utilizing the data set of the agri-processing firm. A derivative free approach, i.e., algebraic approach, is utilized to find the best solution. The sensitivity analysis is performed to support the managers for the development of agricultural product supply chain management (Agri-SCM).</jats:p>"

The biopharmaceuticalindustry in Iran has a generic-based pharmerging market. Therefore, identifying risksassociated with the supply chain of those drugs can significantly boost the possibility of successof biopharmaceutical companies. This study is conducted to determine the supply chain riskfactors of biopharmaceuticals companies in Iran. Methods: The current research work is a qualitative-quantitative study. A systematic review andinterview with experts (n=14) were conducted to identify potential supply chain risks in thebiopharmaceutical industries. To determine the significance of identified risks, Fuzzy screeningmethod was employed to collect the opinions of experts (n=16) in the biopharmaceuticalindustries. Results: By systematic review and interviews with the biopharmaceutical industry experts, 100potential risks in the biopharmaceutical industry supply chain were identified. These risks weredivided into two general categories namely macro and micro risks. Based on experts’ judgment,77 out of 100 identified risks were eliminated and 23 significant risks were determined. Themost important risks are the Ministry of health (as the regulatory body) conflict of interest, USsanctions, lack of domestic suppliers of essential materials, pseudo-productivity, and moneytransfer related to the bank’s sanctions. Conclusion: Due to the multitude of present risks and the impossibility of controlling all ofthem, it is recommended that managers and producers focus more on controlling the identifiedsignificant risks.</jats:p>",

To have a more detailed look at the application of GPP in Latvia, the authors screened 97 public tenders for supply of food products, documenting the choice of the green criteria. Only 15 % of the screened tender documents corresponded to the national GPP requirements. Only 4 % of the tender documents gave higher priority exclusively for organic products compared to products within national quality schemes or integrated pest management agriculture. The authors compared these findings with the opinions of environmental experts, GPP guidelines by the European Commission, and experience from other countries. The authors conclude that 1) self-reporting is not an appropriate method to measure the implementation level of GPP, and 2) having a large number of criteria without clear goals can lead to using the easiest, but least environmentally beneficial options, and 3) for some tenders complying with national GPP, the environmental benefits may be unclear.</jats:p>",

The extraordinary situation has been affecting the behaviour and decision-making of passengers and their demand for public transport not only in the Slovak Republic but globally. The situation has caused a significant decline in passenger transport as well as changes in the structure of passengers who still use the public transport system. Several operators have responded to declining demand by reducing the transport services supply, to reduce operating costs. The declining demand is reflected in a decrease in transport revenues and an increase in the demonstrable loss of operators providing public passenger transport services.</jats:p>",

With three quarters of fed nitrogen ending up in the manure, significant research efforts have focused on understanding and mitigating lactating dairy cows’ nitrogen losses. Recent changes proposed to the Nutrient Requirement System for Dairy Cattle in the US include variable efficiencies of absorbed essential AA for milk protein production. This first separation from a purely substrate-based system, standing on the old limiting AA theory, recognizes the ability of the cow to alter the metabolism of AA. In this review we summarize a compelling amount of evidence suggesting that AA requirements for milk protein synthesis are based on a demand-driven system. Milk protein synthesis is governed at mammary level by a set of transduction pathways, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the integrated stress response (ISR), and the unfolded protein response (UPR). In tight coordination, these pathways not only control the rate of milk protein synthesis, setting the demand for AA, but also manipulate cellular AA transport and even blood flow to the mammary glands, securing the supply of those needed nutrients. These transduction pathways, specifically mTORC1, sense specific AA, as well as other physiological signals, including insulin, the canonical indicator of energy status. Insulin plays a key role on mTORC1 signaling, controlling its activation, once AA have determined mTORC1 localization to the lysosomal membrane. Based on this molecular model, AA and insulin signals need to be tightly coordinated to maximize milk protein synthesis rate. The evidence in lactating dairy cows supports this model, in which insulin and glucogenic energy potentiate the effect of AA on milk protein synthesis. Incorporating the effect of specific signaling AA and the differential role of energy sources on utilization of absorbed AA for milk protein synthesis seems like the evident following step in nutrient requirement systems to further improve N efficiency in lactating dairy cow rations.</jats:p>",

Through 74 semi-structured interviews and analysis of crew management policies from 7 shipping companies, we identify a failure of most shipowners’ internal policies to comply with legal obligations. Furthermore, multinational shipping companies use crewing agencies to evade their liabilities to injured seafarers. We propose the establishment of a joint liability mechanism between employers and labour intermediaries to fill this compliance gap that exists in global human resource supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: J81, J83, L91, M54, N75 </jats:p>",

From 2004 to 2020, a multi-stakeholder initiative through the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN) has endeavored to raise the professionalism of borehole drilling and its management in Africa. The initiative comprised in-country and desk studies, training, and the development of guidelines, manuals, training materials, short animated films for advocacy as well as using blogs, webinars and online communities of practice to share experiences. The initiative was funded to approximately USD 750,000 in total. Funding was fragmented throughout, but the initial support by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme Africa (WSP-AF), consistent leadership and subsequent partnerships between Skat Foundation, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WaterAid UK and others enabled progression on the topic, as well as innovation and opportunities to be harnessed. The initiative has raised the profile of drilling professionalism, provided a wealth of materials and inspired others to take action. Thousands of stakeholders have improved their knowledge. Academic research on the topic has also increased and capacity strengthening of groundwater management and professional drilling is now an action area for the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW). UNICEF and WaterAid are among the organizations that have made changes to procurement and project management as a result of the initiative. Despite a growing recognition of the importance of drilling professionalism, reliable, long-term investment in in-country training and professional development, and addressing challenges in the institutional environment remains inadequate. Despite the importance of water well drilling, and commitments to SDG 6.1, capacity strengthening in this area remains a marginal issue for national and international political leadership, and arguably for international funding agencies.</jats:p>"

Using a difference‐in‐differences (DID) model, this study indicates that the public health insurance reform led to reallocation of the rural labor force out of the farm sector by reducing the farm employment and increasing the likelihood of rural residents working in both the farm and nonfarm sectors. This research finds that rural female residents who are of a younger age and in better health were more likely to leave farm employment when covered by public health insurance. Suggestive evidence also finds that such public health insurance reform increased the individual income of the farm population.</jats:p>",

The established classification of disasters includes natural and man-made disasters. These are further classified into sudden- and slow-onset disasters. Social welfare supply chains happen to be a distinctive type of humanitarian supply chain working in slow-onset disasters such as poverty and drought. To understand the complex systems like humanitarian supply chain, system dynamics modelling is used. </jats:p><jats:p> Type of the Case: Study of a phenomenon. </jats:p><jats:p> Basis of the Case: In this study, we proposed a humanitarian supply chain case and system dynamics model that works as a social welfare supply chain. In the face of a calamity, operations are ramped up for the sudden-onset conditions. After the initial phase is over, operations are ramped down and again become stable. </jats:p><jats:p> Protagonist: Absent. </jats:p><jats:p> Findings: The study tests the results of four policy measures (a) increasing goodwill, (b) decreasing stringent directive, (c) increasing donor attitude and (d) a combination of all of these measures. These measures are additive in nature, and a humanitarian supply chain can use these policy measures to respond to a sudden disaster. </jats:p><jats:p> Discussions: The case discusses various policy measures taken by the humanitarian supply chain during a sudden disaster. It also explores whether being in the slow-onset quadrant helps tack sudden disasters like earthquakes or terrorist attacks. An organization can start with decreasing the stringent measures in the case of a sudden disaster. Increasing donor attitude and goodwill requires long-term outreach efforts. </jats:p>",

Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) was grown in recirculating hydroponic systems fed with post-anaerobically digested brewery effluent (BE) either subject to pH adjustment (6.5–7.0) or unaltered pH (8.0–8.5). These were compared with cabbages grown in water only and in a inorganic fertiliser nutrient solution (NS). Hydroponic systems fed with pH adjusted BE removed significantly more nitrogen and phosphorus than systems fed with pH unadjusted BE (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The final weight of cabbages from the pH adjusted BE systems were 6.7 times greater than cabbages from the pH unadjusted BE systems, whereas pH adjustment had no influence on cabbage weight in the water-only and NS treatments. Anaerobically digested BE that is not pH adjusted is not a suitable water and nutrient source for the hydroponic production of cabbages. However, pH adjustment of BE renders it more suitable for hydroponic crop production with hydroponic systems decreasing dissolved inorganic nitrogen, ammonium, phosphate and chemical oxygen demand concentrations by 72.8, 31.8, 98.5 and 51.0%, respectively. Hydroponic systems can be used to treat post-anaerobically digested BE to a similar standard obtained by conventional activated sludge treatment system.</jats:p>",

The sample size comprised of 66 staff members. The study used multiple regression analysis to determine the significance of the relationship between the dependent variable and all the independent variables pooled together. Principle component analysis was used to obtain the regression models. Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) sample adequacy and Bartlett’s sphericity tests were used to identify whether the output from the principal component analysis were suitable for regression. The results indicated strategic partnerships ranked first, followed by inventory management, procurement planning, and finally financial resource management in terms of significance influence on supply chain performance. The policy implication is that Universities should embark on training of supply chain players to equip them with relevant knowledge.

For this purpose, solar panels and a cylindrical parabolic collector (CPC) were used to raise basin water temperature. The effect of different components of basin solar still on freshwater mass was also investigated. The aluminum basin has been associated with maximum water desalination among the different materials constituting a basin. The effects of different colors (e.g. black, brown, and red) on the basin, as well as different water depths (5, 10, and 15 mm), were also explored. The highest amount of freshwater in the black aluminum basin at a 5-mm water depth was 2.97 kg/day. ANN modeling was employed to validate the experimental data, indicating good compliance of experimental data with ANN prediction. According to the results of the simulation with varying numbers of neurons (n = 2–25), the highest and lowest agreement between experimental data and ANN prediction data were related to 24 and 10 neurons, respectively. Under optimum conditions, R2 and %AAD error were 0.993 and 2.654, respectively.</jats:p>",

The proposed mli structure consists of cross-connected multilevel cells connected in series with a more optimized number of devices to synthesize a higher number of voltage steps. Each cell in the structure consists of a set of switches and a dc-capacitor. Typically, when several dc-capacitors are used in an inverter, the dc voltages fluctuation occurs due to tolerance between passive element and asymmetric switch losses. A dual-loop control technique has been proposed with level-shifted pulse width modulation pwm to overcome these issues. The proposed methodology balances the dc-voltages using a proportional-integral controller by adjusting the switch duty cycle. The control method helps offset the issue of aggravated fluctuation while preserving the delivered reactive power distributed equally among the dc-capacitors at the same time. A thorough comparison is made between the proposed inverter concerning the number of components and efficiency to demonstrate the effectiveness of previous topologies. Moreover, a simulation model built in simulink and experimental results take from laboratory prototype to confirm the effectiveness of proposed structure and its control technique.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this research are to develop models to solve real-world supplier evaluation problems and validate them with real data on fresh fruits in a supermarket chain. Literature review and results from a survey with managers from purchasing, logistics, and quality departments of a food distribution company are used to establish criteria, to first model the assessment of products and, second, to model supplier evaluation. A multicriteria hybrid approach is proposed, using multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) to assess the quality of products and Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) to complete their evaluation with strategic criteria to be included in the second phase. The results allow companies to rank suppliers by product and classify them according to the main criteria categories, such as product strategy, food safety, economic, logistic, commercial, green image and corporate social responsibility. A sorting approach is also applied to obtain ordered groups of suppliers. Finally, the models proposed can form the core of a decision support system in order to create and monitor the supplier base in food distribution companies, as well as to inform sustainable decision making.</jats:p>"

The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission provides a good opportunity to study this issue. Recently, PSP observations have found that the slow solar wind experiences stronger heating inside 0.24 au. Here for the first time we measure in the slow solar wind the radial gradient of the low-frequency breaks on the magnetic trace power spectra and evaluate the associated energy supply rate. We find that the energy supply rate is consistent with the observed perpendicular heating rate calculated based on the gradient of the magnetic moment. Based on this finding, one could explain why the slow solar wind is strongly heated inside 0.25 au but expands nearly adiabatically outside 0.25 au. This finding supports the concept that the energy added from the energy-containing range is transferred by an energy cascade process to the dissipation range, and then dissipates to heat the slow solar wind. The related issues for further study are discussed.</jats:p>",

In this study, we explored feasible sampling intervals for improved efficiency of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution assessment. We compared NPS pollutant loads calculated with concentration samples collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-hour intervals for the first 24 hours of 13 storm events and investigated the effect of different sampling intervals on load estimation for three watersheds that have different land uses. When compared to load estimates made from concentrations sampled at the reference (1-hour) interval, differences in load estimates were less than 10% in the cases of the 2-hour and 3-hour intervals in the urbanized and agricultural watersheds, respectively, except in the case of suspended solids (SS). When it comes to the total load estimation, up to 3-hour interval sampling provided load estimates with acceptable accuracy, except for SS. Thus, the 3-hour sampling interval was considered feasible for long-term pollutant load assessment, while the 2-hour sampling interval was suggested for SS. Such findings are expected to facilitate NPS pollution assessment by providing information required to improve monitoring efficiency.</jats:p>",

The state of the fuel equipment is characterized by the following parameters: injection pressure and the quality of fuel atomization by nozzles, the capacity of the booster pump, the throughput of filter elements for coarse and fine fuel cleaning, the state of the bypass valve, wear of the plunger pairs and discharge valves, the speed of the camshaft of the fuel pump, uneven delivery fuel by pump elements, fuel consumption, advance angle of fuel supply to engine cylinders. During operation, these parameters change due to the deterioration of the state of the elements of the fuel equipment. The initial state of the parameters of the fuel equipment is restored by making the necessary adjustments and replacing the components unsuitable for further operation. Signs of unsatisfactory operation of the fuel equipment can be: difficult start of the diesel engine, unstable operation, smoke of the exhaust gases, a decrease in power and an increase in specific fuel consumption. Improvement of diesel fuel supply systems should be aimed, first of all, at increasing power and fuel efficiency, as well as decreasing smoke and toxicity of exhaust gases, which can be achieved by: increasing the maximum injection pressure; optimization of injection characteristics and reduction of injection duration; correction of the cyclic fuel supply in accordance with the engine operating mode and external factors. With this in mind, this article presents the results of a study of the unevenness of the fuel supply and its effect on the power and economic performance of the diesel engine.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers need access to strategic or critical materials for the production of a battery system. Recycling of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries may ensure a constant supply of critical materials, thereby closing the material cycle in the context of a circular economy. However, the resource-use per cell and thus its chemistry is constantly changing, due to supply disruption or sharply rising costs of certain raw materials along with higher performance expectations from electric vehicle-batteries. It is vital to further explore the nickel-rich cathodes, as they promise to overcome the resource and cost problems. With this study, we aim to analyze the expected development of dominant cell chemistries of Lithium-Ion Batteries until 2030, followed by an analysis of the raw materials availability. This is accomplished with the help of research studies and additional experts’ survey which defines the scenarios to estimate the battery chemistry evolution and the effect it has on a circular economy. In our results, we will discuss the annual demand for global e-mobility by 2030 and the impact of Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt based cathode chemistries on a sustainable economy. Estimations beyond 2030 are subject to high uncertainty due to the potential market penetration of innovative technologies that are currently under research (e.g. solid-state Lithium-Ion and/or sodium-based batteries).</jats:p>"

Building a new reservoir is a common way to alleviate water shortage, but this comes at a great environmental cost. The South Korean government granted permission to add on a water supply function for the Hwacheon Reservoir, the largest hydropower reservoir in Korea, for the first time in the history. This study develops a new rule curve for the Hwacheon Reservoir to supply water and generate energy at the same time, considering the status of other reservoirs in the Han River basin. The simulation model uses two scenarios, with scenario 1 simulating historic operation and scenario 2 applying the deficit supply method. The new rule curve was formulated based on the results from scenario 2. Time-based and volumetric reliability increased by 33% and 4%, respectively, and resiliency more than doubled compared to the historic reservoir operation. This is the first case study in South Korea that demonstrates how to successfully integrate a water supply function into an existing hydropower reservoir. This study can be applied and extended to other river basins in an attempt to alleviate water shortages by adding new functions to existing reservoirs.</jats:p>"

The analysis of theoretical and experimental research, modern energy technologies for the integration of renewable energy sources into innovative and existing heat supply systems for buildings. The adaptation of modern developments of hybrid systems to buildings operating both in permanent and intermittent operation mode (administrative institutions, educational institutions and other public buildings) has been carried out. The conditions for increasing the efficiency of using heterogeneous renewable energy sources in combined heat supply systems have been established. For the proposed combined heat supply system, a hybrid heat generation is provided using low-potential renewable heat sources in the heat pump cycle and high-potential traditional heat sources in a pellet boiler. A mathematical model of the operating modes of a combined heat supply system using renewable heat sources is proposed, which can be used for numerical modeling of thermal processes in a variable heat supply mode for public buildings. The study of the dynamics of heating the premises when changing the climatic conditions of different regions of Ukraine, including the southern regions, is done. This makes it possible to analyze the efficiency of using alternative energy sources for heat supply and substantiate the conditions for including heat accumulators in the circuit. The research results are relevant because allow to achieve significant energy savings for heat supply of public buildings, characterized by a low level of energy efficiency. The proposed solutions indicate that the combined use of the capabilities of heterogeneous renewable energy sources can be effective only with a hybrid method of heat generation using a heat pump and a pellet boiler, taking into account the operating mode of buildings. As a result of theoretical and experimental studies, it was established: the dynamics of heating and cooling of premises with a high accumulation capacity; the share of replacement of the consumed thermal power in the hybrid use of heat generators. The conditions for the most effective use of heat accumulators in a combined heat supply system have been established. The results obtained make it possible to increase the efficiency of the use of renewable energy sources for public buildings, taking into account the mode of their operation, in which the heat supply system operates in an intermittent mode</jats:p>",

However, the joint use of these tools does not yet seem to be fully exploited, particularly in South-Italy. In this sense, the territories limit of potential eco-sustainable development tools deriving from the agri-food logistics chains, also in terms of territorial and tourism development of entire areas. Drawing upon the experiences of innovative projects oriented to eco-sustainability that have implemented mechanisms of continuous improvement in the agri-food sector, through the achievement of high levels of technological, methodological and organizational innovation, some implications for how to implement territorial development policies guided by sustainability can be found. In this paper, the changes that the agri-food sector has undergone will be discussed and possible scenarios of territorial and tourism development supported by the agri-food logistics chains will be suggested, two macro areas covered by the three pillars of sustainability, environmental, economic and social. </jats:p>"

This paper presents a methodology, which consists of two stages. The first stage consists of calibration of a hydraulic model using a genetic algorithm (GA). A real-life network of one of the hydraulic zones of Nagpur city, India, is considered, which optimizes the settings of a throttled controlled valve at different timings for calibration. In this stage, a detailed case study, GA calibration model, methodology and results of calibrated models are discussed. The second stage consists of identifying optimal sensor locations using a newly developed software tool named ‘S-PLACE GA’ and its efficiency and effectiveness are discussed. It can be used for the dual purpose of routine monitoring of water quality and for early detection of contamination. The optimal locations are obtained considering two objective metrics, ‘Demand Coverage’ and ‘Time-Constrained Detection Likelihood’. These two objectives are combined into a single objective by using weights. Key features, input data required for the software and their applications on (1) BWSN network 1 and result comparison with others and (2) calibrated model of the first stage are discussed. Results showed the effectiveness of S-PLACE GA for practical applications.</jats:p>",

The authors analyzed spatial distribution and functionality of public pipe-borne water. They also examined intra-urban variation in the distribution of public pipe-borne water in the study area. The study used primary data which were obtained through random sampling techniques of 400 households, using structured questionnaire in the twelve political administrative wards of the examined area. Physical enumeration was also adopted to identify the functional and non-functional public pipe-borne water points. Descriptive statistics in the form of frequency table and percentages with chi-square were used to describe residents’ demand and accessibility of public pipe-borne water. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to examine intra-urban variations in the functionality of public pipe-borne water. The results revealed that distribution of public pipe-borne water cut across different localities in the twelve political administrative wards that Ilorin West Local Government consisted of. Although the highest proportion (60.24%) of public pipe-borne water points were observed to be functioning, a significant proportion (39.26%) were not functioning. The highest proportion (95.5%) of the respondents were of the opinion that public pipe-borne water is not regularly available. The findings from Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences (F=2.702, P=0.004) in the functioning of public pipe-borne water infrastructural elements existing in the examined area. The study concludes by suggesting the need for the government to ensure regular public water supply to meet the residents’ daily needs for water consumption and domestic use, which continue to increase every day.</jats:p>"

However, the financial outcomes of the rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are not always assured as economic performance of RWH systems vary greatly under different climatic conditions.This paper investigates reliability, water saving and benefit-cost ratio of an RWH system with different storage tanks and under three distinct climatic conditions (i.e., wet, average and dry year) at four cities in China. It was found that for a standard building (1,600 m2 roof having 560 people), the rainwater supply reliability varies significantly (3.85–20.55%) across four cities. It was found that Guangzhou (South China) always achieves the highest reliability, greatest annual water saving and highest benefit-cost ratio under three distinct climate conditions. By contrast, Beijing (North China) is mostly ranked as having the lowest one. These findings are well in line with the historical annual precipitation in these regions. Also, it was found that across these four regions, it was not possible for a RWH system to achieve a benefit-cost ratio higher than 1.0. These findings indicate that the RWH systems in most regions of China are currently economically unfeasible without government subsidies.</jats:p>",

SCOR model is one of the best models to describe supply chain activities in operations management for research and practice alike. There are radical changes in the structure of supply chains as well as developing technology in today’s information age. The purpose of this paper is to extend the SCOR model with new metrics related to Industry 4.0 and digitalization to understand and evaluate the performance of supply chains. New metrics added to the SCOR model and a novel SCOR 4.0 model is proposed. The novel performance evaluation model is structured as a three-level hierarchical structure to evaluate the supply chain. This problem is handled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. This study uses the hybrid Best worst method and Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method to determine the weights of metrics. SCOR model is adapted to performance evaluation of the supply chain in the globalizing world. The most important metrics on the supply chain performances are determined and classified. Level 1 metrics are evaluated by Best worst method and their inner levels are evaluated by the Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method and the importance weights of each level 2 and level 3 metrics are obtained. A real application for the oil supply chain is presented to show the applicability of the proposed model. It is aimed to show the SCOR 4.0 model can be used by both public and private sectors to improve their supply chain strategies in globalizing world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Forestry faces frequent and severe natural calamities causing high amounts of salvage wood. Especially under mountainous conditions, regional available self-loading truck capacity is often the main limiting factor causing transport capacity bottlenecks. Therefore, innovative logistics strategies are needed to ensure quick transport of high amounts of salvage wood. Consequently, a multi-echelon unimodal transport concept, where timber is synchronously transshipped at a truck terminal with four transshipment lots from self-loading trucks to semitrailers, was modeled by means of a discrete event simulation. The simulation model calculates key performance indicators such as transshipped volumes and costs and support estimations of optimal truck fleet configuration. The results provide cost-optimal truck fleet configurations in terms of the number of self-loading trucks, semitrailers and prime mover trucks for varying transshipment volumes, delivery time to terminal and legal truck payload scenarios. Applying the truck terminal concept considerably decreases the number of self-loading trucks needed to transport the same volume when compared to unimodal wood transport, which is most common under mountainous conditions in Europe. In the majority of delivery time to terminal and terminal transshipment volume scenarios, the number of self-loading trucks was reduced by more than 50%. Increasing the legal gross vehicle weight for timber transport from 44 t up to 50 t reduces the number of self-loading trucks needed by 20% to 38%, depending on the scenario setting. Additionally, less self-loading trucks arriving at the terminal also cuts queuing times and system efficiency increases as transport cost/t is reduced by 6% to 11% depending on the scenario setting. Expanding the truck terminal concept by adding storage capacity as well as varying the number of transshipping lots and also including costs for terminal construction and operations in the economic analyses are promising topics for future studies.</jats:p>"

However, local sheep and goat farmers are facing challenges for getting fair prices for their animals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the market price of lamb and goat meat in the Southeast United States. The surveys were introduced to 15 cities of Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The price for lamb and goat meat was collected for three years (2017–2019). Of the 360 price observations (n = 360) collected from these cities, 290 were for lamb and 70 for goat meat. The price consisted of 27 and 12 different types of lamb and goat meat, respectively, from the selected retail and ethnic stores. Data were analyzed for descriptive statistics. The mean price for lamb ranged from $50.58/kg for rack lamb to $10.98/kg for stew bone. Similarly, the most expensive goat meat type was leg stew ($26.38/kg), followed by the whole goat leg ($24.18/kg), and the regular meat was the least expensive ($10.32/kg). The mean price of lamb and goat meat varied as per the type of meat in each state and city. The majority of stores predominantly sold imported lamb and goat meat from Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, China, and Uruguay. The study revealed that the different types of lamb and goat meatare selling for good prices, thereby indicating a promising market for the domestic lamb and goat meat in the Southeast.</jats:p>",

To effectively manage contingency events like the COVID-19 pandemic and improve operational performance, factors such as information technology (IT), relational competencies, cooperation with supply chain partners and integration of supply chain systems that contribute to cooperation are essential. This study found that IT and relational competencies positively influence the integration of supply chain systems, and relational competencies have a stronger implication on supply chain integration and collaboration. In addition, supply chain collaboration, strengthened by supply chain integration, positively affects contingency management. Finally, contingency management positively influences operational performance. In this study, we adopted partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method in the analysis with 102 surveys collected from business managers. Through the evaluation of determinants of contingency management and supply chain performance, this study widens the theoretical base of supply chain management and provides managers with optimal ways to build a more resilient supply chain system to cope with unexpected incidents. Consequently, with collaboration-based contingency management, companies can solve problems properly and reduce additional loss, which will enhance operational performance and enable sustainable business success.</jats:p>"

Based on a comparative analysis of methodological approaches to the analysis and forecast of professional competencies, the article suggests an approach to measuring quantitative and qualitative parameters of gaps in the labor markets of the region. It is proved that the strongest gaps occur in areas with a high concentration of financial and organizational resources that allow achieving significant economic results in the implementation of promising areas of regional development. Based on a step-by-step grouping of professions that are in demand in the labor markets in areas of accelerated development, according to the criteria \"vacancy period\" and \"intensity coefficient per vacancy\", professional groups with high levels of gaps are distinguished. Quantitative parameters of gaps are assessed based on comparison of lists of professional competencies acquired in the system of professional education and labor functions, in accordance with professional standards. Qualitative parameters of gaps are set based on a survey of employers. The results of testing the proposed method are presented.</jats:p>",

Influenced by the supply side reform and the accelerated urbanization, among other factors, gas consumption in China is increasing rapidly. However, the consumption of natural gas changes significantly from region to region, affected by the mismatch in gas production and consumption locations, as well as the gas import patterns. With the continuous energy restructuring in China, the gas consumption in different sectors is growing at very different paces. Analysis of the current situation, future trend and characteristics of China’s gas industry indicates that it is in the third stage of fast growth. Natural gas will play an even more important role in the future energy structure. With the continuous growth of gas consumption at home, the existing and expected gas deliverability is still faced with the risk of enlarging shortage in the mid-long term. In consideration of such circumstance, it is suggested that top-level design be strengthened on the national strategic level to seek rational, robust and scale development of the China’s gas industry. Internationally, diversified import channels should be sought to dilute supply risks, cooperation with the Asia-Pacific markets should be enhanced, and establishment of an international gas trading centre should be accelerated. Domestically, construction of a national gas interconnection system and a number of gas hubs should be speeded up, to make the gas industry an important component of the national energy network; the gas pricing mechanism should be established and completed as soon as possible to facilitate scientific allocation of profits and costs for gas production, storage and distribution, and to ultimately promote the sustainable and scale development of the whole chain of China’s gas industry.</jats:p>",

The Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) method has been used to quantify the water footprint (WF) of beef products but does not suggest any specific management strategies to decrease the WF of beef cattle (WFB) within and across the beef supply chain. The WFB is primarily influenced by forage and grain production water uses (m3/t), which are directly linked to dry matter (kg/d) and water intake (L/d) and cattle growth (kg/d). Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the alteration of forage quality and above-ground biomass production (t/ha) of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), in addition to published WF estimates for corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production (m3/t) on the daily Texas WFB. A dynamic Texas Beef Water Footprint Model (TXWFB) was developed to predict WFB, using the System Dynamic methodology and equations from the Ruminant Nutrition System (RNS) and Beef Nutrient Requirements (NASEM) models. Results indicated that forage and crop biomass production is a high-leverage solution to offset the daily Texas WFB (%∆ = -55 to 130). The alteration of forage TDN had less of an impact on the Texas WFB (%∆ = -39 to 17). An ANOVA with a Tukey Posthoc test indicated that all WFB scenarios were significantly different (P &amp;lt; 0.05) except for the low versus base TDN under low water use conditions scenario. The variability in the use of green and blue waters for grains indicated that the final WFB, in the feedlot phase, may be lower than the WFB in the cow-calf or stocker stages under certain efficiency conditions. Identification of high and low-leverage solutions may help Texas cattle stakeholders implement systemic strategies that aid in the efforts for sustainable beef water use.</jats:p>",

This research established the detection threshold and operational range of the H2S test, to increase its sensitivity and specificity for E. coli. A total of 20 modifications of the H2S test, and the original test, were assayed against 20 confirmed and pure culture bacteria of faecal and non-faecal origin at varying concentrations. Additionally, some of the H2S test modifications were evaluated against standard methods for drinking-water analysis. Results indicate that using a modified version of the H2S test containing L-cystine and 2-mercaptopyridine, and bile salts or penicillin G, E. coli will produce H2S. In addition, this research reveals which organisms react positively to the original and modified versions of the H2S test. The modified versions of the H2S test can be promoted as a simple screening test for microbial drinking-water safety in low-resource settings.</jats:p>",

Although other fungal species in the literature failed at such a high concentration of fly ash, P. chrysogenum was able to tolerate it even at 10% concentration. The highest bio-removal yield was recorded as 100% at 0.5% fly ash concentration. Maximum bio-sorption yield was 95.27% after 24th hour. The evaluation results of fly ash bio-toxicity by D. magna showed that the no observed effect level (NOEL) was 0.2 mg/L and the low observed effect level (LOEL) was 0.5 mg/L. The element analysis, determined by ED-XRF, clarified that Ca, Si, Fe and S were the common elements in this ash.

Subsequently, many nutrition policies have been implemented to reduce added sugar intake and improve population health, including taxes, education, labelling and environmental interventions. A potential consequence of these policy actions is the substitution of added sugars with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) in a variety of foods and beverages. NNS are used to reduce the energy and sugar content of foods and beverages while maintaining their palatability. Evidence of the toxicological risks of NNS is inconsistent, though concerns have been raised over the potential substitution effects of ultra-processed foods containing NNS for whole foods. This review aimed to provide an overview of current NNS food supply and consumption patterns, assess added sugar-reduction policies and their impact on NNS, and determine the impact of NNS on food choice, energy intake and diet quality. NNS are widely available in a variety of products, though most commonly in carbonated beverages, dairy products, confectionery, table-top sweeteners and fruit drinks. However, the longitudinal trends of different product categories, and differences between geographies and economy-income levels, require further study. Few studies have examined NNS consumption trends globally, though an increase in NNS consumption in beverages has been observed in some regions. Research examining how the increased availability of low-sugar, NNS-containing products affects global dietary patterns is limited, particularly in terms of their potential substitution effects.</jats:p>",

The focus is on the radical international economic changes that have caused supply and demand shocks, which have conditioned the structural nature of the crisis. The negative consequences of the pandemic in different sectors of the world are analyzed and general tendencies related to foreign trade, protectionism, employment, fiscal, monetary and other policies are listed. It describes the anti-crisis economic plan developed by the Georgian government and provides examples related to corporate tax shelters. Finally, the conclusion stresses that the priority of the post-crisis economic plan should be to position the country well after the end of the pandemic, as well as to overcome macroeconomic problems such as current account deficits, public debt, unemployment and poverty, rapid economic growth, competitiveness and etc.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to elucidate the extent to which the interaction between N supply and plant population density alters N distribution in oilseed rape plant (Brassica napus L.) and whether this interaction changes plant investment in leaf area or leaf mass per area. Spring oilseed rape was grown at two rates of N supply (50 and 150 kg N·ha−1) and two plant population densities (50 and 150 plants·m−2). Photosynthesis, leaf area, leaf biomass, and N content of selected leaves were measured at 20% of flowers on main raceme open. The interaction between N supply and plant population density altered leaf N content per area, which is the main determinant of photosynthesis. This interaction also affected leaf mass per area, while N supply determined N content per unit leaf mass. These results suggest that the interaction between N supply and population density affects both nitrogen distribution and leaf mass per area, which could have important implications for light distribution and, therefore, for C assimilation at the plant level.</jats:p>"

The results of calculations and selection of an absorption chiller with an array of solar collectors for an office building planned for construction in Voronezh are presented. The analysis of the efficiency of the heat collectors by the average efficiency showed that for the cold supply of the building taking into account the actual actinometric indicators of the region the use of flat devices was the most appropriate. Vacuum collectors for the solved task under the indicated climatic conditions, despite the generation of a high-potential thermal regime, upon reaching the maximum temperature of the coolant, are characterized by a decrease in efficiency as a result of significant losses to the environment. With justified priority use of flat devices capturing solar radiation, for a deeper extraction of alternative energy, an innovative design of devices of this class is proposed making it possible to increase their efficiency. The use of such devices will reduce their number in the array.</jats:p>",

The demand is projected based on the number of prescriptions, sourced from publicly available sources. The analysis period is 2015–2040. The estimated demand is converted into the number of pharmacists and the sufficiency is evaluated using sufficiency ratio (supply/demand ratio). Sensitivity analyses of the sufficiency ratio were conducted to estimate the effects of changes in parameters such as national exam pass rate, enrollments, attrition rates, the number of prescriptions per pharmacist, and diffusion of newly licensed pharmacists.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The projected supply, in 2025 and 2040, is 1.24 and 1.56 times, respectively, as that in 2015 and the demand is 1.11 and 0.98 times, respectively. In 2015, although the sufficiency ratio in Hokkaido overall is 1.19, the ratios are higher in urban medical areas and lower than 1 in rural medical areas, such as Minamihiyama, Emmon, and Nemuro. By 2040, the sufficiency ratios are greater than 1 for all areas except for Emmon and higher than 2 in some areas. The sensitivity analyses found that the sufficiency ratio was most sensitive to diffusion of newly licensed pharmacists and the number of prescriptions per pharmacist.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Optimal distribution should be considered, as the results reveal a possible shortage in the number of pharmacists in rural medical areas in 2015–2025. Conversely, as the demand is projected to decrease after 2025 with a population decrease, future supply should be determined in order not to cause an oversupply after 2025. Refinements of the projection model should be conducted since the related factors such as the roles of pharmacists will change over time.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

If this were true, implementation of a UBI may not be sustainable. To do this, we will compile empirical evidence from studies over the last few decades on the effects of implementation of a UBI on employment. We apply the PRISMA methodology to better judge their validity, which ensures maximum reliability of the results by avoiding biases and making the work reproducible. Given that the methodologies used in these studies are diverse, they are reviewed to contextualize the results taking into account the possible limitations detected in these methodologies. While many authors have been writing about this issue citing experiences or experiments, the added value of this article is that it performs a systematic review following a widely tested scientific methodology. Over 1200 documents that discuss the UBI/employment relationship have been reviewed. We found a total of 50 empirical cases, of which 18 were selected, and 38 studies with contrasted empirical evidence on this relationship. The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying. These reductions do not reduce the overall supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community.</jats:p>"

Several samples didnt meet the hygienic standard for iron content. Adverse changes in the temporal dynamics of the proportion of samples that didnt meet the hygienic standard for the content of oil products were noted.

The necessity to create and develop such systems is due to the significant energy intensity of the country’s GDP, which is twice as large as the majority of developed countries. Modern multi-level distributed control systems of the centralized heat supply system facilities, which are built according to the object rule, are described in the paper. The article analyses advantages and disadvantages of various options for information management systems. In the process of thermal automatics development based on software and hardware, including modern intelligent sensors and industrial controllers, modern thermal automation systems began to be intensively introduced. The use of standard techniques of cycling poll of all local objects included in the centralized heating systems, without taking into account the dynamic characteristics of the measured parameters, including the pipeline processing of this information, leads to a significant increase in the time of collection, processing, transmission of information and decision-making in a centralized heating systems. The concept of measuring and processing information in centralized heat supply systems is proposed, based on variable polling cycles of parameters of heat supply systems at heat points taking into account their dynamic characteristics with subsequent conveyor processing of information at the top level of automated centralized heating systems.</jats:p>",

Studies of drinking water preparation technology, developed by NSUACE (Sibstrin), Novosibirsk, show that it ensures the drinking water quality that meets regulatory requirements, minimizes the cost of building and operating water treatment plants. The cleaning technology is as follows: the source water is supplied to the source water tank from a water supply source. Next, water is supplied to the electrochemical processing unit by the booster pump, consisting of two electrocoagulators. In the electrocoagulators, the aluminum electrodes slowly dissolve; aluminum hydroxide flakes are formed; sorbing impurities of iron; manganese and other contaminants from the treated water.</jats:p>",

A 1-D hydrodynamic model and a 1-D water quality model were combined with the excessive pollutant flux analysis method to calculate pollution data of the Yagang area. The results showed that upstream pollution was the primary cause of water quality degradation for the Yagang Basin, exceeding the water quality standards. In addition, the pollution problem ranking of the entire basin was as follows: the Yagang area (30.4%) &amp;gt; the Foshan area (23.2%) &amp;gt; the Baini River Basin (13.1%) &amp;gt; the Liuxi River Basin (0.6%). In addition, the rainy season had the greatest influence on pollution concentrations. It was also concluded that if the boundary water quality could meet the inspection requirements (class IV water), and the internal research area sewage collection rate reached 60%, the ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) in the river discharge would reach 35.7%. This would allow the water quality at the Yagang cross-section to reach standard class IV.</jats:p>",

However, this results in a significant increase in the cost of such systems. Therefore, it is justified to use optimization resulting in the minimization of the selected economic indicator taking into account the most important technical constraints. For this reason, this work proposes an algorithm to optimize the structure of a hybrid off-grid power distribution system (with electrochemical energy storage), designed to supply a load with known daily energy demand. The authors recommend genetic algorithm utilization as well as a modified criterion for evaluating the quality of solutions based on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) index. Several technical and economic analyses were presented, including unit costs, power distribution of the wind and solar sections, nominal battery capacity, SSSI index (System Self-Sufficiency Index), etc. The model of the system includes durability of the elements which have a significant impact on the periodic battery replacement. The tests were carried out for two types of loads and two types of electrochemical batteries (NMC—Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide; and PbO2—Lead-Acid Battery), taking into account the forecast of an increased lifetime of NMC type batteries and decreasing their price within five years. The proposed synthesis method of photovoltaic-wind (PV-wind) hybrid off-line systems leads to limiting the energy capacity of electrochemical storages. Based on the analyses, the authors proposed recommended methods to improve (reduce) the value of the criterion index (LCOE) for PV-wind off-grid systems while maintaining the assumed level of power supply reliability.</jats:p>"

It has two levels: the upper level is a linear model in which more aggregated decisions are related to allocating production targets to mills belonging to a cooperative society aiming to meet the potential market demand, as well as managing the inventories over months in annual planning; the lower level is a mixed‐integer model that represents the less aggregated decisions of each mill, such as the milling rhythm, the industrial process selection to produce sugar–alcohol–molasses and energy, purchasing sugarcane from the suppliers on a weekly basis. Robust optimization analysis is performed for product prices and industrial yields to investigate their impacts on the supply chain that could not be inferred through deterministic approaches. One important result was related to the uncertainty in product prices that had a greater impact on the whole supply chain compared to the industrial yield, which affects only the mill itself, particularly increasing the inventory backlog of the mill for not meeting the demand assigned by the cooperative. Cogeneration of energy, and the sale of surplus energy was an important strategy to mitigate the decrease in industrial yield performed in the robust analysis while the change in the product production pattern was a consequence of product price uncertainty. The models can be applied in practice to provide better strategic and tactical planning of mills in cooperatives.</jats:p>",

Further directions for sustainable development of such systems and factors that influence the modes of operation of traction substations and electric networks were identified. Average power and a random component are two criteria that were used to build local systems. The paper presents the real schedules of daily load on the traction substation terminals and solar insolation with determined power distribution changes. The power deviations indicators depending on the time interval and the type of generation were determined. A normal law of distribution of a random component was determined as a result of all calculations. It is possible to determine the shortage or excess of electric power in the local system in a certain area and to plan the direction of its development in the near future by analyzing the nature of the determined average power change.</jats:p>",

Taking the Dujiangyan irrigation area of China as an example, we discuss the idea of establishing and solving the optimal allocation model of water resources. With this aim, a two-dimensional constraint model with highest economic value, minimum water shortage, minimum underground water consumption and necessary living water demand was established. In order to solve this model, we improved a multi-population genetic algorithm, extending the genetic optimization of the algorithm into two dimensions, taking population as the vertical dimension and the individual as the horizontal dimension, and transforming the cross genetic operator to copy the genetic (crossover) operator and the mutation operator to only act on the vertical dimension, so as to optimize the allocation of such discrete objectives of water resources in the irrigation area with a particular model suitable for the region. The distribution results successfully control the water shortage rate of each area at a low level, which saves the exploitation of groundwater to the maximum extent and produces high economic benefits. The improved algorithm proposed in this paper has a kind of strong optimization ability and provides a new solution for the optimization problem with multiple constraints.</jats:p>",

In the present study another of our aims was to investigate whether pretreatment with coagulation combined with post-oxidation (US/O3) can also remove NOM, turbidity and coliform from the same water resources. NOM and turbidity removal were measured by UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and a turbidimeter, respectively. Aluminum sulfate (alum), ferric chloride (FC), and poly aluminum chloride (PACl) were tested as coagulants. The disinfection potential of the US/O3 process was evaluated by measuring coliform counts. The effects of different input variables including ozone dose, power intensity, ultrasound frequency, reaction time, coagulant type, dose of coagulant and coagulant aid were examined on the process performance. Design of experiments (DoE) and surface response methodology (RSM) techniques were employed to optimize the operating parameters. Individual coagulation process with ferric chloride decreased NOM and turbidity up to 33% and 15%, however pre-coagulation with ferric chloride combined with US/O3 decreased NOM and turbidity 75% and 32%, respectively. PACL was the best coagulant in the sole coagulation, but in pre-coagulation combined with US/O3 process, FC exhibited the best performance. Treatment with US/O3 following pre-coagulation decreased the amount of coagulant and coagulant aid needed for the treatment. Pre-coagulation followed by US/O3 improves the NOM, turbidity and coliform removal, and so could be considered as a potential method for removing NOM, turbidity and coliform.</jats:p>",

The complexity of stakeholder networks in some cases implies that the result of the application of the programmes is not efficient enough. This paper aims to explore some of these challenges regarding destinations located in rural areas taking the case study of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). While much of the literature focuses on pinpointing the factors that have a bearing on destination governance, this research attempts to sort the importance of each factor. Structured qualitative questionnaires have been held with rural tourism suppliers (n = 52). The findings highlight that public-private partnerships, coordination on both horizontal and vertical levels, marketing management skills and integration of local activities are shown as priorities according to supply-based stakeholders’ opinions. A consolidation of a neoliberal approach of tourism governance is necessary, in which local governments assume a secondary role, and management is decentralised through community-based public-private partnerships. </jats:p>",

Especially for power supplies of SAR or other pulse power supplies, the transient of load is fast and the output current is high, it is very difficult to guarantee the output voltage in the required range. The ECSS-E_ST-20C has provided a standard for the power quality of power supply for spacecraft. In this paper, a fast-dynamic response control strategy for buck converters is proposed. The proposed strategy does not increase the output capacitance, and increases the dynamic response of the converter. In the proposed strategy, the linear control and non-linear control are combined. The linear control operates in the steady state, while the non-linear control operates in the transit state. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified by simulations and experiments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the multi-channel confluent water supply process, the pressure control of the main pipe is often held back by such problems as non-linearity, hysteresis and parameter uncertainty, its own unique load dynamic changes, channel switching disturbance and other system characteristics caused by the actual working conditions. Moreover, pressure fluctuations in the main pipe will lead to a reduction in the service life of fire-fighting equipment, an increase in the failure rate, and even an interruption of the fire-fighting water supply. Therefore, a master and auxiliary control strategy is proposed to stabilize the pressure change in the process of multi-channel concentrated water supply switching, by using variable universe fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) control as the main controller on the main pipe and traditional PID control as the subsidiary controller on the channel. The control strategy is verified by the co-simulation platforms of LabVIEW and AMESim. Simulation results show that the variable universe fuzzy PID control and the master and auxiliary compound control based on the variable universe fuzzy PID control have advantages in step response, tracking response and anti-interference, respectively. The parameters obtained in the co-simulation are used in the experimental system. The experimental results show that the maximum deviation rate of main pipe pressure can be reduced by about 10% compared with other control methods under different loads. In conclusion, the proposed control strategy has strong anti-interference ability, fast dynamic response speed, high stability and good peak shaving effect.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the chemical industry, shortened product life cycles and greater differentiation of customer demand increase challenges to efficiently meet specific customer requirements. Thus, production systems with high flexibility are required. One innovative production concept that meets this requirement is decentralized, small-scale modular production which offers significantly more flexibility in the tactical configuration of the production network. Corresponding production plants are assembled from standardized apparatus modules in transportation containers, hereby enabling a fast relocation of modular plants and adjustments of the production process. Therefore, modular plants can be operated close to customers or suppliers, which supports local sourcing strategies and a reduction in delivery costs. In this paper, we analyze the advantages of these modular production systems for a case from the specialty chemicals industry. Respective advantages arise especially from a technically flexible design of parallel process lines, autonomous production and local sourcing. In order to evaluate economic efficiency and network configuration of modular production networks, an efficient mathematical formulation for the optimization is proposed. This formulation includes a new way to model relocations of modules. We apply this model to a case based on real data from the chemical industry. As a result of this application we come to three technical and managerial conclusions. Firstly, technical designs with parallel process lines improve flexibility and efficiency compared to mono processes. Secondly, autonomous production increases economic efficiency in contrast to staffed production and finally, local sourcing offers significant cost reduction potential compared to central sourcing.</jats:p>",

The river Mahi is flowing through the Mahi sub-basin, which is a tributary to the Ganga river. Understanding and analyzing the past and present water supply and demand scenarios and prediction of future scenarios are indispensable for this area. In the WEAP model development phase, two scenarios are considered: past scenario (2004-2013), present and future scenarios (2016-2021) together. The water supply nodes used are Mahi river, groundwater and canals from Gandak river. The results from the trend of supply and demand shows that the sub-basin is water deficit for most part of year except during July to September. The water deficit is also observed during Rabi season when there is no rainfall or availability of surface water is nil for the crops, especially wheat. This results in more and more usage of groundwater and hence leads to groundwater depletion. By analyzing the results of the WEAP Model for the present and future scenario, a depletion in groundwater storage at a faster rate is observed with the existing climatic conditions and increased population, livestock and industry.</jats:p>",

Extant research has moved beyond the questions of whether and which suppliers should be assessed. Current research is already focussing on how to share and standardise such assessment data. Despite mounting general research on SSCM, we identified that specific tools such as self-assessment questionnaires have not been empirically analysed in SSCM literature. Thus, this paper addresses the research questions of what differences there are among supplier self-assessment questionnaires and how supplier responses to such questionnaires might be influenced. Our research involves an abductive multiple-case study design and an analysis of over 25,000 responses from globally dispersed suppliers to two types of supplier sustainability self-assessment questionnaires administered and requested by a global automotive focal company.</jats:p><jats:p>Although the two questionnaires covered similar areas of sustainability practices and were administered to suppliers of the same focal company, the suppliers’ responses demonstrated various observable differences in average sustainability scores.</jats:p><jats:p>Social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue were identified as issues confronting such questionnaires. We find that questionnaire design, how the questionnaire is embedded in the focal company’s processes and institutional settings are factors that potentially influence suppliers’ responses and could counteract social desirability bias and supplier assessment fatigue. Based on these findings we make suggestions for improving these SSCM tools and provide recommendations for further research.</jats:p>",

In this paper, as an algorithm for solving the problem, we propose the use of a wellknown method of rational planning of the experiment, which allows us to obtain a mathematical model of the multi-factor process under study. In the process of implementing this algorithm, based on a priori information, the object of research was selected, its factors and the main levels of change of these factors were established. Next, a two-factor experiment plan was implemented using a numeric array from the wellknown CoroKey catalog by SANDVIK Coromant. At the next step, the experimental data was processed using the existing method and on the basis of this information, private graphical dependencies of the studied parameter on the levels of factors were constructed. At the final stage, using the types of graphical dependencies, the regression equation of the investigated value of the cutting tool feed from two independent factors at three levels of each of them was formulated. To implement this algorithm, the least squares method was used, and the system of normal equations obtained on its basis. The proposed algorithm for obtaining the regression equation for solving problems in the field of machining production can be effectively used in computer-aided design systems for selecting technological parameters in the modes of processing parts with a blade tool, using numerical data from technological directories and catalogs of cutting tool manufacturers.</jats:p>",

This study aims to conduct an assessment of Supply Chain Management at MS Company and suggested BPMN with adjusted business processes. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) approach is useful for describing complex business process modelling in detail but still easy to understand. Thus, it can minimize errors in implementing business processes. We used the study case approach to conduct this research by studying several journals related to SCM. A discussion was then held to improve the four main processes associated with SCM, and the improvement was written by using BPMN. This study explains that BPMN can be used to give detail and minimize errors so that the modified business process modelling is easy to understand and facilitates communication between business process designers and business process executors. Some MS company improvement in its SCM includes production scheduling, goods procurement, production implementation, and warehouse management. It is suggested that further observation and examination of the improved SCM is needed to prove the new SCM's success in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

There are a number of studies that have directly linked supply chain quality management practices in the manufacturing sector and other service firms to organizational performance. However, minimal research has been done to examine the role of corporate culture in the relationship. Moreover, there is need to empirically confirm effect of corporate culture in private hospitals in Kenya where provision of quality and affordable health care remains a challenge. Corporate culture fit between organizations serves as a thread that ties firms together. The study was conducted in order examine the effect of organizational culture on the relationship between supply chain quality management practices adoption and performance of private hospitals in Kenya. Positivist research orientation and descriptive cross-sectional research design guided the research process. Raw data was collected from management staff tasked with supply chain decision making responsibility in the hospitals. A response rate of 70.51% was realized. Normality, collinearity, homoscedasticity and autocorrelation constituted model diagnosis. Hypothesis was tested using model fit indices and significance of path coefficient. The findings indicate that corporate culture has significant positive effect on the relationship. The study concluded that right corporate culture among supply chain partners both internally and externally serves as catalyst while implementing SCQM practices to bring about improved performance. It is therefore recommended that for private hospitals to benefit more from improved performance upon adopting SCQM practices, they must ensure homogeneity of cultural configurations internally and externally. In addition, the study provides future researchers with a useful conceptual and methodological reference that can be used in the pursuit of further studies particularly in the area of both supply chain and quality management with specific reference to the corporate culture as a moderating variable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Shade is a mechanism to reduce heat load providing cattle with an environment supportive of their welfare needs. Although heat stress has been extensively reviewed, researched, and addressed in dairy production systems, it has not been investigated in the same manner in the beef cattle supply chain. Like all animals, beef cattle are susceptible to heat stress if they are unable to dissipate heat during times of elevated ambient temperatures. There are many factors that impact heat stress susceptibility in beef cattle throughout the different supply chain sectors, many of which relate to the production system, that is, availability of shade, microclimate of environment, and nutrition management. The results from studies evaluating the effects of shade on production and welfare are difficult to compare due to variation in structural design, construction materials used, height, shape, and area of shade provided. Additionally, depending on operation location, shade may or may not be beneficial during all times of the year, which can influence the decision to make shade a permanent part of management systems. Shade has been shown to lessen the physiologic response of cattle to heat stress. Shaded cattle exhibit lower respiration rates, body temperatures, and panting scores compared with unshaded cattle in weather that increases the risk of heat stress. Results from studies investigating the provision of shade indicate that cattle seek shade in hot weather. The impact of shade on behavioral patterns is inconsistent in the current body of research, with some studies indicating that shade provision impacts behavior and other studies reporting no difference between shaded and unshaded groups. Analysis of performance and carcass characteristics across feedlot studies demonstrated that shaded cattle had increased ADG, improved feed efficiency, HCW, and dressing percentage when compared with cattle without shade. Despite the documented benefits of shade, current industry statistics, although severely limited in scope, indicate low shade implementation rates in feedlots and data in other supply chain sectors do not exist. Industry guidelines and third-party on-farm certification programs articulate the critical need for protection from extreme weather but are not consistent in providing specific recommendations and requirements. Future efforts should include: updated economic analyses of cost vs. benefit of shade implementation, exploration of producer perspectives and needs relative to shade, consideration of shade impacts in the cow–calf and slaughter plant segments of the supply chain, and integration of indicators of affective (mental) state and preference in research studies to enhance the holistic assessment of cattle welfare.</jats:p>",

A high‐resistance fault along a high‐surety power supply feeder results in a low fault current, making the conventional high‐surety power supply protection strategy ineffective. To address this problem, this paper develops a directional fault protection strategy for high‐resistance fault detection and faulty feeder identification. Using the intelligent electronic device, the feeder current is sampled and normalised. Then, the fault‐imposed component of the current signal is calculated. This component is added to the input of the forced Helmholtz oscillator to increase the sensitivity of the proposed protection scheme for the detection of high‐resistance faults. The output of the forced Helmholtz oscillator equation is adopted as the fault detection criterion because it is infinity for reverse faults while it is lower than 1 for forward faults, facilitating the fault detection. The developed strategy is local and can detect and classify both pole‐to‐ground and pole‐to‐pole high‐resistance faults. Also, it is effective for both unidirectional and bidirectional converters. The merits of the proposed protection strategy are demonstrated through several fault scenarios using a ±375 V high‐surety power supply system.</jats:p>",

The RFI is a commonly-used measure of feed efficiency in beef cattle. The first experiment determined differences in major ruminal bacteria and ruminal epithelium gene and protein expression between the most-efficient (M-eff) and the least-efficient (L-eff) finishing beef cattle. Results indicated that superior feed efficiency is associated with differences in bacterial species, transcriptional adaptations, and protein turnover in ruminal epithelium that might enhance energy transport and utilization. For example, M-eff group had enriched cellulose-degrading and volatile fatty acids (VFA) producing bacteria. Furthermore, M-eff cattle upregulated genes related to VFA absorption and ketogenesis in ruminal epithelium, underscoring greater energy production in M-eff cattle. Also, M-eff group had greater protein synthesis coupled with lower protein degradation in ruminal epithelium that allow efficient harvest of nutrients from less feed digested. These changes in the rumen might have helped M-eff cattle maintain similar level of growth performance while consuming less dry matter (DMI). Studies in non-ruminants have underscored a central role for maternal nutrition on offspring hindgut microbiome development. Whether this phenomenon exists in cattle is largely unknown. The objective of the second experiment was to evaluate the impact of maternal methionine supply during late-pregnancy in dairy cows on hindgut microbiome and metabolome in neonatal calves. To achieve this, Holstein heifer calves born to cows receiving either a control (CON) diet or CON plus rumen-protected methionine (MET) during the last 28 d of pregnancy were used. Hindgut microbiome was evaluated with 16s rRNA gene sequencing, whereas hindgut metabolites were measured using an untargeted LC-MS approach. Hindgut microbiome and metabolome profiles in MET heifers indicated greater capacity for the production of endogenous antibiotics and enhanced hindgut functionality and health. Those alterations could limit pathogen colonization in the hindgut while providing essential nutrients to neonatal calves at the same level of DMI. Together, such responses contribute to the ability of MET heifers to achieve better nutrient utilization to support greater growth rates during the preweaning period. These studies highlight that gut microbiome contributes, at least in part, to better feed efficiency and fetal programming in beef and dairy cattle.</jats:p>",

Projects fail because of technical caveats, inability to meet business needs, and poor management of implementation. Implementation of blockchain technologies across a network of supply chain partners is more complex than internally focused technologies. It is necessary for partner firms to implement, contribute, and share information, and employees to actively use the capabilities of the technology to realize potential. Blockchain technologies can substitute for traditional interfirm intermediaries acting as an unbiased software agent embedded in the supply chain network. Understanding managers’ perceptions of and willingness to use blockchain technologies is crucial for successful implementation. Integrating design theory with classic diffusion processes, we conducted a scenario‐based role‐playing experiment with industry professionals to examine managers’ perceptions of blockchain technologies and willingness to use. We find that trustworthiness with regard to competence and perceived distributive justice is the focal drivers of managers’ willingness to use the technology. Additionally, both risk and interactional justice are not drivers of willingness to use blockchain technology despite significant claims to that effect. We provide implications for how managers can leverage these drivers to influence supply chain partners’ willingness to use the technology.</jats:p>",

The presence of ammonium in water is mainly originated from agricultural activities, domestic sewage and industrial effluent. This study evaluates the performance of two commercial thin film composite (TFC) membranes, i.e., NF270 and XLE from FilmTec™ for ammonium removal using synthetic wastewater and domestic sewage. The filtration experiment was conducted at different feed ammonium concentrations, humic acid concentrations, pHs and pressure. Results showed that the membrane rejection against ammonium increased dramatically with increasing ammonium concentration. However, the membrane flux was slightly compromised at higher ammonium concentration. With respect to pH, highest ammonium removal rate was able to be achieved at an optimum pH of 10. Besides, the permeation flux increased gradually with increasing feed pressure. From the results, the XLE membrane outperformed the NF270 membrane in terms of ammonium rejection. The retentate of XLE membrane filtration process was found to be useful as liquid fertiliser for plant growth. The results indicated that the TFC membrane process is not only able to produce permeate with an ammonium concentration below the acceptable limit of 10 mg/L but also able to produce retentate with enriched ammonium for plant growth.</jats:p>",

In this V/V transformer-based connection, the two-phase traction voltage is converted into the three-phase voltage. This approach can offer a common low voltage AC bus, which is more convenient for more access to three-phase PV converters. Based on this V/V transformer-based connection, an individual phase current control strategy with the hybrid current reference is fully designed. In this control strategy, the current reference, containing two parts, is generated. One is the asymmetrical part for powering the single-phase locomotive load and mitigating the negative sequence current. The other is the symmetrical part for feeding the surplus power back to the utility grid. Then, each phase current replaces the dual-sequence current to be controlled to track the corresponding phase current reference. Consequently, PV converters can flexibly inject the symmetrical and asymmetrical currents without the dual-sequence extraction for a simpler implementation. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed connection and control strategy is validated by the simulation studies.</jats:p>"

The paper also describes the relevant strategies that were applied to ensure equivalences between the two models representing a supply chain. The model simplification not only reduces its size and computer time for execution but allows for the most relevant time reduction associated with preparing the data input to feed into the model, as well as in analyzing the results. Some distribution network growth options were evaluated by using both models with equivalent objective functions. Small model results give enough information for decision‐making support. The use of new facilities and economic benefits are similar to those obtained with the complex model. The main issues to take care of are bottleneck identification and commodities differentiation. If a binding constraint is removed in the small model, similar results are seen in the complex model when a specific bottleneck is improved. This is the first time that a practical model is used to evaluate multiple scenarios of the complex automotive fuel distribution network in Mexico.</jats:p>",

This displacement can affect the hydraulic function of filters by mixing or segregating media grains, and the function of biofilters through displacement of active biomass and coatings from proper depths. This study quantifies grain displacement in a pilot-scale filter using tracer grains of colored sand, glass beads, anthracite and garnet to determine the effect of grain size, density and shape on grain displacement. Statistical moments are used to describe the depth distributions resulting from displacement during backwashing. Results show that significant grain displacement occurs during backwash consisting of air scour, air-and-water wash and sub-fluidization water-only wash. Here, displacement is largely independent of grain size, density and shape. When fluidization backwash is used, greater displacement and more dependence on grain characteristics is seen. A variety of grain movement phenomena can be observed during the backwashing steps, indicating that grain movement and therefore the resulting displacement is highly inhomogeneous in four dimensions. These results have direct practical implications for the design of rapid sand filters and the optimization of backwashing procedures, while suggesting that the current widespread backwashing practice used in the case study country (Denmark) should be abandoned.</jats:p>",

Lockdown slowed down the fresh vegetables supply in the long distance distribution chains. In addition, the total confinement occurred in many countries left the people not only distressed, but also in the need to divert daily spare time to a new home gardening vitalization. During the pandemic, sales in local and street markets declined dramatically, while most purchases became concentrated in supermarkets. This fact has increased the risk of crowdedness and thus contamination or regulated entrances in the supermarkets, or left communities in small towns with limited access to food supply due to the lack of big grocery stores. Gardening can increase opportunities for local and fresh food availability. Scaling-up local food production becomes important to increase resilience of communities. The pandemic may represent an important opportunity to enhance a new era of gardening with modern technology along with traditional systems.</jats:p>"

To achieve the aims, a methodological framework is proposed through a literature review, expert inputs, and a decision-aid tool, namely the grey-based digraph-matrix method. A total of 10 types of negative impacts and 22 strategic measures to tackle the impacts were identified based on the literature review and expert inputs. Then, the grey-based digraph-matrix was applied for modeling the strategic measures based on their influence to deal with the impacts. Findings reveal that the strategies “manufacturing flexibility”, “diversify the source of supply”, and “develop backup suppliers” have significant positive consequences for managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the RMG supply chain. The findings help industrial managers recover from supply chain disruptions by identifying and classifying the impacts and strategies required to manage the major supply chain disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a theoretical contribution, this study is one of few initial attempts to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and the strategies to deal with the impacts in the supply chain context.</jats:p>"

Feed demands of beef and other livestock (i.e., dairy cattle, chickens, pigs, sheep, bison, horses, turkeys and other poultry) were estimated using county-level inventories from Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development and Statistics Canada, and aggregated to 7 land-use regions: Lower Athabasca, Upper Athabasca, Lower Peace, Upper Peace, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer and South Saskatchewan. Feed requirements were sourced from literature and expert opinion pertinent to Canadian context, and feed demand estimated using annualized feeding days and dry matter (DM) intake. Feed available for beef production was estimated from crop yields minus other livestock feed use. Average feed demand for beef production across Alberta was (tons of DM) 2.71 M, 0.68 M, 2.21 M, and 1.95 M for barley and wheat grain, grass hay, and grass-legume hay, respectively. North Saskatchewan, Red Deer and South Saskatchewan accounted for 90% of the total demand for barley and wheat grain and 81% of grass hay and grass-legume hay. South Saskatchewan had the largest feed deficit and required feed movement in all years. Across years, barley grain deficits ranged from -94% to -31%, grass hay deficit from -142% to a surplus of 1.6% and grass-legume hay deficits from -167% to -15%. Unmet deficits at provincial level occurred for barley grain (2006), grass hay (2001) and grass-legume hay (2001, 2006). Wheat was surplus in all years, ranging from 17% to 90%. Feed movement is critical to support beef production in Alberta, and is highly variable depending on crop yield in different regions. This analysis enables the beef industry to assess provincial feed sourcing and environmental footprints.</jats:p>",

The study utilized a three‐level framework adapted from the CE literature with company (micro), supply chain (meso) and society (macro) levels. This multiple‐case study in the textile industry included two types of companies operating in the CE: companies founded on the sustainable principles of a CE (natives) and companies transitioning to a CE from the linear economy (adopters). The findings show that the adopters emphasized long‐term economic sustainability on a company level and implemented CE elements to varying degrees on all three levels. The natives pursued business decisions from environmental and social sustainability standpoints, and the three levels were integral in their systemic approach to a CE. The study highlights two key claims: established operational structures and economic volition hindered adopters in their systemic CE implementation, and an integral part of the CBM for natives was a proactive approach towards the society level.</jats:p>",

However, there is a critical need to review how real-time control contributes to sustainable water management. This review provides a systematic review of the role of real-time control towards creating a sustainable wastewater system. This review identifies the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainability that can be achieved using automation and control systems, considering individual systems and different scales of integration. Results obtained from a systematic literature review show that previous research on automation and control related to sustainability in the water sector focuses on addressing economic issues (mainly operational cost reduction) and improving the quality of the water environment, while the social pillar of sustainability is not addressed to a significant degree. Integrated control is identified as a promising approach to address the three pillars of sustainability. Future research on automaton and real-time control in the water and wastewater system needs to explicitly demonstrate the contribution of control strategies towards the attributes of sustainability. To this end, regulatory bodies should focus on creating an overarching sustainability framework with indicators of sustainability clearly defined. Further, addressing three pillars of sustainability requires an integrated approach at a catchment scale where upstream and downstream processes are considered.</jats:p>",

Much more coordination, integration, and management of global supply chains will be needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemics. This article describes the pressing need to revisit the governance and resilience of the supply chains that amplified the crisis at pandemic scale. We propose a model that profiles critical stockpiles and improves production efficiency through new technologies such as advanced analytics and blockchain. A new governance system that supports intervention by public-health authorities during critical emergencies is central to our recommendation, both in the face of the current crisis and to be better prepared for potential future crises. These reinforcements offer the potential to minimize the compromise of our healthcare workers and health systems due to infection exposure and build capacity toward preparedness and action for a future outbreak.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the article is to assess the role of the modern dairy subcomplex of Ukraine in solving food supply and its importance for the national economy. Research methods. Based on the dialectical method of cognition and a systematic approach to the analysis of the role and significance of the dairy subcomplex, the following methods were used: analysis and synthesis - when assessing the dairy subcomplex in the context of its components and with the subsequent combination of these components into a system; empirical - in the complex assessment of the current state of the research object; abstract-logical - to summarize scientific research and substantiate conclusions; comparative assessment - when comparing the dairy subcomplex of Ukraine and the world; monographic - for the analysis of scientific achievements of Ukrainian and foreign scientists; graphic - illustrative representation of the calculation results. Research results. The concept of \"dairy subcomplex\" is generalized and a scheme of its production and economic relations is proposed. The advantages of the dairy subcomplex from the standpoint of milk producers and the dairy industry are characterized. The values of dairy products in Ukrainian food rations have been determined and factors influencing changes in consumption have been established. The main positions of the impact of the dairy subcomplex on the functioning of the national economy are highlighted. Scientific novelty. On the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the importance of milk and dairy products for Ukrainian consumers and the role of the dairy subcomplex for the national economy of Ukraine, the objective necessity and obvious priority of the industry among other sectors has been proved, which requires appropriate reflection in the development of state strategies for ensuring food security. Practical significance. The main provisions and conclusions are presented aimed at the factual confirmation of the important role of the dairy subcomplex in the formation of food security of the country and for strengthening the national economy, which can be used by government bodies in substantiating development strategies for the subcomplex in terms of characterizing its value and, accordingly, giving priority with the priority introduction of effective measures public policy. The work may be of interest to the participants of the dairy subcomplex, consumers and public organizations. Tabl.: 2. Figs.: 4. Refs.: 28.</jats:p>",

This pattern of daily water consumption is called the water demand profile. The initiatives to create these profiles are to improve hydraulic performance and to build energy conservation strategies for designed networks in Dubai. Therefore, the aim of the work presented here was to develop and analyze a domestic consumption profile for selected developments with socio-demographic factors including weekday/weekend variation, population, income, fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the outbreak of COVID-19. Data from more than 7000 smart meters were collected while water meters of more than 350 residential flats were examined manually. Water demand profiles generated from the data showed weekdays have more predictable peaks (morning 6–8 am and evening 5–7 pm) than weekends. During Ramadan, peak hours shifted to 7–10 am followed by 3–4 pm during workdays while peaks for low-income areas were higher due to a stricter working routine. The COVID-19 crisis has led to significant rise in observed consumption, with over a 30% increase during the month of Ramadan. The observed results, if compared with further end-use studies on more factors affecting demand profiles, can help in generating both cost and energy efficient networks.</jats:p>",

We determine the optimal inflow depending on the producer's risk preferences. The resulting output is intended to optimally match the stochastic demand for the given risk criteria. We use uncertainty quantification for an adaptation to different levels of risk aversion. More precisely, we use two types of chance constraints to formulate the requirement of demand satisfaction at a prescribed probability level. In a numerical analysis, we analyze the chance constrained optimization problem for the Telegrapher's equation and a real‐world coupled gas‐to‐power network.</jats:p>",

Such experiments were carried out to simulate the erosion process of small-sized sediment particles in a rainwater pipeline during rainfall. The mathematical models were established via quadratic fitting to calculate the critical velocity of migration. Results showed that small particles had powerful cohesive force, and aggregates had strong erosion resistance. So, for the small-sized particles (in the range of 0.33–0.83 mm), the smaller the particle size, the larger the critical velocity. When the pipe wall roughness was large, the ‘starting’ particle resistance was high. A large flow dynamic was needed to overcome such resistance. Thus, the critical velocity was great. The critical velocity was also large when the sediment thickness was large. The difference rate between the critical velocity calculated by mathematical models and the measured value was within the range of −3.60% to 5.33% and had good consistency. Under the research conditions, the critical velocity ranges of the four commonly used pipes; namely, plexiglass, steel/PVC, galvanized/clay, and cast iron pipes, were calculated.</jats:p>",

In the process of designing a waste heat recovery system, few researchers have considered the relationship between the design power of the heat pump and the actual heating load of the heating network. Based on the heating load characteristics, this paper puts forward a design idea which uses an absorption heat pump to recover waste heat from a steam turbine exhaust for heating supply. The operation mode of the system for different design powers of the heat pump was stated. An economic analysis model of the waste heat recovery system was proposed, and the optimal design power of the heat pump could be obtained. For a specific unit, the corresponding waste heat recovery system was designed, and various factors affecting the economy of the system were discussed and analyzed in detail.</jats:p>"

Based on the bounded rationality, we used dynamics theory to analyze the dynamic service and pricing decisions of the manufacturer and the third-party collector in the process of collecting waste products. The results showed that adjustment speeds of pricing and service decisions have great effect on the stability of recycling market, and the recycling market is most sensitive to the change of third-party collectors’ service decision. When the recycling market is in chaos, it has a strong initial value sensitivity. In addition, we found that increase of consumers’ service sensitivity and service cost parameter had negative effect on stability of the recycling market; there is a reverse relationship between price adjustment parameters and the service adjustment parameter. With the increase of service adjustment parameter, the bifurcation point of the system will appear more quickly. Finally, chaotic market can be controlled by the feedback control method.</jats:p>"

We develop a game theoretic model to study the impact of these socially responsible practices in investment and pricing decisions. We model this as a Stackelberg game and study the impacts of the power structure in the outcomes. Our work was motivated by the business model of socially responsible Mexican company Fractal Café. We provide closed form expressions for the optimal wholesale and retail prices, and numerically study the effect of the model parameters. We show that equity concerns drive a redistribution of the profit towards an equitable outcome, but they do not have the same effect on the investment decisions. Additionally, we show that equity concerns may reverse the advantage of the game leader and transfer utility to the follower. We identify the settings under which the introduction of socially responsible practices increases the total supply chain profit by reducing the double marginalization effect. We find that capacity constraints result in a higher retail price, achieved by increasing the leader’s margin. Finally, we show that a two-part tariff contract with equity concerns is only convenient for the game follower when the leader has a high concern for advantageous inequity.</jats:p>",

Emphasis in this work has been on how “intangible” factors such as implicit or explicit constraints within organisations, inadequate communication between actors in the supply chain, overly conservative norms or lack of information, hinder the realisation of the current carbon mitigation potential. Although this work draw primarily from experiences in Sweden and other developed economies we believe the focus on innovations in the policy arena and efforts to develop new ways of co-operating, coordinating and sharing information between actors (SDG17) and on practices and processes that could enable more sustainable resource use in infrastructure construction may be of relevance also elsewhere. Not the least, since there are still many regions of the world where much of the infrastructure to provide basic services remains to be built (SDG6-7, SDG9, SDG11) a challenge that must be handled in parallel with efforts to reduce/erase the climate impact from infrastructure construction (in line with the Paris Agreement and SDG13).</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to check the accuracy of two analytical methods for monitoring the concentration of fluoride in the public water supply of a Brazilian city. The STROBE checklist was used to aid the conduction of this study and report the results. It was an analytical, observational, and prospective study using the water supply of Uberlândia, MG, Brazil. We collected 126 water samples at 21 sites for six consecutive months and analyzed them using the fluoride ion selective electrode (F-ISE) method and colorimetry with SPADNS. The statistical analysis was performed descriptively and then the ANOVA and Student t-test for paired samples were applied. The results showed that the F-ISE method had a lower coefficient of variation (12.3%) than the SPADNS method (57.4%). There was no significant variation of the fluoride concentration in the water through the supply network evaluated either by F-ISE as SPADNS. We concluded that the electrometric method should be the first choice for use by laboratories that monitor fluoride concentration in the public supply water.</jats:p>"

Thus, this article aims to identify the gaps present in maturity models, present an integrator theoretical model that considers the characteristic elements of the models present in the literature and affects the level of maturity in sustainability. The construction of the integrator theoretical model was based on the following stages: research questions; theoretical framework on Supply Chain Management; sustainability and concept of maturity model; maturity models and performance measurement systems; interpretation/analysis of research; and construction of the integrator theoretical model. The literature review was carried out in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The main conclusions: maturity models focus on only one aspect or are excessively broad and do not include in detail the elements necessary to measure the level of maturity in sustainability. The proposed model aims to mitigate these gaps with the addition of the cross-sectional dimension, which offers an integrated and holistic view in relation to the other dimensions.</jats:p>"

Paying for milk solids content is a way of trying to create incentives for farms to invest in improving the solids content. However, little is known about the effects of this type of payment on the dairy supply chain. The paper proposes a microeconomic model to analyze the effects of paying for milk solids content on the performance of farms, dairy processors and consumer welfare. Based on the model, we find that this mechanism improves the yield of milk in producing dairy products and benefits farms, processor and consumers simultaneously. Extensions demonstrate the robustness of results and provide a generalized model and conditions for which these results are valid.</jats:p>",

In early life, equal amounts of fat and carbohydrate are predicted to improve survival. However, as we age, reducing fat in exchange for carbohydrates is associated with the lowest rates of mortality. Our results accord with published experimental and epidemiological data and can help define the mechanisms by which food supply and intake affect public health and demographic processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The market of gluten-free (GF) foods has been expanding in recent years. GF foods are consumed not only by those with medical predispositions for avoiding gluten, but also by a specific segment of consumers, searching for “healthier” food choices. For these, such practices can present a serious limitation in the variability of food choices. Considering that GF foods are commonly perceived as healthier alternatives, there is a lack of knowledge on the nutritional profile and content of specific nutrients of GF-labelled foods compared to general food supply. A comparison of nutritional composition of GF/non-GF packed foods in the Slovenian food supply was conducted. The nutrient profiling scoring criterion (NPSC) and content of specific nutrients/energy was compared between GF-labelled and regular foods. The highest proportion of GF-labelled products were found in food categories, which typically do not contain gluten (Cheese imitates, Milk imitates, Yoghurt imitates, Canned fish and seafood and Processed meat). Significant differences in the nutrient profile between GF-labelled and regular products were found in Cakes, muffins and pastry, Crisps and snacks, Desserts and Milk imitates. GF-labelled foods often had lower protein and sugar content. Energy value was comparable in most categories and no significant differences in salt content were found, compared to non-GF products. In conclusion, GF-labelled foods will unlikely bring health benefits to those who are not medically required to follow GF diet. Public health initiatives should aim towards promotion of consuming non-processed foods and provision of reliable information about who is required to consume GF foods.</jats:p>"

Causal inference relies on a social security reform in Israel that shifted payments from husbands to their (nonworking) wives, thereby substantially reducing the implied tax on the husband's employment while keeping overall household wealth constant. Using administrative social security data, we estimate extensive-margin labor supply elasticities with respect to the average net-of-tax rate of about 0.43 for men over 65. Using the reform to instrument for employment, we find that working an additional full year at old age decreases longevity. This mortality effect occurs after age 75 and is driven by workers holding blue-collar jobs. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the reform on earnings. The results imply a small value for an additional year of life, suggesting that workers underestimate the health cost of employment at older ages. (JEL: J10, J26, J22, H31)</jats:p>",

Therefore, backup systems such as diesel generators are used. Another alternative is the adoption of a microgrid with batteries and photovoltaic generation to supply substation auxiliary services during a contingency. Nevertheless, high battery costs and the intermittence of photovoltaic generation requires a careful analysis so the microgrid capacity is defined in a compromise between the investment and the unavailability reduction of auxiliary services. This paper proposes a method for the capacity sizing of a microgrid with batteries, photovoltaic generation, and bidirectional inverters to supply auxiliary services in substations under a contingency. A set of alternatives is assessed through exhaustive search and Monte Carlo simulations to cater for uncertainties of contingencies and variation of solar irradiation. An unavailability index is proposed to measure the contribution of the integrated hybrid microgrid to reduce the time that the substation is not in operation. Simulations carried out showed that the proposed method identifies the microgrid capacity with the lowest investment that satisfies a goal for the unavailability of the substation service.</jats:p>"

The stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 was greatest at 50% light and smallest at 100%. Photosynthesis, maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and light-saturated rate of electron transport (Jmax) all decreased with decreasing light. Elevated CO2 significantly reduced Vcmax across all light treatments and both species in mid-growing season. However, the effect of elevated CO2 became insignificant at 30% light later in the growing season, with the response being greater in black spruce than in white spruce. Elevated CO2 also reduced Jmax in white spruce in both measurements while the effect became insignificant at 30% light later in the growing season. However, the effect on black spruce varied with time. Elevated CO2 reduced Jmax in black spruce in mid-growing season in all light treatments and the effect became insignificant at 30% light later in the growing season, while it increased Jmax later in the season at 100% and 50% light. These results suggest that both species benefited from elevated CO2, and that the responses varied with light supply, such that the response was primarily physiological at 100% and 50% light, while it was primarily morphological at 30% light.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

One of these targets to be tackled by their implementation is the improvement of the livelihood of 1/6 of the global population, housed in unsafe informal settlements. This paper explores the correlation between GOAL11 – Sustainable cities for all - and other aspects of the societies relevant for the achievement of the SDGs –Responsible consumption and production, No poverty, Gender inclusion, Decent work and economic growth- in a mutual and potentially virtuous relationship. The work is based on months of fieldwork conducted in 2018 in the informal settlement of Mathare and in the city of Nairobi, through observation and semi-structured interviews, with the objective of understanding the current productive and economic flows of the construction sector supplying the informal city. From the study, the following statement emerged: a) different final building users (clients) operating in Mathare have access to different building materials b) the diffusion of materials inside the settlement is strictly related to the access to the shop and to the potential client sites c) the diffusion of materials inside the settlement is highly impacted by the availability of space both by the supplier store and on the building site d) tribal division plays a significant role in the distribution of roles in the construction sector. The study shows the relevance of applying a metabolic approach to the city throughout its supply chain in order to understand its ongoing logic prior to a construction intervention. This allows to understand ongoing construction practices, identify gaps and bottlenecks and propose improvement solutions fitting with the ongoing dynamics. The local economy would benefit from such an approach, tailored on its needs and potentials.</jats:p>",

It has been shown that the threshold shear stress for initiation of motion depends, for example, on the bed morphology and on channel slope and that it may be influenced by flood history effects. This study is based on a unique data set of continuous field observations of bedload transport acquired during 27 years with impact plate measurements and involving more than 500 sediment‐transporting flood events. A disequilibrium ratio is defined which represents the observed bedload mass per event divided by the bedload mass calculated via a bedload transport equation integrated over the time of a flood event. The disequilibrium ratio varies in a cyclic behavior around equilibrium conditions defined by its median value. The mean duration of a cycle depends on upstream sediment supply or availability on the bed, and longer cycles are associated with a larger active layer on the bed. A memory effect is evident regarding the temporal evolution of both disequilibrium ratio and bed state as reflected by threshold transport conditions, determined from the observations as the critical discharge at the start and at the end of a bedload‐transporting event. The disequilibrium ratio and the threshold transport discharge are inversely correlated with each other, likely providing a feedback mechanism governing the fluctuations around an equilibrium state. Accounting for the memory effect, that is, for the bed state after the previous event, improves the prediction of bedload transport for the following event.</jats:p>",

It is unclear whether the greater CP deposition rate in the finisher period results from the restricted CP supply in the grower period. To elucidate this question, a growth performance study (22.1-110.0 kg BW) was performed with 48 Swiss Large White pigs. They were assigned to either treatment C, LPF or LPGF. The grower-finisher diets of treatment C were formulated based on the Swiss feeding recommendations whereas those of treatment LPGF contained 20% lower digestible CP and essential amino acid levels than diets C. Pigs of the LPGF treatment were offered in the grower and finisher period the standard and the low CP diets, respectively. The pigs were reared in 1 large pen, equipped with 6 automatic feeders, which allowed measuring the individual ad-libitum feed intake per visit. The BW was determined weekly and carcass composition at slaughter was determined by dual-X-ray-absorpiometry. Growth performance and dual-X-ray-absorpiometry data were analyzed with a linear mixed model using treatment as fixed and litter, litter size and farrowing series as random effects. Despite total CP intake was 6 and 16% lower (P&amp;lt; 0.05) in the LPGF than the LPF and C groups, respectively, overall ADG among treatments did not differ. In accordance, gain-to-CP-intake ratio was 9 and 20% greater (P&amp;lt; 0.05) in the LPGF than the LPF and C group. The carcass protein content did not differ whereas carcass fat content was 9% greater (P&amp;lt; 0.05) in LPGF than LPF and C pigs. Carcass protein deposition efficiency was 0.5 and 6.7%-units greater (P&amp;lt; 0.05) in LPGF than LPF and C pigs, respectively. In conclusion, lowering the CP supply by 20% in the grower and finisher compared to solely the finisher period or not at all has no detrimental effect on growth performance, markedly improves CP utilization for carcass protein deposition but slightly increases carcass fatness.</jats:p>",

Irrational development and utilization of water resources has led to many problems, such as shrinking oases and drying lakes. To solve this problem, this study proposes a multiobjective, multiwater-source, ecological stability-oriented double-layer model for optimal allocation of water resources based on the large-scale system decomposition–coordination principle, the water balance principle, and a water supply and demand forecasting model. This model can resolve the contradiction between agricultural water use and ecological water use by optimizing and adjusting the crop planting structure, industrial structure, and the amount of water allocated to and groundwater level in each region and thereby achieve ecological stability and restoration of oases. The developed model was applied to the Heihe River Basin in an inland region of Northwest China. The long-term time series data of 2000–2016 were used to construct and calibrate the model. Finally, the practical ecological stability-oriented plan for conjunctive allocation of surface water and groundwater in different plan years was proposed. This model enriches the research results related to the conjunctive allocation of surface water and groundwater and provides a reference for the ecological restoration of oases in arid inland river basins.</jats:p>",

Applicability of this research is defined by the high growth of various electric appliances in the households, and the dishwashing machine has one of the highest tempos of the increase over the last decade. The results of this research allow esteeming the future change in the structure of consumption of energy sources by the households in terms of mass implantation of dishwashing machines in our daily life. Several methods of estimation have been reviewed of how the installation of the dishwashing machine impacts on energy sources consumption in the household. Mathematical descriptions and the rationale for the statistical data analysis methods of household energy sources consumption, which were used are explained. Based on the analysis of statistical data over 5 years before the installation of the dishwashing machine, the consumption of the sources is forecasted for the sixth year upon condition that there is still no dishwasher. At the beginning of the sixth year, the dishwashing machine was installed in the observed household. Forecasted values of household sources consumption for the sixth year have been compared with actual values which were obtained after installation of the dishwasher in the household.</jats:p>",

In the first stage, for calibration of collected data (with time step 15 minutes) by weather radar and determination of the best relation between Z and R, it applied a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the amount of root mean square error (RMSE). Although Z = 166R2 (the transfer function in the Khuzestan province of Iran) is an appropriate equation, the GA method distinguished that Z = 110R1.8 (from February to May) and Z = 126R2 (for other months) are the optimum transfer functions for the Abolabbas watershed in Iran. The mean of RMSE of optimum transfer equations is 0.59 mm/hr in the calibration stage and 0.85 mm/hr in the verification stage. In the second stage, the Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS model) used four types of precipitation data (extracted rainfall data from radar and the optimum transfer equations, Z = 166R2, Z = 200R1.6 and extracted rainfall data from rainfall gauging stations). The calibrated rainfall data by the optimum transfer equations can produce flood hydrographs in which their accuracy is similar to the accuracy of generated flood hydrographs by collected rainfall data of rainfall gauging stations. The mean of RMSE is 0.65 cubic metres per second and the mean or R2 is 0.89 for optimum transfer equations.</jats:p>",

During the course of pigging, after a water pressure test, the instability of the pig caused by terrain fluctuation can affect the stable operation of the pipeline and even cause burst accidents. This paper describes the four stages of pig movement in an inclined pipeline, with vapor-liquid eruption occuring in the last stage. A hydraulic transient model of the pigging operation after a water pressure test is established based on mass conservation and motion equations, the dynamic equation of the pig, and the vapor-liquid eruption model. The model can simulate the status of fluid flow in the pipeline, track the movement of the pig, and predict the pressure pulses. The simulation results are consistent with the data of two burst accidents, which verifies the correctness of the established model and the reliability of the calculated results. It can therefore provide a reliable and effective theoretical basis for developing a pigging plan on site.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: Among patients with MDS, it is estimated that 17-82% (median 60%) are transfusion dependent (Harnan S, et al. Acta Haematol 2016;136:23-42) and require ≥ 1 unit of red blood cells (RBCs) every 8 weeks. Sufficient blood supply is essential for the administration of RBC transfusions in patients with MDS, as shortage of blood supply may create unnecessary burden, such as treatment delay, worsened quality of life, or increased healthcare utilization. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the physicians' experience associated with shortage of blood supply and RBC transfusion delays in this patient population. Physicians' perspectives on the factors that impact clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of patients with MDS are also not well understood. The current study investigated physicians' understanding of these topics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: Prior to data collection, interviews were conducted with physicians (3 each in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) to pre-test and revise the questionnaire, a 40-minute web-based physician survey via the M3 Global Research physician panel, for relevance and understanding. All physicians took the survey in their native language and had to have been in practice for 2-35 years, spend ≥ 75% of their time in direct patient care, and have managed ≥ 15 patients with MDS in the past 3 months. Physicians answered questions regarding adequacy of blood supply related specifically to RBC transfusions for patients with MDS. Physicians identified the top 10 factors (from a list of 32) impacting the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of patients with MDS. These factors were then weighted accordingly (assigned point values summing up to 100). Results were described descriptively in proportions for categorical/ordinal data and mean (standard error [SE])/95% confidence intervals [CI]) for continuous data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: A total of 244 hematologist/oncologists, 124 hematologists, and 10 oncologists completed the survey in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK (n = 75 [approx.] in each country; Table). On average, physicians were in clinical practice for 14.70 years (SE 0.32), 41.3% were aged 45-54 years, and 64.3% were male. Physicians spent 88.7% (SE 0.36%) of their professional time in patient care, and had seen an average of 54.5 (SE 2.26) patients with MDS in the past 3 months. Over 65% of physicians (range 54.7 [France]-73.7% [UK]) reported that their patients with MDS encountered RBC transfusion delays due to blood supply shortage (Table). On average this impacted 9.0% (95% CI 7.6-10.4) of all patients with MDS. However, among physicians who reported delays (n = 248), 13.8% (95% CI 11.9-15.7) of patients were impacted, ranging from 11.0% (Spain) to 19.4% (Italy). Physicians (17.2%; range 9.3 [Spain]-31.6% [Italy]) reported ≥ 25% of their patients with MDS requiring transfusions experienced transfusion delay due to blood supply shortage. On average, patients experienced a 4.2-day (95% CI 3.6-4.8) delay in receiving a transfusion due to blood supply shortage, and 16.7% (95% CI 14.3-19.1) of patients required additional healthcare provider visits due to blood supply shortages. The top 10 factors reported that impact clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of patients with MDS included: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (74.6%); age (66.7%); hemoglobin level (66.7%); infections (61.1%); percentage bone marrow blasts at diagnosis (60.1%); comorbidities (59.5%); platelets (56.3%); cardiovascular comorbidity (52.9%); genetic abnormalities (50.3%); and white blood cell count (48.4%). Factors that had the greatest mean impact scores were ECOG PS (8.9, 95% CI 8.1-9.8); percentage bone marrow blasts at diagnosis (8.3, 95% CI 7.3-9.2); age (7.2, 95% CI 6.5-8.0); hemoglobin level (6.8, 95% CI 6.1-7.4); and comorbidities (6.6, 95% CI 5.9-7.3).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: Two thirds of physicians reported that shortage of blood supply resulted in a delay in RBC transfusions for patients with MDS. Almost 20% reported ≥ 25% of their patients with MDS requiring transfusions experienced a transfusion delay due to blood supply issues. ECOG PS, hemoglobin level, and age were the top factors reported to impact outcomes of patients with MDS. New treatment options should be explored to help reduce the number of RBC transfusions, which may also help improve clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of patients with MDS.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p />\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Gupta: Bristol Myers Squibb: Consultancy, Research Funding; Kantar: Current Employment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Solar energy is widely used in cases where the inaccessibility of other energy sources in combination with a sufficient amount of solar radiation justifies it economically. With the help of a system of solar collectors, you can significantly reduce energy costs for hot water supply and heating. In addition, the use of this system helps reduce CO2 emissions. The potential of solar energy in Ukraine is quite high. According to the climatic conditions of our region, solar activity is slightly lower than in the southern regions, so the use of flat solar collectors, which use both direct and scattered solar radiation, is effective for our region. The use of heat collectors in the home for water supply and heating of small areas is economically feasible, as it does not require significant costs. Heat supply plants using non-traditional energy sources are promising in terms of fuel savings and reduction of harmful effects on the environment. To increase the service life, economical use of heat and fuel, efficient operation of the installation requires the use of automation. The article considers the development of a mathematical model of a heat supply installation based on a solar collector. For automated control of the heat supply installation, it is necessary to know the properties of this installation as a whole and its individual elements. For this purpose, models of individual elements of the heat supply installation in a linear approximation are considered. The solar collector is conditionally divided into two parts. The model of the ground heat exchanger is developed. Also e battery models and consumer premises. The given matrices of elements of installation of heat supply are united in the uniform system of matrices. The obtained results allow estimating in advance efficiency of their use and economic attractiveness.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, for a comprehensive water quality analysis, there is an increasing body of evidence that demonstrates coliforms as insufficient indicators for water quality assessment. Therefore, during the last two decades, alternative water testing approaches such as the use of coliphage as well as cholesterol detection have gained popularity. In the present study, we evaluated and compared the reliability of data from three different indicators that included coliforms (Streptococcus), coliphage and cholesterol. Four sites were chosen for sample collection and these included one site from Haart river (HR1) and three sites from Barberspan (BP1, 2 and 3) in the North West Province of South Africa. Samples were collected during winter and summer seasons. Collected samples were subjected to different analyses for detection of coliphage, coliforms and cholesterol. Faecal indicator bacteria were detected at all sites and in some cases were relatively high (HR1: 287 cfu/100 mL faecal coliform and 228.6 cfu/100 mL faecal streptococci; BP1: 1,730 cfu/100 mL Escherichia coli). The HR1 site consistently had the highest levels of bacterial faecal indicators of the four sampling sites. Most notably, faecal streptococci were detected in higher numbers than any other bacterial indicator. A significant finding was the general higher levels of faecal indicator markers at the BP3. Based on the outcome of this study, a combination of these indicators offers a comprehensive and promising approach for monitoring water quality.</jats:p>",

The first experiment examined the effects of post-ruminal choline supply during NNB on production and pathways of 1-carbon metabolism. Ten primiparous rumen-cannulated cows (158±24 DIM) were used in a replicated 5×5 Latin square design with 4d treatment periods and 10d of recovery. Treatments were unrestricted intake with abomasal infusion of water, restricted intake (R; 60% of net energy for lactation requirements) with abomasal infusion of water or R plus abomasal infusion of 6.25, 12.5, or 25 g/d choline ion. Liver tissue was collected at the end of each treatment period. Enhancing choline supply increased milk yields, but decreased liver triacylglycerol. Activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase increased with choline, while methionine synthase tended to increase, and cystathionine β-synthase was decreased. These changes were associated with increased liver and plasma Met. Overall, enhanced supply of choline during NNB increases flux through the Met cycle to regenerate Met and reduce liver triacylglycerol. The second experiment examined the effects of rumen-protected Met (RPM) during HS on mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin)-related signaling proteins in the mammary gland. Thirty-two multiparous cows (184±59 DIM) were assigned to an environmental treatment, and a dietary treatment [TMR with RPM (0.105% DM) or without (CON)] in a crossover design. There were 2 periods with 2 phases per period. In phase 1 (9d), all cows were in thermoneutral conditions (TN) and fed ad libitum. During phase 2 (9d), group 1 (n=16) was exposed to HS using electric heat blankets while group 2 (n=16) remained in TN but were pair-fed to HS counterparts. After a washout period (21d), the study was repeated (period 2), with environmental treatments being inverted and dietary treatments remaining the same. Mammary tissue was collected at the end of phase 2. Abundance of phosphorylated mTOR was greater with RPM and tended to be greater with HS. Control cows had a greater decrease in milk protein (%) during phase 2 (difference from phase 1) compared with RPM cows, suggesting that RPM supplementation during HS may support greater milk protein synthesis via mTOR activation. The third experiment investigated the effects of RPM during HS on the response of mammary gland explants to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Twenty-five mg of tissue obtained from cows in the second experiment was incubated with 0 or 3 μg/mL of LPS for 2h. Incubation with LPS increased abundance of genes associated with inflammation, while HS decreased genes associated with antioxidant responses. Expression of NFKB1was greater in LPS-treated explants from non-HS compared with HS cows. These data indicate that HS reduced immune and antioxidant responses while RPM did not attenuate the inflammatory response induced by LPS in vitro. Overall, data indicated a beneficial effect of choline during NNB and Met during HS on immunometabolism in dairy cows.</jats:p>",

Assuming that at least one EMBC EP should be present 24/7 in each ED (requiring 5.35 FTEs minimum), we calculated the total FTEs required by dividing each ED’s visit volume by the estimated average visits seen by an EMBC EP (3,548 visits per year) and then summed FTEs by state.

Previous attempts to establish the production of GalOA or the full GalA catabolic pathway in <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic> proved challenging, presumably due to the inefficient supply of NADPH, the preferred cofactor of GalA reductases. Here, we tested this hypothesis by coupling the reduction of GalA to the oxidation of the sugar alcohol sorbitol that has a higher reduction state compared to glucose and thereby yields the necessary redox cofactors. By choosing a suitable sorbitol dehydrogenase, we designed yeast strains in which the sorbitol metabolism yields a “surplus” of either NADPH or NADH. By biotransformation experiments in controlled bioreactors, we demonstrate a nearly complete conversion of consumed GalA into GalOA and a highly efficient utilization of the co-substrate sorbitol in providing NADPH. Furthermore, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis of GalA reductases to change their cofactor preference from NADPH towards NADH and demonstrated their functionality by the production of GalOA in combination with the NADH-yielding sorbitol metabolism. Moreover, the engineered enzymes enabled a doubling of GalOA yields when glucose was used as a co-substrate. This significantly expands the possibilities for metabolic engineering of GalOA production and valorization of pectin-rich biomass in general.</jats:p>"

However, the investigation using a single measure with multi-scenarios for the long-term simulation in karst agricultural watershed is still lacking. In this study, the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution (AnnAGNPS) model was developed to verify the applicability in a karst agricultural watershed. Then, the model was used to determine the best management measures (BMPs) and the reduction rate characteristics under long-term effects (about 10 years) in the watershed. The AnnAGNPS model perform well in simulating in NPS pollution with R2 (0.95 for runoff, 0.93 for TN, and 0.93 for TP, respectively) and NSE (0.95 for runoff, 0.53 for TN, and 0.57 for TP, respectively). The output of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) primarily occurred in the rainy season (up to 80%). The loss of mass of TN and TP were mainly observed in orchards and woodlands in the upstream of each sub-basin. The results from AnnAGNPS model demonstrated that different BMPs had significant impacts on the reduction of NPS pollution. Furthermore, a same BMPs measure showed it was closely related to land use in the watershed. In the Qifeng River watershed, stubble tillage (ST) showed to be useful with relatively good reduction rates (16.64% for sediment, 17.85% for TN, and 17.80% for TP, respectively). The simulation results indicated that AnnAGNPS was a valuable tool after validation for the planning and management of the watershed in karst areas.</jats:p>",

The research was carried out on the example of four regions of the Russian Federation fully included in the Arctic zone (Murmansk Oblast, Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug).Natural-resource, economic, social, technological, ecological, and legal factors of energy supply are considered in this work.A brief description and the specifics of thefactors in the Arctic regions are given. The distribution of the main powers in the field of electric power industry, heat power industry, the development of energy saving and energy efficiency between federal and regional authorities is presented. The structure of regional government bodies relating to the  public  control  of  energy  supply  is  considered. The  differences  in  structures  of  regional  government  bodies  are revealed, which are determined by the specifics of different territories. The non-uniformity in content of the documents regulating activities of the regional public bodies is revealed. Tasks, functions or powers (depending on the documents on the regional public bodies) of regional government bodies in the field of regulating energy supply are analyzed and compared to the factors of energy supply. Public control of energy supply, both at the federal and regional levels, to a greater or lesser degree takes into account all the considered factors.

For such a hybrid distribution network it is a challenge for traditional fault location techniques. This paper presents a traveling wave fault location method based on double-terminal measurement techniques. The proposed method analyses the traveling wave propagation mechanism of both aerial mode and zero mode components for a fault. The method then determines which mode component is used for the fault location according to fault types. The method has been developed and assessed on a typical distribution network using ATP power network simulation tool. The tests were conducted under various fault scenarios. The results show that zero mode component is more effective for a fault on the phase of three-phase main lines which is not linked to the phase to phase supply lines. However for a phase-to-phase fault, aerial mode component is more effective. For the remaining fault types, either aerial or zero mode component can be used.</jats:p>",

These ponds do have a sand filtration system for turbidity removal, but the bacteriological quality of these ponds is not under compliance in most cases. In this context, Pattikadu village in Kancheepuram District (Tamil Nadu, South India) was chosen as the study area. It was observed that the biological parameter of drinking water from hand pumps exceeds the limit prescribed by Indian standards. In this work, zero-energy disinfection technology was developed using UVC-LEDs for drinking water to meet the standards. The electrical power required for the disinfection was taken from the mechanical energy from up and down movement of the hand pump lever. UVC-LEDs (λemission 275 ± 5 nm) were powered by a 6 V rechargeable battery which stores electrical energy by mechanical movement of the hand pump lever. An annular-type UVC-LED photo-reactor (1 litre) was developed and 100% disinfection within 6 minutes’ contact time was achieved. The UVC dose-based inactivation rate constant was 0.57 cm2/mJ. The present study demonstrated 2-log inactivation for a 4.68 mJ/cm2 UVC dose. The novelty of the study is its practical applicability of a sustainable point-of-use disinfection technology which might be economically implemented in lower-income smaller communities.</jats:p>",

In emerging economies, new production chain models are required, but little is known about GSCM in these countries, especially in Latin America. Thus, this paper aims to highlight the state‐of‐the‐art of GSCM in Latin America, through a systematic review of the literature (using Scopus and Web of Science databases) and suggests a research agenda with nine recommendations. Results show underexplored themes, such as GSCM benefits, GSCM and key performance indicators, and GSCM and competitive advantage. This study is the only systematic review of GSCM in Latin America, providing a useful research agenda for academics, managers, and policymakers. For instance, this paper contributes to the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in Latin America by suggesting that scholars, practitioners, and governments shed lights on sustainable production and consumption standards (SDG 12), measures to combat climate change and its impact (SDG 13), and the best means of implementation and global partnerships for sustainable development (SDG 17).</jats:p>",

To assess the sensitivity of the results to different origins, five regions representative of ethanol production were selected, and the final destination was the port of Santos. The transportation stage from the mill to the port included the possible effects of using multimodal alternatives, such as road–rail and road–pipeline. The results indicate that diesel consumption varies greatly by region of origin, and agricultural management, such as tilling, planting, and harvesting operations, accounts for about 70% of total diesel emissions to the ethanol supply chain. Rail and pipeline transportation are ultimately important for mitigating emissions from fuel consumption in logistics corridors for exporting ethanol. It is a valuable contribution to supporting private actions and public policies related to the mitigation of emissions in the logistic stages of bioethanol, especially related to the optimization of the agricultural management process and improvement of the multimodal transport infrastructure, respectively. It is also a lesson to countries intending to produce ethanol from sugarcane.</jats:p>"

The SWAP model was used to simulate soil water–salt dynamics in saline wasteland after calibration and validation. The results showed that model simulation results of soil water content and soil salt concentration agreed well with the measured values. Soil water content and soil salt concentration changed obviously under the effect of farmland irrigation in the crop growing period. Soil salt was accumulated in saline wasteland. The soil salt accumulation of each soil layer in saline wasteland was 0.164, 0.092, −0.890 and −1.261 mg/cm3, respectively. Soil water content gradually increased and soil salt concentration gradually decreased in the autumn irrigation period. Soil salt was leached in the saline wasteland. The soil salt accumulation of each soil layer in the saline wasteland was −1.011, −1.242, −1.218 and −1.335 mg/cm3, respectively. The saline wasteland became a drainage and salt drainage region for cultivated land.

In addition, there is still a lack of understanding about the bio-regeneration of MC-LR adsorption capacity in a BAF. This study examined MC-LR removals by a granular activated carbon-biologically active filter (GAC-BAF) as a function of EBCT, temperature, and backwash strategies. Results demonstrated that the optimum EBCT (1.2 h for this study) likely depended upon an optimum superficial velocity as well as the GAC column height. A superficial velocity not greater than 0.5 m/h was deemed appropriate according to this research. The MC-LR removals achieved at the optimum EBCT reached 54.8%–72.0%. A higher temperature resulted in a greater MC-LR removal; adsorption might contribute to effective MC-LR removal by the GAC-BAF at a lower temperature. A strategy (Air + air-water + water) was suggested as an optimal backwash strategy for GAC-BAFs in terms of MC-LR removal. A comparison of the effectiveness of the experimental GAC-BAF in continuous and discontinuous operations on MC-LR removals was conducted, from which indirect evidence for bio-regeneration of MC-LR adsorption capacity of the GAC was obtained.</jats:p>",

Risks range from intoxication due to pathogen-contaminated edibles, to suboptimal potency of temperature-sensitive vaccines. High-performance and low-cost indicators are needed, based on conformable materials whose properties change continuously and irreversibly depending on the experienced time-temperature profile. However, these systems can be limited by unclear reading, especially for colour-blind people, and are often difficult to be encoded with a tailored response to detect excess temperature over varying temporal profiles. Here we report on optically-programmed, non-colorimetric indicators based on nano-textured non-wovens encoded by their cross-linking degree. This combination allows a desired time-temperature response to be achieved, to address different perishable products. The devices operate by visual contrast with ambient light, which is explained by backscattering calculations for the complex fibrous material. Optical nanomaterials with photo-encoded thermal properties might establish new design rules for intelligent labels.</jats:p>"

In the system, the dropshaft, with the function of conveying stormwater to the deep tunnels underground, often runs under conditions of high falling head and large discharge. Based on the standard stepped dropshaft, a blade-shaped stepped dropshaft was proposed in order to control the potential standing wave and improve discharge capacity. Its hydraulic characteristics in respect of flow pattern, flow rate distribution, time-averaged pressure and energy dissipation were investigated by numerical simulation. Compared with the standard stepped dropshaft, the blade-shaped stepped dropshaft generated a more uniform flow rate distribution in the radial direction, therefore effectively decreasing the height of the standing wave near the external wall. The negative pressure areas that easily existed on the vertical wall of steps were well controlled. The energy dissipation of the blade-shaped stepped dropshaft was as high as that of the standard stepped dropshaft. Therefore, the blade-shaped stepped dropshaft could be a preferable design for the deep tunnel system.</jats:p>",

As a rule, finned surfaces and turbulization of heat carrier flows are used to increase the efficiency of heat exchange in heat exchangers. The present paper proposes to use novel materials, namely porous material, in the design of highly efficient heat exchangers. The investigation was carried out experimentally and theoretically. To study the possibility of creating such heat exchangers, a multi-purpose test bench is created. The aim of the study was to assess the intensity of heat transfer in heat exchangers using porous metal. Laboratory tests are carried out as part of the experimental study. In the theoretical study, the classical equation for the change in the heat flux density when the coolant passes through the porous insert was used. As a result, a mathematical model was obtained in the form of a second-order differential equation. Boundary conditions were set and a particular solution was obtained. The results of theoretical calculations were compared with experimental data. The performed study experimentally confirmed the efficiency of using porous metal inserts in the design of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The compiled mathematical model allows one to perform engineering calculations of the considered heat exchangers with porous inserts.</jats:p>"

This is owing to the great influence of this process and the lack of its strong dependence on other processes. Information management processes, risk, market, service performance, demand, capacity, and customer relationship have a linking role in this model. These parameters have a great influence and a strong dependence on the other parameters of the chain. Financial management is the most dependent process in the tourism chain of the region with a low influence but a high dependence on the other processes.

Based on this, the “return cost-sharing and commission readjusting” contract is designed to maximize both ESC and consumer utility. Finally, the paper validates and further analyzes conclusions through numerical simulation. The main conclusions are as follows: higher return rates and return handling costs will reduce market demand and ESC profits, while higher salvage value of returned products will have a positive impact on ESC, but the above factors will not affect the online service level under decentralized decisions. The impact of consumer’s service quality preferences on manufacturer’s profits and e-commerce platform’s profit is determined by channel power structure.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Control aims to avoid oxygen starvation and maximize the net power output by maintaining the optimal oxygen excess ratio (OER), which varies between 1.8 and 2.5. Because of the nonlinearity of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) air supply system and the different conditions, ensuring an optimal OER is still a challenge. In this study, a model-free adaptive controller is presented for the PEMFC air supply system based on feedback linearization and interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2 FLSs). Theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. For the theoretical analysis, first, the PEMFC air supply system is transformed into a canonical form with the feedback linearization technique. Then, zero-dynamics stability is discussed in detail to determine the stability of the internal dynamics. Finally, an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic system controller (AIT2FLSC) is designed on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory, which does not require complete a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. For the experimental results, the root mean square error (RMSE), variance, and standard deviation (SD) of the tracking error are used as tracking performance metrics to evaluate the control accuracy of the proposed AIT2FLSC, which are 0.0968, 0.0093, and 0.0962, respectively. Compared with the traditional proportion integration differentiation controller (RMSE 0.1119, variance 0.0122, and SD 0.1105), this proposed algorithm obtains better adaptability and the RMSE of the tracking error improves 13.48%. Compared with the adaptive type-1 fuzzy logic system controller (AT1FLSC) (RMSE 0.1076, variance 0.0113, and SD 0.1063), this AT2FLSC has a stronger ability to deal with uncertainty and the RMSE of the tracking error improves 10% when the stack temperature is fixed (353.15 K). Furthermore, when the stack temperature is time-varying, the RMSE, variance, and SD of the tracking error under the AIT2FLSC are 0.0966, 0.0092, and 0.0960, respectively, which is less than AT1FLSC (0.1085, 0.0115, and 0.1073) and the RMSE of the tracking error improves 10.99%.</jats:p>",

The as-prepared Ti3C2 was deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane via vacuum filtration to form a Ti3C2/PVDF membrane, which was used for seawater desalination in the next step based on interfacial solar heating. The water evaporation rate of the Ti3C2/PVDF membrane could be enhanced to 0.98 kg/m2·h under 2 sun irradiance, which was 2.8 times and 5.4 times higher than that of pure water (0.35 kg/m2·h) and PVDF (0.18 kg/m2·h) respectively. The temperature difference between the two air–water interfaces with and without the Ti3C2/PVDF membrane was as high as 11.8 °C, confirming the interfacial heating behavior. The water evaporation rate under 2 sun irradiance kept mostly in the range of 0.96–0.86 kg/m2·h over 30 days under continuous operation, indicating the high stability of the Ti3C2/PVDF membrane. Finally, it was demonstrated that the typical water-quality indexes of the condensed fresh water were below the limit values of the Standards for Drinking Water Quality in China, WHO, and US EPA.</jats:p>",

The obtained AC/CuO exhibited excellent adsorption and catalytic performance. The maximum adsorption capacity of BPA on the AC/CuO was 319.03 mg/g according to the Langmuir fitting. At an initial BPA concentration of 20 mg/L, the BPA degradation efficiencies were maintained above 96% for 15 min by using 20 mg/L AC/CuO and 2 mM peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Moreover, the relationship between adsorption and catalytic degradation was also investigated. The results indicated that the pre-adsorption disfavored the degradation reaction. This work not only provides a novel preparation method for AC/CuO catalyst, but also gives a deeper insight into the mechanisms between adsorption and catalytic degradation.</jats:p>",

Experiments were performed to study the electricity grid supply substation in which the basic indexes of quality of electric energy and the built waveform voltage SAG during rolling. Voltage dips are observed throughout the rolling process and reach 10% of the rated network voltage.

The introduction of service flow has made supply chain management more complicated. In this paper, we build a product service supply chain network composed of raw material suppliers, service providers, manufacturing integrators, and customers. The equilibrium model for decision-makers at all levels is established by variational inequality. In particular, we emphasize the impact of product and service capacity constraints and changes in the product service integration ratio on network equilibrium. The results show that, while capacity constraints on production tend to stabilize and unify the market price, service-related capacity constraints polarize the customer pay price. That is to say, product capability constraints limit the quality of product service systems, while service capability constraints limit the types of product service systems. Furthermore, the introduction of service flow and integration with products creates a more closely networked relationship between the upper and lower layers of the product service supply chain, and an increase in the service proportion will increase the network equilibrium profit.</jats:p>",

With hydroponic technologies, all the necessary minerals of the plant are obtained from the nutrient solution, so deviations of acidity and concentration of mineral elements in the substrate and its humidity from optimal values lead to impaired plant uptake of nutrients and water, which can lead to plant diseases and death.  Currently, the most common is software control of watering plants, but the loss of fertilizers and water is at least 25 %, which necessitates the creation of a system of automatic control of substrate humidity  The aim of the work was to develop a system of automatic control of the supply of nutrient solution in greenhouses.  To achieve this goal, a functional scheme of automatic humidity control of mineral wool was developed and the transfer functions of each of its links were determined.  It is established that the most acceptable is the relay-pulse law of automatic regulation. As an indicator of quality in the optimization of the system of automatic humidity control of mineral wool, the total deviation was taken, which allowed to determine the pulse duration and quantization period by the time of the regulator, which are 111 and 666 s, respectively.  The developed system of automatic regulation is stable and provides maintenance of humidity of mineral wool at the set level with an error which does not exceed 5 %</jats:p>",

Based on the analysis of Origin 9.0 and summarizing the law of simulation data, an empirical model for predicting wetting pattern size is constructed, with the reliability of the model verified by experimental data. The results show that the power function is used to fit the relationship between the size of wetting pattern and irrigation time. The power function exponent has small changes in three directions (vertical upward, horizontal, and vertical downward) of the moistube. Further analysis shows that the power function coefficient is in accordance with the power function relationship with soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity, the steady permeability of the moistube, and the difference between soil-saturated moisture content and initial moisture content. The average absolute error of statistical indicators of the built model is between 0.30 and 1.42 cm, the root mean square error is between 0.42 and 1.65 cm, and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is not less than 0.93.

Field experiments were executed to evaluate the effect of foliar spray of different strengths and application times of Hoagland’s solution on growth and yield characteristics of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under rain-fed conditions. The treatments consisted of distilled water (control), 25, 50, and 75% strength of Hoagland’s solution sprayed at 7, 14, and 21 days after crop emergence (DACE) on two chickpea cultivars C-44 and CM-72. In terms of growth and yield, CM-72 showed superiority over C-44. The 75% strength of Hoagland’s solution showed an improvement of 32.9, 37.9, 35.3, 13.5, and 35% in dry weight, plant height, 100- seed weight, seed yield, and biological yield, respectively when sprayed at 21 DACE than distilled water. However, the lower strength (25%) of Hoagland’s solution produced similar results to distilled water. It is recommended that under rain-fed conditions chickpea cultivar CM-72 should be cultivated with a foliar supply of 75% strength of Hoagland’s solution at 21 DACE to obtain the maximum growth and yield.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing evidence shows that cadmium (Cd) toxicity causes severe perturbations on growth performance, physio-biochemical and molecular processes in crop plants. Molybdenum (Mo), an essential trace element, plays key roles in oxidative stress tolerance of higher plants. Hence, the present study has been conducted to investigate the possible role of Mo in alleviating Cd-induced inhibitions in two fragrant rice cultivars namely Guixiangzhan (GXZ) and Meixiangzhan-2 (MXZ-2). The results revealed that Mo application enhanced the plant dry biomass by 73.24% in GXZ and 58.09% in MXZ-2 under Cd stress conditions, suggesting that Mo supplementation alleviated Cd-induced toxicity effects in fragrant rice. The enhanced Cd-tolerance in fragrant rice plants prompted by Mo application could be ascribed to its ability to regulate Cd uptake and reduce Cd-induced oxidative stress as evident by lower hydrogen peroxide levels, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde contents in Cd-stressed plants. The ameliorative role of Mo against Cd-toxicity also reflected through its protection to the photosynthetic pigments, proline and soluble protein. Mo also induced antioxidant defense systems via maintaining higher contents of glutathione and ascorbate as well as enhancing the ROS-detoxifying enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities and up-regulating transcript abundance in both fragrant rice cultivars under Cd stress. Conclusively, Mo-mediated modulation of Cd toxicity in fragrant rice was through restricting Cd uptake, maintaining photosynthetic performance and alleviating oxidative damages via the strong anti-oxidative defense systems; however, GXZ cultivar is comparatively more Cd tolerant and Mo-efficient as evident from the less growth inhibition and biomass reduction as well as enhanced Mo-induced Cd stress tolerance and less oxidative damage than MXZ-2 fragrant rice cultivar.</jats:p>"

The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10–15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility.</jats:p>"

The animals were divided into the following experimental groups: I – animals receiving full-value semi-synthetic ration (control group); II – animals receiving high-sucrose diet; III – animals receiving low-protein high-sucrose diet. The content of total and oxidized ubiquinone was determined spectrophotometrically at 275 nm, the content of reduced ubiquinone was determined by the difference between the content of total and oxidized ubiquinone. The intensity of the oxidative modification of proteins was assessed by the accumulation of carbonyl derivatives in the reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH), the content of free SH-groups was assessed by using the Elman reagent. It was found that the most pronounced decrease in the content of total ubiquinone (almost twice) and the redistribution of its redox forms (reduction of the content of reduced ubiquinone by 7.2 times against the background of an increase in the level of oxidized ubiquinone by 2 times) in rat liver mitochondria is observed in animals that received a diet high in sucrose against the background of alimentary protein deprivation. In addition, the animals of this group showed the most pronounced free radical oxidation of mitochondrial proteins, as evidenced by a 3.5-fold increase in the content of carbonyl derivatives and a 2.6-fold decrease in the content of free protein SH- groups. It was shown that nutritional protein deficiency is a critical factor affecting the intensity of free radical processes in mitochondria. The established changes in the ratio of the redox forms of ubiquinone and the degree of oxidative modification of mitochondrial proteins in rat liver could be considered as prerequisites for deepening the energy imbalance and violation of the functional activity of mitochondria under conditions of nutritional imbalance.</jats:p>",

Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity is at the core of this challenge; however, the aggregate electrification potential and resulting system-wide CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reductions for diverse industrial processes are unknown. Here, we present the results from a comprehensive bottom-up analysis of the energy use in 11 industrial sectors (accounting for 92% of Europe’s industry CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions), and estimate the technological potential for industry electrification in three stages. Seventy-eight per cent of the energy demand is electrifiable with technologies that are already established, while 99% electrification can be achieved with the addition of technologies currently under development.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Thanks to the convenient and hassle-free manner of leasing service, the car leasing industry has flourished in recent years. To leverage commercial opportunities, many well-known car manufacturers have chosen to enter the leasing market rather than focus solely on the selling market. An interesting phenomenon is that some manufacturers establish their own leasing departments to gain revenue from the leasing market (referred to as centralization), while other manufacturers conduct their leasing businesses through an autonomous leasing company (referred to as decentralization). In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model to explore whether a car manufacturer should manage a leasing department in a centralized channel or have the leasing business done by an autonomous company in a decentralized channel. We demonstrate the optimal pricing policy for the manufacturer, dealer, and leasing department/company under both centralization and decentralization. In the main model, we assume that the consumer experience value preference follows a uniform distribution, and leasing brings consumers a better experience value than purchasing, and we normalize the marginal production cost of the product to zero. Our analysis reveals that neither centralization nor decentralization is always optimal, and the related boundary is analyzed. An interesting finding is that as the consumers’ leasing experience value rises, the dealer obtains higher profit, even though it serves fewer consumers in the decentralized channel. In the extension, we relax our assumptions to examine the impact of a normal distribution of consumer experience value preferences, a large purchasing experience value, and a non-negligible production cost, and we find that most of the main model results still hold qualitatively. </jats:p>",

Remote sensing techniques are effective tools for monitoring spatiotemporal information of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a biochemical indicator for water quality. In this study, the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model and Sentinel-2A/B imagery were combined to estimate low CDOM concentrations (0.003 m−1 &amp;lt; aCDOM(440) &amp;lt;1.787 m−1) in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, an important drinking water resource in Zhejiang Province, China, providing the CDOM distributions and dynamics with high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5 day) resolutions. The possible environmental factors that may affect CDOM spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics were analyzed using Sentinel-2 image-observed data in 2018. Results showed that CDOM in the reservoir exhibited a clear increased gradient from its transition and lacustrine zones to the riverine zones, indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. The precipitation may increase CDOM concentrations but it has a delayed effect, while it may also shortly decrease CDOM concentrations due to the rainwater dilution. We also found that the correlations between CDOM and water temperature, air pressure, and wind speed were very low, indicating that these factors may not have significant impacts on CDOM variations in the reservoir. This study demonstrated that the GBRT model and Sentinel-2 imagery have the potential to accurately monitor CDOM spatiotemporal variations in reservoirs with low CDOM concentrations, which advances our understanding on the relations between the dissolved organic matter and its coupling environmental factors in river-reservoir systems.</jats:p>",

A fundamental trait of natural and man-made networks is the emergence of loops and the trade-off governing their formation: adding redundant edges to supply networks is costly, yet beneficial for resilience. Loops typically form when costs for new edges are small or inputs uncertain. Here, we shed further light on the transition to loop formation. We demonstrate that loops emerge discontinuously when decreasing the costs for new edges for both an edge-damage model and a fluctuating sink model. Mathematically, new loops are shown to form through a saddle-node bifurcation. Our analysis allows to heuristically predict the location and cost where the first loop emerges. Finally, we unveil an intimate relationship among betweenness measures and optimal tree networks. Our results can be used to understand the evolution of loop formation in real-world biological networks.</jats:p>"

At the field concentration, there was no significant mortality; however, the bees were not able to distinguish the feeders.

It is also urgent to deal with increased inventory while avoiding shortages, with the purpose of reducing supply chain risks. This study analyzes the integrated supply chain decision-making problem in the random product demand and return environment. It proposes a multi-objective optimization model, which is an effective tool to solve the design and planning problems of the global closed-loop supply chain. It consists of a multi-period, single-product and multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model, which can solve some strategic decision problems, including the network structure, entity capacities, flow of products and components, and collection levels, as well as the inventory levels. From the perspective of economic, environmental and social benefits, three objective functions are defined, including maximizing the net present value (NPV) of the system, minimizing the total CO2e emissions of supply chain activities, and maximizing social sustainability indicators. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the advantages of this model, and sensitivity analysis results are provided. The results show that changes in product demand and return rate will have a great impact on economic and social performance.</jats:p>"

Such adaptability, combined with apoptosis resistance provides cancer cells with a survival advantage. Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) has been defined as a metabolic checkpoint at the crossroad of these two processes. Here, we show that the hypoxia-induced cleaved form of VDAC1 (VDAC1-ΔC) is implicated in both the up-regulation of glycolysis and the mitochondrial respiration. We demonstrate that VDAC1-ΔC, due to the loss of the putative phosphorylation site at serine 215, concomitantly with the loss of interaction with tubulin and microtubules, reprograms the cell to utilize more metabolites, favoring cell growth in hypoxic microenvironment. We further found that VDAC1-ΔC represses ciliogenesis and thus participates in ciliopathy, a group of genetic disorders involving dysfunctional primary cilium. Cancer, although not representing a ciliopathy, is tightly linked to cilia. Moreover, we highlight, for the first time, a direct relationship between the cilium and cancer cell metabolism. Our study provides the first new comprehensive molecular-level model centered on VDAC1-ΔC integrating metabolic flexibility, ciliogenesis, and enhanced survival in a hypoxic microenvironment.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the Stackelberg game model of green investment decision-making among enterprises is established by considering the case of the supplier’s green investment alone and the case of the manufacturer and the supplier’s joint green investment. The influence of green uncertainty on enterprise’s decision-making is analyzed, and the green investment decision-making strategies of both sides in two cases are compared. There are four main conclusions derived from the results: (i) with the increase in the supplier’s green cost coefficient, the supplier will reduce the green investment and the manufacturer will reduce the share of the green costs; (ii) with a decrease in uncertainty for eco-friendly intermediate components and the increase in their feasibility factor, the supplier will increase the greenness of intermediate components and increase the investment in environment, and the manufacturer will reduce the share of the green costs; (iii) the increase in the manufacturer’s share of green costs will promote the supplier to increase the greenness of intermediate components and increase its green investment, which shall increase the supplier’s optional choice space of for green investment; (iv) in the case of the manufacturer and the supplier jointly making a green investment, the threshold value for the environmental input of the supply chain members (i.e., the manufacturer and the supplier) is lower, and the supply chain members will have more choice space. At the same time, the care for environment in the case of a cooperative is higher than that in the case of a supplier investing alone.</jats:p>",

Rapid expansion of agricultural scale may lead to a higher risk of re-abandonment of wasteland due to waterless irrigation in water-deficient areas. Against this background, this study proposed a water resources regulation-allocation coupling model. The ‘regulation’ is to control the water consumption of agriculture and regulate the utilized scale with water resources as the main constraint; the ‘allocation’ is to optimize the water resources allocation among crops and arrange the crop planting system according to the water quota for different crops and the economic, social and ecological benefits brought by crops, so as to control the water resources among crops. Afterwards, taking an agro-pastoral ecotone in Northwest China as the study case, schemes of feasible agricultural scale and planting structure suitable for local conditions were obtained. Lastly, the matching patterns of land and water resources were raised gradually from ‘poor’ into ‘good’ degree from 2015 to 2030. This study is expected to provide a reference for controlling the ordered and balanced development of land and water resources of agriculture as well as effectively improving the sustainable development ability in water-deficient areas.</jats:p>",

The baseflow estimation is important to water supply and ecological environmental protection in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. This paper comprehensively assessed the applicability of four single-parameter digital filtering, recursive digital filtering, and HYSEP (streamflow hydrograph separation) methods across four typical catchments in the Yellow River Basin: the Zuli River Basin, the Kuye River Basin, the Tuwei River Basin, and the Jingle sub-basin. We also investigated annual and monthly variations in baseflow. We found the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of baseflow index through recursive digital filter were relatively small. And the baseflow process line was smoother and more reasonable in typical year and typical storm-flood events, which conformed to the damping and hysteresis effect of the underlying surface. Thus the recursive digital filter method had the best performance, which was recommended for baseflow separation in the YRB. The estimated baseflow index of typical basins were between 0.354 and 0.502. In addition, inter-annual baseflow showed a decreasing trend and intra-annual baseflow was characterized by uneven distribution, which was subject to the characteristics of each basin.</jats:p>",

In this research, the denitrification performance and microbial dynamics were studied in a H2-based MBfR operated at close-end mode with a fixed H2 pressure of 0.04 MPa and fed with nitrate (NO3−) containing influent. Results of single-factor and microsensor measurement experiments indicate that the H2 availability was the decisive factor that limits NO3− removal at the influent NO3− concentration of 30 mg N/L. High-throughput sequencing results revealed that (1) the increase of NO3− loading from 10 to 20–30 mg N/L resulted in the shift of dominant functional bacteria from Dechloromonas to Hydrogenophaga in the biofilm; (2) excessive NO3− loading led to the declined relative abundance of Hydrogenophaga and basic metabolic pathways as well as counts of most denitrifying enzyme genes; and (3) in most cases, the decreased quantity of N metabolism-related functional bacteria and genes with increasing distance from the H2 supply end corroborates that the microbial community structure in H2-based MBfR was significantly impacted by the gases’ back-diffusion.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, there are various stakeholders including pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributors, retailers, patients, and the government. In this paper, we consider a two-stage supply chain consisting of one pharmaceutical manufacturer and a pharmacy with online and offline channels. We focus on four price cap models: no price cap regulation, pharmaceutical manufacturer’s price cap regulation, pharmacy price cap regulation, and linkage price cap regulation. We apply game theory, investigate how the price cap regulations affect the firms’ pricing, and evaluate the economic performance and social welfare of the dual-channel pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings show that first, like the single-channel pharmaceutical supply chain, the profit of the regulated firm always decreases and the profit of the unregulated firm always increases when they are under one-sided price cap regulations. Second, the impacts of the linkage price cap regulation on the supply chain are more complicated depending on the linkage coefficient and market share. Overall, our findings can provide theoretical and practical insights to help the government devise price cap regulations for complex modern pharmaceutical supply chains.</jats:p>",

The results showed that in the past 30 years, influenced by human activities and meteorological changes, the groundwater flow field in 1986–2015 was generally move from southwest to northeast, the depth of groundwater level was increasing from the initial 3.26 to 4.06 m, with an annual increase rate of 0.027 m/a; the contribution rate of exploitation factor, precipitation factor, evaporation factor were 40, 20 and 40%; the fitting figure of the observed values and the predicted values were very good, with an average relative error of 7.73%. According to the prediction schemes, when the evaporation increases by 5%, and the agricultural exploitation decreases by 5%, the depth of groundwater will reach 3.39 m; when the evaporation increases by 10%, and the agricultural exploitation decreases by 10%, the depth of groundwater will reach 3.32 m.

By adjusting GaN growth temperature and pattern arrangement, a GaN microfacet with almost pure {101} semipolar facets is obtained.

Considering the dependence of emission wavelength and intensity on injection currents, a programmable power supply is designed to drive the LED. The specific color of the LED is tuned by time‐shared driving of the currents based on three channels with controllable magnitudes and duty cycle from the power supply, covering red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple.

The results show that, under the decentralized decision-making mode, the profit of FLSP increases first and then decreases as the sensitivity coefficient of cross-service level increases, while the profits of other decision makers and the supply chain system decrease with the increase of sensitivity coefficient of cross-service level. The relative size of the price sensitivity coefficient of online and offline channel has an inconsistent impact on the profit of FLSP, while it has a consistent impact on the profits of other decision makers. The profit of FLSP fluctuates greatly with changes in the sensitivity coefficient, and it is difficult to be guaranteed in the entire supply chain system. On this basis, an improved coordination mechanism of residual profit sharing is designed. The results show that, after the introduction of bargaining power coefficient of the Nash negotiation model, the variation coefficient of the profits of all decision makers is smaller after coordination, and the profit growth rates are more uniform.</jats:p>",

Forecasting performance can be improved using complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) to produce clearer signals as model inputs. In the forecasting models based on CEEMD, the entire time series is decomposed into several sub-series, each sub-series is divided into training and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models, such as least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and finally an ensemble forecasting result is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub-series. This model was applied to forecast the inflow runoff of the Shitouxia Reservoir (STX Reservoir). The forecasting results show that the Nash efficiency coefficient of the LSSVM model is 0.815, and the Nash efficiency coefficient of the CEEMD-LSSVM model is 0.954, an increase of 13.9%. The root mean square error value is reduced from 20.654 to 10.235, a decrease of 50.4%. The runoff forecasting performance can be effectively improved by applying the CEEMD-LSSVM model. When analyzing the annual runoff forecasting results month by month, it was found that the forecasting results for November to April were unsatisfactory compared results from the nearest neighbor bootstrapping regressive (NNBR) model, which was more suitable for the dry season, but the forecasting results for May to October improved significantly. This also proves that the CEEMD-LSSVM model has a great advantage in the forecasting of inflow runoff during the wet season. In the optimized operation of reservoirs, the forecasting result of inflow runoff in the wet season is more important than in the dry season. Therefore, when forecasting annual runoff month by month, the CEEMD-LSSVM model is recommended for the wet season combined with the NNBR model for the dry season.</jats:p>",

Under the five models (one centralized and four decentralized), the influence of competitive strength and fairness concern degree of collectors on the pricing decisions is analyzed. The following conclusions can be obtained: (1) When the manufacturer considers the fairness concern of the collectors, fairness concern is a way for the collectors to obtain more profit. Whether the manufacturer “proactively” considers the fairness concern of the collectors is an approach to benefiting the collectors but only in the case of “active” consideration, there is less self-loss to the manufacturer. (2) When the collectors’ fairness concern cannot be considered by the manufacturer, the equilibrium recycling price sets lower for the purpose of achieving more profit by the collectors. At this point, the profit of the collectors and the manufacturer is the lowest, and so is the return rate of the CLSC. (3) When the collectors do not care about whether they are being fairly treated but the manufacturer “actively” takes the fairness of the collectors into consideration, the collectors get “unexpected” attention from the manufacturer, which makes the performance of the collectors more positive than it is when their fairness concerns are taken into account. The profit increased by the collectors is more than that lost by the manufacturer, so the profit of the CLSC is the largest. Additionally, our findings provide some managerial insights on the pricing decision in the case where the collectors consider fairness concern.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introdução: A fluoretação das águas de abastecimento público representa uma importante medida de saúde pública para prevenção da cárie dentária, devendo ser monitorada quanto ao teor de fluoreto em dose ideal, bem como em relação ao seu alcance populacional na perspectiva de reduzir as desigualdades e proporcionar benefícios em saúde bucal. Objetivo: O estudo avaliou a equidade na distribuição de água fluoretada na cidade de Manaus/AM, por meio da relação entre indicadores contextuais de desenvolvimento municipal e os teores de fluoreto na água de abastecimento dos bairros que compõem os distritos sanitários da cidade. Método: Realizou-se estudo ecológico transversal no período de 2016 a 2018. Amostras de água foram coletadas mensalmente de cada distrito sanitário, cujas concentrações de fluoreto foram determinadas utilizando-se um eletrodo específico. Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano Municipal (IDHM), mortalidade Infantil,número de crianças fora da escola e expectativa de vida representaram os indicadores contextuais do município, obtidos a partir do Atlas do Desenvolvimento Humano no Brasil. Os dados foram submetidos a uma análise descritiva, estatística bivariada e análise espacial. Resultados: Observou-se grande variação nos teores de fluoreto das amostras, das quais 50,02% apresentaram concentrações de fluoreto inadequadas e as maiores concentrações predominaram nas amostras coletadas no segundo semestre do ano. A distribuição espacial indicou que os bairros com melhores valores de IDHM,  mortalidade infantil, número de crianças fora da escola e expectativa de vida apresentaram melhor concentração de fluoreto na água de abastecimento. Conclusões: Evidenciou-se a ausência de equidade na distribuição de água fluoretada, sugerindo que o acesso à água fluoretada reflete as desigualdades sociais presentes na própria cidade.</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is to substantiate the structure and parameters of the combined electrotechnological processes of wastewater treatment in paper and cardboard production.  When treating wastewater, electrocoagulation processes were used, characterized by the electrochemical dissolution of metal anodes.

Also, wastewater was subjected to ozonation for the purpose of additional oxidation of pollutants. To mix the coagulant and effluents, we used an atmospheric air supply. After flotation coagulation, the wastewater was separated by sedimentation and filtered, if necessary, through a polystyrene foam filter. After evaluating the results of experimental wastewater treatment of paper and cardboard production, a combined scheme of an electrotechnological water treatment complex is proposed.  Calculation of technical and economic indicators showed that the financial costs of processing glue and dye washes using a combined electrotechnical complex are almost six times less than the services of specialized companies for the disposal of such wastewater.
