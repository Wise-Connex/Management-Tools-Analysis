Radical product and process innovations bring such tensions to the forefront by disrupting supply chains. Using two illustrations, this article considers the paradoxical tension between change and stability in upstream supply chains, which becomes particularly salient after radical innovation. Furthermore, the article discusses why and how paradox theory can help firms understand and manage this pressing tension between stability and change. This article then presents future research opportunities for using paradox theory to investigate other persistent post‐innovation tensions in upstream supply chains. The aim of this article is to encourage new studies that develop responses to such paradoxical tensions, an area ripe for research.</jats:p>",

Trouble-free and reliable operation of water supply systems ensures the normal operation of social and household and industrial enterprises, as well as the safe operation of fire protection systems, which can be disrupted when the supply of a quality product to the consumer is stopped. For the purpose of research to determine the conditions of the reliability of reversible water supply systems in thermal power engineering, as well as the impact of risks in these systems on the reliability of reversible water supply systems, it is proposed to determine the states in which any water treatment system can be and the risks in water treatment systems that are technogenic in origin, and the consequences are ecological. The analysis of the obtained results showed that the states in which the water treatment system can be divided into three classes in accordance with the regulatory documents on the definition of technogenic risks in water treatment systems: class 1 (limit state) - the system works in normal mode, all blocks and elements work without failures and crashes; class 2 (critical state) - the system works in offline mode, some units or elements of the system work in partial failure mode; class 3 (dangerous state) - the system practically does not work and does not purify water, some blocks or elements of the system are in a state of failure. The risks that arise during the operation of water treatment systems and which can be used to assess their technogenic safety can be defined as: a) the probability of this system supplying raw water to the consumer as a result of the failure of blocks and elements of this system - state 3 - dangerous; b) the probability of this system supplying the consumer with poor-quality water as a result of partial failures and freelance work of units and elements of this system - state 2 - critical; c) the probability of this system supplying raw water to the consumer when the system is in state 1 - limiting, due to the natural inertia inherent in the specific physical and chemical processes on which the actual system operates.</jats:p>"

Three hundred eighty-three pieces of data were obtained between August and December 2021 by the simple random sampling method. Two hypotheses were developed. Simple regression analysis was used to test the first hypothesis, and moderator effect analysis was performed with the SPSS process to test the second hypothesis. It has been determined that the DDSC has a significant effect on the SCCC. In addition, SCO has a moderating effect, and when there is a high SCO, the DDSC has a greater effect on the SCCC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Ukraine, two methods are used to calculate building utilities: the standard one (DBN 2013) and the \"optimal diameter\" method. In the EU, there is a standard with a simplified method for calculating building utilities. It also states: \"National regulations may require a lower flow rate to avoid water hammer and noise.\" A small number of European countries have their own national calculation methods, but the standard states that national methods \"may be used as an alternative to the European standard in cases where there are reasons for differentiated selection of pipe sizes, e.g. for large buildings, industrial and commercial enterprises, etc.\". It is hard to imagine a European country that does not have, for example, \"large buildings\" and Ukraine is no exception. The \"optimal diameter\" calculation methodology determines the optimal average speed of water movement in the system, taking into account two criteria: the quality and quantity of water supplied to the consumer.  The obtained average velocities are always in the range of \"quiet pipes\", i.e. less than 1 m/s. Since a simple algorithm exists to solve the problem of finding the best diameters in individual sections, the result is not affected by the designer's experience. As an example, four comparative calculations were performed for an eleven-story building with a total of 192 sanitary facilities and a design section length of 50.5 m. The calculations were performed by two methods for networks made of steel and polyethylene pipes and. It was found that networks calculated according to the DBN method require more electricity for both steel and polyethylene pipes (from 10 to 30% in the hour of maximum consumption). That is why, the use of an alternative methodology for calculating internal networks developed at the Department of Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment of KNUBA not only meets European standards, but also allows to choose more energy-efficient pipe diameters in comparison with those that can be obtained using the DBN.</jats:p>"

The duration of the pandemic was more protracted than initially expected as new variants of the pandemic (in ‘waves’) resulted in additional restrictions.Objectives: To determine the nature of COVID-19-related air travel restrictions, their impact on annual passenger demand, the number of flights operated (supply of services), the related average passenger loads carried as well as on tourism indicators of the direct contribution of travel and tourism, the total contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment.Method: The study identifies the number of passengers carried and flights operated and calculates the average passenger load per flight and trends. The impact on tourism indicators is based on the unit values of metrics published by the World Travel and Tourism Council for the 2019 calendar year, adapted for the reduction in passengers in the first and second years following the COVID-19 lockdown.Results: Significant decreases in the annual number of passengers carried, flights operated (in the three geographic areas), and their impact on tourism and employment indicators were identified.Conclusion: The decline in passengers exceeded the decrease in flights operated, which resulted in a decline in the average load of passengers carried per flight. The significance of COVID-19 restrictions on tourism indicators and employment was also calculated.Contribution: The study identifies the impact of COVID-19 air travel restrictions on both air transport and tourism indicators for South Africa.</jats:p>"

This has opened up opportunities for corrupt relationships between internal and external stakeholders seeking to embark on corrupt activities in universities. As corruption is a worldwide phenomenon, this study selected previously disadvantaged universities in South Africa to investigate the effectiveness of university administrators and managers. The research examines the enforcement of policies and regulations in the effort to curb corruption.Objective: The study further sought to determine the extent to which service providers and politicians are enabled to manipulate the supply chain management and procurement systems, convincing the university officials to overlook quality standards and specifications.Method: This study was suited to a multi-case study approach, and the qualitative method was used to obtain data. A sample of 20 respondents were approached from different employment categories, including departments, faculties and trade unions.Results: The major highlights of the study pointed to the following as being the dimensions of corrupt practices in universities: rules and regulations were not enforced by university officials. There were obvious corrupt relationships and agreements among corrupt individuals, without any action being taken against them; there was a clear corrupt relationship between internal and external forces, which included bribery by funders, service providers and suppliers; there was political interference from members of management and council members, driving the corruption agenda.Conclusion: To fill the gaps that enable corruption in universities, the development of an anti-corruption workforce is a necessity. This can be achieved through skills development, proper intelligence, cooperation from stakeholders, employees refusing gifts and/or bribes and consequence management for those who are driving corruption.Contribution: The findings of the study can be used to assist university stakeholders, agencies and decision-makers in understanding the nature and extent of the corruption that is prevalent in the institutions concerned. The research could have a positive influence on improving policy compliance and adding value regarding the scant literature on corruption in universities.</jats:p>"

Inductive thematic analysis and in-depth interviews with district administrators were used to collect qualitative data as part of an exploratory case study design. The findings from the interpretive philosophy reveal that district municipalities lack the capacity to deliver water services due to a variety of supply chain risks and augmenting water demand from the community. Due to the detrimental effects of water shortages on livelihoods, the district's supply risk management capacities need to be strengthened. The supply chain operations should mitigate supply risks not just in water supply, but in service delivery as a whole by striking a balance between water demand and supply to address supply risks. The supply risks that are recognised should take into account data sharing, supplier agility, adaptability, dependability, and infrastructure quality. The force field analysis created a platform to identify the forces that provide a change in the water supply.</jats:p>"

Thus, for decades, programs have been implemented to eradicate poverty and facilitate access to financial services for the most disadvantaged segments of the population, represented mainly by the rural population. Among these programs, microfinance holds a predominant place. However, the latter is increasingly moving away from the agricultural sector, depending on its assessment of the risky nature of agricultural investments. This study sought to analyze the effect of agricultural credit supply on the performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Data from the two largest microfinance institutions (FUCEC-Togo and WAGES) were analyzed. The linear regression model was used for the analysis. The results show that the supply of agricultural credit has a negative impact on financial performance ratios of both MFIs in this study. The study recommended that microfinance institutions improve their agricultural financial services to adapt them to the needs of rural populations. The introduction of financial products should be adapted to the needs of producers and compatible with the profits of microfinance structures.</jats:p>"

Organizations look for better management of their supply chain from “end to end,” i.e., sourcing of raw materials from vendors to delivering finished products at the doorstep of consumers. This means businesses that used to be ‘operations hubs' within the company have moved into the epicenter of business innovation, and this process can not be done manually or by few people within organizations, thus the need to back up business innovations and product complexities through advanced technologies. Using sensors like RFID, CRM, AI, and ML, organizations today collect information at every checkpoint from status of raw materials flow to the location of finished goods. Supply chain management is the process of planning and implementing the operations of the sourcing of quality materials at competitive cost.

The circular supply chain emphasizes an increase in the usage of reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing, promoting the shift of manufacturing features from linear ('take-produce-use-dump') to circular models of product, by-product, and waste flow. In the last few decades, supply chains in manufacturing industries have become global. In recent years, organizations have sought to approach circular supply chain models to lengthen the product life cycle, manage waste, and promote economic sustainability by shifting customer preferences toward secondary commodities and products. As a result, CSCM may provide a meaningful linkage between their economic growth and resource depletion, and community welfare issues, and therefore offer the potential for the sustainability of a business.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Academic and policy proposals on algorithmic accountability often seek to understand algorithmic systems in their socio-technical context, recognising that they are produced by ‘many hands’. Increasingly, however, algorithmic systems are also produced, deployed, and used within a supply chain comprising multiple actors tied together by flows of data between them. In such cases, it is the working together of an algorithmic supply chain of different actors who contribute to the production, deployment, use, and functionality that drives systems and produces particular outcomes. We argue that algorithmic accountability discussions must consider supply chains and the difficult implications they raise for the governance and accountability of algorithmic systems. In doing so, we explore algorithmic supply chains, locating them in their broader technical and political economic context and identifying some key features that should be understood in future work on algorithmic governance and accountability (particularly regarding general purpose AI services). To highlight ways forward and areas warranting attention, we further discuss some implications raised by supply chains: challenges for allocating accountability stemming from distributed responsibility for systems between actors, limited visibility due to the accountability horizon, service models of use and liability, and cross-border supply chains and regulatory arbitrage</p>"

This study examines the effects of firms' SC viability on SC and marketing performance.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: An explanatory research design was employed to examine the relationship between the antecedents of SC viability, SC, and marketing performance using partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). Moreover, 5-point Likert scale questionnaires are used as a data collection instrument.\nResults: The finding shows that both SC resilience, SC agility, and sustainable SC have a positive effect on SC performance. Further, SC viability [SC resilience + SC agility + sustainable SC] has a positive effect on SC performance. SC performance also play partial mediation between SC viability and marketing performance.\nLimitations of the investigation: The study focused only on a limited number of large manufacturing companies in Ethiopia, which excluded other medium- and small-sized firms due to the ongoing war in the northern part of the country. Moreover, the study focused only on one dimension of sustainability (social aspect).\nImplicações práticas:  O estudo mostra às empresas que os métodos tradicionais de avaliação de risco são insuficientes e não serão mais suficientes para superar uma grave disrupção.

It dates the back to late 1970s and has been shaped by a number of schools such as “regenerative design,” “industrial ecology,” and “cradle to cradle.” It is assumed that without circularity in the use of limited resources sustainable development cannot exist. In short, CE is about keeping resources and their value in the economy and avoiding them becoming waste.

There are six layers in this supply chain simulation model: raw material providers, component manufacturers, product assemblers, product holders, retailers, and final customers. Each entity in the supply chain represented by an agent has five components: interface, task distribution, business processing activities, knowledge management and decision support, and information storage. A detailed agent structure is designed and various functions of an agent including communication among agents are described. Issues in the supply chain integration, information sharing among supply chain partners, demand forecasting, supply chain risk management, and automated communication and negotiation, could be simulated and studied by using the proposed system.\n\nBased on the proposed supply chain simulation model, a generic six-layer prototype mobile phone supply chain simulation system is designed, developed and implemented. The system allows a user to setup and adjust a large number of parameters, including (1) simulation period, loan and saving interest rates; (2) customers' behavior and market demand; (3) each retailer's initial cash, loan, market share, inventories, Order Amount Policy and Order Point Strategy; (4) each product holder's initial cash, loan, market share, inventories, Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy and inventory strategy; (5) each assembler's and component agent's initial cash, loan, inventories, Order Amount Policy, Order Point Strategy, production strategy, and production capacities; and (6) each material provider's initial cash, loan, inventory, production strategy, and production capacities. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine and compare many supply chain management strategies and agent behaviors. This system can be used to test which strategy is most suitable in certain environments, The generic supply chain simulation system developed can be used in a number of ways, including: as an analysis tool for entity in a supply chain from the entity's perspective; as a tool for studying supply chain coordination and integration from the perspective of an entire supply chain, or portion of it; as a tool to design supply chains by answering \"what-if\" questions.</jats:p>"

This may result in over-stock, stock-out and expiries of health commodities at health facilities. This studyassessed the effect of data quality on the supply of malaria commodities in lower level health facilities in Kinondoni Municipal, Tanzania.\n<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: A descriptive research design was used to undertake the study using malaria commodities transaction data submitted by health facilities in the report and requisition form through the electronic Logistics Management Information System (eLMIS) from January 2020 to January 2021. Data was extracted from report and requisition forms and subjected to data quality assessment using data quality dimension factors: data validity, accuracy, timeliness, completeness, uniqueness and consistency. Descriptive statistics such as percentage and frequency as well as a Chi-square test was applied to identify the association between data quality and stock-out of malaria commodities.\n<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>The results indicate that the data validity accounts, 39 (26%) of malaria commodities transactions records were reported stock-out and not ordered, 55 (36.67%) of transactions records did not report the stock-out days, and 15 (8.15%) of transactions records demanded malaria commodities despite being over-stocked. Health facilities that order malaria commodities after being stocked-out were observed to have less proportion of stock-out (14.92%) compared to those which were experiencing stock-out and did not order malaria commodities (23.31%). Health facilities reported late in the eLMIS had a higher proportion of stock-out (25%) and under-stock (32.50%) compared to early reporters 16.72% and 24.25%, respectively. Health facilities that neglected to report malaria commodities had a higher proportion of over-stock 27.73% and stock-out 27.31%, compared to the respective stock status of health facilities which reported all malaria commodities (over-stock 21.07% and stock-out 15.18%).\n<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: Health facilities that reported poor data quality had more proportion of stock-out compared to those that reported good quality data. Advocacy on good data quality should be emphasized to promote malaria commodity availability and provide quality malaria services in lower-level health facilities in Kinondoni Municipal, Tanzania.</jats:p>"

Carried out for 19 regions and the city of Kyiv. Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn: centralized water supply covers 98.7% of cities (absent in 4 cities), 90.3% of rural settlements (absent in 46 rural settlements), and 23.5% of rural settlements, 67.4% of rural settlements and 1.5% of rural settlements. To ensure the development and reconstruction of systems of centralized drinking water supply and centralized water drainage in populated areas of Ukraine and to provide the population with quality drinking water in sufficient quantity, the Ministry of Regions has developed the State-wide target program \"Drinking water of Ukraine\", which provides for the implementation of more than 1,747 infrastructure projects in the regions during 2022-2026 years In addition, the following measures are recommended for the development of water supply and drainage enterprises: the creation of effective response systems in case of emergency situations, in particular, a logistics chain for the supply of the necessary welding and assembly resources (materials, equipment, labor, etc.); attraction of investments for the modernization of water supply and treatment facilities of the central drainage system; carrying out scientific and research works for the purpose of modernization of engineering facilities for wastewater treatment; modernization of pipeline structures and treatment facilities with the involvement of modern welding and assembly technologies and materials. In addition, in order to increase the reliability of water supply and sewage networks, it is now necessary to carry out certification and inspection of pipelines. Knowing the degree of wear and tear of the pipe wall and the service life, you can calculate the nominal pressure of the pipeline and make a decision about its replacement or rehabilitation. Using the failure criterion for \"critical\" points, it is possible to predict the complications of network operation, model redundancy for them, and optimize their operation. It is proposed to equip specialized mobile laboratories on the basis of water utilities, which allow network diagnostics and emergency cleaning of pipelines and water disinfection. Specialists of the Ministry of Development of Communities and Territories of Ukraine carried out systematic work on assessing the technical condition of water supply networks. The materials officially provided by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine served as the basis for such works. The curator of this work was the State Enterprise \"Scientific-Research and Design-Technological Institute of Urban Economy\" (Kyiv).</jats:p>"

This technological advance certainly contributes to improving the links between the various partners in the chain through the sharing and exchange of information. This chapter highlights the prominent role of technological advances in making information reliable and accessible by all partners in the chain and also in achieving the organizational performance of all partners.</jats:p>",

For MTSCs involved in perishable product distribution, blockchain technology (BCT) is one of the most promising technologies that can ensure products’ traceability and safety. This study examines a Portuguese MTSC for frozen fish products piloting BCT adoption for its supply chain (SC) practices. The goal is therefore to explore the consequences of information availability inherent for BCT adoption pilots in the SC context. This study follows a mixed-method approach, with qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. Three semi-structured interviews with players from a single frozen fish SC, including supplier, transporter, and retailer were conducted. MAXQDA Analytics Pro 2022 software was used for further coding and data analysis. An online survey among retail chain consumers was conducted resulting in 112 responses. Regression analysis and Pearson correlation test were further performed via IBM SPSS Statistics software. Data collection for both parts took place between December 2021 and July 2022. This study explores four layers in the SC– including supplier, transporter, retailer and final consumer. Findings revealed a current lack of extensive and detailed information from upper tiers regarding products’ characteristics. Despite being hyped as a “trust-enabling” technology, BCT was found not to eliminate the need for trustful relationships between players prior to adoption, as information input requires human intervention. Even in those cases when the traceability option is not of major interest to final consumers, findings revealed a higher probability of purchasing fish products that have traceable information available.</jats:p>",

A panel data, multi-equation labour supply model is estimated with correction for tax system endogeneity and multi-sample selection in a correlated random effects framework. Data come from the British Household Panel Survey. The effects of counterfactual increases in marginal tax rates are obtained from Gauss-Seidel simulations of labour supply embedded in a tax system with allowances, tax credits, and child benefits. Labour supply to the main job is reduced by increased marginal tax rates while labour supply to the second job is increased. On net total labour supply is reduced. These effects diminish with increased marginal tax rates. In addition there are labour force withdrawal effects as well as transitions from dual job holding to unitary job holding in response to increased marginal tax rates.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays fast-acting automatic transfer equipment is commonly applied in power supply systems with a motor load since it ensures uninterrupted power supply of critical consumers. However, their application requires the use of high-speed breakers. The implementation of a “high-speed” transfer to a backup power source when using vacuum switches may not be possible due to the long turn-on and turn-off times. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is relevant. The aim of the paper is to study the possibility to reduce the backup power supply time by improving the algorithm to control the vacuum switches of the main and backup power sources in the modes “high-speed” switching by the fast-acting automatic device in case of short circuits in the external power supply network. To achieve this purpose, computer modeling methods are used. They are based on mathematical models of electrical network elements written using systems of differential equations. The authors have defined the regularities of the transient processes in synchronous and induction motors when switching to a backup power source by the fast-acting automatic device in case of short circuits in the external power supply network. It makes possible to set the limit value of the mismatch angle between the residual voltage vectors on the section of the main power source and the voltage of the backup power source, at which the level of the self-starting current does not exceed the values of the starting currents. Also, it makes possible to develop an algorithm to control breakers. The proposed algorithm is based on changing the operation order of the switches of the main and backup power sources. The obtained results show that implementation of the proposed algorithm to control breakers of the main and backup power sources in fast-acting automatic devices in case of short circuits in the external power supply network of the main power source makes it possible to reduce the backup power supply time and decrease the level of self-starting currents that do not exceed the level of starting currents of electric motors without use of high-speed switches.</jats:p>",

This study examined the extent to which farm households' respond to production inputs and output price changes using panel data covering the period 2010-2016. Specifically, to determine whether a commodity output's price positively affects its supply and other output categories; and whether an input price negatively affects its usage in Nigeria within the multiple input and multiple output (MI-MO) framework. The translog profit function was used to simultaneously examine the production response of farm households' in terms of the factor demand and produce supply. Seven output supply and four input demand equations were estimated. The results indicated that the response of output supply to own price ranged from 0.59 for animal products and 1.24 for cereals. The own-price demand elasticities of farm input range from -0.82 for mechanisation to -1.46 for intermediate inputs. Also, a substantial degree of farm households' response to input price shocks. Farm inputs and outputs were economic complements to price changes. Therefore, price policy issues aimed at improving the production response of farm households' to both input and output price shocks should be developed with a particular focus on farm inputs.</jats:p>"

Today, the total capacity of water supply systems mainly for the citiescorresponds to an average rate about 300 l/day per capita. The territory of Albania consists of uneven distribution of very heterogeneous aquifers. In this article are classified and analyzed the water supply sources of the settlements, which are summarized in five groups: a) Wells in alluvial intergranular aquifers; b) karst springs; c) wells in karst aquifers; d) springs in fissured rocks, and e) mixed water sources like: karst springs, drilling wells and surface water. For each group of the water supply sources are analyzed the main concerns regarding the quantity and quality and many examples are given how are solved the problems. Beside this, some recommendations also are given for a sustainable groundwater water supply management, especially related to monitoring and control of the water supply systems and of the aquifers in general, emphasizing the transboundary aquifers as well as consequences of the climate changes. However, the main problems of public water supply of Albania remain the poor management of water supply systems which is reflected in the e high water losses, as well as the low public awareness of request for sustainable use.</jats:p>"

It is concluded that global supply, production, and value chains, although being economically efficient, are no longer any more secure under national protectionist policies, and therefore, the relocation of production processes is mainly due to the increase in the level of income and wages of the developing countries that are the destination, and which reduce the advantages to relocate.</jats:p>",

The data are collected using a questionnaire targeting 25 Jordanian manufacturing firms. The data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and correlation. The results reveal a positive relationship between supply chain management and sticky cost behavior (the correlation factor is 81.2%), indicating that the higher the level of sticky costs, the higher the supply chain management level. Moreover, the study found a positive and significant link between target costing and supply chain management (the correlation factor is 68.1%). The findings suggest that manufacturing companies in Jordan should consider the impact of sticky cost behavior on their supply chain management practices and that target costing can be an effective approach to improve supply chain management. The study adds to the previous studies on cost behavior and supply chain management, providing insights for manufacturing companies in Jordan and beyond on improving their supply chain management practices.\nAcknowledgment I want to thank Amman Arab University for funding this study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In macroeconomic policy discussions, the supply side of the economy is usually represented as a level of potential output, reflecting the real resources available for production. It is often assumed that aggregate demand and potential output evolve independently, and that the task of macroeconomic policy is to keep demand-determined output close to the level corresponding to the economy’s productive potential. A number of developments have made this representation of supply constraints less satisfactory. The failure of output and employment to return to its previous trend following the financial crisis of 2007–2009 suggests that demand-induced changes in output can have permanent effects. On the other hand, it has become clear that supply constraints come into play in response not only to increases in aggregate expenditure, but also to changes in its composition. We argue that these developments call for a reconceptualization of supply constraints. Rather than limiting the level of output, we should think of them as limiting the rate of change of output, both in the aggregate and in its composition. Substantively, we should think of supply constraints in modern economies as fundamentally reflecting limited capacity for coordination by markets.</jats:p>",

This led food waste and loss issues to new heights, thus calling for the design of effective mitigation measures. Hence, this chapter recommends the emergence of green technologies and sustainable practices as potential drivers for the food industry to reduce food waste and loss at each stage of the ecosystem and subsequently transform the entire system into a circular economy.

An autoregressive deep learning network consisting of four hidden layers is developed for the modelling of the electricity supply and demand da ta having the form of multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. The electricity supply and demand data of Türkiye is gathered from the official sources and then investigated utilizing the seasonality analysis. Then, the deep learning network is developed in Python programming language. The 70% of the available electricity supply and demand data are used as the training data whereas the remaining 30% of the data is the test data. The randomized selection of the train and test data are performed using the classes available in the SciKit-Learn library of the Python programming language. The performance of the developed deep learning network model is evaluated both by plotting the actual and the modelled data on the same axis pair and by using performance metrics of the coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and the root mean square error. The mean absolute percentage errors of the models have the values of 2.29% and 2.17% for the electricity supply and demand data, respectively, indicating the success of the developed deep learning model for the modelling and the estimation of the electricity supply and demand data.

This paper adopts the probabilistic power flow (PPF) method, which is a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) based on the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method, to analyze the uncertainties of power systems. Specifically, the available load supply capability (ALSC) based on the branch loading rate is used to analyze the safety margin of the whole system, while the improved power flow entropy is introduced to quantify the equilibrium of power flow distribution. The repeated power flow (RPF) calculation is combined with the PPF method, and, hence, the probabilistic repeated power flow (PRPF) method is proposed to calculate the power flow entropy at the initial state and the probabilistic ALSC. To flexibly control the power flow, the unified power flow controller (UPFC) is added to the AC power system. The different control coefficients of UPFC are set to reveal the relationship between power flow entropy and available load supply capability under the stochastic scenarios. Finally, the modified IEEE14 test system is used to study the adjustment abilities of UPFC. With consideration of uncertainties in the test case, the positive effect of UPFC on the power flow entropy and the probabilistic ALSC under stochastic scenarios is deeply studied.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, this study analyzed the differentiation of service supply chain, which could be hardly explained by the traditional manufacturing supply chain architecture.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach: The research method was conducted through in-depth literature review. It was intended to identify the structure and characteristics of the service supply chain through an in-depth literature review in the service and supply chain fields.\r\nFindings: The service industry is made up of a wide range of fields and has various characteristics. The characteristics of the service industry are expected to be more diverse and complicated depending on the tangibility spectrum or servitised degree of the combination of tangible products and intangible services. According to the literature review, remarkable differences were shown between the type of the traditional manufacturing-oriented supply chain and that of the logistics service supply chain in respect of industrial architecture and direction of the entities in the supply chain.\r\nResearch limitations/implications: This study cannot suggest general service supply chain types through literature review. The reason may be that it was difficult to generalize the types of service supply chains due to the diversity of the service industry and the characteristics of services that are different from tangible products. It was also difficult to apply the methodology to scientifically distinguish service supply chain to the traditional supply chain.\r\nOriginality/value: The research results of this study on the service supply chain are meaningful in both academic and practical aspects. Academically, it provides the foundation for research on the service supply chain structure. In practice, it suggests the possibility that service companies can also use supply chain management as a business strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The COVID‐19 pandemic resulted in severe supply disruptions and revenue losses, especially for buyers highly dependent on foreign suppliers. Unsurprisingly, scholars and industry experts claim that high dependence on any exchange partner is detrimental to buyers. The literature, however, is ambivalent about whether supply base concentration—the number of sources in a firm's supply base and the degree of importance of each source—benefits or harms buyers. Our study addresses this ambivalence by investigating whether supply base concentration, conceptualized as supplier concentration, supplier country concentration, and carrier concentration, worsens or mitigates the impact of supply disruptions as they unfold over time. We use longitudinal data from ocean bills of lading to examine these relationships in the context of U.S. buyers importing apparel during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Our results show that higher pre‐disruption supplier concentration and supplier country concentration helped buyers mitigate the impact of supply disruptions related to COVID‐19, with diminishing effects once supplier and supplier country concentration exceeded specific inflection points. Conversely, higher pre‐disruption carrier diversification helped buyers mitigate the impact of supply disruptions related to COVID‐19. Notably, these effects depend on the specific phase of the supply disruption. We discuss implications for research and practice.</jats:p>",

Competitors, pathogens, and insect predators are constantly evolving to combat our attempts to control them: weeds mimic the appearance of the cultivated species, more than 600 arthropod species are now resistant to pesticides, and more than 40 species plant species somewhat resistant to the commonly applied herbicide Roundup.

The use of software and information complex made it possible to calculate the parameters that provide optimal coverage of the heat load schedule of a cottage settlement based on local energy resources. For the calculation, the predicted values of the installed thermal power of the units and the heat load graph which was obtained by adapting the real annual graph of the external temperature of Stockholm to the geographical location of the Kyiv region were used. The developed new software and information complex provide an opportunity for hourly modeling, research into the optimal modes of operation of heat units, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the use of renewable energy sources in autonomous heat supply systems. In the developed software and information complex, the model of optimization of operating modes is applied, which belongs to the class of problems of optimal loading of generating capacities of power systems with the criterion of minimizing costs for production, accumulation, and consumption of thermal energy. An example of simulation results using a heat load schedule for a selected typical day is presented. The obtained results indicate a decrease in the specific cost of hourly heat supply with an increase in the part of thermal energy supplied at the expense of renewable energy sources. This is due to a decrease in the share of gas, and in general, any other generation based on fossil fuel technologies, in the total volume of heat supply. Thus, the effectiveness of the use of renewable energy sources based on local energy resources as part of the heat supply system of the cottage village was confirmed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As traditional supply chains face increasingly severe environmental issues and countries promote green development and sustainable development policy concepts, cultivating green supply chain operation models is gradually being highly valued by current governments and enterprises. Generally speaking, the production of green products incurs higher additional costs and thus their total production costs also increase. In this work, the product green level is related to the random demand. Under the green supply chain buy-back contract with the green product R&amp;amp;amp;D cost sharing between the manufacturer and the retailer, both the product green level and the order quantity need to be decided to maximize the channel profit. In order to coordinate the green supply chain, the manufacturer needs to share both the risk of good salvage and the green product R&amp;amp;amp;D cost with the retailer. We find that both the wholesale price and buy-back price increase in the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s proposition of the green product R&amp;amp;amp;D cost, but decrease in emission reduction efficiency coefficient or carbon trading price. In addition, the product green level, the optimal order quantity and the channel profit increase in emission reduction efficiency coefficient, but decrease in the R&amp;amp;amp;D cost coefficient of the product green level. Interestingly, we find that if the carbon trading price is low, the manufacturer will set a low product green level and the product carbon emission trading is a cost for the supply chain. The increment of the carbon trading price leads to a higher cost such that the channel profit is decreased. However, if the carbon trading price is high, the manufacturer will set a high product green level and the product carbon emission trading is a revenue for the supply chain. The increment of the carbon trading price leads to a higher revenue such that the channel profit is increased.</jats:p>"

Problem statement: the main approaches of ChatGPT in the recent and scarce literature are more focused on the impacts for general use, applied sciences and educational systems, which evidences a relevant gap for the management field, especially related to the supply chain area. Objectives: as a novel and initial contribution, this article aims to provide a viewpoint with the main applications and other issues regarding ChatGPT in supply chains, based on the initial discovered evidence. Methods: This viewpoint article is grounded on the few articles available in specialized magazines, blogs and company websites that approach potential applications and other issues of ChatGPT in supply chains, as a systematic literature review was not possible due to the absence of papers approaching the subject in the research databases. Contributions: this article contributes to the practitioners involved in supply chain activities who desire to have an initial and structured content related to the impacts and applications of ChatGPT on supply chains. It also seeks to encourage researchers on further research deployments in this field by presenting potential research agenda topics. Results: first evidence based on quality results from the analyzed content showed that, although it may take time until this technology evolves to a desirable level of maturity, it may be applied in different areas of supply chain management (e.g., route optimization, predictive maintenance, order shipment, customer and supplier relationships, data analysis, ordering process, automating invoices, reducing waste, workforce training and guidance, amongst others), with a potential generation of significant benefits such as cost reductions and the improvement of supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

China's total manufacturing industry has occupied the world's top position for many years in a row, becoming an indispensable link in the global production chain. In the situation of global manufacturing shift, some labor-intensive industries are gradually moving out of China as the cost of labor factors rises. The new epidemic has further accelerated the outward migration, especially in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, where many countries are concerned about the security of their supply chains due to their over-dependence on China, and some overseas countries have widely raised the slogan of \"de-Chinaization\". With the normalization of the epidemic, the acceleration of the reverse globalization process and the rise of trade protectionism, the position of Chinese manufacturing in the global value chain will be affected. According to the data, it can be found that the first thing that affects the Chinese manufacturing industry is the import and export, like Brazil, which has frequent trade with China, has a higher dependence on rubber and plastic manufacturing and a more pronounced dependence on chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing in terms of imports. The international competitiveness of China's major manufacturing industries is analyzed using the RCA-VA index.

This study aimed to ensure supply chain resilience in light of the COVID-19 pandemic through prioritizing main supply chain capabilities. After surveying (30) experts in supply chain from leading manufacturing companies in Jordan, a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) analysis was conducted to prioritize main supply chain capabilities that were derived from the related literature. The results of this study showed that proactive capabilities, followed by reactive capabilities, were the most dominant capabilities that could ensure supply chain resilience, while efficiency-based capabilities were the least significant. Therefore, manufacturing companies should place their focus and emphasis on reacting to this pandemic in a more systematic manner.</jats:p>"

In response to the current situation, the current research takes less account of the subjective perception of public panic buying and the lack of reference to the reality of effective governance. First, this paper uses prospect theory to portray the public’s perceived value of goods in panic buying and non-panic buying situations. Then, drawing on the experience of effective governance in China, a tripartite evolutionary game model of local government, the public and green smart supply chain enterprises is constructed under the reward and punishment mechanism of the central government. Then, this paper analyzes the strategic choices of each game player and the stability of the system equilibrium. The structure of the study suggests the following. (1) Improving local government subsidies and penalties, the cost of positive response and the probability of response can lead to an evolutionary direction where the public chooses not to panic buy and green smart supply chain enterprises choose to ensure a balance between supply and demand and increase pollution control in the production process. (2) Our study yields three effective combinations of evolutionary strategies, of which an ideal combination of evolutionary strategies exists. Non-ideal evolutionary strategy combinations can occur due to improper incentives and penalties of local governments and misallocation of limited resources. However, we find four paths that can transform the non-ideal evolutionary strategy combination into an ideal evolutionary strategy combination. (3) The central government’s reward and punishment mechanism is an important tool to stabilize the tripartite strategy, but the central government cannot achieve effective governance by replacing incentives with punishment.</jats:p>"

As an important form of retail trade, supermarkets have attracted the attention of the whole retail industry. At present, large, medium, and small supermarkets are facing complete market competition, and each supermarket enterprise has more or less problems in its own supply chain relationship. The problem of how to solve the problems of various types of supermarket enterprises, improve their management programs, and win the market has become particularly important. Based on the existing literature and statistical data, this paper analyzes the problems existing in the supermarket retail industry in China, focusing on the deficiencies of the current supply chain and how to manage and optimize the supply chain. The result shows that the supply chain in domestic supermarkets still has a long way to improve. There are mainly five types of problems, which are supplier problems; delivery problems; location problems; display problems; and pricing problems. These kinds of problems might cause the loss of customer loyalty. The solution consists of three parts: diversifying the product supplier to ensure that the popular product never runs out; replacing the products shelf so that the customer can grab the popular product at first sight; and replacing the products shelf so that the customer can grab the popular product at first sight. Finally, be precise with the products pricing strategy; stress the price of the popular products and increase the profit for the unpopular ones.</jats:p>"

When the location information of logistics vehicles and objects is known, in order to plan the most suitable vehicle scheduling route and realize the optimization objective of logistics transportation, we allocate resources to the goods in the logistics by using genetic algorithm, and calculates the individual fitness through the fitness function, so as to judge the individual's advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, the genetic algorithm model is mainly used to find the optimal solution in the process of data analysis. Also, in order to avoid the increase of operation time caused by too many iterations in the process of operation, this paper also analyzes the data by combining the related theories of quantum computing. The parallelism of the combined algorithm model is improved, the complexity of operation is reduced, and the operation speed can be improved. In order to further improve the accuracy of system identification, this paper also selects the hidden Markov model, predict and correct the data of logistics supply chain, which solves the problems of complicated operation caused by large data volume. After analyzing the basic requirements of logistics transportation, this paper designs a real-time logistics supply chain tracking model based on cloud computing technology, including order management, vehicle scheduling management, sorting management and other modules. After testing, the availability of the system under large operating pressure is determined, and the requirements for basic hardware are low.</jats:p>"

However, proximity in the context of supply chain represents an important construct that lacks a clear conceptualization and needs further research. In this paper, we contribute to the body of literature on proximity as well as that of supply chain by proposing an extension to existing proximity frameworks and incorporating a new dimension of supply chain proximity. We conduct a systematic review of supply chain and other relevant literatures, summarize key findings, and present a new multidimensional framework of proximity, inclusive of supply chain management. We discuss methodological issues, and outline research suggestions for different streams of literature.</jats:p>",

The current on the load coil of EAST fast control power supply is affected by various uncertain environmental factors, making it difficult to establish a standard mathematical model for prediction. Accurate object model is not required in grey prediction, and only a small amount of known information is needed to achieve short-term prediction of output current. Grey prediction has been studied and applied in EAST fast control power supply to some extent. To further improve prediction accuracy and accelerate output current response speed, an improved grey prediction algorithm is proposed to achieve output current prediction. Considering the control delay in digital control, the output current of the next period is predicted using the sampled original sequence. Following the principle of new information priority, an original sequence transformation operator is proposed to weight new information. The predicted output current in the next period is added to the original sequence while removing the oldest original sequence, to achieve rolling prediction of the output current in the next two periods. The control value of the output current is loaded one switching period in advance, further improving prediction accuracy while compensating for control delay. The output gain of proportional integral (PI) control is adaptively adjusted based on the error between the predicted current and the reference current, and the improved grey prediction variable gain PI control achieves fast and accurate control of the output current. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control method has high prediction accuracy. Compared to traditional PI control and grey prediction control, the proposed control method can effectively improve the output current response speed.</jats:p>"

In particular, the contribution deals with how to ensure the supply of energy from renewable sources for cultural assets and buildings that are part of historic centers. In these cases it can be very difficult to achieve both the objective of protecting the monument or landscape as well as that of installing or connecting the building or urban or rural settlement to renewable energy sources. Through some European and Italian examples in particular, where about 8 million buildings were constructed before 1945, about 25% of the total, virtuous ways will be presented that make it possible to achieve both objectives simultaneously. The regulations that favor this dual objective will also be highlighted, such as the one of the Veneto Region on so-called energy communities and the national one that allows the deferral of energy production from one place of cultural interest to another that has none, without serious costs for the final beneficiary and safeguarding the cultural asset.</jats:p>"

However, doing so often incurs higher costs for carbon emission reduction (CER), which can worsen the capital-constrained problems faced by manufacturers operating within a retailer-led supply chain. To address this challenge and optimize CER efficiency within limited funds, we propose a two-echelon supply chain model led by a retailer. We then analyze six different scenarios, including no financing, bank loan financing and retailer credit financing, both with and without CER investment, to identify optimal strategies for each situation. The results show that: (1) Increasing interest rates on bank loans and retailer credit will have a negative impact on the CER efficiency and retailer's profits. (2) If the initial funds are below a certain threshold, a higher interest rate on bank loans will reduce the manufacturer's profits. However, as the initial funds increase, a higher interest rate can improve the manufacturer's profits with the retailer's credit financing strategy. (3) The manufacturer's optimal financing strategy depends on both the interest rates and initial funds, while the retailer's credit decision is solely based on the manufacturer's initial funds. (4) The retailer credit financing strategy can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome by adjusting the interest rate of the retailer credit, thereby improving the CER efficiency and relieving financial pressure. However, the bank loan financing strategy does not have this advantage.</jats:p>"

The digital economy promotes enterprise supply chain network status through the information transmission effect and technological innovation effect. Compared with digital economy industries, state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in coastal areas, the development of the digital economy has a greater positive role in promoting the position of the supply chain network of traditional industries, non-state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in inland areas.

In addition, we observe a lack of research in the oil and gas industry especially in Developing Countries when we know that this industry is the most lucrative and polluting. Therefore, this paper’s purpose consists to make a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 38 papers published from 2005 to 2023 especially in oil and gas industry and in Developing Countries, in order to make a clear distinction between SSCM and GSCM while highlighting the practices related to them and at the same time, generating a united theory which will bring together the triple bottom line of the SSCM. As findings, the authors built a Conceptual Framework that applies the triple bottom line of the SSCM in oil and gas industry by demonstrating that GSCM which is more related to environmental issues and is a part of the SSCM. Therefore, in order to be more efficient and to have a great impact on their performances, Oil and gas companies should apply SSCM practices rather than GSCM practices which are very different from what is applied in Developed Countries because of certain barriers and pressures.</jats:p>"

Circular supply chain, offers a new and compelling perspective to the supply chain sustainability domain. Therefor having proper solution approach for circular supply chains is of great value. To this end, in this paper suitable solution approaches has been presented for a multi-echelon, multi-product, multi-period and multi-objective mixed integer linear programing. This model is designed for a circular closed-loop supply chain that considered digital devices. The conflicting objectives of the model are to minimize total costs on the entire chain and environmental pollution and to maximize total rate of unemployment reduction. The Epsilon-constraint method is proposed to solve small size of the problem. A Pareto set of optimal solutions helped to assess the trade-offs involving the three objective. Because this problem is of NP-hard category, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to find near optimal Pareto front for large size of the problem. To demonstrate the efficiency of the metaheuristic algorithm the answers obtained in small dimensions are compared with the answers obtained from the Epsilon-constraint method. The results show that the error percentage of the objective function compared to the epsilon method in all solved problems is less than 1%, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Reducing the solving time especially in the large dimensions of the problem is one of the advantages of this solution method. Using these methods allows decision makers to provide a set of efficient optimal solutions so that they can select the best point, according to the available budget and their organization policies.</jats:p>"

A supply chain encompasses the process of acquiring and distributing commodities, while logistics pertains to the transportation, warehousing, and overall handling of resources and products. Both commercial and emergency supply chains encounter various obstacles, however they may derive valuable insights from one other's tactics and business models. Logistics comprises several components, including transportation, storage, inventory management, packaging, and information processing. The primary objective of logistics management is to effectively coordinate the availability of appropriate resources, ensuring their timely delivery to the designated destination. Supply chain management is a strategic approach that combines essential business activities in order to enhance value for both customers and stakeholders. Supply chain management encompasses the harmonization of several entities, including suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, transporters, retailers, and consumers, with the objective of fulfilling client demands while simultaneously reducing expenses. There is a prevailing agreement among scholars that SCM and logistics constitute a crucial area of study. However, it is noteworthy that there is a scarcity of literature evaluations pertaining to this subject matter. This study aims to identify and discuss prominent topics in contemporary research by conducting a comprehensive literature assessment from the standpoint of operations management.

Another problem is limited availability of information. Specifically, companies lacking modern IT systems are constrained to rely on historical sales observation as their sole source of information. This paper employs and contrasts a selection of mathematical models for short-term demand forecasting for products whose sales are characterized by high seasonal variations and a development trend. The aim of this publication is to demonstrate that even when only limited empirical data is available, while other factors influencing demand are unknown, it is possible to identify a time series that describes the sales of a product characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations and a trend, using selected mathematical methods. This study uses the seasonal ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model, ARIMA with Fourier terms model, ETS (exponential smoothing) model, and TBATS (Trigonometric Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with Box–Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal component). The models are presented as an alternative to popular machine learning models, which are more complicated to interpret, while their effectiveness is often similar. The selected methods were presented using a case study. The results obtained were compared and the best solution was identified, while emphasizing that each of the methods used could improve demand forecasting in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The interaction effect of crop water requirement (CWR) and soil texture on water productivity was evaluated in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, China. A field experiment with two scenarios of compost application (0, 25 ton/ha) and three levels of irrigation policies (deficit irrigation (DI = 0.75CWR), regular irrigation (RI = CWR), and full irrigation (FI = 1.25CWR)) was planned in three replications during 2021–2022. Water productivity was simulated as a criterion to improve the irrigation time for increasing the final biomass. Four strategic crops including potato, corn, wheat, and barley were incorporated into the daily simulation system. Furthermore, a machine-learning random forest algorithm was used to find the best irrigation times. The results showed that the use of adjusted irrigation time and improved soil texture can increase water productivity by reducing evaporation and deep percolation and increasing actual biomass. Estimation of irrigation time in a learning-based method will be optimal when plant growth and soil moisture are monitored on a daily basis.</jats:p>",

The solutions of the original equations system are obtained under the assumption of neglecting the term that takes into account the effect of the flow rate variation along the path. The analysis uses the concept of an infinitely long distribution drainage pipeline, which is laid with a slope, or, what is the same, an inclined pipeline with an infinite filtration capacity of the side surface walls. Series of calculations of the main pipelines characteristics at different slope values were carried out according to the proposed formulas. Corresponding graphic dependencies were constructed for clarity. It is shown that the geometric slope of the pressure distribution drainage pipeline, the resistance factor and the generalized parameter A significantly affects the design parameters of such pipes.</jats:p>"

The evidence for the multiple-case studies was collected through semi-structured interviews, where the interviewees were SC experts from four manufacturing companies and one service company. The data analysis was performed in two phases. In phase one, the case study protocol was completed, and in phase two, thematic analysis was used to identify supply chain response (SCR) patterns. The results revealed two aspects of the SCR. First, to respond to a stimulus, SC adapted activities other than those of suppliers and manufacturers, such as product design and development, human resources, budgeting, and logistics. Second, the SCs used several alternatives to respond to the stimuli. This study contributes to two aspects of the SCR literature: (1) it documents the identification, detection, planning, and evaluation of SCR in response to a stimulus, and (2) it proposes the concept of the response alternatives. The response alternatives concept facilitates decision-making and resource management in SCR.</jats:p>"

However, the outcry for net-zero emissions compels the sector’s supply chain to a minimum 55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below the 1990 level by 2030 and zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This study examines a European environmental sustainability path toward a green commercial aviation supply chain. Driven by literature and a review of related documents, two propositions were advanced to orient perspectives on the relationship between pollution and the commercial aviation supply chain and actions being taken toward environmental sustainability. In semi-structured interviews, seventeen aerospace associates endorsed pollution sources in the commercial aviation supply chain during the four stages of the aircraft life cycle, including extracting the raw materials, manufacturing, ground and flight operations, and end-of-service. They recommended transitioning into green commercial aviation through the widespread deployment of innovative technologies, from modifying airframes to changing aviation fuel, utilizing alternative propulsion systems, adopting circular manufacturing, and improving air traffic management.</jats:p>"

Under the macro trend of reducing carbon emissions, there is a close connection between regional carbon emissions and corporate supply chain decisions. However, there exist few researches on the relationship between \"regional carbon emissions\" and \"downstream and upstream supply chain concentration of firms\". In view of this, this paper empirically analyses the impact of regional carbon emissions on the decision of downstream and upstream concentrations of firms, using the panel statistics of A-share listed firms in Shenzhen and Shanghai between 2008 and 2020 as the research samples. The findings show that regional carbon emissions have a significant heterogeneous impact on the downstream and upstream supply chain decisions of firms, reducing the upstream concentration of firms but strengthening the downstream concentration of firms. The mechanism analysis illustrates that regional carbon emissions decrease upstream supply chain concentration by forcing local firms to increase green innovation and weaken corporate governance and increase downstream supply chain concentration by raising the financial constraints of local firms. This paper not only enriches the field of research on influencing factors in corporate supply chain decision-making but also serves as a reference for the construction of green supply chains in the background of carbon neutrality, thus having significant practical implications as well as policy implications.</jats:p>"

During the construction of the model, a GIS map of the OpenStreetMap resource was used, which allows you to add coordinates of objects and build routes as close as possible to real ones.\nThe imitation model was built for the Antonov Serial Plant and seven Ukrainian airports, which need spare parts for aircraft maintenance and repair twice a week. The order comes from the airport to the factory via notification. After that, the truck is loaded, the maximum number of cars for transportation is seven. The time for loading and unloading is two to three hours. After receiving the spare parts, the airport notifies this enterprise by the message «Delivered!». Then the truck is sent back to the enterprise.\nDuring the development of the simulation model, the single agent for the factory «Manufacturing», the population of the agent «Airport», which contains a collection of airports with their coordinates, the population of agents «Truck» and the agent type «Order» are created.\nThe process of placing an order for new spare parts is described, given that each airport sends a request of the same form. The logic of order processing by the plant is described, which takes into account: receiving an application, time for loading the truck, sending it to the customer, unloading the truck, notification of delivery and returning the truck to the company.\nAn optimization experiment was created and conducted to minimize the number of cargo vehicles for the supply of spare parts to Ukrainian airports, the loading of which is no more than 85%. The results of the experiment showed that the best allowable value for the use of resources is about 64% when using 2 trucks.

The cost effects of sidelong parcel approaches in a store network organization with a single stock source and different brick and mortar stores are examined in this work with the aid of a created model. Crisis sidelong parcels or, at the very least, the development of an item among the areas at a similar echelon level due to material shortage might help the retailers, who potentially differ in their lead time and request boundaries. In general, an interest is anticipated to be lost or delayed in being bought if it occurs in a location where there is no stock nearby. However, in this case, parallel parcels serve as a crisis supply in the event that a stock out occurs. The parcel rule states to constantly send when there is a shortage at one location and stock nearby at the other. A major finding is that, in terms of cost reduction, a horizontal parcel approach is significantly superior to one using no such parcels, though at the expense of increased transportation movement. Additionally, with the help of the model developed and after addressing the model problem, we finally realized the benefits of sidelong parcel in terms of an increase in client administration level and overcoming the vulnerability of interest and lead-time.</jats:p>"

The use of water resources is of particular importance. They are a strategic, vitally important natural resource, the national wealth of every country, one of the natural foundations of its economic development. In addition to reasonable consumption, it is necessary to promote the preservation, restoration and reuse of water resources. One of the many methods of effective and at the same time the most natural management of water resources is \"green\" constructions. These are biotechnological means that combine building structures and living plants. This paper examines the implementation and creation of \"green\" roofs for the collection, accumulation and re-use of rainwater. The chemical composition of water after passing through the \"green\" roof, as well as ordinary rainwater from the roof of the building of the residential complex \"Respublika\" was analyzed. Water sampling was carried out in December 2021 during rainfall. It is shown that the concentration of impurities in wastewater from \"green roofs\" does not exceed the permissible values for drinking water. In addition, financial costs for the construction of conventional and \"green\" roofs were presented. Additional costs for the creation of a \"green\" roof will be 20.89% of the total cost of materials and 63.49% of the total cost of works for the construction of a stationary roof. Means for reuse of rainwater on \"green\" roofs are considered. It is shown that thanks to the retention of water by the layers of the \"green\" roof with an area of 490 m2, it is enough to provide a tank with a volume of 150...250 dm3. Data on the volume of used water for technical needs (irrigation) from Faina-Town residential complex in Kyiv are provided. It is shown that the accumulated rainwater is sufficient to meet the needs for watering the adjacent territory.</jats:p>"

Here, the original logistics data obtained from the manufacturer is sanitized with an optimal key generated by using the PCGS optimization algorithm, avoiding the risk of unauthorized access and data swarm that causes the system to lag. Moreover, the sanitized data obtained from the manufacturer is transmitted to the allowed parties via different sub-chains. The same generated key is used on the receiving customer side for reconstructing the original information from the sanitized data. The performance and results of the proposed blockchain-based privacy preservation model are validated using various parameters.</jats:p>"

Especially in the case of sudden load increase, virtual synchronous generator bears too much load in the transient process because of its fast adjustment speed, and even causes short-term overload, which makes the capacity of virtual synchronous generator can not be fully utilized. In view of this problem, firstly, the mechanism of transient power uneven distribution of two heterogeneous power sources is explained from the differences of frequency modulation, voltage regulation and output impedance. Secondly, virtual speed regulation, virtual excitation and dynamic virtual impedance are added to the traditional virtual synchronous generator control to simulate the speed regulation characteristics and electromagnetic transient characteristics of the synchronous generator, so as to realize the transient and steady-state power equalization between heterogeneous power supplies when the virtual synchronous generator and the synchronous generator run in parallel. Thirdly, in order to ensure the fast dynamic response characteristics of the virtual synchronous generator in independent operation mode, the traditional virtual synchronous generator control algorithm is still maintained in independent operation mode, and the mode switching control link based on state tracking is designed to realize smooth switching between the two working modes. Finally, the hardware in loop experiment results based on RT-LAB show that the proposed control method can realize the transient and steady-state power equalization when the virtual synchronous generator and the synchronous generator operate in parallel, it can keep the fast voltage regulation and frequency modulation ability when the virtual synchronous generator operates independently, and can realize smooth switching between independent and parallel operation modes.</jats:p>"

Governments around the world hope to use new energy vehicles to alleviate air pollution and energy shortages and achieve sustainable economic development. As a leader in China's new energy vehicle industry, BYD has not only achieved good results in China, but also has a certain share in foreign markets. As a leading enterprise in the new energy vehicle industry, BYD fully relies on its advantages in scale and actively explores the development mode of the whole industry chain of new energy vehicles. According to the analysis, BYD's market share is high and its sales volume has repeatedly hit record highs. Although its operating capacity has declined owing to the impact of the epidemic, it is still in a leading position in the industry. BYD has a large enterprise and a good momentum of development and its vertical supply chain system has also enhanced its competitive edges. Suggestions are proposed to reduce dependence on the government and improving product positioning. These results shed light on guiding further exploration of the further development of BYD.</jats:p>"

The challenges associated with each stage are highlighted, and the potential of metaheuristic optimization methods to address these challenges is discussed. The primary method of green hydrogen production, water electrolysis through renewable energy, is outlined along with the importance of its optimization. Various storage methods, such as compressed gas, liquid hydrogen, and material-based storage, are covered with an emphasis on the need for optimization to improve safety, capacity, and performance. Different transportation options, including pipelines, trucks, and ships, are explored, and factors influencing the choice of transportation methods in different regions are identified. Various hydrogen consumption methods and their associated challenges, such as fuel cell performance optimization, hydrogen-based heating systems design, and energy conversion technology choice, are also discussed. The paper further investigates multi-objective approaches for the optimization of problems in this domain. The significant potential of metaheuristic optimization techniques is highlighted as a key to addressing these challenges and improving overall efficiency and sustainability with respect to future trends in this rapidly advancing area.</jats:p>",

Estimation is undertaken using a directional distance function that accounts for the presence of adjustment costs associated with investments in quasi‐fixed factors of production. A bootstrap regression is then used to determine the factors affecting dynamic productivity change and its components. Results show that the sample cooperatives experienced a modest decline in productivity over the study period, on average. The analysis of productivity change decompositions suggests that productivity decline is mainly due to the negative contribution of technical inefficiency change. Results further reveal that ignoring adjustment costs when modeling cooperatives' performance leads to distortions in estimates of productivity and its components. The regression analysis results show that years of operation and a higher share of energy products in supply turnover are positively related to productivity change, technical inefficiency change, and scale inefficiency change.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There are several definitions of BIM available from Wikipedia to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that more or less consistently describe BIM as follows: a process or method of managing information about objects and projects to coordinate inputs and outputs using shared digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of any built object, including buildings, bridges, roads, industrial facilities. Despite the common definition, we often observe that BIM has different meanings to different people. There is no single international standard or definition of the activities that must be performed within a project to be considered a BIM project. Very often we come across the idea that BIM is a software, a 3D model or a system. This inconsistency creates confusion and disagreement between government customers and private sector providers, creating barriers to successful implementation. Experience from the EUBIMTG suggests that a clear and specific definition of measures and characteristics, combined with a phased implementation of the strategy in a realistic time frame, has proven to be the most promising approach to the successful transformation of the construction sector. The following \"EU Common Performance Level\" characteristics describe the activities that must be consistently performed within a project to be considered an EU BIM project. They should be considered as minimum criteria for the procurement and implementation of construction projects consistently throughout Europe. The implementation of BIM design in the process of higher education in Ukraine is just beginning, especially in the area of designing engineering networks. If BIM design courses for future architects are the norm rather than the exception, it is difficult to find suitable specialists, let alone teachers, in the area of designing water supply networks.</jats:p>"

It is proposed to evaluate the parameters of turbulent flows based on the indicators of molecular and turbulent viscosity with the introduction of the conditional relative thickness of the boundary layer into the calculations. The dependencies of the logarithmic law of the distribution of averaged velocities in the cross-sections of pipelines have been clarified. Unlike similar formulas of the semi-empirical theory of turbulent motion, they correspond to the boundary conditions on the pipeline wall. New theoretical dependencies between the main parameters of turbulent flows in pipelines were obtained. It is proved that the magnitude of the coefficients of hydraulic friction is determined by two parameters: the conditional relative thickness of the boundary layer and the proportionality factor, which takes into account the change in tangential stresses in the turbulent flow. The adequacy of the obtained dependencies is confirmed by their correspondence to the experimental data of the hydraulic dependencies of turbulent flows, on the basis of which the current standards for hydraulic calculations of water pipes were developed. For hydraulically smooth pipes, an explicit dependence was obtained for hydraulic friction coefficients in a wide range of Reynolds numbers (from 7 10³ to 10⁷). It almost completely corresponds to the well-known Prandtl-Colebrook’s formula, which has an implicit form. Numerical values and analytical dependencies between parameters of turbulent flow in hydraulically smooth pipelines are determined. It was established that with an increase in the Reynolds number, the values of both the conditional and absolute thicknesses of the boundary layer decrease, and with the increasing of the pipe diameters, they grow. It is shown that the thickness of the boundary layer depends on the type and magnitude of the roughness of the inner surface of the pipes and it is decisive when other parameters of turbulent flows in pipelines are evaluating.</jats:p>"

The seller offers a credit policy to the buyer to increase sales for a particular growing item (fish), and in this paper, it is assumed that the buyer accepts the policy of the trade credit. In this paper, the buyer acquires the newborn items (fish) from the seller and then sells them when the newborn items have increased their size and weight. From this point of view, the present paper reveals a fuzzy-based supply chain model that includes carbon emissions and a permissible delay in payment for defective growing items (fish) under the effect of learning where the demand rate is imprecise in nature and is treated as a triangular fuzzy number. Finally, the buyer’s total profit is optimized with respect to the number of newborn items. A numerical example has been presented for the justification of the model. The findings clearly suggest that the presence of trade credit, learning, and a fuzzy environment have an affirmative effect on the ordering policy. The buyer should order more to avoid higher interest charges after the grace period, which eventually increases their profit, while at the same time, it is also beneficial for the buyer to order less to gain the benefit of the trade credit period. The fuzziness theory controls the uncertainty situation of inventory parameters with the help of a de-fuzzified method. The lower and upper deviation of demand affects the total fuzzy profit. The effect of learning gives a positive response concerning the size of the order and the buyer’s total fuzzy profit. This means that the decision-maker should be aware of the size of the newborn items, rate of learning, and trade credit period during the supply chain because these directly affect the buyer’s total fuzzy profit. The impact of the inventory parameter of this model is presented with the help of sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

Their application, however, has historically been limited in the North American context owing in part to their costly implementation and operational challenges. Both to overcome these barriers and to demonstrate the benefits of DMAs, a leakage testing programme was undertaken in Ontario, Canada. Novelty arises from the development and deployment of a mobile testing unit specifically designed to collect minimum night flow (MNF) and pressure data into temporarily configured DMAs. Moreover, activation of a pressure reducing valve facilitated the direct testing of pressure modulation on leakage reduction. The mobile unit was deployed in 22 DMAs across eight water systems with results indicating a clear relationship between MNFs and system characteristics for well-performing DMAs. MNF benchmarks were quantified to enable an evidence-based assessment of leakage performance at the DMA level in typical Canadian water systems. This project established the proof-of-concept of the mobile unit for providing both accurate and reliable measurements of key leakage performance characteristics and for predicting leakage reduction following system interventions.</jats:p>",

The GSCM practices examined are green design, green purchasing, green production, green marketing, environmental management, and recycling. A research model was developed to test the relationship between six GSCM practices and the three sustainability performance dimensions by using a shipyard-level survey. Environmental uncertainty was placed in the model as a moderator variable. The authors utilized a web-based survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The research revealed that the GSCM practices were positively significant for economic and social performance but not for environmental performance. Environmental uncertainty did not have a moderating effect between GSCM practices and sustainability performances.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In multitier supply chains, brand-owners often form exclusive deals with downstream retailers or upstream suppliers. Therefore, the selection of exclusive channel strategies becomes a critical decision for brand owners, resulting in three typical structures: a flexible structure, an exclusive retailing-channel structure, and an exclusive purchasing-channel structure. This paper contributes to the literature by formulating these three representative channel structures in a three-tier supply chain. Both observable and unobservable contracts are considered in each structure. We build game-theoretical models and derive the equilibrium outcomes under observable and unobservable contracts. We find that the exclusive retailing channel is more beneficial for brand-owners, regardless of whether the contracts are observable or unobservable. Additionally, the exclusive retailing channel benefits the entire supply chain more than the exclusive purchasing channel when the level of channel substitutability is low (high) under contract observability (unobservability). With regard to the effect of contract unobservability, we find that it can benefit brand-owners when the level of channel substitutability is low, but it can harm them when the level of channel substitutability is high. Furthermore, we explore the effects of channel substitutability and demonstrate that brand-owners’ performance can be positively and negatively affected by the channel substitutability under contract unobservability. Our findings provide operational strategies for brand-owners to form exclusive channels in a multitier supply chain.</jats:p>"

This lack of study can also be seen in law and regulations that have not anticipated the existence of the Smart-Contract method.

The results of this study explain that the potential risks of implementing Smart-Contract technology not only have an impact on financial aspects but also produce risks resulting from program failures or system errors. This system failure has the potential to be misused and endanger the interests of the parties involved in it. Indonesian legislation in electronic transactions has not specifically regulated the risk of failure or error in the smart contract system.

Applying a cost-minimizing electricity system model including options to invest in eleven different flexibility measures, and cost-efficient combinations of strategies to manage variations were identified. The results of the model were post-processed using a novel method to map the net load before and after flexibility measures were applied to reveal the contribution of each flexibility measure. The net load was mapped in the space spanned by the amplitude, duration and number of occurrences. The mapping shows that, depending on cost structure, flexibility measures contribute to reduce the net load in three different ways; (1) by reducing variations with a long duration but low amplitude, (2) by reducing variations with a high amplitude but short duration and low occurrence or (3) by reducing variations with a high amplitude, short duration and high occurrence. It was found that cost-efficient variation management was achieved by combining wind and solar power and by combining strategies (1–3) to manage the variations. The cost-efficient combination of strategies depends on electricity system context where electricity trade, flexible hydrogen and heat production (1) manage the majority of the variations in regions with good conditions for wind power while stationary batteries (3) were the main contributors in regions with good conditions for solar power.</jats:p>"

The main goal of the water price mechanism is to solve the problem of water resource allocation under the pressure of water supply and demand and realize the sustainable development of agricultural economy (AE). Faced with the dual pressure of rising water demand and declining water supply, many regions have begun to reform the water price mechanism and use the CGE model for scientific and reasonable resource allocation. To this end, this paper analyzed the drawbacks and the factors of WR pricing mechanism and used the CGE (Computable General Equilibrium for short here) model to study the upper limit of the pricing of resources, and then analyzed the problems of WR CGE model in agriculture, and finally optimized the problems. According to the experimental analysis, the pricing mechanism of WR under the CGE model can reasonably allocate resources, reduce water demand and promote the development of AE.</jats:p>",

The methodology for the synthesis of a high-molecular polymer, which by adjusting the ratio of the components of its composition and the conditions for obtaining new proper structures, determines such parameters as hydrophilicity, selectivity and permeability, along with the main chemical and physicochemical properties. A number of polymer materials that differ in chemical and thermal resistance have been determined, as well as new approaches to creating a thin barrier layer for both asymmetric and composite membranes. Micrographs of the structure of microfiltration polysulfone membranes are presented. The results of experimental studies of the obtained samples of multilayer composite membranes are given. The curves of the dependence of the selectivity of multilayer polymer membranes on such operating parameters of the reverse osmosis process as time and operating pressure are shown.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability and decarbonization are growing trends in the energy industry, and electric utilities are no exception to that trend. Currently, 29 out of the 30 largest utilities in the United States have some type of net‐zero carbon goal, committed to reducing and offsetting their emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050, with some utilities committing to achieve it by 2030. Initial decarbonization efforts focused on meeting these goals by reducing direct (Scope 1) emissions from generation or indirect (Scope 2) emissions by purchasing emission‐free electricity. However, net‐zero commitments and growing requirements for emissions disclosure are driving emission reductions throughout other utility operations, in particular utility supply chains. Scope 3 emissions, or emissions driven by a firm's supply chain, make up the majority of emissions at most organizations. Because of this, companies across industries, including the utility industry, have increased focus and resources to begin reducing Scope 3 emissions to reach their net‐zero goals. Given the large number and diversity of utility suppliers—companies that supply utilities with a product or service—decarbonizing utility supply chains presents significant challenges for utilities and their suppliers. Despite these challenges, there has been significant progress in the last few years in identifying the best practices to ensure companies realize success in reducing Scope 3 emissions within their operations.</jats:p>",

With stock-outs, transportation problems and the bullwhip effect caused by ever-changing demand, it is necessary for decision-makers to review their supply chain configuration. The latter must adapt to new market changes and respond quickly and cost-effectively to customer requirements. In fact, the selection criteria of the most reconfigurable configuration, i.e., the configuration that adapts its structure and its functions to the new market changes, must respond to this problem. The aim of this paper is to conduct a literature review of the criteria and methods for configuration selection in reconfigurable manufacturing systems and reconfigurable supply chains. This study allows to define a roadmap for the configuration selection in reconfigurable supply chains based on the most efficient reconfigurability criteria. We provide new trends to consider in this selection problem. This paper allows managers to choose the most appropriate criteria to implement a reconfigurable supply chain.</jats:p>"

The role of green, grey, blue and white water footprints in yield production has been critically investigated to analyze the climate and economic risks. Therefore, a nonlinear hydro-economic framework, which integrates soil water content, food production and economics has been used for the semi-arid regions of China. Non-dimensional form of net benefit per drop was formulated to analyze the uncertainty of economic parameters. Root zone moisture was simulated to estimate crop yield, transpiration, evaporation, water required for irrigation and increase water quality. Five plants of potato, onion, tomato, eggplant and carrot were selected due to similarity in the plant growth season and market criteria. The results showed that the average effective rainfall contributed less than 15% to food production. The impact of the risk of economic fluctuations in achieving the expected net profit has been more than water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research presents a theoretical justification and offers guidelines about the organization of logistical oversight concerning the structural-functional aspects of managing the evolution of integrated supply chains. The study demonstrates that the preconditions for logistically organizing these structural-functional and dynamic management aspects of functioning and growing integrated supply chains are marked by an exceptionally high level of diversity in key influencing factors. This diversity is further compounded by heterogeneity and conflicting interests of the involved stakeholders, necessitating the creation of a dual-loop mechanism for supply chain logistical management. The viability of establishing a logistics governance system based on the organizational forms of integrated supply chains is argued. Such a system mandates adherence to differentiated requirements concerning the structural organization and dynamic regulation of economic collaboration. The research identifies that deepening integration among supply chain participants while expanding competitive development prospects for such enterprises introduces emergent risks to their effective business operations. It is ascertained that the economic justification for enhancing cooperation and scaling partnership relations is directly contingent upon the capability of the partnership participants to align and balance the intricate web of economic ties within the supply chain. This is based on devising an appropriately complex management mechanism for the developed supply chain. Establishing a distinct functional set of managerial tasks associated with logistics governance as a foundation to ensure consistency and coordinated actions in organizing the flow-process interaction of partnership entities facilitates the institutional anchoring of organizational practices in guiding the growth of integrated supply chains. The study concludes with a summarization of characteristics defining the formation of a logistics governance system for organizing integrated supply chains</jats:p>",

Intraoperatively, the anomalous artery was first divided. Indocyanine green (ICG) was subsequently injected intravenously to evaluate blood perfusion within the abnormal lung area. Since the abnormal area was still poorly perfused after a few minutes, a left basal segmentectomy was performed because of the possibility of complications.

The complexity of methodologies developed in recent decades for balancing exploration and exploitation activities of digital transformation has risen. Still, the desired integration levels across organizational levels were often not reached. Systems thinking promises to holistically consider interdisciplinary relationships and objectives of various stakeholders across supply chain ecosystems. Systems theory‐based concepts can simultaneously improve value identification and aligned transformation among supply networks’ organizational and technical domains. Hence, the study proposes synthesizing management science concepts such as strategic alignment with enterprise architecture concepts and artificial intelligence (AI)‐driven business process optimization to increase innovation productivity and master the increasing rate of business dynamics at the same time. Based on a critical review, the study explores concepts for innovation, transformation, and alignment in the context of Industry 4.0. The essence has been compiled into a systems engineering‐driven framework for agile value generation on operational processes and high‐order capability levels. The approach improves visibility for orchestrating sustainable value flows and transformation activities by considering the ambidexterity of exploring and exploiting activities and the viability of supply chain systems and sub‐systems. Finally, the study demonstrates the need to harmonize these concepts into a concise methodology and taxonomy for digital supply chain engineering.</jats:p>",

We conceive an intermediate input to be more relevant for a downstream buyer if a negative shock to that input's productivity affects that buyer more. In particular, in our framework, the relevance of any input depends on: (i) the network position of the supplier relative to the buyer, (ii) the patterns of intermediate input intensities connecting the buyer and the supplier, and (iii) the competitive pressures along supply chains. After we compute the Input Rank from both the U.S. and the world input–output tables, we provide useful insights into the crucial role of services inputs as well as on the relatively higher relevance of domestic suppliers, and suppliers coming from regionally integrated partners. Finally, we test that the Input Rank is a good predictor of vertical integration choices made by 20,489 U.S. parent companies controlling 154,836 subsidiaries worldwide.</jats:p>",

Geography’s input is, then, to place these issues within the space of economic activity and life, linking these to an analysis of resources. Geography also provides for the construction of models for the spatial relations between different actors. In turn, analysis from a geopolitical point of view, inter alia, involves itself in the study of dependency and power through reference to relations which entail domination, the exerting of influence, independence or mutual dependence, territorial integrity, development, political and social stability, and security (Dallanegra Pedraza 2010). Then there are the issues concerning the use of natural resources, as these affect relations between states, thus representing research topics for geography. Through the analysis of the interactions between variables which recall the aforesaid relations, it has here proved possible to construct models describing, or helping to account for, present-day world relations, characterised by dependence on fossil fuels (as raw materials supplying energy) which originate in Russia. This process makes use of available statistical data and reports, including ENERDATA 2021 and Key World Energy Statistics 2021, from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).</jats:p>",

Micro-CT pulmonary and bronchial arteriography were performed to demonstrate the blood supply of early lung adenocarcinomas, especially the tumor–vessel relationships, and the findings were correlated with the pathology results.

Micro-CT showed that the pulmonary artery was densely distributed in and around tumors in 141 (84%) of 167 early lung adenocarcinomas, the bronchial artery was not related to tumors, and there were four patterns of tumor–pulmonary artery relationships that correlated well with pathologic findings. Quantitative and texture analyses showed that the tumor size had positive correlations with vessel volume (VV), VV fraction (VVF), vessel thickness (VT), vessel number (VN), inverse difference moment, long run emphasis, gray level nonuniformity (GLN), and run length nonuniformity (RLN) and negative correlations with vessel separation (VS), inertia, and short run emphasis (SRE); the size of the solid component had positive correlations with VV, VVF, VT, VN, GLN, and RLN and negative correlations with VS, cluster shade, and SRE.

This study, hence, is carried out using an exploratory case study research method, and the data have been collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews with key informants from managerial levels of 20 Australian SMEs of clothing retailing businesses to identify various supply chain risks and their management processes. This study finds five supply chain risks, namely supply risk, demand risk, financial risk, environmental risk, and operational risk, that the SMEs of clothing retailers mostly face in the supply chain. This study also finds that most of the investigated retailers lack a formal risk identification approach, though they informally use the reactive and proactive methods of risk identification. Furthermore, the assessment methods are not well established in most of the participating firms, and supplier monitoring receives more attention compared to their own performance to deal with their supply chain risks. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by being one of the first empirical studies to explore the SMEs of clothing retailers’ supply chain risks and their management processes in the Australian business context, which can add value in guiding supply chain design decisions for SMEs in other sectors.</jats:p>"

The burden of this issue disproportionately affects young children, with 40% of foodborne disease cases occurring among children under the age of 5. It's worth nothing that malnutrition is also a significant problem in the region, and poor sanitation practices exacerbate this issue. Approximately 50% of malnutrition cases stem from unhygienic practices and life-threatening infections, such as diarrhea, rather than a poor diet. In these situations, a well structured integrated platform is required to monitor the food supply chain straight from the producer to consumer in a way that other government authorities can track the quality of the products of different producers.

The results of the research using the Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN) approach, it can be concluded that the supply chain for peanuts for consumption already has clear targets, the relationship between actors is structured, but has not been managed properly in terms of business processes that have not been integrated in the long term. In peanuts, the seeds of collaboration between actors have been well established in terms of information disclosure, cooperation and integration between supply chain actors. Besides that, business processes run structured with good management. The results of supply chain performance analysis through the farmer's share received by farmers in each channel where the value of the farmer's share in peanuts for channel 1 is 46.88 percent, channel 2 is 45.45 percent and channel 3 is 50.00 percent. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the peanut supply chain for channel 3 is more efficient than the peanut supply chain for channels 1 and channel 2.</jats:p>"

Surface sediments were collected from the Ganjiang River in Nanchang, China, and the adsorption characteristics of heavy metals Zn(II) and Pb(II) under different hydrodynamic conditions were simulated using the particle entrainment simulator. The results showed that under different hydrodynamic conditions, the adsorption equilibrium of Zn(II) and Pb(II) can be reached within 6h, and the adsorption amount of Pb(II) by the sediment was significantly higher than that of Zn(II). Pseudo-second-order dynamics and the Elovich model can better describe the kinetics of adsorption in both metals (R2 &amp;gt; 0.90). The Langmuir model and Freundlich model could better simulate the adsorption isotherms of Zn(II) and Pb(II) on sediments, which revealed that the adsorption spots are heterogeneous. According to the △G and −F results the adsorption of Zn(II) and Pb(II) is mainly physical adsorption. Furthermore, there are certain differences in the adsorption of heavy metals Zn(II) and Pb(II) by sediments at different pH, where the adsorption amount of Zn(II) increases with the increase of pH, but Pb(II) is not sensitive to the change of pH.</jats:p>",

We aim to estimate the costs of the BT-based PSC model, select algorithms with minimum prediction errors, and determine the cost components of the model. After the data generation, we applied four Supervised Learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine, and naive Bayes) combined with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (ant colony optimization and the firefly algorithm). We also used the Feature Weighting approach to assign appropriate weights to all cost model components, revealing their importance. Four performance metrics were used to evaluate the cost model, and the total ranking score (TRS) was used to determine the most reliable predictive algorithms. Our findings show that the ACO-NB and FA-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in estimating the costs of the model with lower errors, whereas ACO-DT and FA-DT show the worst performance. The findings also indicate that the shortage cost, holding cost, and expired medication cost more strongly influence the cost model than other cost components.</jats:p>"

The article presents the study of the influence of dust and gas emissions from a factory for the production of mineral fertilizers on cotton plants in Uzbekistan. The composition of technogenic dust deposited on plant leaves has been determined. The chemical composition of the above-ground and underground organs of cotton at different distances from the source of pollution has been established. The radius of aerial dispersion of industrial emissions was best described by measurements of the fluorine content in washed and unwashed cotton leaves. Empirical models have been developed that describe the relationship between P, K, Mg, Ca, S, F, and Mn in plant roots and leaves depending on the distance to the pollution source. The results of biometric observations were summarized and the yield of raw cotton was established. Zones of different levels of technogenic load on cotton plants were identified. It has been shown that the resistance of cotton against aerial pollution by acid gases (SO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S) from the emissions is determined by the ability of cotton plants to neutralize toxic compounds of their transformation by increasing the influx of alkaline earth metals to the affected tissues. This study showed the possibility of growing cotton in the vicinity of the fertilizer factory. Despite the resistance of cotton to industrial pollution, monitoring of areas identified as impact zones is recommended.</p>"

Among them, the first problem is the core problem. This paper attempts to design an innovative ASC structure to solve these problems. Firstly, from the perspective of farmers, this paper analyzes the agricultural sustainable development of network embedding, and draws the following conclusions: with the increase and deepening of farmers’ network embedding relationship, farmers can obtain more effective information about the whole agricultural sustainable development, and finally improve their profit distribution ratio. But how to increase this network embedding relationship? To solve this problem, we introduce the platform theory and consider redesigning ASC by embedding the integrated management information platform (IMIP). Then, we made a mathematical analysis. Through the comparison of absolute value and relative value, we find that the innovative structure can not only increase the amount of effective information that farmers get from ASC, but also increase the total amount of information from all stakeholders and the proportion of farmers’ information in the total amount of ASC information. In view of this, we believe that the innovative structure of ASC can effectively solve the problems existing in the traditional ASC structure.</jats:p>",

In this study, we proposed a domain adaptation method to generate minor-category samples (pipeline-burst samples in general) of arbitrary pipe networks utilizing theoretical hydraulic models. The proposed method transferred pipeline-burst data generated from a random water supply network with theoretical hydraulic models to an actual imbalanced dataset. Accordingly, we established a machine learning model exploring a mapping matrix between two domains for minority-category data transfer. The experimental validation first verified the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method between two customized water supply networks in terms of their bust recognition accuracy, model parameter sensitivity and time efficiency. Then, an actual monitoring dataset from a working water supply network was used to prove the suitability and compatibility of the proposed method.

The demand projections were computed using simple growth rate model under the assumptions of 6, 7 and 8 per cent GDP growth rate representing low-, moderate- and high-income growth. Results indicated that in both India and Nigeria increase in income do not cause any significant increase in the demand for cereals.  It is concluded that India would be a self-sufficient in rice, wheat and maize with deficit in sorghum for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively. On the other hand, Nigeria would be plunging into a huge deficit in rice, wheat and a marginal surplus in maize and sorghum for the year 2030 with deteriorating deficits in the years 2040 and 2050 in rice, wheat, maize and sorghum respectively. In the study period, there would be surplus of cereals in the India with exception of sorghum; these prospects need to be strengthened and expand to sorghum through vigorous expansionary production programs as well ensure more availability, accessibility and affordability of cereal among poor families of India.  For Nigeria to meet the future food requirements, the country shall have to either increase agricultural production, or depend on imports. As such, the paper suggests that the policy focus needs to be lunched, towards massive production, productivity enhancement in agriculture, through public investment in irrigation, credit facilities, research and extension.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that decentralized supply chains enable local partnerships and drive value creation via increased exchange of products and services that also better align with community needs. Our supply chain intervention resulted in a reduction in waste disposal costs for the retailer and a greater supply of food for the food bank. We study the private–public partnership (PPP) in retail food recovery in two successive phases. The first exploratory phase incorporates qualitative data from key informants at multiple Feeding America partners across the United States. The second phase was a researcher‐led supply chain intervention involving multiple stakeholders and executed with our partner food bank. Our intervention, Pantry Direct, represents a transition in the PPP to a decentralized, community network. It shifts the pickup responsibility for retail food recovery to a purely volunteer workforce at the pantry. Retail store management noticed lower pickup service reliability; however, more frequent interactions between food pantry volunteers and retail store employees improved communication, which overshadowed the limitations of the volunteer workforce. Owing to several factors, the gain in PPP performance was not universal. Among the five retail stores that participated in the supply chain intervention, two increased food donations and two others decreased food waste. The Pantry Direct model is transformative in the fight against food insecurity, as increased volume (and quality) of retail food donations enabled downstream pantries to provide end clients with more adequate, consistent, or appropriate access to food.</jats:p>",

The supply chain system refers to the entire supply and demand network formed from the supplier to the end user. It gradually extends the manufacturer's side to consumers and becomes a large, complete, complex, multi-functional, interrelated and mutually influencing whole, enabling it to better integrate social resources and information, thereby improving market competitiveness. At the same time, the establishment of the supply chain system also enables enterprises to respond more flexibly to market changes, so as to maximize their own value. In the context of the new economic era, how to adapt to and solve the problems and challenges faced by the traditional retail industry has become a topic that needs to be studied and discussed urgently. Under the new retail wave, the comprehensive transformation and upgrading of the supply chain management model of enterprises can not only make the supply chain process of the enterprise more scientific, reasonable and efficient, which requires us to comprehensively transform and upgrade the supply chain management model under the traditional model.

The reduction in the plant height due to cultivation conditions rather than genetic properties of the genotypes occurred because of the decreasing length of upper internodes by 0.47-9.51%. Structural components of the product were determined. The greatest reduction in above-ground dry biomass per unit of the field was detected in Barakatli 95 and Garagylchyg 2 genotypes. The amounts of pigments were determined to evaluate the level of the photosynthetic apparatus development, its physiological state, formation and accumulation potential of the product. The content of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids was determined during the grain forming, milk ripening, and wax ripening phases. Green plastids were broken down and chlorophyll content decreased under drought. Chlorophyll a content decreased more sharply compared with chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll a content decreased more sharply in all phases in the durum variety Barakatli 95 (during the phases, respectively, 19.7; 16.6 and 35.6%) and bread variety Gyrmyzy gul 1 (21.9; 15.3; 39.5%). Chlorophyll b amount decreased less in the durum variety Tartar (11.0; 7.30; 14.2%) and bread variety 4th FEFWSN-50 (4.83; 10.8; 9.20%).

Biogas, as an analogue of natural gas, is used in production of thermal and electrical energy, as transport motor fuel, as a raw material for chemical industry.\r\nAn analysis of trends in intensification of methane fermentation processes was carried out. A promising way to increase productivity of methane generation process during processing of organic matter is to increase the energy saturation of an organic substrate and its preliminary treatment. One of the approaches aimed at intensifying methane generation is use of organic waste as an auxiliary substrate for fermentation of sewage sludge – a process known as co-fermentation.\r\nThe sediments of primary and secondary settling tanks of the biological wastewater treatment complex were studied. According to results of tests, it was noted that ratio of carbon and nitrogen in the studied excess activated sludge is 4–5, in the mixture of primary and secondary sediment – 5–6, in sediment from sludge sites – 6–10, which is significantly less than desired ratio of 20:1, which limits the negative impact of increased nitrogen content in the organic substrate for methane fermentation. According to obtained data, it can be predicted that nitrogen-containing compounds present in sewage sludge will contribute to a microbiological process of formation of nitrogen-containing reduced products, which reduce output of methane during methanogenesis.\r\nThe expediency of enriching the inoculated biocenosis with hydrolytic enzyme preparations or microorganisms with high hydrolytic activity is shown, given the fact that activated sludge has a lower hydrolytic activity than enzyme preparations isolated from the same sludge, as well as than some bacteria, and even more so microscopic fungi. This was caused by presence of inert organic and inorganic mass, dead microorganisms and those with low hydrolytic activity in the sludge biomass. It is also possible to increase speed of the first phase of sediment fermentation due to alkaline pretreatment of the substrate mixture.</jats:p>"

Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic has been attacking Indonesia violently (since March 2, 2020), disrupting the supply chain of the fish cultivation business. The negative impact is a decline in revenue significantly. Mino Ngremboko Cultivator, for instance, has been affected by the pandemic with an average revenue (demand) loss of 50-70 percent. In addition, business resilience becomes very crucial which comprises business continuity that represents the ability of businesses to rapidly adapt and respond to the pandemic crisis (EIB, IBRD, 2022). The objective of the study is to assess the resilience and supply chain integration of the Mino Ngremboko Cultivator in facing the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. Method this study uses the inductive-qualitative approach through a case study of Mino Ngremboko Cultivator. Data was collected through unstructured interviews and observation from November  2020 to March  2021. The study results provide three constructive insights, especially for managing Mino Ngremboko Cultivator and Fish Cultivator Group in general for sustaining their businesses. (1) Supply chain resilience is relatively good, which was shown by the average of productivity 1,10 from March 2019 to March 2021; (2) supply chain integration of fish cultivation business was not optimally implemented yet, and (3) Pokdakan Mino Ngremboko's business recovery strategy to optimise the practices of supply chain integration based on the digital marketing as well as downstream and commercialisation the output of fish cultivation. These recovery strategies require the support of improving organisation capability and stakeholder alignment to contribute to sustainable development (benefits for the social and ecological environment) in 2022 and beyond.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify the factors directly affecting the competitiveness of logistics companies providing last-mile delivery service under a consumers’ perspective. The study employs a best-worst method (BWM) to assess which alternative and which criteria are the preferred ones when selecting a last-mile service provider in Vietnam. The selected criteria include shipping cost, lead-time, customer service, insurance policy and delivery liability, and the alternative are three last-mile service providers namely GHN, GHTK, JT, the largest logistics companies operating in Vietnam. The study findings reveal that GHTK company is the most competitive last-mile service provider compared to the others due to outstanding intrinsic characteristics and competitive advantage. In particular, the findings of the paper show that customer value \"Delivery cost\" as the most important criterion in domestic last-mile delivery whilst \"Customer Service\" is the least important one in the Vietnamese market.</jats:p>"

Due to various uncertainty volatility, ambiguity, and intricacy, the sustainability of supply chain becomes a major topic for organisations. Now there is need to integrate the digital technologies like cloud computing, internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data analysis etc. which improve the performance of supply chain in efficient and responsiveness manner. Due to this digital integration, the system undergoes various changes at organisational, operational, performance and technological level. This study aims to identify nine major critical factors which are enablers to achieve the sustainability in digitally integrated supply chain. A TISM model is developed to address their interrelationship among them. The factors are classified as dependent and independent factors according to their driving and dependence power through the use of the MICMAC analysis. If is confirmed in MICMAC analysis that the factors Agile Organisational structure, Smart logistics Capabilities, Smart Manufacturing Process and financial planning enhance the sustainability of digitally enabled supply chain. This study provides a comprehensive list of enablers that are necessary to achieve sustainability of digitally integrated supply chains; nevertheless, the list is not exhaustive. This paper was written with the intention of contributing a pool of knowledge on achieving sustainability in digitally integrated supply chain.

Typical designs to measure these asymmetries select, often arbitrarily, a small set of news items as experimental stimuli without clear reference to a “population of information.” This pre-registered study takes an alternative approach by, first, conceptualizing estimands in relation to all political news. Second, to represent this target population, it uses a set of 80 randomly sampled items from a large collection of articles from Google News and three fact-checking sites. In a subsequent survey, a quota sample of US participants (n = 1,393) indicate whether they believe the news items to be true. Conservatives are less truth-discerning than liberals, but also less affected by the congruence of news.</jats:p>",

The reconfiguration problem for a 118-node test distribution network is solved using a high-speed algorithm involving the construction of a maximum spanning tree on a network graph as the basis for determining information about the composition of branches and chords of independent circuits necessary to restore power following disconnection. To ensure acceptable voltage levels following power restoration, additional reactive power sources determined using singular Jacobian matrix analysis methods are installed in the sensor nodes of the network. For the test circuit, the modes for single disconnections of individual sectional switches, including in dead-end sections, are analysed. By optimally reconfiguring the network in the normal mode, it is possible to reduce voltage deviations from 13% to 7%. For the modes caused by disconnections of individual bus section circuit breakers that lead to unacceptable voltage deviations, the set-down locations and reactive power of additional sources are selected. In the most severe of the considered disconnection scenarios, the installation of additional sources provided a reduction in voltage deviations from 18 to 8%. Thus, the methods proposed by the authors make it possible to restore the test network mode following emergency disconnections and ensure that the voltages in the network nodes are maintained within acceptable limits, both in normal and in post-emergency modes.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the genetic algorithm is improved, the solving steps are designed, and the validity of the model and the algorithm are verified by example analysis. The results show that as long as the LNG price does not exceed 120% of the LSHFO price, the LNG dual-fuel ship can still reduce the fuel cost during the voyage. The lower the LNG price, the larger the LNG fuel tank capacity and the higher the proportion of fuel cost saved.

The purpose of this consumer-centric study is to examine the spillover effect of an upstream incident in the supply chain on consumer perceptions of a retailer’s reputation and consumer repatronage intention. Specifically, this study explores two factors that may impact consumer perceptions: location of the incident within the retailer’s supply chain and the severity of the incident. Study 1 tests the spillover effect on the retailer’s reputation and repatronage intention using a two-tier supply chain and two relative extremes of severity. Study 2 examines how a retailer through messaging could dampen the spillover effect following an upstream incident. Our findings provide insight regarding when and how consumer perceptions regarding a retailer’s reputation may change following an incident in the retailer’s supply chain and how those perceptions can be influenced by effective messaging. Collectively, our results offer initial theoretical insights into the concept of a supply chain (vertical) reputation commons.</jats:p>",

The results show an exponential growth in SSCM research since 2013 with 6,306 authors from 83 countries published in 675 journals; however, less attention is given to developing economies (DEs) and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The findings provide a useful direction for future research and theory development in SSCM, allowing scholars and businesses to implement true CE by addressing practical sustainability issues relevant to their operations and supply chains. This bibliometric analysis is the first study providing a holistic overview of SSCM research trends in developed countries (DCs), DEs, and MSMEs, and arguing for inter-disciplinary CE discourses and inter-organizational collaboration in SC to update and implement CE.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent developments in the world economy have substantially increased  interdependence among nations, due to which no nation can isolate itself  completely from the rest of the world. Internationalization of production  has resulted to mutual exchange of goods, services, technologies, people  and investment, generally called as supply-chain trade. These processes  have dramatically influence structure of production networks in global  economy. Traditional domestic production networks have been replaced  by much modernized global ones. The trade that is taking place through  international networks is associated with momentous of global economic  changes. These global supply networks have several economic and non economic effects particularly on the business organization involved and  generally on the economies/nations as a whole. Trading pattern of world  economy has also experiencing changes under the influence on these supply  chains. This paper highlights the role of recent global supply chains in  changing pattern of world trade. Evidences from literature reveal that recent  global supply chains have had a significant effect on pattern of world trade  as Newly Emerging Economies (EMEs) are emerging as manufacturing  trading partners which was not even dreamt about few years back during  1970s and 1980s. Role of supply chain to make these changes incidental is  multidimensional and immense. Paper also highlights role of transnational  corporations (TNCs) in coordinating global trade through creation of global  supply chains and importance of these chains as instrument of trade policies  for firms in developing nations. </jats:p>"

However, the problem of financing constraint is always the shackle that restricts the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. As a strong support for national development, the integration of the real economy and the financial supply side has been in constant friction. Efforts should be made to create a sound financing ecology, and further promote the solution of the financing difficulties of the real economy, especially for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. In reality, the shortage of operating capital is always the main factor restricting the improvement of enterprise operation performance. In view of this situation, supply chain finance is regarded as an effective way to solve the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises by the theoretical circle and the industrial circle. Supply chain finance, as a new financing solution, helps to optimize the allocation of resources and funds between the upstream and downstream organizations of the supply chain, and gradually becomes an important way to alleviate the shortage of operating funds for small and medium-sized enterprises. This paper systematically reviews the relationships among supply chain finance, supply chain integration, enterprise digital transformation and enterprise operation performance, and reviews the information asymmetry theory and transaction cost theory.</jats:p>"

However, Batam City is the economic center of the Riau Islands and absolutely needs enough raw water supplies to support its development. The need for raw water in Batam City is predicted to reach about 6,630.29 l/s in 2025. Due to the population growth that is estimated to reach about 1.8 million people in 2025 and the plan of Batam City development as an industry and tourism center, Batam City is faced with the condition that reservoir management becomes a very important thing for supporting the continuity of water supply. The methodology consists of collecting the supporting data, such as inflow, reservoir capacity curve, and data on water needs; then building the optimization model by determining the objective function and constraints of the integrated reservoir; and carrying out the optimization model by using linear programming and simulation models for the integrated reservoir operation. The result presents optimal reservoir operation of the integrated Duriangkang-Muka Kuning reservoirs. The reservoir operation consists of the boundary curve of upper and lower normal operation, the outflow for fulfilling the water need, and the rule of supply pumping from Duriangkang reservoir to Muka Kuning reservoir. It is hoped that the result can be used as a reference in operating the two reservoirs to fulfill the water needs of the Batam City population. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2023-09-04-07 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

On this basis, the pipes' dimensions and the water tank's volume are determined. The operating pressure of the water supply network inside the building is calculated to overcome the height difference and the friction inside the pipes and provide sufficient pressure to operate the most remote fixture.  The most important results of the research are that the optimal use of the water distribution network inside the buildings is achieved by the correct design and implementation using skilled labor, materials, and devices of high quality and rationalization of water consumption by the user.\n </jats:p>"

Exploring the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for shoot and grain Zn accumulation would help to develop barley cultivars with greater Zn accumulation efficiency. In this study, two glasshouse experiments were conducted by growing plants under adequate and low Zn supply. From the preliminary screening of ten barley cultivars, Sahara (0.05 mg/pot) and Yerong (0.06 mg/pot) showed the lowest difference while Franklin (0.16 mg/pot) had the highest difference in shoot Zn accumulation as a result of the change in Zn supply for plant growth. Therefore, the double haploid (DH) population derived from Yerong x Franklin was selected for the identification of QTL for shoot mineral accumulation and biomass production. A major QTL hotspot was detected on chromosome 2H between 31.91–73.12 cM encoding genes for regulating shoot mineral accumulations of Zn, Fe, Ca, K and P, and the biomass. Further investigation demonstrated that 16 potential candidate genes for mineral accumulation, in addition to a single candidate gene for shoot biomass were found in the identified QTL region of this study. The genomic region identified in this study could be a useful resource for the improvement of mineral nutrient composition and yield potential in future barley breeding programs.</jats:p>"

This vastness of supply chains impacts business competitiveness since it adds complexity and can difficult securing traceability, chain of custody and transparency. We propose that assuring chain of custody and traceability via Blockchain (BC) allows organizations to demonstrate product provenance, integrity and compliance. This work proposes that to effect true traceability the more complete approach is to connect both the Supply Chain Actors (SCAs) and products identifications using digital certificates. A Blockchain is used to manage the traceability of products and validation of the identities. Importing, verifying and storing the certificates uses an off-chain data storage solution for products certificates, IDs and data (i.e., WalliD) . To create, validate the certificates and setup the chain of trust a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) was designed as part of the proposal. Our study follows a Design Science research approach aimed to analyse the requirements and propose a solution to a more complete traceability in supply chains. The results were architectural artifacts, including an Ethereum Smart Contract and a PKI based certificate authentication system. The implementation of these deliverables allow for a supply chain system that can provide decentralized and trustful assurance of the provenance, chain of custody and traceability functionalities for all the Organizations and also for the final consumers.</jats:p><jats:p>To exemplify the problem and demonstrate the applicability of the solution, its potential and benefits we applied it to a real food supply chain use case that already uses provenance certificates and stored them in the blockchain using the before mentioned SmartContract to assure and demonstrate the chain of custody and traceability of the food produce.</jats:p>",

The Firebase platform-based mobile app enables users to view the water levels in each tank and operate the motor. The water supply system is designed to manage the water supply efficiently, prevent water wastage, and ensure the water levels in all tanks are continuously monitored in real time. The four ultrasonic sensors measure the water levels, and the L298N motor driver module operates the submersible motor pump. The system regularly checks the water levels and activates the motor pump when the water level in any of the sub-tanks falls below a certain threshold level. Once the water level reaches the upper threshold level, the motor pump is deactivated. Users can view the water levels in all tanks on the mobile app and operate the submersible motor pump manually.

The empirical outcomes suggest that GSCP positively and negatively affects BP. The positive influence points out that high GSCP might boost the international bitcoin market, driving BP to rise, which indicates that “digital gold” could resist the pressures of global supply chain. But the negative effect of GSCP on BP could not support the above view, mainly affected by the weak purchasing power and more valuable assets, which is not consistent with the assumption of the inter-temporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). In turn, GSCP is adversely affected by BP, highlighting that the international bitcoin market may be viewed as a stress reliever for the global supply chain.

Companies often experience problems with losing sales profits if export demand tends to increase, because companies have not maximized their inventory management. So by using a three-level supply chain management approach, namely the level of finished products, the level of processing and the level of raw materials, it is important to ensure the availability of finished products at any time. Through this approach, the average amount of raw material needed for production of each PND product is PND 26/30 of 12,333.33 kg/month, 31/40 of 75,416.67 kg/month, 41/50. 28,750 kg/month, 51/60 42,250 kg/month, 61/70 21,083.33 kg/month, and 71/90 11,083.33 kg/month. so that the company's service level for PND finished products is above 100%, which is an average of 111,39%.</jats:p>",

Potable water, sinks, faucet aerators, showers, tub immersion, toilets, dialysis water, water baths, eyewash stations, and dental-unit water stations have all been linked to nosocomial outbreaks. This study aimed to determine the microbial profile and pattern of antibiotic resistance in the water supply of a tertiary care hospital in Uttarakhand.\r\nMaterials and Methods: This is a 1-year prospective study which was carried out by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Sri Mahant Indersh Hospital (SMIH), Dehradun. A total of 154 water samples were collected from the AC outlets, ventilators in the Intensive care unit (ICUs), Operation theatre (OTs), and High dependency unit (HDUs), scrub sta- tions, pantry, and blood bank, patient’s bathroom, private ward, septic ward, labour room, transplant unit, laboratory, scope rinse water, the dialysis unit and tank throughout the hospital, including tap water (pre and post flush [25%]), tap swabs (24%), drinking water (9%), AC outlets (13%), and other areas (3%).\r\nResults: 30 of the 154 (19.5%) water samples tested were culture-positive. The most contaminated water samples were tap swabs (27%, n = 8/30). A total of nine organisms were isolated, of which the most predominant was Pseudomonas aeru- ginosa (40%; 12/30), followed by Legionella pneumophila (13%; 4/30), Acinetobacter baumanii (10%; 3/30), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%; 3/30), Escherichia coli (7%; 2/30), Enterococcus faecalis (7%; 2/30), Aspergillus flavus (7%; 2/30), Stenotrophomonas (3%; 1/30), and Fusarium spp. (3%; 1/30). Gram-negative bacilli and non-lactose fermenting (GNB and NLF) showed a high rate of contamination, 53.3% (n = 16/30). P. aeruginosa showed resistance to gentamicin and amikacin (42%), imipenem (50%), levofloxacin (58%), and colistin (25%), while Acinetobacter baumanii showed resistance to genta- micin and amikacin (67%), minocycline (63%), and levofloxacin, imipenem and colistin (33%).\r\nConclusion: The study's findings show that a variety of microorganisms are contaminating hospital water supplies and can be a source of hospital-acquired infections. A suitable and robust surveillance program for hospital water supplies, as well as strict adherence to infection control practices, is strongly advised.</jats:p>"

Considerable efforts have been made by the government, NGOs and researchers in generating, introducing and disseminating appropriate potato technologies to boost the production and productivity of potato. The objective of this study was to identify the status and performance of potato seed supply and factors that determine potato seed supply system in West Arsi zone. A multi-stage random sampling procedure was used to select 120 sample potato producers and 21 traders using probability proportional to size. Descriptive statistics and econometric model were used to analyze data. In West Arsi zone, informal, and alternative potato seed systems co-exist which accounts for 83.71 and16.29%, respectively. Access to market information and credit service plays an important role in accessing of improved potato seed supply system by smallholders’ farmers. Therefore, any interventions that make farmers access to above mentioned service of the households have better enhances farmer’s access to potato seed in the area. Farm income effect farmer’s access to potato seed supply system. Therefore, household farm income should be increased to enhance access of potato seed supply systems. Meanwhile land allocated for potato production and potato yield obtained have a positive effect on farmers access to potato seed supply system. Therefore, land allocated for potato production should be increased by using rent-in and shared-in land to enhance access of potato seed supply systems and potato yield have to be increased by using different agricultural technologies.</jats:p>"

Ensuring the reliability of an IESS power supply is an important issue associated with the operation of these systems that are responsible for the safety of people, accumulated property, natural environment, and cooperating structures—e.g., storage facilities. IESSs are operated under harsh external or internal environmental conditions. In such a case, we are dealing with processes of beneficial or adverse impact, which actively affects IESS operation. The IESS operation process is also associated with ensuring power supply continuity under normal operating conditions. This also means ensuring transition to backup power supply systems in the event of failures. Therefore, an IESS should exhibit high reliability related to the power supply process. To this end, the article presents two representative IESSs operated in buildings and in a vast area. The analysis covered the processes of power supply from basic energy sources (BES) and backup sources in cases of failures. The further segment of the article describes developed models of these power systems with acceptable and unacceptable technical states associated with an IESS power supply. The last section of the article defines a model and graph of a selected IESS operation process and describes a conducted computer simulation associated with operational safety. Such an operation process analysis enabled drawing conclusions that can be utilized throughout the entire IESS operation process.</jats:p>"

This study used a series of methods such as the InVEST model, spatial autocorrelation, and coupling coordination degree models using Liangjiang New Area as an example to quantifiably quantify both regional ecosystem services supply and demand at the county and district levels. Determine the land's spatial ecological restoration zones and present the optimization strategies based on the supply-demand matching and coordination relationship. The results revealed that: (1) A considerable difference was identified between the supply and demand of ecosystem services in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing, with \"high in the northeast and low in the southwest\" spatial patterns for supply and \"high in the southwest and low in the northeast\" spatial patterns for demand. (2) The supply-demand matching relationship of ecosystem services in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing was characterized by spatial mismatches of high supply and low demand and low supply and high demand, with an average coordination degree index of 0.2, indicating uncoordinated supply and demand. (3) Based on the supply-demand relationship of ecosystem services, the regional ecological base, and the functional orientation of upper planning, the Liangjiang New Area was divided into four zones: high supply-low demand, low supply-high demand, and high supply-high demand zones, for which the respective optimization strategies were presented.</jats:p>"

A numerical method is introduced that ensures the smooth dynamics of the cell network and allows for relative numerical cheapness while reproducing the effects typical of more complex approaches such as the elongation of cells toward low-pressure regions and their tendency to maximize the contact area. Simulations of free tumor growth, restricted only by the stress generated within the tumor, demonstrate the influence of the tissue hydraulic conductivity and strength of cell–cell interactions on tumor shape and growth rate. Simulations of compact tumor growth within normal tissue show that strong interaction between tumor cells is a major factor limiting tumor growth. Moreover, the effects of normal tissue size and strength of normal cell interactions on tumor growth are ambiguous and depend on the value of tissue hydraulic conductivity. Simulations of tumor growth in normal tissue with the account of nutrients yield different growth regimes, including growth without saturation for at least several years with the formation of large necrotic cores in cases of low tissue hydraulic conductivity and sufficiently high nutrient supply, which qualitatively correlates with known clinical data.</jats:p>"

The concentrations of pH, alkalinity, Escherichia coli, nitrite manganese, and iron in the groundwater of built-up areas were found to exceed the limits set by the World Health Organization. The groundwater quality distribution contained 69.6% of good water, 19.6% of the excellent class, and 10.8% of the poor class. The high potential of groundwater, particularly in the Lake Tana shoreline sedimentation areas, revealed the poor quality class.

While technology is frequently interrelated with finance, it has several favorable applications in non-financial industries such as food and power. By make use of blockchain technology, it is feasible to generate enduring, attainable, and empirical data of products as they proceed through the supply chain. This improves the capability to track the products, guarantee their legitimacy and morality, and do so in a more cost-efficient manner. The possible advantages of using blockchain in agribusiness were also debated, as well as the case for executing a blockchain based small business in the automotive manufacturing industry. This project prefers to outline work of block chain technology in the field of supply chain. As an endeavor to cooperate with the physical one, we support a track of the journey of the supply chain products from producers to consumers. The user can access a complete documentation and confidence that the information is on target and precise. Block chain technology demonstrate to be useful in the supply chain zone in the following ways: diminish mistakes, reduce product retards, delete fraud activities, enhance management, improve consumer or supplier belief</jats:p>"

To curb the capacity surplus, the government put forward a sweeping proposal of “supply-side structural reform,” although without any specifics of implementation. This vagueness has resulted in fragmentation between China's central leadership and local agents. Based on two rail delivery services – China Railway Express Delivery (<jats:italic>Zhongtie kuaiyun</jats:italic> 中铁快运, CRED) and China–Europe Rail Freight (<jats:italic>Zhong–Ou banlie</jats:italic> 中欧班列, CERF) – this article argues that fragmentation in authority has allowed and even encouraged local actors to carve profit-making opportunities out of the excess capacities (including idle assets). In so doing, they give substance to what would otherwise be hollow policy rhetoric. Such subnational entrepreneurialism and the resulting tacit dynamics between state and local-level actors add another layer to the fine-grained theorization of fragmented authoritarianism in China: despite fragmentation, China's authoritarian governance endures, but with outcomes now shaped by a cyclical process of decentralization and re-centralization as well as continuous central–local interplay.</jats:p>",

This disruption of the EU border regime took place for different, even opposite reasons than the so-called ‘crisis’ of 2015, which is also known as the ‘long summer’ of migration. Indeed, where the latter originated from migrants’ massive appropriation of mobility, the disruption of 2020 resulted from state-imposed restrictions on mobility. However, by comparatively analysing two models of work organisation in the agro-industrial sector, characterised by a strong reliance on mobile labour and thus particularly affected by the border lockdowns of 2020 (harvest of crops in Italy and meat processing in the Netherlands), I argue that states’ response to the disruption of border regime in 2020 relied on a pre-existing logistical approach in migration management, adopted in the aftermath of 2015. More specifically, during the pandemic the ethical minimalism intrinsic in the logistical approach allowed a decoupling of migrant workers’ right to mobility, on one hand, and social and economic rights, on the other, thus resulting in increased discipline in the workplace, exposure to infections, exploitation, and dependency on the employer, to which migrant workers opposed more or less visible forms of resistance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of the work is to use a stochastic model of quasi-stationary modes of water supply network to reduce excess pressure in the water supply network by establishing pressure regulators at the entrances to the selected zones. The subject of research in the article is the optimization of the structure of water supply network by zoning. The article discusses the task of optimal zoning of water supply networks, which consists of two subtasks: allocation in the water supply network of isolated zones of nodes with excess pressure exceeding a given value; calculation of the parameters of pressure regulators installed at the entrances to the selected zones. A method based on the breadth-first search method is proposed for zone selection. The deterministic equivalent of this problem is solved using the Newton and Nelder-Mead methods. As a result of solving this problem, we obtain the minimum required values of the pressures stabilized at the outlets of the regulators and the maximum allowable values of the flow rates through them. To determine the minimum and maximum values of the ranges of flow rates and pressures at the inlets and outlets of the regulator, the forecast of the maximum and minimum water consumption by all categories of consumers in the selected zone is carried out and the problem of optimal load distribution between the pressure regulators is solved. As a result, we obtain a range of changes in the optimal flow rates through the regulator and the values of pressure stabilized at the output of the regulator. Based on this information, the type of regulators is determined that provides the necessary ranges of pressure changes at the inlets and outlets of the regulators for the minimum and maximum predicted costs through the regulator and the minimum allowable pressure at its inlet. The following results were obtained: calculations show that, using zoning and installation of pressure regulators at the inlets to isolated zones of the water supply network of the structure under consideration, it is possible to reduce the mathematical expectation of the total excess pressure in the network by 21%. Conclusions: the paper proposes a mathematical model for the problem of optimal zoning of the water supply network, based on a stochastic model of quasi-stationary modes of its operation, and a method for solving this problem. A computational experiment carried out for a water supply network of a given structure showed that as a result of installing pressure regulators at the entrances to the selected zones, it is possible to increase the efficiency of its operation.</jats:p>"

In particular, the impact of M&amp;As in a supply base depends on the concentration and differentiation of the supply base, which affects power–dependence relationships in the supply chain. This study examines the effect of supply base M&amp;As on focal firms’ cost of goods sold (COGS). In addition, this study explores the role of power relationships by investigating the moderating effects of supply base concentration and differentiation. Using secondary panel data assembled from four different data sources, this study constructs econometric models and empirically examines the relationship between supply base M&amp;As and focal firm cost efficiency. Our findings indicate that supply base M&amp;As are positively associated with focal firm COGS. This result suggests that potential efficiency gains from M&amp;As in supply bases may not translate to benefits for the focal firm because suppliers may also gain bargaining power from M&amp;As. However, the effect of supply base M&amp;As on focal firm COGS is attenuated when the supply base is less concentrated in terms of their transaction percentage with suppliers and more differentiated in terms of industry and business scopes. These are situations where suppliers less effectively obtain or employ bargaining power from M&amp;As. These findings make important contributions to the operations management literature. </jats:p>",

India is responsible for 7.39 per cent of total world agricultural production. But the agricultural supply chain used in India is inefficient and caters less to the producer. Farmers who are the producers get very less profit from selling their produce. It is estimated that about 80 percent of the profits are secured by the middlemen who have significant control over the agriculture trade in the country. The lack of communication between different stages in the chain and data transparency is also one of the major reasons why the current supply chain in India is flawed. Proper communication is essential in any system to avoid the spread of any misinformation and at each stage in the supply chain sensors are required to share data with the users so that information is collected and made available to everyone concerned with the particular transaction of goods. The combination of blockchain and IoT in the agricultural sector can provide a better supply chain system from the ground up which addresses communication and transparency issues suffered by the latter systems.</jats:p>"

The biofilm attached on the pipes will fall into pipe water when disturbed, which is a potential threat to human health. Particulate matter can contain bacteria, and most bacteria in water will adhere to the surface of particulate matter, are not easy to kill using disinfectants. Therefore, the effect of particulate matter and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the stability of biofilm was investigated. This study revealed that biofilm without particulate matter had the highest biomass, at an order of magnitude higher than biofilm with particulate matter and bacteria, while biofilm with abundant particulate matter and bacteria were more stable. The effect of shear stress on the biofilm attached on the pipes was investigated through rotational speed experiments, and the results implied that the collision between bacterial polymers increased with an increase in rotational speed and the formation of stale biofilm adhered inside the pipes. Further, instead of protein and fatty chains, the hydroxyl bonds played vital roles in the combination of particulate matter and EPS.</jats:p>"

The findings show that digital transformation significantly inhibits the supply chain relational transactions; the mechanism testing results reveal that digital transformation is conducive to the alleviation of information asymmetry and agency costs, which thereby reduces the degree of supply chain relational transactions; the regulatory effect analysis demonstrates that the impact of digital transformation on supply chain relationship transactions becomes more significant in non-high-tech enterprises and enterprises with less fierce industry competition. Finally, this paper confirms that a decline in the proportion of supply chain relationship transactions can significantly reduce the operational risk of enterprises.</p>",

Through exploratory spatial data analysis, the spatial distribution of the supply efficiency of ecological products of state-owned forest farms and its primary index are studied to explore the temporal and spatial evolution of ecological products from state-owned forest farms in China. The results show the following: (1) Through the reform of state-owned forest farms, the supply capacity of forest farms’ ecological products has been greatly improved, and the physical quantity and value quantity of ecological products have shown an increasing trend, with growth rates of 31.7% and 24.2%, respectively. (2) There is strong spatial heterogeneity in the supply efficiency of ecological products from state-owned forest farms in various provinces, and the overall distribution pattern is gradually decreasing from the northwest to the southeast coastal provinces. (3) There is a negative correlation between the supply capacity of ecological products and provincial GDP. The supply capacity of ecological products in provinces with high per capita GDP is relatively low. (4) The comprehensive index of the supply efficiency of ecological products and its first-level index of state-owned forest farms are characterized by different degrees of agglomeration in space, which are mainly represented by three distribution modes: “H–H”, “L–L”, and “L–H”. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the ecological function orientation of state-owned forest farms, improve the endogenous power of ecological product supply, actively explore and connect social ecological needs, and achieve coordinated progress in terms of ecological environmental protection and economic development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management aims to achieve both efficiency and low cost. Backscatter technology provides a low-energy consumption approach for critical links in the supply chain, such as warehouse management and cargo identification. Traditional backscatter systems achieve tag data transmission through dedicated hardware or controlled transmission sources. An additional access point (AP) can be used to ensure that the original data are always known in tag data decoding. These requirements increase the deployment costs and are not suitable for large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we introduce CRCScatter, a backscatter system based on a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) reverse algorithm, with an uncontrolled source and a single-AP receiver. The CRCScatter decoder at the receiver uses the constraints within 802.11b WiFi packets to recover the original packet and decode tag data from the backscatter packet. Our Matlab simulation results show that CRCScatter is effective in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and its average decoding time is independent of the length of tag data. By appending redundant bits in tag data, the decoding accuracy of CRCScatter can be improved. In summary, CRCScatter presents a backscatter communication mode based on ambient WiFi signals with fewer hardware requirements and low deployment costs. Furthermore, the decoding idea of calculating unknown data based on the packet constraints has the potential to expand to different types of excitation packages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable beef production is a global challenge in present times. This research paper aims to investigate the financial risks and barriers in the adoption of robotic process automation (RPA), which has emerged as a strategic catalyst for achieving sustainability in the beef sector. Beef manufacturers constantly strive to achieve sustainability and a competitive advantage in order to gain enhanced beef productivity at low operational costs. There is a gap in the research, as there is a lack of knowledge about the financial aspects, barriers, and challenges influencing the RPA adoption process in the beef supply chain. To bridge this gap, secondary research is used to extract statistical data and information relevant to the RPA adoption process in beef supply chains, considering financial aspects. This study utilises a simulation method adopting a process model created in previous research and analyses different scenarios based on financial parameters using values or variables in Simul8 software. The scenario analysis allows for the identification of financial risks in the adoption of RPA and evaluates the simulation results from a sustainability perspective. The scenario analysis highlights the financial risks and barriers in the adoption of RPA in beef supply chains through process simulation, using financial parameters as a basis. KPI values, income statements, and carbon emission reports are generated to evaluate the main bottlenecks at various beef supply chain stages, thus allowing business users to conduct a thorough cost analysis. Successful adoption of RPA can lead to reduced supply chain complexity, thus improving financial and operational efficiency, which results in increased beef productivity, quality, and shelf life. This study is extremely important as it assesses scenarios from a sustainability perspective and contributes to academic knowledge and professional practice. It provides a process model to support the financial and ethical decision-making of managers or stakeholders, while helping the beef sector adopt RPA with greater ease. The process model can be adopted or modified according to the financial circumstances and individual requirements of business users. Furthermore, it provides decision-makers with the knowledge to eliminate or prevent financial barriers, thus advancing and accelerating the adoption of RPA. Robust adoption of RPA assists beef supply chains in gaining higher productivity at reduced costs, thus creating sustainable value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fruit and vegetables (FV) are the major source of bioactive compounds for human beings. FV supply chains are complex and sensitive due to various features, including the seasonality of products, variations in demand, and short shelf-lives. The amount of waste in FV supply chains is significant compared with other supply chains as 44% of fresh FV produced globally are wasted in the food chain. This large amount of waste has a significant impact on the economy, food security, available natural resources, and the environment. To reduce food losses in the fresh food supply chain (FFSC), the root causes of waste must be first identified. While a number of researchers have investigated food losses in Australia, most only consider a specific stage in the supply chain and multiple stages in the FFSC are often overlooked. Additionally, the impact of advanced storage technologies, packing, handling, and transport on food losses should be investigated. Furthermore, supply chain practices are changing in response to uncertainties, such as the pandemic and climate changes, which also need to be captured. This research aims to identify the key factors contributing to fresh fruit and vegetable losses through a comprehensive empirical study. Primary data were collected through a well-designed questionnaire-based survey targeting major stakeholders in the FFSC, including farmers, distributors, and retailers in Australia. The survey investigates current postharvest practices and the effects of these practices on food losses. The main factors influencing food losses were identified and the options to reduce these losses were outlined. The results showed that losses mostly occurred at the farm level, and picking practices and preharvest conditions largely contributed to FV losses. The results highlight the need for proper training and education for workers involved in harvesting and handling fresh produce.</jats:p>"

Such loads on the ecology of the environment, caused by the activities of industrial enterprises, endanger the safe existence of individual biological individuals and the sustainable development of the social economy in the future.

Meanwhile, a number of issues related to the problem of reducing the ecological burden on the environment through decarbonization of Ukraine’s electricity industry remain unresolved. At this stage of implementation, the Smart Grid concept is considered from the point of view of electrical networks, although in the future it will be a combination of electrical, fuel and heat networks. The International Energy Agency sees hydrogen as a link between these networks. The analysis of the possibility and features of the implementation of the concept of decarbonization of power supply systems of industrial enterprises in the aspect of sustainable development showed the relevance of the implementation of distributed generation sources using buffer storage of electric energy in order to stabilize the level of generated electric energy.

It was determined that the basis of understanding competition is the struggle between market subjects for access to resources, consumers, while competition determines the economic behavior of market subjects. It is substantiated that competitive development, as one of the types of development, is a tool for ensuring economic growth and a consequence of ensuring competitiveness. Modern interpretations of competitive development by scientists are analyzed. It was found that such development is based on a process approach to the implementation of changes that provide a synergistic effect in the parallel acquisition of competitive advantages and development of the business entity. The key features of competitive development are determined by its basis on the creation of special unique advantages of the enterprise, the use of production factors capable of providing a competitive basis for development, the use of strategizing processes in ensuring competitiveness, which in the complex not only ensure the maintenance of positions and economic efficiency of operation, but also become tools for the development of the enterprise. The own vision of the interpretation of the competitive development of the enterprise as qualitative and quantitative changes in the economic activity of the enterprise, provided with innovative, organizational, economic advantages, different from those of competitors, which ensure economic growth, increase in efficiency and the transition of the enterprise to a higher level of functioning in an economic environment with hard-to-achieve results, has been formed for competitors.</jats:p>"

Studies have shown that the application of additive manufacturing (AM) technology in construction can help offset the negative impact of “black swan events” on supply chains. This study examines the construction industry based on AM technology and analyzes the impact of changes in the industry chain on the supply chains. The specific factors that affect the resilience of AM construction supply chains were identified through literature research and expert interviews, including 7 dimensions and 21 secondary indicators. An intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IFAHP) evaluation model was established. Finally, an example of an AM construction manufacturer, YC Enterprise, was introduced to quantify the various factors and determine the weights. The results show that the essence of building a supply chain with AM is creating a closed-loop supply chain. The impact of AM construction manufacturers on supply chain resilience (SCR) is the most critical, followed by that of regulatory authorities and general contractors. The AM construction SCR assessment index system and evaluation method constructed in this paper have important significance in filling the gap in the quantitative evaluation of the impact of AM on supply chains.</jats:p>"

A series of steps such as; selection of models, network representation, simulation of network, problem identification, network configuration finalization, and results analysis were carried out in developing the WDN simulation model. The hydraulic parameters such as pressure, flow velocity, and flow rate were analyzed under extended period simulation. The result indicated that the nodal pressure head in the junctions (100%) is above the required pressure level of 10 meters H2O, which is adequate for the effective performance of the water distribution system (WDS) during peak and off-peak demand hours. The elevated water tower was optimized with a 10 m height to supply water at satisfactory pressure. Nodal pressure is negatively correlated with ground elevation. The flow velocity was observed within the range of 0.1-0.4 m/s in 67% of the pipe network, while 17% of the pipe network velocity was below 0.1 m/s. The low daily water demand of the small community could be the reason for the low-velocity scenario, which shall lead to silt deposition in the pipelines; hence frequent line washout to eliminate the silt deposition in the system is recommended. The WDN was designed for optimized pipe sizes with availability in the market.</jats:p>"

This problem is exacerbated by the various meanings that are often ascribed to risk in a practical sense. The issue of risk—as measurable uncertainty—has proved to be especially problematic during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the tensions between policymakers and technical experts has led to public disagreements about the nature of the hazards associated with the virus and the associated strategies for mitigation. The chapter concludes by arguing that the paradox at the core of risk analysis can only be addressed if organizations and policy makers both accept and acknowledge the inherent uncertainties that often lie at the core of their attempts to quantify radical forms of uncertainty.</jats:p>"

Using the panel data of 41 prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta from 2005 to 2019, this study explores the distribution of cold and hot spots as well as the agglomeration of residents’ marginal consumption tendencies using ArcGIS’ Jenks method. We provide ideas and actions to raise inhabitants’ consumption standards and levels in cold spot locations on the supply and demand sides. The empirical findings demonstrate that: (1) There are distinct spatial patterns in the seven categories of consumer goods consumption tendencies among urban residents in the Yangtze River Delta, (2) in contrast to hot spots, urban residents in cold spots are constrained by the supply side, and the demand for consumption upgrading has not yet been met. Hence, we can increase the capacity for consumption by raising resident income, altering their consumption patterns, and developing consumer marketplaces.</jats:p>"

A key challenge behind the adoption of blockchain is understanding the dynamics of blockchain governance. With the promise of an efficient network owing to the elimination of intermediaries, governance in blockchain may be understood as addition of standards and culture, laws and codes, people, and institutions that promote coordination and jointly decide a particular organisation.

      "abstract": "<p>With the rapid growth of social economy and the improvement of people's living standards, the logistics industry not only shows a trend of rapid development, but also faces various business risks. Therefore, supply chain management becomes particularly important. Strengthening supply chain management has become a general trend. The traditional cost-oriented supply chain management model has been unable to meet the requirements of modern enterprise development. Given that the changes in customer demand, production, and sales have not been considered, enterprise resources are easily wasted. How to build a new supply chain model driven by value and customer demand has become one of the problems that large enterprises must solve. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BT) can realize information sharing, risk sharing, data interaction, and other functions. Through smart contracts, the division of responsibilities among all roles in the supply chain is controlled, which makes the supply chain safer and more efficient. In this paper, the authors designed a new supply chain financial system model that can effectively reduce financial risks, improved the efficiency of capital use, and enhanced the competitiveness of enterprises. The authors compared the traditional supply chain management mode with the management mode under the combination of AI and BT. The supply chain resource and economic security management based on AI and blockchain multichannel technology was more efficient, the system security index was higher, and the internal employee satisfaction of the enterprise also increased by 5.98%. The simulation application system for the internet of things and edge computing has the characteristics of high real-time and scalability. By analyzing the differences between the internet of things and edge computing technologies in terms of device perception, communication mode, data processing, and processing performance, product manufacturing efficiency can be improved to a certain extent.</p>",

The minimum wage has a positive long-term effect on women's employment (0.141) and a negative effect on male employment (−0.097). The estimated employment elasticity magnitudes for men and women are within the range of elasticities found in previous studies of employment effects of minimum wages in low- and middle-income countries. The aggregate employment effect of the minimum wage in Mauritius is not significant, due to the larger share of men who are employed. The extensive margin effect of minimum wages is also associated with a 2.2% increase in average working hours for men but a 1.3% decline in average working hours for women in the covered sector. In the uncovered sector, the significant positive effect along the intensive margin, estimated at 4.6%, is driven by changes in labour supply among men.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper highlights the current state and prospects for logistics development of perishable goods supply in international traffic, which made it possible to justify the study aim in this research. The chosen topic is quite relevant because developing supplies to European countries have a real perspective according to last tendencies in the international perishable goods market. This fact is additionally justified by increasing delivery volumes of milk and meat products, and animal fats every year. One of the directions for supply logistics cost reduction is an efficient use of transport resources (vehicles, warehouses). The scientific projects and their results have shown that a well-developed market for transport services with appropriate operators and infrastructure allows effective logistics implementation for perishable goods delivery in international traffic to costs reducing for all supply chain participants. A structural model has been designed for the sequential interaction of logistics participants during perishable goods supply on routes from Ukraine to Poland, which is formed from certain participants implementing relevant operations. The sequence is designed based on order analysis of transport enterprises by cargo order volumes, transportation distances, operations cost, operations time, as well as statistical data of corresponding parameters. Three alternative options for the logistics of perishable goods delivery were formed, using road transport with various load capacities and warehouses. The designed schemes consider opportunities for using a consolidation warehouse in Ukrainian territory for a possible combination of products and involving a perishable cargo distribution warehouse in Poland territory. The operation costs of relevant supply logistics variants are selected as a criterion for evaluating proposed solutions. These costs are affected by: operations cost; the volume of perishable goods batch; transportation distances; shippers (consignees) quantity; operation time parameters. The mathematical models’ components for logistics of perishable goods supply have been designed according to alternative three options, considering performing operations specifics at each stage, as well as the peculiarities of cost and time determining for each operation performing in the supply chain. \nKeywords: sustainable model, sustainable logistics supply, perishable goods , international transportation.</jats:p>",

Adoption of innovative technologies, blockchain traceability (BT), and cold-chain preservation (CP) technology to improve the efficiency of FFSC management has attracted much attention practically and academically. Distinct from existing studies, this paper provides a specific insight into the application of these two technologies by taking into account their functions in restraining misreporting behavior with BT technology due to its traceability and transparency and improving the freshness with CP technology based on the investment in fresh preservation equipment. With this in mind, this paper develops game theoretic models to identify the conditions under which technologies are the optimal selection for the supplier/retailer. It assumes that the retailer is the Stackelberg leader and the supplier is the follower. The key findings show that: (1) with the foci to eliminate suppliers’ misreporting behavior and minimize the incentive fees, BT investment can increase prices and promote order quantities and demand; (2) only when the consumers demonstrate “appropriate” sensitivity to freshness, a win–win situation can be achieved without adoption of BT technology; and (3) suppliers are not keen to invest in BT or CP technology when the circulation time is short, while retailers prefer to invest in CP technology when the circulation time is long.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the key attributes of a sustainable healthcare supply chain (SHSC), and this paper presents a new, four-dimensional model for SHSCs, consisting of social, environmental, economic, and technological dimensions. A systematic literature review was conducted, resulting in the identification of 35 potential SHSC attributes. The Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) was then applied to determine the appropriateness of these potential attributes according to the consensus of 13 experts, including healthcare workers in a variety of medical specialties, who profoundly understand HSC sustainability. The results yielded 22 appropriate attributes, which were then categorized across the four dimensions. Consequently, a new model of an SHSC, which prioritizes patient safety, was constructed and is proposed here. This SHSC model can be applied strategically to the healthcare industry to enhance the safety of both medical personnel and patients in a sustainable manner.</jats:p>"

Business analysts are citing that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains are unprecedented in recent business history, something that can be visualized with supply chains becoming partially paralyzed as a result of official measures to prevent the pandemic from spreading at a speed that health systems cannot meet. However, some academic works have already warned of the danger of business concentration in specific regions of the planet, where the main focus is the low cost of production, without addressing strategic objectives or focusing on strategic products. This work proposes a reflection on the location of suppliers in certain geographical areas, as this implies the use of long supply chains, proposing an alternative for the creation and planning of shorter supply chains for products that are classified as strategic.</jats:p>"

Overall, 200 spring locations and 13 predictor variables were considered for model building and validation. The four models were calibrated and trained on 70% of the spring locations (i.e., 140 locations) and their predictive accuracy was evaluated on the remaining 30% of the locations (i.e., 60 locations). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) was employed as the performance measure for the evaluation of the accuracy of the constructed models. Results of model accuracy assessment based on the AUROCC revealed that the performance of the RF model (AUROCC = 0.748) was better than that of any other model (AUROCC SVM = 0.732, AUROCC MARS = 0.727, and AUROCC BRT = 0.689).</jats:p>",

The thermo-mechanical response of a piezoelectric functionally graded (FG) rod due to a moveable axial heat source is considered in this paper, utilizing the dual-phase-lag (DPL) heat transfer model. It was supposed that the physical characteristics of the FG rod varied exponentially along the axis of the body. Both ends hold the rod, and there is no voltage across them. The Laplace transform and decoupling techniques were used to obtain the physical fields that have been analyzed. A range of heterogeneity, rotation, and heat source velocity measures were used to compare the results presented here and those in the previous literature.</jats:p>"

SSCM expands upon traditional supply chain management (SCM) by taking environmental and social considerations into account. Given the sustainability challenges facing the cement industry, SSCM has become a crucial topic for companies operating in this sector. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to identify and categorize SSCM practices based on the triple bottom line (TBL) dimensions of sustainability. Additionally, the study assesses the adoption of SSCM practices by Jordanian cement manufacturers according to the developed model. There is a lack of studies focused on creating a tailored and comprehensive SSCM conceptual model to evaluate sustainability practices within cement manufacturing. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a model for SSCM practices by incorporating 23 SSCM factors divided into three dimensions of sustainability: nine factors of environmental SSCM, seven factors of social SSCM, and seven factors of economic SSCM. The study employed a quantitative research approach, using a structured questionnaire to collect data from 41 cement company managers in Jordan and industry specialists. The proposed hypotheses were tested using SPSS software. The research findings revealed that the average level of implementation for all environmental factors was at a medium level within the Jordanian cement industry, the average level of implementation for all social factors was at a high level, and the average level of implementation for all economic factors was at a medium level. Overall, the implementation of SSCM practices was found to be at a moderate level. The study also provided a detailed level of implementation for each SSCM practice for each dimension of sustainability. By identifying and categorizing SSCM practices related to the cement industry, this study addresses a gap in the literature. It also highlights critical sustainability issues for decision-makers and academics, which can aid in the evaluation and improvement of SSCM practices in the cement industry. Future studies should aim to replicate this study with larger sample sizes and probability-sampling techniques to enhance the generalizability of the results.</jats:p>"

The welding power supply can output four DC and two AC currents. This paper also analyzes the stability of the welding power supply. Finally, a prototype is designed and verified through experiments, and the maximum output of the prototype is 300 A. The experimental results show that the converter can output different DC and AC currents according to the requirement, the multiple outputs are independent of the others, and the output phase and value are independently adjustable. After verification, the proposed multi-output welding power supply can output steady current according to the requirement.</jats:p>"

Hence, the mechanisms behind such acceleration phenomenon in FCG should be understood comprehensively toward developing promising alloys resistant to hydrogen occlusion. In particular, Alloy718 has a meager resistance to HE, even regularly displaying superior mechanical and physical performances. Notwithstanding, the present study unveiled that the FCG acceleration by dissolved H in Alloy718 can be negligible. An abnormal deceleration of FCG can instead be pronounced by optimizing the metallurgical state, a hopeful prospect in Ni-based alloys applied to the hydrogenating environment.</jats:p>"

However, when the retailer is disadvantaged in the supply chain cooperation and does not have access to subsidies, fairness issues may arise that affect pricing and subsidies. Therefore, this study aims to examine the optimal solutions for a government-led CLSC with remanufacturing subsidies and fairness concerns. We develop a three-echelon game with a government, a manufacturer, and a fairness-concerned retailer and derive the solutions for four scenarios: the fairness-neutral model, without fairness issues; the retailer has fairness concerns about the distribution of supply chain profits, and the concerned behavior is recognized by the manufacturer; the retailer is fairness-concerned, but the manufacturer ignores the concerned behavior; and the centralized scenario. Through the comparative analysis of different models, we design a cooperation mechanism for enterprises. Then, the conclusions are verified by numerical experiments. This study shows the following: (1) The retailer is always willing to maintain fairness concerns, but this does not affect the amount of collection. (2) The government will consume more subsidies because of the fairness issue ignored by the manufacturer. (3) Only when unit waste pollution is relatively low while the degree of fairness concerns is significant, will the manufacturer recognize the fairness concerns to reduce its unfavorable impact on profit. The increase in the level of concern can bring more benefits for two enterprises by consuming more subsidies for the highly polluting wastes. (4) A two-part tariff contract can coordinate the enterprises and promote social welfare within a certain parameter range.</jats:p>"

The main goal of relief efforts is to get enough emergency supplies to the area hit by the disaster as quickly as possible. The decision of where to locate warehouses that will store relief supplies presents a significant obstacle for humanitarian relief organizations as they work to enhance their capacity for providing aid and their rescue plan. A non-optimal location could make the search and rescue efforts harder. More importantly, it has been seen that when these kinds of geographical sites are evaluated, social and environmental issues are not considered. This research paper aims to make humanitarian networks more accountable by determining the ideal warehouse site and considering both traditional and sustainable factors. A framework for selecting warehouses to keep relief goods was devised using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach.  Best-Worst and TOPSIS (“Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to the Ideal Solution”) methods were used to rank the potential locations based on Cost, Logistics, Environmental, and Social Criteria.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this heat-treatment method has any effect on the quality or value of white oak veneer logs shipped between the US and EU. Seventeen steam- and vacuum-treated and seventeen untreated control logs were shipped from Baltimore, Maryland to the Czech Republic, for processing into veneer, between December 2021 and February 2022. The treated and untreated logs were sawn into flitches, soaked in hot water vats, sliced, dried, and the veneer from each log was graded for quality. Each log was assigned a value based on the veneer quality and yield. The average value of treated log was 1,547 €/m³, and the average value of the untreated logs was 1,539 €/m³.

Our goal is to provide assistance to operators in the decision-making process and establish a systematic approach for determining the appropriate water withdrawal level in a stratified reservoir. To achieve this, we propose an algorithmic approach as a decision support system for estimating the water withdrawal level. We validate our approach using long-term data collected from a water supply reservoir and compare the results with those of the operator's decisions. The results reveal that when the depth tolerance is set to 10 m, the approach and operator's decisions match at an 80% rate. However, when the depth tolerance is increased to 15 m, the matching percentage improves to over 90%.</jats:p>",

The statistical analysis suggests that the inequality in industrial and commercial land prices rose from 2008 to 2015 and decreased after 2015. The inequality in residential land prices has kept rising from 2008 to 2020 because land finance is still essential to local government. Discriminatory price strategy for industrial land prices in eastern China is getting more popular. The regression models reveal the significant negative impact of natural restrictions on land price, and such impact from natural restrictions is decreasing after 2015. The market forces represented by city-level socioeconomic factors are becoming more important after 2015, indicating a more free land market in China. We also find the gaps between cities and counties in land prices are closing, which might benefit the recent development in rural and county region of China. These findings provide important insights into the transition in the land market in China from 2008 to 2020, which also contribute to a better understanding of the spatial inequality in the land market and the heterogeneity in different land-use types.</jats:p>"

This research examines whether affiliate marketing initials of cryptocurrency wallet applications affect their digital marketing efficiency, as well as whether air forwarding firms’ website visibility could be benefited from them. After collecting the required Web Analytic data, the authors performed statistical analysis (correlations and linear regressions), followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) macroanalysis and Hybrid Modeling (HM) microanalysis to assess the outcomes of cryptocurrency wallet applications’ affiliate marketing programs. Hence, from the deployed methodology, valuable insights arose. The first part of the produced outcomes concerns the effect of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics on their digital marketing results. The increased implications of affiliate marketing metrics (referring domains, backlinks, etc.) decrease the number of pages their visitors see. Regarding the air forwarder firms’ website visibility, specific metrics (branded and referral traffic) were increased and others (social traffic) were decreased from the increment of cryptocurrency wallet application affiliate marketing metrics (backlinks, internal links, etc.). Supply chain firms, in the air forwarding sector, could have increased website visibility by deploying advertisements and affiliate marketing initiatives with cryptocurrency wallet organizations. Summing up, specific affiliate marketing metrics of cryptocurrency wallet applications are capable of significantly impacting their digital marketing performance and also constitute determinant factors of supply chain firms’ website visibility.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of “double carbon”, constructing green supply chains is the only way to implement sustainable development strategies in the manufacturing industry. This paper, therefore, examines the manufacturing supply chain for low-carbon products. More recently, the lack of technical information flow due to data barriers up and down the supply chain has led to high energy consumption, the serious waste of raw materials, and the substandard production of green products. Therefore, the level of supply chain data governance must be improved to enhance the sustainability of the supply chain. By studying blockchain-based data governance and government policy incentives for manufacturing supply chains, this study constructed an evolutionary game model based on prospect theory for the tripartite relation of government, manufacturers, and retailers. The difference between the perceived and actual value was introduced into a three-way evolutionary game model based on prospect theory to optimize the practical implications of the model. The model was then simulated using system dynamics. Through the simulation, it could be concluded that the ability of the three-way evolutionary game to reach the optimal stability point is only related to the sensitivity of the retailer’s perceived value. Additionally, the outcome of the three-way evolutionary game can be unstable, with changes in perceived value sensitivity. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are made. The innovation of this study is establishing a data governance platform that uses data governance to build green supply chains. Additionally, the government was added to the subjects of the game to explore the role of government policy in data governance and sustainable development. In addition, the evolutionary game model was incorporated with prospect theory and traditional expected utility theory, and the rational deficits and preferences of decision makers were taken into account, which brings the results closer to the reality of the situation.</jats:p>"

Within this context, the agricultural activities related to tobacco imply the use of large amounts of phosphate fertilizers, endowed with large residual amounts of fluoride. Thus, fertilizers application combined with rain and irrigation of tobacco crops contributes to high fluoride levels in groundwater. In this study, a residue from the tobacco production chain, the tobacco stem, was used as a support medium for the synthesis of an Al-Ca-Zn trimetallic compound, being named Al-Ca-Zn-tab. Thereby, an alternative adsorbent based on the recycling of an agricultural residue is presented. The impregnation and pyrolysis at 500°C of the material were the main steps adopted in the synthesis of Al-Ca-Zn-tab. The Response Surface analysis showed a positive and increasing effect of the adsorbent concentration. The pH, however, did not affect the adsorption. The efficiencies of fluoride removal were up to 71.7%, with actual accumulations up to 2.78 mg g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, and maximum accumulations of 13.59 mg g<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. The fluoride adsorption on Al-Ca-Zn-tab followed the Freundlich isotherm and the general order kinetic model. In addition, the thermodynamic data suggested the predominance of physisorption phenomena with exothermic characteristics. Finally, the proposed adsorption mechanism is based on ion exchange of the surface hydroxyl groupings of the oxides and hydroxides, in addition to hydrostatic interactions due to the bi and trivalent cations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain information disclosure is a vital factor for corporate investment efficiency and can signal a corporation’s long-term sustainable development. However, little attention has been paid to its significance. In this paper, we investigate how supply chain information disclosure affects corporate investment decisions. Using a sample of Chinese-listed firms, we find that firms that disclose nonfinancial information are more likely to have a high level of investment efficiency. We also identify the mechanism underlying the effect by examining the mediating effect of financial constraints and agency costs. Increasing a firm’s supply chain information disclosure can improve its investment efficiency by reducing its financial constraints and agency costs. We further find that this positive impact is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and firms located in regions with a high degree of marketization. Our findings imply that supply chain information disclosure plays an important role in corporate investment efficiency and sustainable development. Our study emphasizes the importance of nonfinancial information disclosure, contributing to the literature investigating the role of supply chain management in corporate decision-making on sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Block chain is a peer to peer, distributed ledger in which members must establish consensus to record every new input and transactions that are stored by all members. Over the last decade, block chain technology has grown in popularity, attracting interest from a wide range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, energy, and government sectors, health, and agriculture supply chains, land registrations, and digital identifications (IDs). Block chain facilitates better opportunities and benefits in agriculture, as well as building trust between farmers and consumers and allowing the creation of reliable food supply chains. The Chapter discusses how block chain and smart contracts can improve productivity, transparency, and traceability in agricultural insurance, smart farming, and agricultural food supply chain transactions (AFSC). By applying Block chain agri-food supply chain tracking was made easy and won the trust from different stakeholders, which was a real benefit to the real heroes of the country. The consumer can research the history of a product they are thinking about buying and consume food in their cart, learning about the entire process from planting to harvesting, transporting, and selling. Food fraud may be reduced by using the traceability and integrity of financial information to detect untrustworthy intermediaries and business practices that exploit both independent farmers and cooperatives. The agricultural industry will be transformed by block chain for supply chain management. All phases of the agriculture supply chain are being simplified, enhancing food safety and preventing the sale of counterfeit goods. Access to agricultural finance services for farmers and companies could also be facilitated by the technology. This Paper presents a review and research challenges on the existing block chain based IoT applications in the agriculture domain where maximum research focuses on food supply chain and its security of Internet of things with Block chain. The chapter presents how block chain and smart contracts can increase productivity, transparency and traceability could be very effective in Agricultural insurance, smart farming, transactions of agricultural food supply chains.</jats:p>"

Interviews, field perceptions, and surveys were utilized to gather essential information; writing (distribution reports, inspecting reports, records, and information) from both a public and global setting was utilized. The statistical tools used to analyze the adopted process of project commissioning are clustered column, line and bar chart.\nFindings/Result: Pakali and Bharaul project have been compared on the basis of steps that should be followed for successful project commissioning Both of selected project were found competent in planning and pipe and instrumentation diagrams. In terms of mechanical completion, pre-commissioning, commissioning, start-up, initial operation, and performance testing, none of the chosen projects were deemed competent.  Both projects are not handed over yet thus post commissioning is not done. \nFor a successful commissioning, it is recommended a management transfer procedure that involves calibrating and sterilizing the system, having the \"water operator's standard\" document in place, and training the office staff and members of the water user supply committee.\nOriginality/Value: The novelty of this research is commissioning analyses the nine elements of successful plant commissioning. \nPaper Type: Research paper</jats:p>"

By adding more transparency to the transitions of information and physical items, blockchain is considered a disruptive innovation that has the power to alter conventional supply chain activities. In these circumstances, blockchain technology must also be implemented in the supply chain. While implementing blockchain technology, supply chain partners face a number of barriers. As a result, the main goal of this research is to explore the prime barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain. In order to achieve these goals, we reviewed the literature and sought the advice of industry experts to identify the 10 main barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology. Further, the DEMATEL approach is used to categorize the finalized barriers into influential and influenced groups. The finding of this study suggests that “influential group” barriers demand more attention from the supply chain partners to minimize these barriers. The top influencing factors are “unwillingness of information sharing”, “lack of trust among SC partners” and “lack of technological advancement” and these barriers demand quick attention from supply chain stakeholders. This study looks into the barriers that stand in the way of effectively implementing blockchain in the supply chain, which will help managers do so. </jats:p>",

For a long time, this issue was left to the responsibility of European companies on a voluntary basis. Recently, a shift towards hard law in the sense of legal obligations has become visible. The European Commission started a legislative process in 2021 and published a proposal for a due diligence Directive in February 2022 to which the European Parliament responded in first reading on 1 June 2023. In the meanwhile, France and Germany passed legislation, and in the Netherlands and Belgium a private member’s bill was submitted by members of Parliament. All in all, a lot is happening on this subject at both European and national level. Much has been written about the proposals as such but the issue of fundamental labour rights has been underexposed. This paper fills that gap. Central question is as to what extent legislation will lead to an improvement in compliance with fundamental labour rights in the cross-border supply chain. This paper will explore this question on the basis of the said European and national legislative initiatives. It will become clear that the solution lies much more in a mix of hard law and self-regulation and that in the search for a smart mix, lessons can be learned from the Dutch system of private sector-specific agreements.<jats:target id=\"page-337\" target-type=\"next-page\">337</jats:target>\n               </jats:p>",

It has become an integral part of business operations for many organizations since its introduction in the early 1990s. With recent technological advancements, CRM systems have seen a significant transformation over time. This article has explored how these changes have occurred, explored the features offered by today's CRM systems, and identified some of the key challenges along the way. The growth of competition, the development of the goods and services market has led to changes in approaches to customer service, as well as to the need to involve the latest IT solutions in the customer service process. In addition, after the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the issue of changing the vector to domestic providers of CRM systems became relevant. Today, CRM systems have also begun to change as a result of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The increasing availability of data, the need to automate repetitive operations, and the need to offer personalized experiences at scale are the trends driving this movement. Personalization and predictive analytics help identify potential growth opportunities, improve the efficiency of tasks such as sales forecasting or lead scoring through automation that reduces human error, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences that can be used to personalize the customer experience, which leads to increased customer loyalty. Customer relationship management systems are necessary for Ukrainian enterprises to be competitive. CRM solutions simplify sales processes, facilitate better teamwork and offer a deep understanding of customer behavior.</jats:p>"

The study employed the descriptive cross-sectional design. The target population was 6126 households from two Wards (Kikore and Mnenia) in the Kondoa District Council.  The study used the Yamane formula to determine the sample size of 376 respondents. Thereafter, 376 respondents (household heads) were drawn from the population through the systematic random sampling.  Secondly, key informants (government officials from higher and lower LGAs) were selected purposely by virtue of positions they held. The study used a questionnaire survey, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and observations as sources of data. Quantitative data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics. Data from in-depth interview, observation and FGDs was analyzed by the thematic method. The study concludes that physical access to water points was crucial as the majority of respondents received water beyond the target of 30 minutes specified in policy statements. Furthermore, there is inadequate water quality. Therefore, Kondoa District Council was not on course to meet the established standards outlined in the national water policy of 2002 and the overall target for water access set in Tanzania's development vision for 2025. One of key recommendations is the empowerment of the water users, water institutions and village leaders who can make huge contributions to improve the status of water service delivery in terms of physical access, quality and quantity.</jats:p>"

Lack of proper supply chain management in any construction project results in cost overrun, time overrun, claims, disputes, and low productivity, which may ultimately lead to failure of the project. The overall objective of this study is to perform a comparative analysis of the need and importance of supply chain management based on stakeholders' perceptions of the selected building construction projects in Kathmandu valley. A total of thirty-four projects were taken for the study. Among these, 16 projects were executed by DUDBC and NRA, and 18 projects from private developers. The primary data collection tool used for the study was a questionnaire survey based on the Likert scale. A key informant interview along with a desk study was also conducted. The responses of questionnaires were ranked using the Relative Importance Index (RII). The findings were based on the comparison of views of public and private stakeholders on factors influencing the importance, challenges, and solutions of the problems of supply chain management. The findings show that both the public and private stakeholders agree on the high importance of proper supply chain management in the construction industry, but their perceptions differ on factors contributing to and benefits obtained from an efficient supply chain. Additionally, public and private stakeholders have differing opinions on the most pressing challenges facing supply chain management, its efficiency, and material management. Public stakeholders focused more on quality and delayed delivery of materials, while private stakeholders focused more on cost and efficiency issues. On the solutions and approaches for improvement of supply chain management, both the public and private sectors agree that improved integrated management between the supply chain and project site is essential to maintain a reliable and efficient supply chain. However, both stakeholders differ slightly on the approaches needed to improve supply chain management. Finally, the study shows that public and private stakeholders in building construction projects in Kathmandu agree that while major challenges exist in supply chain management, solving these problems through proper integration and communication will lead to an efficient and qualitative supply chain vital for a project's completion.</jats:p>",

Thus, many efforts have been devoted to the simulations of land changes. Among all spatially explicit simulation models, CLUMondo is the only one that simulates land changes by incorporating the multifunctionality of a land system and allows the establishment of many-to-many demand–supply relationships. In this study, we first investigated the source code of CLUMondo, providing a complete, detailed mechanism of this model. We found that the featured function of CLUMondo—balancing demands and supplies in a many-to-many mode—relies on a parameter called conversion order. The setting of this parameter is a manual process and requires expert knowledge, which is not feasible for users without an understanding of the whole, detailed mechanism. Therefore, the second contribution of this study is the development of an automatic method for adaptively determining conversion orders. Comparative experiments demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of the proposed automated method. We revised the source code of CLUMondo to incorporate the proposed automated method, resulting in CLUMondo-BNU v1.0. This study facilitates the application of CLUMondo and helps to exploit its full potential.</jats:p>"

However, these tools occasionally spill over beyond the intended recipients and affect guiltless supply chain members, jeopardizing the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains. This study identifies four channels through which sanctions and boycotts propagate through supply chains. In particular, supply chain members can be affected by direct relationships with targeted organizations, disruptions in accessing foreign markets, inability to access technology, and logistics failures. Potential solutions include mapping supply chains, proactive cooperation, network analysis, and shortening supply chains. While the work provides a general framework for research and practitioners, it also identifies areas for further studies, such as the role of new technologies and the effect of sanctions and boycotts on supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

On the basis of these problems, it is necessary to take preventive measures to reduce material losses and casualties. Through the use of the literature review method, the authors reveal a visual representation of the prevailing trends in the existing body of research on how stress impacts truckers and stress control to minimize accidents. The representation of ongoing research and shortcomings in potential future investigations was then used as a reference in prototyping, the stages of which are presented in the form of flow charts. The results show that stress primarily causes driver fatigue, alongside various indicators that serve as benchmarks for identifying fatigue-related factors. It was also found that there is an undeniable link between stress and fatigue in truck drivers during work performance. As part of the research results, the authors propose a solution in the form of sensors and IoT-based wearable devices that can help measure stress indicators, namely STOPIA. With the implementation of STOPIA, it is hoped that accurate recognition of driver fatigue conditions can be achieved, reducing the risk of traffic accidents, and providing comfort and safety for truck drivers and the transportation industry. Thus, this technology has the potential to decrease accident risks, enhance driver management, and reduce accident-related costs in the transportation industry.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to analyze the levels of facilities availability and service quality of fishing ports in the islands through a case study of Tanjungpandan Islands Fishing Port in Belitung Island. This study was conducted by combining survey methods, observation, as well as in-depth interviews with the port users and managers.  Due to Covid-19 pandemic, field research was conducted in two periods: from September to October 2020 and from January to February 2022. Respondents were selected by applying the snowball sampling method and resulted in 70 selected respondents, consisting of fishermen, skippers, traders, factory managers or fish processing units, and port managers. Structured questionnaires were used for data collection.  It proceeded into descriptive-qualitative analysis and combined with SERVQUAL and IPA (Importance Performance Analysis) methods. The study demonstrated that six port facilities failed to meet the Nusantara (inter-island) fishing port standards as outlined in the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries' Regulation No. 8, year 2012. Eight port services that were considered important indicated low performance to support the island’s fish supply chain. The total score of basic, functional, and supporting facilities was 60.46% (within 0 – 100% scale) and considered as relative “good”. Therefore, given that the port is the main hub of marine fisheries activities on Belitung island, it is crucial to increase the accessibility, quality, and services of fishing port facilities in order to support the fish supply chain in the islands.</jats:p>"

To facilitate the development of NEVs, the Chinese government issued the dual credit policy (DCP). However, whether the DCP can promote the technological innovation of NEVs and effectively reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector remains to be studied. This study constructed the decision-making model of NEVs under the DCP and obtained the optimal strategy to study the impact of the DCP on carbon emissions. Furthermore, we constructed a bargaining game model based on an alliance strategy to demonstrate the coordination of the NEV supply chain. The results showed that implementing the DCP can effectively reduce carbon emissions in the transportation field. The higher the technological innovation credit coefficient or credit price, the more significant the DCP’s incentive effect on reducing carbon emissions. Decentralized decision-making weakens the DCP’s incentive effect on reducing carbon emissions. The bargaining game based on alliance negotiation can enable independent companies to achieve carbon emission reduction when making centralized decisions so that the DCP’s incentive effect on reducing carbon emissions is optimized. The alliance between manufacturers is not to increase profits but to enhance their product advantages. However, suppliers can gain higher profits by participating in the alliance, which provides a theoretical reference for the alliance’s cooperation in decision-making.</jats:p>"

The project is subject to the constraints of the Yellow River diversion sluice diverting water time, reservoir diverting water time, and combinations of pumping stations with self-flowing gates. The opening and closing forms of the gates and pumps are complicated and irregular, and the switching of the gates and pumps mainly depends on the experience of the staff, which makes the water transfer cost high and the water transfer time long. Based on engineering compositions in the study area, an optimal mathematical model is constructed by the dynamic programming method. By combining the flow and water level, the objectives of the minimum operation cost, the shortest water transfer time and the combination of the two are established. A new optimization scheme of the switch between gates and pumps combined with water level and flow is proposed, which reduces the operation cost by 20% and the water transfer time by 8%, providing an efficient operation mode.</jats:p>",

This will make the transportation service more efficient. For the supplier's transportation service problem, an analysis method of critical path nodes is provided and a multi‐supplier collaborative transportation strategy is designed in this article. First, a model for minimising the transportation cost was established, then a path diagram was simulated and the optimal and alternative transportation paths of suppliers based on the k‐shortest path algorithm were calculated. In addition, path node availability during COVID‐19 is used as a research context in this article. A multi‐stage path analysis method was provided by discussing different cases of critical path nodes, which can make a reasonable selection of paths in a timely and effective manner. Finally, simulations of collaborative transportation for suppliers were performed in three scenarios and the results verified the effectiveness of the collaborative transportation strategy. The proposed collaborative transportation strategy of suppliers not only strengthened the synergistic cooperation among suppliers, but also cultivated the potential customer for suppliers in this article. Furthermore, the strategy could improve the flexibility of the supply chain, maximise the overall efficiency and also provide a new solution for the development of logistics and transportation services.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, continuous tracking of the shipped product must be monitored in a freezing environment where temperature and also humidity are maintained called supply chain management. During transportation of the packaged food, there may be a chance of getting damaged food like fluctuations in the temperature maintenance might cause food to be rotten. And there is a chance of leakage of canned goods or bulge at the ends which indicates the unhealthy and unhygienic condition of the packaged food. Quick Response (QR) codes provide a robust technique to fight the practice of counterfeiting the food products. Counterfeit food products are detected using a QR code scanner, where a QR code of the packaged good is linked to a Blockchain. And this system may be used to store shipped product details and generated unique code of that product as blocks in the database. So, we aim at two important aspects, firstly on continuous monitoring of supply chain and then on fake product detection which is done using Blockchain.</jats:p>"

In regions further away from urban centers, access to a water supply system is non-existent or ineffective. The population of these regions is forced to quest for alternative supplies to achieve quality home access. The residential condominium Solar de Maricá I, in the municipality of Maricá, has a water supply from individual wells, but it does not serve all the residents. This work presents a project for sizing the water supply system, in addition to a proposal for the reuse of gray waters as an alternative to preserving water resources. To do that a previous study was carried out to improve knowledge about the local reality in terms of access to water through visits to nearby condominiums with surveys on the technology used for treatment and quality of available water. Furthermore, water collections were carried out in the study condominium to establish the adequacy of the proposed system with the water quality of the place. The water purifying station operates for 16 hours daily, serving a projected population of 30 years, and consists of 2 filters in parallel with zeolite and sand as filter media, disinfection with sodium hydrochloride, two reservoirs of treated water, and a chemical house. The reuse water treatment is composed of a bio-disc reactor, equalization tank, decantation tank, accumulation tank, pressure sand filter, and disinfection system and presents itself as an effective alternative in reducing water consumption, thus preserving the resource local water resources.</jats:p>"

The depth of the logistics controlling implementation helps to analyze the functioning of logistics controlling and identify opportunities for further improvement. To determine it at the transport company, it is necessary to evaluate and analyze the performance of the logistics controlling tasks and the use of its tools. To carry out such an assessment, 20 indicators of the depth of logistics control implementation are used. Determining the depth of the logistics controlling implementation for transport enterprises goes through three stages: organizational, content-technological, and practical. The goal of the organizational stage is to create a group of experts and prepare relevant materials for the survey. The goal of the content-technological stage is an expert evaluation of the indicators of the depth of the logistics controlling implementation. The goal of the practical stage is to determine the depth of the logistics controlling implementation by experts. In the third stage, the analysis and discussion of the results of the assessment of the depth of the logistics controlling implementation are carried out, and further areas of improvement of logistics controlling are determined to increase the efficiency of the logistics processes management. Evaluation of the depth of the logistics controlling implementation was carried out at two transport enterprises; the results showed the intensity of the tools’ use in their management. The authors conducted an analysis that made it possible to determine directions for improving the logistics processes management for domestic transport enterprises based on logistics controlling, and to single out the stages of improving the management of transport industry enterprises. Mentioned steps are the following: assessment of the level and depth of the logistics controlling implementation, ensuring the functioning of logistics controlling as a continuous process based on Web-based and IT technologies, and using a wide range of primary and special logistics controlling tools.</jats:p>"

This work simulates a practical situation in which periodic temperature is generated in an electrical device as a result of its periodic input voltage. The finite volume method has been adopted to solve the governing equations. The effects of important parameters such as pulsation flow frequencies and temperature modulation frequency on heat transfer rates were investigated in details for Re = 500 corresponding to velocity of 0.39 m/s. The piezoelectric vibration amplitude is fixed at 0.2 and frequencies are varied in the range of [0–3] corresponding to [0–287] Hz. We have found that the time averaged Nusselt number for each electrical device depends on the pulsation frequency and heat modulation, and it is always larger than that in the steady‐state case. The results show that there exists a short band of frequencies which the enhancement of heat transfer of all electrical devices is higher than 55% compared with that of steady state. In addition, the heat transfer is maximum when heated pulsation frequency in the device is set as St = 3.0 corresponding to frequency of 58.5 Hz of input voltage. The combined pulsation flow by piezoelectric fan and heated pulsation by input voltage show vigorous heat transfer through electrical devices blocks and the heat transfer enhancement was observed in relatively narrow bands of frequencies. The efficiency of piezoelectric fan is expressed by the maximum temperature of the ninth electrical device which not exceed 80°C for time‐averaged velocity of 0.556 m/s and vibration frequency of 34.75 Hz of piezoelectric fan. The pressure drop and power pumping of piezoelectric fan are obtained for different Reynolds numbers. We found that the power loss was 4.6 times higher than for the piezoelectric fan at Re = 500. Good agreement between our numerical simulations of piezoelectric fan and experimental results available from the literature is obtained. © 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The study investigates the impact of SRM on supply chain performance, adaptation to local challenges, and key success factors for effective implementation. A qualitative research design was employed, involving in-depth interviews with 35 professionals from diverse organizations in Bangladesh. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. The findings revealed that SRM practices in Bangladesh have a positive influence on supply chain performance, emphasizing long-term relationships, cost reduction, quality improvement, and supply stability. Key success factors include clear communication, trust-building, adaptability to local challenges, and navigating regulatory complexities. Participants recommended greater technological integration and training programs for cultural sensitivity and negotiation skills. This research focuses on the specific context of Bangladesh, and the findings may not be universally applicable. Future research can extend the study to other emerging economies for comparative analysis. The study offers practical insights for organizations operating in Bangladesh and similar emerging markets, highlighting the value of tailored SRM practices and the need to balance cost efficiency and supply chain stability. Effective SRM practices contribute to economic growth and job opportunities in emerging economies, fostering social development. This research contributes to the understanding of SRM practices in emerging economies, with a focus on the Bangladesh context, and provides valuable insights for practitioners and researchers in the field of supply chain management. The primary limitation of this study is its focus on a single emerging economy, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study relies on self-reported data from participants, which may introduce response bias.</jats:p>"

In addition, all semiconductor devices implement soft switching under low voltage stress and current stress by introducing an auxiliary cell in each sub‐module. By reasonably distributing the energy collected in the soft switching process, the converter realizes the self‐power supply for the drive control circuit of the high‐potential semiconductor switches, wherein the sub‐modules are turned on step by step. The structure of the converter is described and its working principle and control strategy are analyzed in detail.

In this regard, we wanted to evaluate whether the economic situation of families is able to influence their social environment, surroundings, and safety. We observed how their economic situation can allow families the possibility of developing a life without exposure to health risks, and how economic constraints result in disadvantages in several areas of life. The results show how families at risk of poverty live in less favourable conditions and experience a widening of different gaps, with current prices leading to a possible poverty trap for the most disadvantaged groups. The higher the percentage of the population below the threshold, the lower the possibility of not being able to rent a house compared to areas with a lower prevalence of population below the threshold. This association was observed both when considering the risk linearly and non-linearly. Linearly, the probability of not renting a house was reduced by 8.36% for each 1% increase in the prevalence of population at risk of extreme poverty. In the second, third and fourth percentage quartiles, the probability of not being able to rent a house decreased by 21.13%, 48.61%, and 57.79%, respectively. In addition, the effect was different inside and outside of metropolitan areas, with the former showing a decrease of 19.05% in the probability of renting a house, whereas outside metropolitan areas the probability increased by 5.70%.</jats:p>"

In addition, the logistics industry is vital in transportation, urbanization in the Middle East, and transshipment through the Middle East. Due to their increasing importance and size, there is an increasing demand for adequately qualified people capable of managing the logistics systems and supply chains holistically and sustainably to avoid problems caused by unsustainable practices in mobility, transport, and supply chains. However, it is unclear whether the logistic and supply chain education of future leaders, managers, and engineers will follow SDG goals, the rise of new trends, and green technologies or lag behind. This paper pioneered a systematic approach and analyzed Middle Eastern countries regarding their sustainability integration into higher education programs related to supply chain management and logistics studies. It revealed enormous differences among countries and a lack of sustainability topics in most studied countries. Some countries are also significantly more oriented toward partial logistics challenges such as transport efficiency instead of sustainable supply chains, which are becoming critical challenges for the near future and must be accompanied by formal and life-long learning on sustainability-related topics. The circular economy and corporate social responsibility are especially neglected. It was also revealed that sustainability integration in higher education does not correlate with sustainability scores and the ranking of countries within the sustainability index.</jats:p>"

Compared to traditional supply chain networks, the Physical Internet (PI) has the potential to address sustainable development challenges and build resilient supply chain networks by providing interconnected and open logistics services. However, the interplay between resilience and sustainability has yet to be thoroughly explored in the PI-enabled supply chain literature. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between resilience and sustainability in PI-enabled supply chains. An innovative hybrid approach that combines the resilient-sustainable performance scoring method with mixed-possibilistic programming is proposed to trade-off and analyze the relationship between the two. Applying the concepts of resilience and sustainability to PI-enabled supply chains involves optimizing costs, sustainable performance, and resilience levels simultaneously. This enables coping with unforeseen disruptions from suppliers, plants, and PI hubs. The results of computational experiments have demonstrated that the PI-enabled supply chain exhibits stronger sustainable and resilience performance in dealing with random disruptions compared to traditional supply chains. The fruitful research yielded important management insights and practical implications, thereby contributing to the reinforcement of the literature on PI.</jats:p>"

The model uses system dynamics tools to explore the interaction between individual system elements and transport subsystems. A wise choice of crucial system elements, well-adjusted relationships and behavior settings, as well as system dynamics tools, allow for a considerable simplification of an otherwise complex system. The article works with a principle of stock and flow diagrams for forecasting supply and demand in public transport.

This can prevent SMBs from becoming suppliers to large companies, accessing working capital credit, and increase the risk of fraud or delinquency in transactions with large corporations. To address this issue, I have developed a Business Credibility Product that uses real-time data feeds from various sources, including banking, eCommerce, payroll, payments, commercial real estate, telecom, utilities, insurance, tax filing, and firmographic data. The product includes a comprehensive 360 degree evaluation of a company's credibility, as well as a deep dive into each of the contributing factors to identify significant deviations and trends. This allows for real-time portfolio monitoring and improved lending, verification, and supply chain operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply and demand management (WSDM) is essential for developing sustainable cities and societies. WSDM is only effective when tackled from the perspective of a holistic system understanding that considers social, environmental, hydrological, and economic (SEHEc) sub-systems. System dynamics modeling (SDM) is recommended by water resource researchers as it models the biophysical and socio-economic systems simultaneously. This study presents a comprehensive literature review of SDM applications in sustainable WSDM. The reviewed articles were methodologically analyzed considering SEHEc sub-systems and the type of modeling approach used. This study revealed that problem conceptualization using the causal loop diagram (CLD) was performed in only 58% of the studies. Moreover, 70% of the reviewed articles used the stock flow diagram (SFD) to perform a quantitative system analysis. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement plays a significant role in understanding the core issues and divergent views and needs of users, but it was incorporated by only 36% of the studies. Although climate change significantly affects water management strategies, only 51% of the reviewed articles considered it. Although the scenario analysis is supported by simulation models, they further require the optimization models to yield optimal key parameter values. One noticeable finding is that only 12% of the articles used quantitative models to complement SDM for the decision-making process. The models included agent-based modeling (ABM), Bayesian networking (BN), analytical hierarchy approach (AHP), and simulation optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO). The solution approaches included the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The key findings for the sustainable development of water resources included the per capita water reduction, water conservation through public awareness campaigns, the use of treated wastewater, the adoption of efficient irrigation practices including drip irrigation, the cultivation of low-water-consuming crops in water-stressed regions, and regulations to control the overexploitation of groundwater. In conclusion, it is established that SDM is an effective tool for devising strategies that enable sustainable water supply and demand management.</jats:p>"

The main objective of the present study is to extract a mathematical correlation between the total drag coefficient and the particle motion parameters. To this end, the total drag coefficient of a sphere with a variable velocity in a water tank was studied experimentally using a high-speed camera. An expression was developed to simulate the correlation between the total drag coefficient, the Reynolds number, and the acceleration coefficient. Then the developed expression for calculating the total drag coefficient based on the Reynolds number was improved. Moreover, the correlation between the Froude number and the acceleration coefficient was analyzed and an expression was developed in this regard. A formula for calculating the total coefficient based on the Froude number was established. The obtained results show that the total drag coefficient has a complex change with an increasing Reynolds number at a determined acceleration coefficient. Furthermore, it is found that at a constant Reynolds number, the total drag coefficient decreases as the acceleration coefficient increases. The performed analyses demonstrated that the established expression based on the Froude number has high accuracy and low computational complexity.</jats:p>",

This is because of location substitution: a city cannot be easily substituted by another city, but neighbourhoods of the same city can be close substitutes. This paper revisits the question of whether supply elasticity can differentiate housing price appreciation rates within a city by carefully accounting for substitution effects at the neighbourhood level. From a Hong Kong housing boom (2003—2018), we have found that the impact of supply elasticity on another neighbourhood on average is about one-tenth of the impact on its own neighbourhood. It rejects the notion of perfect substitution, under which this magnitude difference should not have been identified. The contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) It clarifies the theoretical relationship between supply elasticity and substitution in shaping housing price movements. 2) It proposes two novel ways to account for neighbourhoods’ substitution using the spatial spillover of land availability and price co-movement. 3) It delivers a clear answer that supply elasticity can shape the housing price movements within a city.</jats:p>"

This study is applied research which employed geospatial techniques and aimed at examining fire disaster emergency response demand and supply relationships with the view to delineating service coverage and locating more facilities for optimum coverage in Kano metropolis. Locations of the existing fire stations and fire incidents (2009-2019) were gathered through GPS surveying. Network data set were generated. Nearest Neighbor and Network Analysis (origin-destination, service coverage and location-allocation) were conducted to determine emergency response demand and supply relationships, service coverage area delineation and identifying best site for allocating new facilities within the metropolis respectively. It was found that no clearly defined service coverage exist as emergency response supply takes more than 4-8 times the NFPA travel standard, and with a great deal of overlapping response patterns. New service coverage areas were proposed and best sites for 8 firefighting facilities identified for optimum coverage. It is concluded that emergency fire disaster response demand and supply relationships within Kano metropolis is imbalanced, with extensive recurrent demand especially within the core area served by overstretched and inefficient response supply.

The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design and a split plot scheme, with four replications. The main plots consisted of the following cropping systems: soybean monoculture–maize monoculture; soybean intercropped with Aruana Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximum cv.

The subplots consisted of nitrogen rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha−1) applied as side-dressing in rows of maize and tropical grass in the autumn–winter season. Our results showed that maize or soybean intercropped with tropical grasses and adequate nitrogen rates favored the entry of microbial carbon and nitrogen, stimulated enzymatic activity, and reduced C-CO2 loss. However, the excess nitrogen supply can nullify the benefits of the intercropping systems.

Woody biomass is suggested as a substitute for fossil fuels to achieve sustainable development. Transitioning the land purpose entails investment and a tradeoff between wood pellet production and the current utilities created by the land, hindering the private landowners’ willingness. The current study suggests that utilizing the woody leftover on the land can potentially increase the woody biomass supply. Employing the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 707 private landowners in the United States (US), we aimed to identify the characteristics of woody-resource-wasting landowners and examine how to increase their likelihood to contribute to woody biomass-based energy. We discovered that landowners being male, having higher income, and being a member of a state/national forestry organization are more likely to waste woody resources. Moreover, woody-resource-wasting landowners perceiving woody biomass-based energy as a substitution for fossil fuel are likelier to sell wood, while those perceiving environmental costs over benefits of woody biomass-based energy are less likely to sell. These findings can be used as insights for policymakers, logging companies, and state agencies to find an additional supply of woody biomass-based energy from landowners likely to waste woody resources.</p>"

The work of the plant is intended for the production of high-quality petroleum products for technological transport of the divisions of Lukoil — Western Siberia LLC in Kogalym, Langepas, Pokachi; in addition, the plant’s products are in demand at other enterprises of the Khanty-Mansiysk region. In the course of the study, the goal was to offer an alternative source of energy for the trouble-free operation of an oil refinery, to ensure the reliability of objects belonging to the first category. Based on the analysis of the existing power supply system of the plant, it was found that the power receivers of the ELOU-AVT-Bitumen plant are provided from two sources of power supply from the Tyumenenergo network, which does not guarantee uninterrupted and trouble-free operation of the plant. The power supply of the refinery is provided with a voltage of 6 kV from Substation No. 7 35/6 kV. Substation No. 7 is powered by 110/35/10 kV Substation Druzhnaya from the medium voltage side via two power feeders Druzhnaya-1 and Druzhnaya-3. In the study, the calculation of loads, short circuit currents was carried out, the necessary power equipment was selected, and a method was proposed for transferring the refinery to power supply from a stationary power plant operated on hydrocarbon gas utilized from the production process. The proposed solution allows: to eliminate the occurrence of emergencies at the refinery due to a power outage; reduce the cost of purchasing electricity and thereby reduce the cost of commercial petroleum products; increase the percentage of hydrocarbon gas utilization by reducing the amount of gas flared.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to present the state of the art on the protection of water resources in the inter-tropical zone in order to identify gabs in knowledge that improve drinking water supply. To achieve this, a documentary search online was carried out to assess the progression of work over time. What emerges from this literature review is that the method for assessing intrinsic and specific vulnerability in bedrock areas is practically non-existent. A discrepancy exists and reflects the difference in a coincidence of the level of vulnerability when several methods of determining vulnerability are used in the same study site. The issue of validation is still problematic, as it lies in the fact that a property that is not precisely defined cannot be unambiguously deduced from the measured quantity. The characterisation of specific pollutants and their propagation in the saturated or groundwater zone are not taken into account. All the different components of the water cycle are not always taken into account during a groundwater vulnerability study, yet each water resource is part of a closely related component of the water cycle.</jats:p>"

The article is an attempt to provide some of the empirical foundations to the female LFPR in rural India, and further delves into a comprehensive understanding of the effects of different factors like household, social, economic and personal factors, empirically through previous NSSO data sets. The data sets used in the study are from NSSO 50, that is, from 1993-94 to NSSO 66, that is, 2009-10, to ascertain the factors that were significant over the years in determining the female LFPR in rural areas. These variables were tested to gain an understanding on the variations in female labour supply in rural India. Being cognisant and by problematising some of the significant factors that affected the female LFPR in the past, the article demands the state to exercise policies beyond its neoliberal framework and the ‘Keynesian welfare-state’ model of ‘superficial’ social security. Methodologically, three models were further created based on the NSSO 66 data set to showcase the perennial discouraged-worker effects among the females in LFPR in rural India. The article further empirically tests Jacob Mincer’s theory: ‘substitution effect dominating the income effect’ in the decision of females entering the labour market in rural India and shows empirically how it does not hold in the Indian context, thereby an attempt on debunking the mainstream theory. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: J10, J21, J64, C18 </jats:p>",

In this study, constant humidity and dry–wet alternating modes were compared to determine their impacts on soil nitrogen transformation and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Drought was found to reduce the soil NH4+-N concentration under the constant humidity mode, and the NO3−-N concentration was highest in 60% water-holding capacity (WHC) soil. Soil NO3−-N content increased rapidly after rewatering, and increasing the frequency of dry–wet watering resulted in a higher accumulation of NO3−-N. In the constant humidity mode, drought reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), whereas that of ammonite-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) increased. Increases in drought duration and the frequency of dry–wet watering inhibited the activity of AOA under the dry–wet alternating mode, whereas the relative activity of AOB increased after rehydration. The water supply mode did not change the community structure of AOA or AOB at the genus level but affected their relative abundance. In the constant humidity mode, the contribution rate of AOA to nitrification potential (PNR) was 42.75–49.72%, whereas that of AOB was 50.28–57.25%. In the dry–wet alternating mode, the contribution rate of AOA to PNR increased, and the contribution rate of AOB decreased. Taken together, these findings indicate that ammonia oxidation might be primarily driven by AOA and AOB in weakly acidic and neutral soil. This study reveals the effects of different water supply modes on soil nitrogen transformation and ammonia-oxidizing micro-organisms and provides a scientific basis for improving nitrogen use efficiency.</jats:p>"

The role played by sustainable human resources in agriculture is becoming increasingly prominent. In this context, China’s sustainable talent in agriculture is used as the research object, and a neural network analysis method is applied to construct a prediction model of sustainable agricultural talent to forecast its supply and demand. The prediction aims to provide a scientific basis for the strategic planning of talent development for rural revitalization. Based on the forecast results by region and province, we analyzed the level of coordinated development of talent supply and demand to provide a reference for the coordinated development of supply and demand of sustainable talent in agriculture in China. The results showed that a large sustainable agricultural talent demand gap exists in China. The overall talent supply and demand coupling coordination level is low; we found significant differences among different regions and provinces, characterized by decreasing order of the northeast, central, west, and east. According to the socio-economic development level, agricultural economic foundation, and other factors, we divided the provinces into six types for analysis. To promote the coordinated development of sustainable human agricultural resources, talent policy support at the national level is required to reduce the loss of human resources to other countries; at the regional level, the talent environment for rural revitalization should be optimized to increase the attraction of talent. At the provincial level, agricultural and forestry education resources should be created to increase the supply of sustainable agricultural talent.</jats:p>"

The tools of resource analysis, component analysis, functional analysis, and cause-effect analysis are used to analyze the problem of excessive EMI encountered in the design of LED lamps and lanterns, and the tools of technical contradiction and material field analysis are used to improve the problem of reducing EMI. Two solutions are obtained to improve the problem of high EMI by changing the Power inductor design method of the input voltage and by adding capacitors to form a Π-type filter circuit.</jats:p>",

The use of digital technologies in this approach can enhance resilience and human rights, particularly in the context of the green and digital twin transition post-COVID-19 pandemic. To enrich the sustainability-practice approach, this paper aims to produce a roadmapping taxonomy, based on knowledge mapping of a dataset collected in late December 2022 from the Web of Science Core Collection. As the knowledge map reveals the dimensions of resilience, human rights, and digital technologies, the proposed taxonomy highlights the importance of dynamic capabilities in facing supply chain disruptions, especially their ripple effects, along with the corresponding digital technologies to enhance human social dynamics in facing such disruptions. The proposed taxonomy provides a knowledge-based framework for professionals and researchers to enhance their understanding of supply chain resilience in designing and implementing digital solutions. The proposed roadmapping taxonomy features a people- and community-centric perspective and several managerial insights, contributing to the wider discussions on the green and digital transformation of the supply chain, by shaping actions and interactions in networked, digitized, and datafied forms to enhance supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that, when the working pressure is below 200 kPa, the jet diffusion angle of the new sprinkler with the water dispersion device B is the largest. Although the pattern radius of the new sprinkler is slightly lower than that of the original, it is more effective in improving the combined coefficient of uniformity (CU) at lower working pressures. Specifically, when the working pressure was 100 kPa, the new sprinkler with the water dispersion device B, which has a square inner hole with a side length of 6.2 mm, improved the CU by 54.89% on average. Remarkably, the CU of the new sprinkler with water dispersion device B at a working pressure of 100 kPa was 6.65% higher than that of the original sprinkler at a working pressure of 200 kPa. The research results provide valuable insights into the design of sprinklers to improve the performance of low-pressure sprinkler irrigation systems.</jats:p>",

The Narrow Money, Broad Money and Consumer Price Indexare the independent variables respectively with GDPas the dependent variable. The whole dynamics of inflation in developing economies are different, so the idea that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon is important to revisit and reevaluate, especially in relation to developing economies.

The objective of this study was to explore the resilience performance of the pork supply chain under different food safety shocks caused by<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>spp., and to investigate the effectiveness of interventions on reducing the impact of these shocks on the resilience performance of the chain. Scenario analysis indicated that the effectiveness of the investigated resilience strategies or interventions depended on the risk profile (i.e., default, minimum, maximum level of<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>spp. contamination) of the pork supply chain. For pork supply chains with minimum and default risk profiles, more attention should be paid to increasing resilience of pigs towards<jats:italic>Salmonella</jats:italic>spp. infection. For supply chains with maximum risk profile, the focus should be on improving the performance of the slaughterhouse, such as careful evisceration, logistic slaughtering.

Under a certain quantity discount mechanism and profit distribution strategy, both the seller and the buyer can reduce costs. The quantity discount model and profit distribution mechanism designed require supply chain members to share information. In order to protect the privacy of members and improve the willingness of supply chain members to share information, we designed a privacy protection joint ordering policy protocol and privacy protection quantity discount policy based on Secure multiparty computation technology. Then, the joint ordering strategy, the privacy-preserving joint ordering strategy, and quantity discount protocol are numerically simulated.

However, in the existing urban planning system, the energy planning mapped by carbon emissions has received less attention, and the main goal is often to ensure safe supply. There is less research on carbon emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to take the energy planning in urban planning as the breakthrough point to carry out research on green and low-carbon development and construction at the urban level in the \" Carbon Reduction \" era. First, a city in China was taken as the research object to evaluate the resource endowment and development potential of the target city. Then, the carbon reduction paths of target cities in the three fields of construction, transportation and industry were studied, and the carbon reduction potential in different scenarios was quantified. After that, the influence of electric power carbon emission coefficient on different carbon saving scenarios was studied through sensitivity analysis. Finally, the government's low-carbon urban planning and decision-making suggestions were given. The results show that the relatively effective way is to carry out large-scale promotion of ultra-low energy consumption buildings and electric vehicles on the demand side, and to build distributed photovoltaic and heat pump systems on the supply side. On this basis, with the introduction of additional 30% of foreign green power, the per capita carbon emissions of cities would be reduced to 1.5tCO2 in 2035. In this way, the target city can achieve the goal of carbon neutrality in advance. Therefore, the results of this study have certain theoretical reference value for the study of low-carbon urban planning.</jats:p>"

To solve this problem, under the current situation of large-scale access to new energy, considering the limitations of the carbon emissions from different emission subjects plus the construction of a carbon trading model among the emission subjects, a day-ahead optimal scheduling method that takes carbon emission quotas and carbon trading into account is proposed. Firstly, carbon transaction cost models of thermal power and wind power are constructed, respectively, and a carbon emission quota allocation strategy based on the entropy method is proposed to redistribute the weights of baseline emission factors for the regional power grid. Then, considering the additional carbon emissions of conventional thermal power units caused by wind power access, the carbon trading costs of different types of generation units are calculated on the basis of carbon trading price prediction. Thereafter, a day-ahead optimal scheduling model considering carbon emissions trading is constructed with the objective of minimizing the total cost of the system in the scheduling period. The model is solved as an MINLP problem based on MATLAB 2016a software utilizing CPLEX 12.4. Simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this research is to find out and analyze the Effect of Capacity of Machine Efficiency in Production and Inventory Control of Raw Materials on the Smooth Production Process in Bekasi Branch \"Galvanized Steel\" Company. The type of research used is observation with a multiple linear regression analysis model with 32 samples. The regression test results show that 58.5%, the smoothness of the production process can be explained by the capacity of machine efficiency, and control of inventory of raw materials, while the remaining 41.5% is explained by other factors not examined in this study. F test results show that simultaneously the efficiency of production machinery and raw material inventory control have a significant effect on the smooth production process. The results of the t test show partially the capacity of machine efficiency has a significant effect on the smoothness of the production process while the control variables for raw material inventory have no significant effect on the smooth production process in the branch company \"GALVANIZED STEEL\" Bekasi</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent decades, the use of supply chain management is essential for developing new technologies and setting the ground in expanding major global markets to integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and stores effectively. In addition, the growing competition in the modern business environment has created an increasing trend of new products and improved product quality for attracting more consumers. However, an increase in the related costs and uncertainty in these innovations requires the development of algorithms to solve optimization problems. Therefore, this study is aimed to implement a multi-product supply chain including raw material suppliers, factories, distributors, and customers to maximize the quality and minimize costs. To this aim, supplier quality, distribution centers, and manufacturing products were considered for the quality model, while warehousing costs, product production, transportation, defective raw materials, and the like were regarded for the cost model. Then, the NSGAII algorithm was used for solving the created optimization problem, and accordingly, the optimal Pareto points were calculated. Based on the results, the proposed model can give the manufacturer the ability to decide on a multi-product and multi-time supply chain by involving cost and quality variables. Thus, the owner can manage the supply chain of the factory effectively. </jats:p>",

The theoretical basis for the search for an economically viable option for the layout of the modules of the photovoltaic system was the mathematical formulation of the optimization problem using the following criterion: the cost of generated electrical energy is lower than or equal to the current tariff of the power system for consumed electrical energy. At the same time, the requirement that the payback period of the project does not exceed the standard value of 8 years was taken into account. On the example of a processing agricultural enterprise located in Rostov region, taking into account the peculiarities of its development and the regime of insolation of the territory, consumers were identified, on whose roofs it is possible to install photovoltaic systems. The mode of operation involves generation within the power supply system of the enterprise without generation beyond the point of balance. The analyzed changes in the technical and economic indicators of a photovoltaic system with an increase in its power, if the latter operates with the accumulation of electric energy and taking into account the load schedule, made it possible to identify that 5 photovoltaic systems with a maximum power of 0.4 kW to 71 kW of total installed power can be installed on the territory of the enterprise. with a power of 77.4 kW. But only for four of them the proposed criterion is met: the payback period is not more than 8 years (5.7 ... 7.4 years), and the cost of generated electrical energy (4.0 ... 5.5 rubles / kWh) is lower than the current tariff (8.3 rubles/kWh). The excess of electricity generation by photovoltaic systems, compared to the load of consumers on the roof of which they are located, is directed to the power supply system of the agro-industrial complex for the power supply of other consumers, which makes it possible to realize the solar energy resource to a greater extent at the geographic location of the object.</jats:p>",

Although it is difficult to measure, some data and estimates point out that informality is still quite present worldwide, but especially in emerging and developing countries, and this situation was confirmed in the studied supply chain. In analysing the narratives, we noticed that this is a chronic issue which bothers the producers that are properly formalised mainly because of unfair competition, and hinders the organisation of the chain. Some factors foster the persistence of informality, such as family labour and temporary jobs, the low educational level of entrepreneurs, lack of adequate supervision and cultural aspects of producers and their families. We could corroborate the perspectives of modernisation (informality is still persistent), neo‐liberal (informal entrepreneurs reject the bureaucracy of an over‐regulated market) and post‐structuralist (informality is a way of life related to identity, social position and/or resistance against the formal structure) theories. Our research has shown us that the situation found is contributing to a reduction in the number of formal producers and impairing the development of that local supply chain, as well as its sustainability.</jats:p>",

Drawing on evolutionary economic geography and global production networks literature, we applied a combinatorial and dynamic view on firms’ supply chain integration, R&amp;D collaboration, and impact on competitiveness. Conceptually, we argue that companies not only produce and sell goods at different levels (global, national, regional), but are located in differently developed regions and innovation systems with different institutional qualities. Therefore, various modes of engagement within vertical supply chains and at the same time different R&amp;D collaboration strategies influence competitiveness of firms. Empirically, we revealed that the vertical integration strategy drives levels of regional R&amp;D collaboration for a firm. It turns out that globally more connected and technologically sophisticated firms are not highly interconnected by R&amp;D collaboration within regional/national innovation systems. Moreover, technologically capable firms with little or no R&amp;D collaboration may be highly profitable on average, but they are vulnerable in the long run. Furthermore, an intensive involvement in R&amp;D collaboration had the highest resistance towards economic shocks. We also found statistically significant positive relationship with medium R&amp;D collaboration and productivity of firms.</jats:p>"

However, there is a lack of consensus among researchers on how to measure sustainability in SSCD. Therefore, the authors propose a novel approach to measuring sustainability in the context of SSCD by developing an integrated, tractable, and representative metrics framework. The methodology corresponds to a quantitative approach involving bibliographic examination and statistical techniques. First, the authors conducted a systematic literature review by formulating research questions and a search protocol, searched for relevant articles, and conducted a quality assessment on full-text reviews to obtain metrics for measuring sustainability in SSCD from the literature. Then, they defined aggregation criteria representing their inclusion relationship by merging associated metrics. The authors then used Cluster Analysis (CA), a multivariate statistical technique, for grouping the metrics. Consequently, twelve clusters were distinguished from 541 research articles, grouping 51 metrics from different sustainability dimensions. It shows the strong connection among the sustainability dimensions, i.e., they must be assessed holistically. Then, we proposed reducing the 51 metrics to 5 to evaluate sustainability in the SSCD, allowing us to focus on a reduced number of indicators.</jats:p>"

The aim of the study is to examine the threat facing the Nigerian manufacturing industries using generating sets as their alternate source of power. Some industries were considered in this research and in which some of the challenges facing the industry were itemized. Part of these problems includes; cost of fuelling and maintaining the generators, down time by the generating sets when there is break down of equipment and facilities, inability to satisfy the customer’s needs on time due to irregular power supply.  This research established the amount of fuel used by each of these industries visited to power their generators daily, weekly, monthly and also yearly, compared with the amount paid to Distribution Company (public utility). But these industries couldn’t depend solely on the public utility power for their operations due to the epileptic power supply in the country. Hence, the necessity for a steady power supply using public utility is very important thereby reducing the cost of fuelling of generating set and cost of production of goods and services.</jats:p>"

This has come about largely owing to the paradigm shift regarding its genuine nutritional benefits. It is especially due to innovation that has been incorporated into agro-industrial processing and the development of new products, and the fruits of such labor can be seen in the growing demand by consumers around the world. Integrally making full use of coconut, it turns out, is extremely important for agribusiness. Coconut indeed has become a benchmark, not only from the environmental dimension but also from the social and economic perspectives both of the communities that plant it and the agribusinesses that transform it. This study aims to identify technologies, new uses, trends, and innovations related to the coconut agro-industrial chain, as well as their prioritization, by means of a prospective study, using the Delphi method in two rounds. Two methods applied at the methodological level comprised a technological surveillance study by means of a literature review in a SCOPUS database, PatentsInspiration, complemented with commercial surveillance for the four major topics of plastic wood, coconut oil extraction, high salinity and moisture, and small-scale coconut by-products. Moreover, the Delphi method was used, in two rounds, with 178 topics, technologies, and innovations, classified into seven thematic groups. The Delphi was answered by 32 experts in the two rounds. Vantage Point text mining software was also applied for the analysis of the surveillance results. Within the seven thematic groups, the following 10 priority technologies are highlighted: functional phytochemicals, non-caloric sweeteners, coconut milk preservation technologies, water activity and shelf life, coconut sugar extraction methods, batch and continuous drying technologies, lyophilization, coconut fiber and shredded recycled PET, magnetic particle modification of activated carbon derived from coconut shell and biochar to effectively remove phenol from water, and biodegradable packaging for coconut derivatives. In addition, the following topics were prioritized in the sustainability grouper: sustainable agriculture, bioeconomy, family agriculture, and circular economy.</jats:p>"

The numerical model is established to describe the infiltration‐exudation response in the deformed porous material. It is found that the lubricant stored in the pores is forced to flow when the loaded porous matrix deforms. The flow drives the seepage stratification in the porous body and forms an interlayer flow zone. The fluid pressure gradient in the normal direction is the internal factor of the seepage stratification. The interlayer flow zone first appears in the middle of the vertical direction of the porous matrix. With the increase of loading time, the interlayer flow zone gradually moves from the middle to the bottom of the porous matrix, which means that the quantity of the lubricant stored in the porous surface decreases. In the whole process of the seepage response, the lubricant flows out from the inlet and continuously supplies lubricant to the contact area. Delaying the downward movement of the interlayer flow zone can ensure the continuous exudation of the lubricant, which is beneficial to maintain excellent lubrication characteristics.</jats:p>",

The article considers functional and informational structure of spacecraft power supply systems. The principles of data exchange between the elements of regulation and control equipment with the power supply system are described and the hierarchical structure of the power supply control system elements is built. The current approaches to the automatic systems of control and management of spacecraft power supply systems are regarded. Based on these data, the algorithms of power supply system control are analyzed using the example of battery charging and discharging algorithms. The phenomena which are not accounted for when building the algorithms are considered. The means to improve the algorithms for controlling battery charging and discharging by introducing new parameters to track the degree of battery degradation are proposed, and the means of intellectualizing the algorithm are considered. A proposal is made to intellectualize the control system using a neural network trained on the spacecraft onboard telemetry.</jats:p>",

The research aims to identify the factors influencing the adoption of e-commerce in SMEs’ supply chain operations, understand the challenges and barriers faced by SMEs in adopting e-commerce, and analyze the impact of e-commerce adoption on supply chain efficiency. A qualitative research design is employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews with SME owners and managers who have adopted e-commerce for their supply chain operations. The study highlights the importance of SMEs in Bangladesh’s economy and the growing significance of e-commerce in supply chain operations. Despite the rapid growth of Bangladesh’s e-commerce industry, the integration of e-commerce into SMEs’ supply chain operations is still in its early stages. Factors such as technological readiness, infrastructure availability, organizational culture, and external influences affect the pace of e-commerce adoption. The findings reveal that increased efficiency, cost savings, and improved customer experience are the primary drivers for e-commerce adoption. However, resistance to change, lack of technical skills, and security concerns pose challenges to adoption. Participants recommend training programs to enhance technical skills and foster a culture of change. Additionally, organizations should conduct thorough market research, seek customer feedback, and engage in discussions with supply chain partners to make informed decisions regarding e-commerce adoption. Investing in cybersecurity measures is crucial to address security risks. The study contributes to the existing literature on e-commerce adoption in supply chain operations, particularly in the context of developing nations like Bangladesh. It provides valuable insights for SMEs, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the need to carefully evaluate the benefits, costs, and risks associated with e-commerce adoption. Enhancing supply chain efficiency through e-commerce adoption can lead to improved competitiveness, cost reduction, and increased profitability for SMEs in Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

However, the SSO modes and characteristics in complex power systems where series-complementary AC systems, DC systems, wind farms, and thermal power plants co-exist simultaneously are still not well understood, and relevant research has yet to be conducted. To address these issues, this study aims to investigate the SSO oscillation modes and the participation of specific influencing factors using eigenvalue and participation factor analysis. Additionally, the influence of system operation mode and control parameters on the SSO characteristics is studied through eigenvalue analysis. The findings of this study suggest that multiple oscillation sources and the co-existence of various oscillation patterns in hybrid AC–DC transmission systems cause SSO problems. The SSOs arise due to inappropriate system operation or parameter selection. As the series compensation increases, the system tends to become unstable. The system stability improves when the wind power output increases or the thermal power output decreases while keeping the output power of other sources constant. On the other hand, the system stability decreases as the DC transmission power gradually decreases. In terms of the control parameters, a higher value of the inner-loop proportionality coefficient of the converter current on the rotor side of the wind turbine results in a more unstable system. However, the rotor-side converter outer loop parameters and the stator-side control loop PI parameters have a negligible effect on the oscillation frequency and damping of the system.

The amount of water harvestable using these systems is proportional to the availability of rooftop areas in the region. The use of satellite imagery has gained traction in recent times considering the challenges in conducting a manual survey to determine the rooftop area. However, the limitations on spatial resolution impaired stakeholders from conducting similar assessments in areas with small residential units. In this regard, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) providing high-resolution spatial imagery for the delineation of rooftops of all scales has become popular. The present study is an attempt to utilize UAV-generated orthomosaics to estimate the harvestable quantity of rainwater for setting up an RRWHS. A study area in the Gurgaon district, India, is selected, and the steps involved in estimating the quantity of water harvestable using UAVs are demonstrated. In addition to these computations, a suitable site for constructing the storage unit is identified with the aid of a weighted overlay technique implemented using a Geographic Information System. The results from the study show that nearly 11,229 m3 of water can be harvested per year in the study site using the RRWHS.</jats:p>",

The remarkable contribution of the aged cast iron pipe wall to overall total chlorine residual decay was manifested by the ratio, kwall/kbulk. The pipe wall-induced decay was related to microbe consumption and electrochemical corrosion as indicated by variations in total organic carbon (TOC), NO2−-N, NO3−-N, and Fe residual. The larger kwall for NaClO + NH3·H2O (0.720 h−1) relative to NaClO (0.465 h−1) was mainly attributed to enhanced nitrifier-mediated microbe consumption. The largest kwall for NaClO + (NH4)2SO4 (0.864 h−1) was due to the further promoted microorganism regrowth and metabolization as evidenced by the SO42- declining behaviors. On this basis, it was suggested to minimize extra inorganic salt introduction into treated water to constrain microbial development in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Temporal-free chlorine disinfection was also recommended for the chloraminated DWDS before the critical temperature.</jats:p>",

This proposed model is analyzed under green investment along with trade credit and cap-trade policy. It is considered that the manufacturer’s production process is imperfect. Few inferior quality products are reworked, and the remaining defective items are discarded. The manufacturer makes investments in green technology to reduce carbon emissions. The product’s demand is influenced by selling price, advertisement, and green-technology level. The total average profit of the supply chain is constructed under three different scenarios of trade credit provided by the manufacturer to the retailer. The primary goal of this research is to obtain the optimal selling price, production rate, and green-technology level to maximize the system’s total average profit by using genetic algorithm. A numerical example is shown to demonstrate the model, and sensitivity analysis is carried out to analyze the impact of numerous input parameters. Managerial insights and conclusions are provided to make this model helpful for manufacturers.</jats:p>"

Data-driven technologies and applications in supply chain management enable supply chain planning, performance, coordination, and decision-making. Although the literature on procurement, production, logistics, distribution, and other areas within the supply chain is rich in their respective areas, systematic analyses of supply chain analytics are relatively few. Our objective is to examine supply chain analytics research to discover its intellectual core through a detailed bibliometric analysis. Specifically, we adopt citation, cocitation, co-occurrence, and centrality analysis using data obtained from the Web of Science to identify key research themes constituting the intellectual core of supply chain analytics. We find that there has been increasing attention in research circles relating to the relevance of analytics in supply chain management and implementation. We attempt to discover the themes and sub-themes in this research area. We find that the intellectual core of SCA can be classified into three main themes: (i) introduction of big data in the supply chain, (ii) adoption of analytics in different functions of operations management like logistics, pricing and location, and (iii) application of analytics for improving performance and business value. The limitations of this study and related future research directions are also presented.</jats:p>",

To achieve the objectives of this paper, first, a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is used to estimate the technical efficiency (TE) score of manufacturing companies. Subsequently, the TE score is used to evaluate the electricity shortage index and other factors that are postulated to affect enterprise productivity. Two estimation methods have been adopted including ordinary least squares (OLS), which is less robust to endogeneity and instrumental variable (IV) estimation, which turns out to be more robust to endogeneity in the data. The empirical results show that, under OLS estimation, electricity shortage has a significantly negative impact on the technical efficiency of the listed manufacturing companies. However, when IV regression is implemented to address endogeneity issues in the data, electricity shortages tend to have a significantly positive impact on the technical efficiency, underscoring the importance of capturing endogeneity in the data. Extending the baseline results, this study also finds that, while the size of an enterprise may have no bearing, state-owned companies are more likely to be negatively affected by electricity shortages compared to privately owned companies. These results have significant implications for industrial policy design in China in particular, and developing countries in general. Most importantly, the results of this study underscore the importance of policies and measures to promote a shift in the ownership structure towards the private sector.</jats:p>"

However, the vaccine supply shortage will be inevitable during the early stage of the vaccine rollout. Public health authorities face a crucial challenge in allocating scarce vaccines to maximize the benefits of vaccination. In this paper, we study a multi-period two-dose vaccine allocation problem when the vaccine supply is highly limited. To address this problem, we constructed a novel age-structured compartmental model to capture COVID-19 transmission and formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) model to minimize the total number of deaths in the population. In the NLP model, we explicitly take into account the two-dose vaccination procedure and several important epidemiologic features of COVID-19, such as pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, as well as group heterogeneity in susceptibility, symptom rates, severity, etc. We validated the applicability of the proposed model using a real case of the 2021 COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the Midlands of England. We conducted comparative studies to demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our numerical results show that prioritizing the allocation of vaccine resources to older age groups is a robust strategy to prevent more subsequent deaths. In addition, we show that releasing more vaccine doses for first-dose recipients could lead to a greater vaccination benefit than holding back second doses. We also find that it is necessary to maintain appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the vaccination rollout, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that starting vaccination as soon as possible is able to markedly alleviate the epidemic impact when the vaccine resources are limited but are currently available. Our model provides an effective tool to assist policymakers in developing adaptive COVID-19 likewise vaccination strategies for better preparedness against future pandemic threats.</jats:p>"

Moreover, it has certain limitations concerning the minimum and required pressure head parameters used for PDA, which leads to inaccurate simulation results. Another limitation of the PDA option of EPANET 2.2 is its inability to simultaneously consider pressure-dependent demands with pressure-independent fire demands. In this article, the reason for the spurious convergence is identified, and it is shown that the spurious convergence of EPANET 2.2 can be addressed by extending the energy balance convergence criterion to include the virtual demand links employed in the EPANET 2.2 formulation of PDA. On the other hand, interest in the methods that use artificial modelling elements in EPANET 2 for PDA is increasing rapidly. The implementation of the method presented in this paper (termed the alternative PDA approach) allows an extended period simulation of large networks with complex demand patterns, multiple tanks, reservoirs, pumps, valves, and thousands of pipes. Two benchmark networks and two real-world networks were analysed by both the alternative PDA approach and EPANET 2.2 and the results were compared.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A generalized mathematical model has been introduced to describe the level of fire safety of systems for saving and supplying water, as it is presented in terms of the theory of fire safety. Such a generalized mathematical model takes into account the probability of the appearance of a combustible medium and an ignition source. It is shown that for the appearance of a combustible medium in the hydrogen storage and supply system, it is necessary and sufficient the simultaneous appearance of a combustible substance and an oxidizer. When determining the probability of an ignition source, an exponential dependence is used, the time constant of which is proportional to the value of the minimum ignition energy of the combustible medium. For the purpose of assessing the level of fire safety of systems for saving and supplying water, the control system is victorious, the functioning of which is characterized by the ability to operate without a driver. This allows you to win against the fluctuations of the health of the systems of saving and supplying water in the fire-safe and fire-safe camps, as well as to gain the counter for the fluctuations of the deaths of the first and other births. The presence of these viruses allows to induce a virus, which reflects the reliability of the functioning of such a water system. It has been wised up for some time to improve the reliability of the functioning of the system for saving and supplying water. Taking this condition into account makes it possible to formulate requirements for the control system, in particular, for the probability of its failure-free operation or for the intensity of its failures. For illustration of these minds, there were some graphical fallows, which allow to again an express assessment of the indicators of reliability and control of water supply systems. It is shown that with total control of this efficiency, which does not seem to be ideal, with an integral indicator of 0,5 and equal to the fire safety of the system for saving and supplying water 0,01, the efficiency of the controllers robotic system is more than 0,995. It should be noted that for the same minds, the control of the system is responsible for saving water supply at equal her fire safety 10-3  for an hour interval 103 , the intensity of the waters of the control system is no more to blame  \nKeywords: fire safety, control system, water supply saving system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply diversification and pricing are two common mechanisms for dealing with supply yield uncertainty. This paper characterizes a firm's pricing and sourcing decisions under supply yield uncertainty, and studies the interplay between the two mechanisms. We compare the optimal sourcing decisions under two distinct pricing schemes: (1) ex ante pricing—the firm simultaneously makes the sales price and sourcing decisions before production takes place; (2) responsive pricing—the pricing decision is postponed until after the production yield realization. Although the firm is better off with responsive pricing, the effect of price postponement on the optimal sourcing decision and the firm's need for supply diversification varies and is influenced by factors such as unit procurement cost, supply portfolio, and supply reliability. For the case of one unreliable supplier, we show that responsive pricing mitigates the overage and underage risks imposed by yield uncertainty, and results in a lower optimal order quantity than that under ex ante pricing when the procurement cost is low, and a higher quantity otherwise. For the case of two unreliable suppliers, we show that responsive pricing promotes supply diversification when the sole‐sourced supplier's reliability is low, and discourages when it is high. By contrast, when the sole‐sourced supplier's reliability is moderate, responsive pricing promotes supply diversification when its unit procurement cost is low and discourages otherwise. The composition of supply portfolio also has a fundamental impact on such strategic interplay: When the supply portfolio consists of one unreliable and one reliable supplier, diversified sourcing is never optimal under ex ante pricing, but may be optimal under responsive pricing. Thus, responsive pricing promotes dual sourcing in this setting. We also conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to both confirm the robustness of the main results and derive additional insights. </jats:p>",

The planning criterion was the most prioritized and the most influential DSCM criterion in LKPP’s e-procurement service, which covers the distribution requirement process. The three most important DSCM criteria in LKPP’s e-procurement service were the distribution requirement process, delivery and inspection, and transportation management. The analysis showed that some DSCM criteria in LKPP’s e-procurement had met the DSCM principle.

The issue of fire-explosive events in the hydrogen storage and supply system is investigated. A set of mathematical models has been built to determine the probability of a combustible medium in the hydrogen storage and supply system. This set includes partial mathematical models for the main elements of the system, which are united by a generalized mathematical model. When constructing partial mathematical models, the probabilities of trouble-free operation of the main elements of the system are used, which include a pipeline and a gas generator with a pressure stabilization circuit. The probability of trouble-free operation is represented in the form of two multiplicative components that take into account catastrophic and parametric failures of the main elements of the system. When determining the probability of trouble-free operation of the main elements of the system in relation to parametric failures, the integral (generalized) parameters were used. In particular, for a gas generator, such parameters are its time constants. The current values of time constants of the gas generator are determined according to the developed algorithm whose feature is the use for its implementation of the values of the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the system, which are determined at three a priori given frequencies. For a typical version of the on-board hydrogen storage and supply system, quantitative indicators of the likelihood of a combustible medium are given. It is shown that if the parametric failures of the main elements of the system are not taken into account, an error occurs, the value of which is 30.0 %.\nThe results could be used to obtain an express assessment of the level of fire hazard of hydrogen storage and supply systems at different stages of their life cycle.</jats:p>"

The current pandemic has highlighted the significance of resilient and dependable supply chain systems that are less dependent on humans and more efficient in cycling goods supply chains. The present study included and excluded records from two recognised databases, Scopus and Web of Science, using the PRISMA declaration 2020. After following the inclusion and exclusion criteria details, investigated the forty-seven articles with two significant data streams (traceability of supply chain management, resin and sustainability). Results illustrated that in today's environment, the rivalry has shifted from \"firm vs firm\" to \"supply chain vs supply chain.\" As a result, the ability to optimise the supply chain has arisen as a significant issue for organisations seeking a competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to traceability of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The Internet of Things (IoT) applications and blockchain technologies can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, privacy, security and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimise operations in warehousing, manufacturing, food supply chain and transportation. Combined with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable various application scenarios to enhance supply-chain transparency and trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. First, we illustrate how deploying Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we also identified that the resilience of big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence is helpful for the sustainable development of social, economic and environmental contexts.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The study focuses on the distribution of refrigerated beef in the UK, where digitalisation was implemented to re-route cargo carriers. By comparing simulations of both digitalised and non-digitalised supply chains, the study found that digitalisation can reduce beef waste and decrease the number of miles driven per successful delivery, leading to potential cost savings. Note that this work is not attempting to prove that digitalisation is appropriate for the chosen scenario, only to justify a simulation approach as a decision making tool. The proposed modelling approach provides decision-makers with more accurate predictions of the cost–benefit of increased sensorisation in supply chains. By accounting for stochastic and variable parameters, such as weather and demand fluctuations, simulation can be used to identify potential challenges and estimate the economic benefits of digitalisation. Moreover, qualitative assessments of the impact on customer satisfaction and product quality can help decision-makers consider the broader impacts of digitalisation. Overall, the study suggests that simulation can play a crucial role in facilitating informed decisions about the implementation of digital technologies in the food supply chain. By providing a better understanding of the potential costs and benefits of digitalisation, simulation can help organisations make more strategic and effective decisions.</jats:p>"

However, to study the optimal remanufacturing strategy of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network under government regulations and the manufacturer’s design for the environment, we use variational inequality to construct a CLSC network equilibrium model based on these two strategies. By using a comparative analysis of the decision-makers’ profits, carbon emissions, and carbon taxes, we show how the decision-makers should choose the optimal remanufacturing strategies under different government regulations and the manufacturer’s levels of design for the environment. The findings of the study show that the manufacturer’s design for the environment is conducive to resource recovery and promotes the development of remanufacturing activities. When manufacturers’ levels of design for the environment are high, although manufacturers will adopt the outsourcing remanufacturing strategy to obtain high profits, they will lose environmental benefits. The findings also show that the new product handling fee policy in government regulations can promote energy conservation and emission reduction, and the reproduction subsidy policy can encourage product remanufacturing. Moreover, when the government’s subsidy for remanufactured products increases to a threshold, it will prompt manufacturers to adopt the outsourcing remanufacturing strategy; and the remanufacturing subsidy threshold is negatively correlated with the manufacturer’s levels of design for the environment.</jats:p>"

Based on achieving the function of the retractable frame, it is required to be light in mass and high in stiffness. Therefore, the structure is improved, and then the maximum bending and static torsional deformation and minimum mass of the frame are used as the optimization objectives. The multi-objective optimization is carried out using the genetic algorithm MOGA based on the optimal filling space OSF design experiment and the establishment of the Kriging response surface model.

However, the presence of nanoplastics (NPs) as carriers may increase the risk of antibiotic leakage in the carbon filtration column. We designed experiments with the polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) concentration, norfloxacin (NOR) concentration, flow rate, and ionic strength as four orthogonal factors to investigate the effects of each factor on NOR removal by carbon filtration columns. The influence mechanism of PSNPs was inferred by combining with NOR transport curves and characterization analysis, and a prediction model of NOR removal efficiency was established through back-propagation (BP) network. The results showed that the increase of both PSNPs concentration and flow rate decreased the NOR removal efficiency. There was an optimal value of NOR concentration to maximize the NOR removal efficiency, while with increasing ionic strength, the NOR removal efficiency decreased, then increased, and finally decreased again in an inverted ‘N’ pattern. Furthermore, PSNPs can affect NOR removal efficiency via carrier function and aggregation on the activated carbon surface. On the other hand, the relative errors of the predicted and experimental values for two evaluated samples were 3.37 and 6.62%, respectively, indicating a good prediction effect.</jats:p>",

The water supply network is particularly vulnerable to seismic damage, and so physical earthquake resistance is very necessary to adapt to or withstand disaster situations. This study evaluated various strategic methods to improve the reliability of water distribution network systems in the event of an earthquake disaster with a focus on structural earthquake-proofing methods for pipelines. For this purpose, three major flow-, diameter- and connection-hierarchy-based earthquake proofing strategies are proposed. We quantified the extent to which earthquake reliability improved after the strengthening of the earthquake-proofing of the pipeline segments, which had been divided based on the proposed strategies. The proposed methodology of dividing the pipeline segments for earthquake-proof strengthening was applied to the water supply system of the Republic of Korea and analyzed thereafter. As a result, it was confirmed that the associated costs and the extent of the improvement in the reliability of earthquake proofing for each strategy and scenario need to be precisely analyzed. Thus, it is necessary to execute strategic earthquake proofing of pipelines with medium size diameters and which occupy most of the length of a mainline, in order to simultaneously satisfy the reliability and cost efficiency of the relevant water supply. However, additional earthquake proofing for segments of a higher level of flowrate is required because a marked drop in overall reliability is caused if they are damaged. In addition, because the effect of an increase in reliability in comparison with the costs incurred is insignificant in the case of some low demand and small-diameter pipeline segments, it is reasonable to exclude earthquake resistance strategies for these sections. The proposed study results—determining the level of importance of each resistance method—can be utilized to make a combined plan for optimal earthquake-proofing strategies.</jats:p>"

Based on the flow of the production process, it was found that St. Rear Frame 3 is the most problematic with a percentage of 21%. By using the DMAIC method, in the Define stage, it was found that the most common problem that occurred in St. Rear Frame 3 was a torn pipe in lower jig B with a percentage of 6%. At the Define stage, it is also known that the root cause of the problem is the lack of accuracy from the operator, who may be sleepy at work due to lack of rest, or even chatting, which results in setting teaching too far because it is more dominant to the lower, not to the iron connection between the lower and the subframe. Then, at the measurement stage, the target is to reduce 6% of the problems to 4%. Furthermore, at the analysis stage, an analysis is carried out to determine if the potential problem occurs and then what next steps will be conducted which is useful for minimizing waste. At the Improve and Control stage, namely, the steps taken to minimize the problem or waste (preventive actions) and what steps or ways to do if the problem or waste occurs again (contingent actions).</jats:p>"

A large-capacity DC/AC superimposed experimental power supply above 100 kVA is an important piece of equipment that must be used in the aging research of DC-link capacitors. The irregular periodic operating voltage of the DC support capacitor is equivalent in the form of DC voltage superimposed with multiple harmonics based on the Fast Fourier transform analysis. The power supply is mainly divided into four parts: an AC module, a DC module, a protection module, and an isolation component. The composited harmonics are output by the IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) inverter of the AC module. The soft start method is applied to the AC module in order to ensure the long-term reliable operation of the power supply. The kV-level high-voltage is output by four inverter units connected in series. The amplitude and phase control of harmonic decomposition is adopted, and the inverter is controlled by Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation. The output voltage of the power supply is close to the operating voltage of the capacitor. Based on the designed power supply, the degradation experiment was carried out. The temperature rise and aging characteristics of DC-link capacitors under different AC/DC ratios were studied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s global environment, supplier selection is one of the critical strategic decisions made by supply chain management. The supplier selection process involves the evaluation of suppliers based on several criteria, including their core capabilities, price offerings, lead times, geographical proximity, data collection sensor networks, and associated risks. The ubiquitous presence of internet of things (IoT) sensors at different levels of supply chains can result in risks that cascade to the upstream end of the supply chain, making it imperative to implement a systematic supplier selection methodology. This research proposes a combinatorial approach for risk assessment in supplier selection using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) with hybrid analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE). The FMEA is used to identify the failure modes based on a set of supplier criteria. The AHP is implemented to determine the global weights for each criterion, and PROMETHEE is used to prioritize the optimal supplier based on the lowest supply chain risk. The integration of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional FMEA and enhances the precision of prioritizing the risk priority numbers (RPN). A case study is presented to validate the combinatorial model. The outcomes indicate that suppliers were evaluated more effectively based on company chosen criteria to select a low-risk supplier over the traditional FMEA approach. This research establishes a foundation for the application of multicriteria decision-making methodology for unbiased prioritization of critical supplier selection criteria and evaluation of different supply chain suppliers.</jats:p>"

The innervation of the anterior abdominal wall is carried out by the intercostal nerves, branches of the iliopsoas and iliac-subiliac nerves. All of these structures may have different topography in each particular patient. Most variations will not be pathologic, but they are worth keeping surgeons in mind when performing surgical interventions. For example, in severe sclerosis of the distal arteries or aorta, or in the case of aortic coarctation, there is significant vessel dilation to provide blood supply to the lower extremities. Transection of the epigastric arteries in such cases can lead to more severe bleeding and ischemia of the lower extremities. Variation in the location of the branch of the deep inferior epigastric artery, the crown of death, occurs in 77% of patients and can cause life-threatening hemorrhagic shock. Also of clinical importance is the replacement of the areas of sensitive innervation of the iliopsoas and iliac-subiliac nerves during operations on inguinal hernia and during blockade anesthesia. Thus, surgeons need to be aware of variations in the blood supply and innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall during surgical interventions, particularly during trocar insertion and other surgical manipulations. In order to improve surgical technique, it is suggested to introduce convenient and relatively inexpensive neuroimaging or neuromapping methods into routine practice.</jats:p>"

The HCSC in Industry 4.0 aims to give patients the medicine they need as quickly and cheaply as possible. The HCSC can improve operations by automating routine tasks and reducing human error by using new technologies like the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT); so, there is a need to analyze the role of IoT and Industry 4.0 in the Healthcare Supply Chain. This paper aims to analyze the role of IoT and Industry 4.0 in HCSC. Also, this paper proposes a framework using a single-valued neutrosophic set with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to overcome uncertainty and deal with the various criteria and features. This paper used the 18 criteria and nine suppliers as an application in the healthcare supply chain. The results concluded that the proposed framework could handle uncertain data and give more effective results in analyzing the role of IoT and Industry 4.0 in HCSC.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The study highlights how external risk factors have influenced the internal and organizational factors of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in dealing with their supply chain disruptions. We applied the resource dependence theory to illustrate this aspect and also to understand the factors that impact supply chain management. The study applied the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) methodology and Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) methodology to understand the inter-dependence relationship between these factors of risk in supply chain management during Covid-19. Our study was specific to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic as the external factor disrupting supply chains and impacting a firm’s internal and organizational factors in dealing with the impact. Our results showed that external factors deeply influence the internal factors governing supply chain management, which in turn, impact firm performance.

In order to determine what actions the supply chain (SC) should take to protect itself against risks, it is necessary to analyze whether the supply chain is robust to them. This paper proposes a tool based on a system dynamics model to determine the robustness of an already designed five-stage fresh agri-food supply chain (AFSC) and its planting planning to disruptions in demand, supply, transport, and the operability of its nodes. The model is validated using the known behavior replication test and the extreme conditions test. In order to guide decision-makers in the different uses of the above system dynamic model, a methodology for the improvement of the AFSC robustness is presented and applied to a case study. As a result, the SC robustness to the defined disruptions is provided. For critical disruptions, protective actions are defined. Finally, the model is re-run to evaluate the impact of these proactive strategies on the AFSC in order to finally select the most beneficial for improving its robustness.</jats:p>",

However, the extent to which such services exist in Australia and how they operate is currently unknown. We aimed to identify Australian online contraception platforms and evaluate the services they provide to determine the degree to which they may facilitate equitable access to contraception. We conducted an internet search to identify online contraception platforms operating in Australia. Data were extracted from each of the platforms relating to operating policies, services provided and associated payment processes, as well as prescribing and screening processes for assessing user suitability. As of July 2022, eight online contraception platforms operating within Australia were identified. All platforms offered oral contraception, with two also offering the vaginal ring, and one emergency oral contraception. None of the platforms provided access to long-acting reversible contraception. Significant variability existed in product and membership costs across platforms, with only one platform providing access to subsidised medicines. Five platforms restricted services to those already using oral contraception. Overall, online questionnaires were deemed to be adequately screening for important contraindications to using oral contraception. While online contraception platforms may be a valuable option for some individuals who face access barriers and are willing to pay out-of-pocket for to have their contraception sent straight to their home, they do not necessarily ensure that individuals can access their contraceptive method of choice or address recognised financial and structural barriers to contraceptive care.</jats:p>"

The process of automation eliminates the need for more humans to employ and also reduces the need for storage building which is required for storing physical documents.

When a quality defect happens, it is usually cost‐inefficient to trace the source of quality problems and all firms in the supply chain might incur a loss. New technologies such as blockchain can enable supply chain traceability at an affordable cost. In this paper, we develop a two‐echelon supply chain model including one supplier and one buyer in a competitive market. The quality of the final product depends on the two firms’ quality efforts. The buyer as a leader can set a wholesale price to stimulate the supplier's effort. In the absence (presence) of traceability, the payment of wholesale price is based on the realization of the final product's quality (the supplier's individual quality). Interestingly, we find that supply chain traceability may cause a decrease of the supplier's quality effort, thereby reducing the quality of the final product when market competition is sufficiently intensive. Furthermore, traceability weakly increases the supplier's profit but weakly decreases the buyer's profit. However, the total profit of the supply chain can be increased in the presence of traceability.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aims to develop a map of the spatial distribution pattern and to analyze the potential source of manganese and nitrate in groundwater in Sleman Regency in Yogyakarta Province. The method used is mapping groundwater quality using the ArcGIS application, analyzing groundwater pollution with water quality standards in the Indonesian Ministry of Health regulation number 492/Menkes/per/IV/2010 regarding drinking water quality requirements, and identifying the potential source of high pollution. Data processing uses the ArcGIS 10.8 application by performing the IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) Interpolation technique. The result of this study has obtained a map of the distribution of groundwater quality for manganese and nitrate from 2017-2019. Manganese contamination may come from industrial and/or agricultural waste, while higher nitrate concentration might be a result of a septic tank leak and/or pesticide/fertilizer residue in paddy fields.</jats:p>",

Results revealed that all the average values of the physico-chemical parameters measured during wet and dry seasons for the water samples from the different water sources and sampling points are within the allowable range except for turbidity and color during and just after typhoons and prolonged strong rainfalls. As to microbiological parameters, samples from the sources, storage tank, and distribution line have a very high total coliform count, and Escherichia coli content for both seasons. For heterotrophic plate count, only the water samples from Balabag Spring for both wet and dry seasons, from the storage tank during the wet season, and from Gakhan Spring during the dry season have acceptable values. Findings indicate the high vulnerability of the water sources to microbial contamination. Thus, water in all sources is not potable and is therefore not recommended for drinking purposes in its present condition. To address the water supply quality problems, filtration systems may be included in the water system design, the intake tanks, or a new reservoir.</jats:p>",

In the present work an original design approach for a supply device for liquid nitrogen is developed and characterized in detail. With the device pure liquid nitrogen is supplied from a pressurized dewar flask to a hypodermic needle without contamination of the liquid with its own vapor or frost, finally enabling to generate a free liquid jet or single droplets in a way comparable to the handling of non-cryogenic liquids using a syringe and a hypodermic needle. Compared to previous approaches for the generation of liquid nitrogen droplets in scientific studies which mostly rely on a reservoir for liquid nitrogen from which droplets form at a bottom outlet due to gravity, the present design allows generation of droplets and free liquid jets in a significantly better controlled and more flexible way. The device is experimentally characterized for varying operational conditions during generation of a free liquid jet, and its versatility for laboratory research purposes is further briefly demonstrated.</jats:p>"

At present, it is a key tool to implement energy efficiency measures in the existing supply chain management. In this paper, we study the efficiency of the energy performance contracting in a supply chain including one risk‐averse supplier and two risk‐neutral manufacturers with financial asymmetry. The manufacturer with weak finance has no funds to order enough raw materials; thus, the supplier offers a trade credit financing to ensure her normal operation and participate in the competition with the financially strong manufacturer in the market. However, neither manufacturer has extra capitals to develop emission reduction activities. Therefore, the upstream supplier acts as an energy service company and provides an energy performance contracting for two downstream manufacturers to reduce carbon taxes. We analyze important factors such as risk aversion coefficient, carbon tax saving sharing ratio, and variable cost coefficient to explore whether and which manufacturer the supplier should select to provide an energy performance contracting. The results show that, when the risk aversion is high, the supplier will not provide energy‐saving services for any manufacturer. When the risk aversion and the variable cost are low, the supplier tends to offer an energy performance contracting for the manufacturer with weak finance, because the supplier can get more utility from higher wholesale price. However, with the increase of costs, the supplier with a low risk aversion is more willing to provide emission reduction services for the financially strong manufacturer. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that there is always a Pareto region to optimize the utility of supplier and manufacturers, when the supplier provides energy performance contracting for both manufacturers.</jats:p>",

First, an explanation is provided for the importance of including location analytics in the standard business school curriculum—especially in the field of supply chain management. Second, a lack of GIS‐based location analytics methods in business school curricula is demonstrated. Third, a three‐part location analytics exercise is introduced to contribute to the supply chain management curriculum. The proposed exercise utilizes the output of a GIS‐based location analytics software (namely, Esri's ArcGIS Online) as the input for a location set covering problem that can be solved using an integer programming solver. The exercise can also be used as a stand‐alone example of GIS in a supply chain management course. This teaching brief aims to (1) develop a new method to use in teaching location analytics in supply chain management and analytics courses and (2) bridge an important gap between supply chain management practice and curriculum.</jats:p>",

In red onion farming there have a problem of price fluctuations which result in an uneven and less transparent distribution of red onions yields, thus affecting both consumers and producers. To answer these problems, we designed a system to maintain and store red onion harvest data for farmers, collectors, distributors, and retailers in the form of a blockchain-based supply chain system. This system can maintain the validity of transactions in the supply chain of red onion farming with a private blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric. Then the data on the blockchain system will be displayed through the Hyperledger Explorer website. This system already passed the Black Box Testing system. From the research and testing of the system that has been made, this system can help the red onion farming to maintain the validity of transactions in the supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the work was to determine the system parameters of the key area of pharmaceutical knowledge \"drug supply\" (DS) and to assess the possibility of using these parameters to monitor the state of knowledge about the DS. The research material was the information base of the Leningrad Region, formed on the basis of the lists of references for 8 dissertations on the problems of the Leningrad Region (2015-2022) and included 1910 bibliographic references. Methods of logical, comparative and system information analysis (SIA; variant of scientometrics) are used. As a result of the study, for the first time, the system parameters of DS as a field of scientific knowledge were determined - fundamentality, connections with other fields of knowledge, integration into systems of other sciences, development potential and fruitfulness of the knowledge system; their suitability for characterizing the state of the given area is shown. Quantitative indicators for the selected parameters are calculated, which indicate noticeable differences between the information system of the DS from the hierarchically close system \"pharmaceutical informatics\", as well as from information systems of a higher level - the discipline and pharmaceutical science in general. Determination of the specific indicator of the closeness (strength) of the connection showed that the field of DS is most closely connected with medicine (the value of the indicator is 133.97), pharmacy (36.09) and healthcare (12.18). In total, connections with 16 areas of scientific and practical activity were revealed. Abnormally high values of the index of heterogeneity and the cumulative influence of other sciences on the DS indicate that this area of knowledge is still being formed, without yet forming a stable structure. It has been established that the DS region has a high potential for development; after 1991, two “daughter” subsystems were formed within its framework. At the same time, the process of formation of the field of DS itself as a scientific system is very difficult, the search for an adequate model continues - economic, social, medical, universal, etc. The identified numerical values of the system parameters of the DS area can be used as basic or comparative in diagnosing the state and further development of this knowledge system (monitoring), as well as in similar studies of other areas of pharmaceutical scientific knowledge.</jats:p>"

Of key interest in this paper is the core subject; Sports and Physical Education and optional subjects; Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Home Science, Computer Science and Foreign Languages in which learners are provided with an opportunity to choose according to abilities, interests and career choices. Hitherto the new curriculum, various challenges pose a profound threat to the 26333 education system. Key among them is the infrastructure of schools that is not well established in the secondary schools that will be essential in identification of talent among learners through the subjects mentioned. This implies that some students will miss out on their career progression due to low quality services unless necessary interventions are made. This paper therefore set out to examine whether the school infrastructural system supports development of students varied abilities and to make recommendations on appropriate ways of developing various students’ abilities. Survey research design was used. The stratified and proportionate sampling was used to select 14 schools. Respondents included 14 head teachers. Interview schedules, library methods and observation schedules were used to get information. The findings established that the schools had inadequate infrastructure. It is recommended that, school administration should strive to partner with different stakeholders to develop infrastructure to enhance students’ participation.</jats:p>"

The core goal of this work is to develop an innovative simulation-based approach to support more informed and effective decision making, while establishing reasonable trade-offs between supply chain robustness and resiliency, operational efficiency, and environmental and social concerns. Such a decision-support system will contribute to the development of more resilient and sustainable pharmaceutical supply chains, which are, in general, critical for maintaining access to essential medicines, especially during times of crises or relevant disruptions. The system will help companies to better manage and design their supply chains, providing a valuable tool to achieve higher levels of resilience and sustainability. The study we conducted has two primary contributions that are noteworthy. Firstly, we present a new advanced approach that integrates multiple simulation techniques, allowing for the modeling of highly complex environments. Secondly, we introduce a new conceptual framework that helps to comprehend the interplay between resiliency and sustainability in decision-making processes. These two contributions provide valuable insights into understanding complex systems and can aid in designing more resilient and sustainable systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Remanufacturing is a way for product recovery initiative and maintaining sufficient production flow to satisfy customer demand through circular economy. Recently, manufacturers have been progressively incorporating remanufacturing processes, making their supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. Among the disruptions that usually occur is the shortage in spare parts supply, which causes unexpected delay in production and possible loss of sales. In the face of potential disruption, it is essential for remanufacturing facilities to manage their supply chains in an optimum manner as to decrease the adverse impact of disruptions to their business. In this study, a two-stage production-inventory system is analysed by developing a cost-minimisation model focusing on the recovery schedule after a disruption occurrence in sourcing spare parts for a remanufacturer’s production cycle. The developed model was solved using the branch and bound algorithm. Through numerical experiments, the results indicate that the optimal recovery schedule and the number of recovery cycles are significantly dependant on disruption time, lost sales and backorder costs. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis shows that the lost sales option seems to be more effective than the backorder option in optimising the system’s overall cost. The proposed model could assist managers in deciding the optimal production strategy while providing interesting managerial insights into vital spare parts recovery issues when disruption strikes.</jats:p>"

Our results reveal that political acceptance is considered the most important criterion with a global weight of 0.514 in the context of Thailand. Additionally, natural gas is found to be the foreseeable source for hydrogen production in Thailand with a global weight of 0.313.

Development, operation, and management are vital in a reservoir operating policy, especially when the reservoir serves a complex objective. In this study, an attempt via metaheuristic algorithms, namely the Harris Hawks Optimisation (HHO) Algorithm and the Opposite Based Learning of HHO (OBL-HHO) are made to minimise the water deficit as well as mitigate floods at downstream of the Klang Gate Dam (KGD). Due to trade-offs between water supply and flood management, the HHO and OBL-HHO models have configurable thresholds to optimise the KGD reservoir operation. To determine the efficacy of the HHO and OBL-HHO in reservoir optimisation, reliability, vulnerability, and resilience are risk measures evaluated. If inflow categories are omitted, the OBL-HHO meets 71.49% of demand compared to 54.83% for the standalone HHO. The HHO proved superior to OBL-HHO in satisfying demand during medium inflows, achieving 38.60% compared to 20.61%, even though the HHO may have experienced water loss at the end of the storage level. The HHO is still a promising method, as proven by its reliability and resilience indices compared to other published heuristic algorithms: at 62.50% and 1.56, respectively. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) outcomes satisfied demand at 61.36%, 59.47% with the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), 55.68% with the real-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA), and 23.5 percent with the binary GA. For resilience, the ABC scored 0.16, PSO scored 0.15, and real coded GA scored 0.14 whilst the binary-GA has the worst failure recovery algorithm with 0.09.</jats:p>"

Gain weight and P50 significantly decreased in OsAOX1a-RNAi rice seed, indicating that there might be impaired in seed development and storability. Compared to WT seeds in the 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% germination, respectively, NADH and succinate-dependent O2 consumption, the activity mitochondrial malate dehydro-genase and ATP contents were decreased in OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds in the 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% germination, respectively, indicating that mitochondrial status in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds after imbibition was weaken than the WT. In addition to, the reduced abundance of complex I N and P module subunits might showed that the capacity of mitochondrial electron transfer chain was significantly inhibited in the OsAOX1a-RNAi seed at critical node of seed viability. Above results might indicated that the ATP production was impaired in OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds during ageing. Therefore, we conclude that the activities of mitochondrial metabolism and alternative pathways were severely inhibited in OsAOX1a-RNAi seeds at critical node of viability, which was leading to accelerate the collapse of seed viability. The precise regulatory mechanism of the alternative pathway at the critical node of viability still needs to be further analyzed.</jats:p>"

Drawing from the perspectives of social networks and organizational learning we highlight the relevance of the interdependency between these networks for a firm's technological entry and exit decisions. We argue that a firm that maintains a large number of supplier ties is more likely to enter new technology domains and exit from old technology domains instead. We further find empirical evidence that the degree centrality of a firm in its board interlock network strengthens these effects. Our theoretical arguments are supported through stochastic actor-based modeling analysis for the longitudinal and multilevel networks of 86 firms active in the Chinese automotive during 2011–2015. These findings inform the literature on interorganizational network dynamics as we insert relational pluralism to examine the complexities of organizational relationships as antecedents to a firms’ technological entry and exit. Finally, we imagine the implications of our analysis for management as they shed light on how multiple interorganizational relationships affect firms’ decisions on new technology entry and old technology exit.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, managers need techniques for protecting supply chains from serious and costly disruptions, establishing permanent relationships with the customers and partners and preventing breakdowns throughout the process. Each firm needs to determine SCM strategies to be prepared for breakdowns in an intense competitive environment. With COVID-19, the change in business and trade environments has taken a different dimension, and it has revealed a new relationship between the efforts to perpetuate supply chains and strategies for supply chain management and enabled new models. In this study, it is aimed to prioritize the factors that lead to SCM breaks needed in project management and the realization of projects, and to choose the most successful SCM strategy considering COVID-19. For this purpose, rough SWARA was used for weighting factors and rough MARCOS was used for the alternative selection. According to the findings, the transportation capacity factor was found to be the most important factor leading to SCM breakdowns. The most ideal supply chain management strategy has been the “collaborative supply chain management strategy.” In the food manufacturing sector, the study can be considered as a roadmap in terms of preventing supply chain management breaks during the COVID-19 process and helping to ensure a sustainable production. As another theoretical and practical importance of the study, it is aimed to propose a robust, powerful, and practical decision-making model that can cope with the current uncertainties.</jats:p>",

One of the key tools to address such growing food demand is minimizing grain losses and optimizing food processing operations. Hence, several research studies are underway to reduce grain losses/degradation at the farm (upon harvest) and later during the milling and baking processes. However, less attention has been paid to changes in grain quality between harvest and milling. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap and discusses possible strategies for preserving grain quality (for Canadian wheat in particular) during unit operations at primary, process, or terminal elevators. To this end, the importance of wheat flour quality metrics is briefly described, followed by a discussion on the effect of grain properties on such quality parameters. This work also explores how drying, storage, blending, and cleaning, as some of the common post‐harvest unit operations, could affect grain's end‐product quality. Finally, an overview of the available techniques for grain quality monitoring is provided, followed by a discussion on existing gaps and potential solutions for quality traceability throughout the wheat supply chain.</jats:p>",

One current application is that providing supply chain transparency, sellers can disclose product information to consumers for authentication and certification. To examine the supply chain blockchain based transparency‐level strategy and its interact with different refund policies, in a two‐echelon supply chain, we consider a supplier decides on the transparency level and wholesale price, and a retailer decides on retail price and provides full refund (policy F), or partial refund (policy P), or no refund (policy N) policy to consumers. We find the refund policy choice and the transparency‐level strategy have a mutual influence. A lenient refund policy (a higher refund) can generate more demand, which makes the supplier to provide a high transparency level, whereas a high consumer's transparency awareness also promotes the retailer to choose a more lenient refund policy. We find Pareto improvement exists under a cost‐sharing strategy, and the retailer is willing to share part of the adoption cost only when the efficiency of improving the transparency level is moderate. Otherwise, the retailer adopts blockchain technology only when there is no cost sharing. Further, different shipping cost bearers can change the sensitivity of refund policy choice, and the supplier prefers to provide a high transparency level when the retailer covers the shipping cost. When the retailer becomes more socially responsible, the supplier is more willing to provide a higher transparency level, and the retailer is more willing to provide a partial refund policy.</jats:p>",

Besides, it transforms the sustainable supply chain towards a new paradigm of redesign, reuse, and product transformation. Additionally, the integration of a circular economy paradigm within sustainable supply chain management will provide benefits from an environmental perspective. Hence, the authors would like to review the role of green technologies in sustainable supply chain management within a circular economy. In addition, the focus will be given to analyzing the benefits of a circular economy from an environmental point of view.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;Abstract&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; lipogenesis is a well-described androgen receptor (AR)–regulated metabolic pathway that supports prostate cancer tumor growth by providing fuel, membrane material, and steroid hormone precursor. In contrast, our current understanding of lipid supply from uptake of exogenous lipids and its regulation by AR is limited, and exogenous lipids may play a much more significant role in prostate cancer and disease progression than previously thought. By applying advanced automated quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we provide the most comprehensive functional analysis of lipid uptake in cancer cells to date and demonstrate that treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens results in significantly increased cellular uptake of fatty acids, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein particles. Consistent with a direct, regulatory role of AR in this process, androgen-enhanced lipid uptake can be blocked by the AR-antagonist enzalutamide, but is independent of proliferation and cell-cycle progression. This work for the first time comprehensively delineates the lipid transporter landscape in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples by analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data, including the plasma membrane proteome. We show that androgen exposure or deprivation regulates the expression of multiple lipid transporters in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and that mRNA and protein expression of lipid transporters is enhanced in bone metastatic disease when compared with primary, localized prostate cancer. Our findings provide a strong rationale to investigate lipid uptake as a therapeutic cotarget in the fight against advanced prostate cancer in combination with inhibitors of lipogenesis to delay disease progression and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;Implications:&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer exhibits metabolic plasticity in acquiring lipids from uptake and lipogenesis at different disease stages, indicating potential therapeutic benefit by cotargeting lipid supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

Theoretical Framework: Based on the primary factors affecting the efficiency and performance of global supply chain activities in logistics for Vietnam's exports, including practical impact and logistics results of enterprises in Vietnam. Based on the primary factors affecting the efficiency and performance of global supply chain activities in logistics for Vietnam's exports, including (1). Customs efficiency (speed, simplicity and predictability of customs clearance procedures) (2). Quality of infrastructure related to trade and transport, including Roads, railways, ports, airports, warehouses and information technology ...(3). The level of ease when arranging to transport import and export goods with competitive prices (costs such as warehousing fees, port fees, tolls ... ) (4). Capacity and quality of logistics service providers ... (5). Ability to track and trace shipments. (6). Timeliness of the shipment to the destination within the specified time limit. The practical impact and logistics results of enterprises in Vietnam. Method: The panel approach allows the authors to explore the heterogeneity in data across countries. Fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models were used to estimate the model. Then, the Hausman test is carried out to decide which model is appropriate. The data were collected from 240 observations from Vietnam and 80 major export partner countries of Vietnam. Findings: The research results show that the cost, time and capacity of providing logistics services have the most significant impact on Vietnam's exports. Practical &amp; social implications: Overall, to increase the efficiency and logistics efficiency of enterprises. The Vietnamese Government needs to cooperate and propose ideas to partner countries to improve logistics activities for exports from Vietnam. Logistics is beginning to play an increasingly important role in the competitiveness of economies. Originality values: This study also confirms the sustainability of the extended gravity model using OLS and RE methods by substituting different variables for the country's logistics efficiency and solving the endogenous problem in the model while applying the regression method to industrial variables. We find that an 1% improvement in Vietnam's logistics would increase Vietnam's exports by 1.443%, and an 1% improvement in a partner country’s performance would help promote Vietnam's exports to this country by 0.546%.</jats:p>",

The first is such organisms’ ability to acquire resistance genes through genetic elements, and the second seems to be the substances’ potential toxicity. The health index of supply water is lacking for bacteria such as coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and intestinal enterococci. The study's main aim was to figure out how these bacteria function as antibiotic resistance pools, not only to find resistant genes like SHV, TEM, and CTX-M but also to depict the dendrogram of clones in water supply samples in Tehran. Over the course of a year, 17 strains of P. aeruginosa were analyzed. In this study, 94.1% of the isolates tested positive for the TEM gene, while only one isolate tested positive for the CTX-M gene, and none tested positive for the SHV gene. This research shows that P. aeruginosa is not as common in drinkable water as previously thought. Nevertheless, it appears that P. aeruginosa can spread acquired antibiotic resistance vertically rather than horizontally.</jats:p>",

Reasonable balancing curves for reservoirs in parallel are proposed, and the proportional distribution of water is determined to illustrate the optimal allocation rule for different reservoir scheduling periods. The mutation point and slope are used to describe the segmentation of reservoirs in parallel. Finally, the relative optimal water supply rule is obtained. Taking the reservoir groups in the lower reaches of the Luanhe River basin as the research object, the results show that the water supply obtained by the balancing curve is increased by approximately 4% compared with the compensation regulation, and wasted water is reduced by 10%. The results are close to the largest water supply, the annual average wasted water and the guarantee rate obtained by dynamic programming. The suggested method can achieve the operation goal effectively and improve the operation performance of the shared water demands for the reservoir water supply. This article highlights the superior results obtained compared with the current storage allocation rules to meet shared water demands.</jats:p>",

At present the Russian Government has adopted a program for the development of the manufacturing industry until the end of 2035: during this time manufacturing output should grow by 192 %. It is obvious that this program should also meet the requirements of the modern scientific concept of industrial revolution \"Industry 4.0\", when manufacturing enterprises and corporations begin to develop and apply subsystems and elements of \"smart manufacturing\", which help to build intelligent communications between individual tasks and operations during the entire life cycle of production, in accordance with the principles and methods of systems engineering. It is important to note that the issues of intelligent management in the subject-oriented area of electric power industry (in our case — energy saving), as the basis of any industrial production in modern conditions, require the development and implementation, first of all, of new solutions based on modern IT-technologies. It is known that energy intensity in Russia, according to the World Bank, is 3-4 times lower than in European countries. It is also known that in connection with the new provisions in the field of housing and communal services, aimed at improving economic efficiency in terms of electricity consumption, it becomes very important to ensure its accurate and operational accounting with the possibility of further forecasting of electricity consumption and the state of power grid facilities, which will allow specialized organizations and services, as well as the managing bodies in the shortest time to make a balanced specialized decisions This paper proposes the concept of intelligent control system to manage the process of condition monitoring based on data from intelligent sensors.

The methodological approach was based on a technical inspection of 647 water points (181 boreholes and 466 wells) and semi-structured interviews with 500 stakeholders, including 103 water point committee members, 389 water users, and 8 water experts. According to the findings, one out of every three hand pumps is inoperable. Based on this rate, approximately 1.3 billion CFA francs (approximately 2 million US dollars) invested by the government, communities, and development partners are immobilized and do not generate any benefit for affected rural communities. This high level of handpump non-functionality is due to the low economic viability of water point management, the poor functionality of water point committees, and the poorly structured handpump maintenance chain. The pooling of water point management at the scale of the Mvila Division appears to be an avenue to be explored to improve the functionality of the handpump.</jats:p>",

Using a sample of 263 Chinese listed firms, we find that no single factor is necessary to achieve high firm performance during COVID-19 and reveal four paths to produce high performance: operational level driven, supply base complexity driven, and customer base complexity driven with supplier distance, and supply network complexity absence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that supply-based complexity-driven and customer-based complexity-driven can improve firm performance, but not all supply network complexity dimensions can improve firm performance.

The coastal community was found to be already adopting technological measures as an adaptation means. This study developed a detailed inventory of all the available indigenous water supply technology options along the region and categorized them. An analysis of the suitability of the technologies was done, focusing on factors like the state of the technology, convenience in operation, quantity and quality of the supplied water, as well as financial viability or management practice. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches to the study were adopted to collect and analyze the data through extensive field visits, laboratory testing, and secondary data analysis.

This paper presents an investigation of the problem of transshipment among distribution centers (DCs) in a cold supply chain to achieve sustainable inventory cross-filling. Although transshipment is an effective tool for supply chain pooling, the possibility of increased GHG emissions raises environmental concerns. This study establishes a sustainable cold-chain logistics model that considers GHG emissions from DC storage and transshipment trucks. The new sustainable cold-chain model also reflects laden status and cargo weights of trucks for accurate emission assessment. An optimization model is also developed to minimize both GHG emissions and costs in the cold chain. Numerical simulations are conducted for diverse problem cases to examine important problem characteristics. The result analysis identifies that inventory service levels and demand variability have a strong impact on GHG emissions in transshipment; small p-values in the statistical analysis verify the significance of this effect. The different effects of demand variability and service levels on each emission source are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that transshipment among DCs can effectively reduce both GHG emissions and costs in cold supply chains. This study provides useful models and tools to assess GHG emissions and optimize decisions for the design and operation of transshipment. The proposed models will enable the assessment of sustainable alternatives and achieve sustainability objectives effectively for cold supply chains.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this essential component of the building envelope functions herein as a heat exchanger with its own geometric characteristics and exchange conditions. In this research, a dual numerical and experimental approach has been implemented in order to highlight the temperatures, velocities and heat flux fields both at the glazing surfaces and in the ventilated air gaps. Several turbulence models were tested using CFD software (ANSYS-FLUENT®); their results were compared with each other as well as with the experimental results. This study shows that the air gap geometry in the window induces flow disturbances, recirculation phenomena and non-uniform heat exchanges, all of which prove to be important in terms of overall component performance. With regard to modeling and, in particular, at the level of turbulence models, the results obtained indicate that the model GEKO is best suited to the configuration under study when the phenomena of turbulent forced convection dominate the dynamics of the transfers. The k-ε models reveal a tremendous weakness in precisely estimating the problem’s characteristic quantities. From an experimental point of view, local measurements of thermal fluxes and temperatures demonstrate high efficiency with regard to experimental technique, which in turn could be extended to many different configurations for the local evaluation of convection heat transfer.</jats:p>"

Traditional blockchains rely on computationally expensive consensus mechanisms with low throughput and high latency. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of several existing consensus protocols to illustrate blockchain’s shortcomings in terms of consensus and propose a new consensus algorithm: Reputation based proof of cooperation (RPoC). The RPoC algorithm uses a layered architecture to segment the nodes that participate in the consensus phase in order to improve scalability and efficiency while maintaining trust among peers. The layered design addresses the issues of flexibility and scalability and breaks down the extensive mining process into segments. Rather than choosing a few nodes for mining, the proposed consensus process involves all network nodes, making it more efficient, decentralized and scalable. Through extensive theoretical analysis and experimentation, the suitability of the proposed algorithm is established in terms of scalability and efficiency.</jats:p>",

In contrast, our current understanding of lipid supply from uptake of exogenous lipids and its regulation by AR is limited, and exogenous lipids may play a much more significant role in prostate cancer and disease progression than previously thought. By applying advanced automated quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we provide the most comprehensive functional analysis of lipid uptake in cancer cells to date and demonstrate that treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens results in significantly increased cellular uptake of fatty acids, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein particles. Consistent with a direct, regulatory role of AR in this process, androgen-enhanced lipid uptake can be blocked by the AR-antagonist enzalutamide, but is independent of proliferation and cell-cycle progression. This work for the first time comprehensively delineates the lipid transporter landscape in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples by analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data, including the plasma membrane proteome. We show that androgen exposure or deprivation regulates the expression of multiple lipid transporters in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and that mRNA and protein expression of lipid transporters is enhanced in bone metastatic disease when compared with primary, localized prostate cancer. Our findings provide a strong rationale to investigate lipid uptake as a therapeutic cotarget in the fight against advanced prostate cancer in combination with inhibitors of lipogenesis to delay disease progression and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;Implications:&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer exhibits metabolic plasticity in acquiring lipids from uptake and lipogenesis at different disease stages, indicating potential therapeutic benefit by cotargeting lipid supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

The basic metals industry is one of the most energy‐intensive industries in the electricity supply chain. The impossibility of large‐scale energy storage, reservation constraints, and its high costs, limitations on electricity transmission lines capacity, real‐time response to high priority strategic demands, and variety of energy rates at different hours and seasons are issues that challenge the electricity supply chain. A hybrid approach is presented in this paper to improve the accuracy of long‐term demand forecasting in the electricity supply chain. The proposed approach uses wavelet decomposition and long short‐term memory (LSTM) neural networks to produce new predictors for demand forecasting in case of defective data. The data used in this study consists of the recorded hourly demand of Espidan Iron Stone (EIS) company and data of Mobarakeh Steel (MS) company in Isfahan Province. The understudy time series includes a lot of interruptions due to non‐production of the factory or power outages and spikes which cause uncertainty that makes the forecasting more difficult in comparison with continuous time series. Multiple machine learning models including decision trees (DTs), boosted and bagged trees (BGTs), support vector regression (SVR) models, extreme learning machines (ELMs), and a LSTM neural network model are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this paper. A comparison of the results obtained using the hybrid proposed approach and training machine learning (ML) methods shows a notable reduction in forecasting error.</jats:p>",

However, how to generate this kind of excitation voltage with a simple structure is rarely researched. To address the issue, a novel LC‐based bipolar high‐voltage pulsed power supply is proposed in this paper. The proposed power supply is comprised of an inductance, two capacitances, a step‐up transformer, and two power switches sharing the same ground. By planning the switch sequence of the two power switches, a resonant stage and an idle stage are formed. The resonant stage is used to generate a bipolar pulse excitation voltage on DBD excimer lamps and an idle time in the excitation voltage is generated in the idle stage. The characteristics and the parameters design of the proposed power supply are studied by theoretical analysis. To verify the feasibility of the proposed power supply, an experimental setup is built with a DBD‐type excimer lamp. The experimental results show that the power supply not only better takes advantage of the potential of DBD excimer lamps, but also there is a fine luminous regulation feature for the excimer lamp. Besides these characteristics, the proposed power supply has several other benefits, such as good adaptability to different DBD‐type excimer lamps, a small number of components, and high efficiency.</jats:p>",

In the context of climate change and the increasing crisis of water resources, how to effectively use forest resources and other natural resources to achieve sustainable management of agricultural water ecosystems has become an increasingly urgent issue. Therefore, this paper proposed a real-time self-organization algorithm for forest cultivation, tea planting and tea processing for sustainable ecosystem management of agricultural water resources. This paper first described the sustainable ecosystem of agricultural water resources, carried out optimization analysis on tea planting and processing technology, using the genetic optimization algorithm based on decision tree and then carried out an experimental analysis on a tea garden. It can be seen from the data that the average monthly temperature of the tea garden cultivated by the algorithm in this paper was between 13.4 and 20.5 °C and the average annual temperature was 16.16 °C. However, the average monthly temperature of the traditional cultivation method was between 11.5 and 16.8 °C and the average annual temperature was 13.64 °C.</jats:p>"

The urgency of this task has increased in the context of diplomatic isolation and the imposition of economic sanctions that have affected the collapse of the main technological and logistics chains. In these circumstances, the need to understand which industry structure will give the largest increment in production volumes and the lowest prices while maintaining the stability of supply chains is of particular importance. The purpose of the study is to determine the principles and optimal forms of organizing the activities of firms in supply chains from the standpoint of market efficiency and profitability of the participants themselves. The set goal predetermined the solution of the following tasks: a comparative analysis of two options for the interaction of chain participants was carried out – autonomous functioning and full vertical integration; the model of contractual relations of firms is identified, which allows them to receive maximum profit; the most attractive variant of the chain organization from the position of the consumer (output volumes and prices) was determined; an economic-mathematical model has been developed for calculating the optimal parameters of activity in the supply chain of an industrial enterprise for two opposite models of firms’ behavior. The methodological basis of the study is a synthesis of theoretical, methodological and applied research of foreign and domestic specialists in the field of supply chain management theory, as well as the theory of industry markets. The scientific novelty of the study is a methodical approach to considering the supply chain as a system oriented to the market function of demand, i.e. the activities of all participants in the chain are set up to produce and sell such a volume of goods for which demand is presented. The article proposes a formal model that allows one to analyze the incentives for vertical integration and evaluate the results of alternative strategies for the behavior of firms in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Each started to show a much steeper, positive change between 2012 and 2014 (APCfat: 1.0; 95%CI: 0.8–1.1; APCprotein: 0.5; 95%CI: 0.3–0.6; APCkcal: 0.4; 95%CI: 0.3–0.5). In terms of the composition of the daily calorie intake per capita, the overall share of fat (+4.9%) and protein (+1.0%) increased between 2000 and 2019. We found significant differences among countries and also an increasing and optimal proportion of consumed protein per total calorie in all countries over the last two decades. We concluded that several countries have access to fat availability above the optimal level, which deserves particular attention from health policy makers in the fight against obesity and diet-related diseases.</jats:p>"

We show that both self‐ and government labels facilitate and adjust the promotion effect of encroachment on product greenness, stimulating green demand and retail prices for profitability improvement and raising wholesale prices for investment sharing. The difference is that self‐labeling's low credibility and complete self‐interest features only induce inferior greenness increments and coordination effects. Government labeling outperforms self‐labeling in simultaneously optimizing the interests of the manufacturer, retailer, and society, presuming the benefits of greenness improvement reimburse investments.</jats:p>",

In this paper, on the basis of considering asymptomatic infections and relapse, this paper establishes a risk transmission model that considers a recurrent Susceptible–Exposed–Asymptomatic–Infectious–Recovered (abbr. SEAIR) model, systematically analyses the risks in the supply chain, and calculates the risk balance point to conclude that the risks can exist in the supply chain for a long time. By drawing a causal circuit diagram, the relationship between the influencing factors in the process of risk transmission is found, establishing a stock flow map to explore the law of risk propagation. The simulation results using Vensim PLE software show that the five influencing factors of infection rate, transmission rate, government financial support, government policy supervision, and immunity loss ratio have an important impact on the number of risk-unknown enterprises, risk-latent enterprises, risk transmission enterprises, and infection rehabilitation enterprises in risk transmission, and relevant countermeasures to deal with risk transmission in the supply chain are proposed. Theoretically, this paper broadens the ideas for improving infectious disease models. From the management point of view, it reveals how the prefabricated building supply chain enables enterprises to improve their ability to deal with risks through the risk propagation model, providing reference and helping to manage the risks faced by the prefabricated building supply chain.</jats:p>"

The recent rise in the foreign currency against the Nigerian Naira has further increase the cost of purchasing and maintaining foreign equipment. In this work, a constant temperature hot and cold-water supply system (CT50WS) for laboratory application was developed. This is to explore the production of equipment locally. The developed system was tested on a load and no-load conditions. A shell and tube heat exchanger were used to simulate the load on the component. The system was designed to heat and cool 50 liters of water independently. Results of the tests carried out on the constructed CT50WS on no load condition showed that the actual rate of heat loss from the hot water system is 34.4W. The actual rate of heat gain from the cold-water tank is 16.03W, far lower than the designed heat gain rate of 74.9 W (10%) heat gain rate. When tested on-load condition, the CT50WS was able to continuously supply 100 litre/hr of hot and cold water at a temperature of 50 and 18oC respectively to the heat exchanger. The open market cost of a similar foreign equipment is about 25 times the cost of CT50WS. Its acceptability will further open opportunities in local production of teaching and research equipment, thereby serving as source of job creation and saving the scarce foreign currencies.</jats:p>"

Power outages cause a decrease in the continuity of service to customers and result in a lot of loss of electrical energy that is not distributed to customers. The research objectives are to find out the optimization technique of distribution network maintenance, how to reduce the value of energy not supplied (ENS), find out the losses due to ENS, and find out the total electrical energy distributed after preventive maintenance is carried out. This research uses a preventive maintenance method, which is maintenance that can prevent unexpected damage to distribution system networks and equipment. This research optimized preventive maintenance actions by reducing disturbances after preventive maintenance from 7 disturbances in February to 2 disturbances in March. Before preventive maintenance, the loss due to ENS amounted to Rp. 36,192,017.626, and the total electrical energy not distributed was 25,025.76 kWh. After preventive maintenance, there was a significant decrease in the total loss due to ENS of Rp. 953,516,447, and the amount of electrical energy not distributed was 659.28 kWh. This research can increase maintenance efficiency due to electrical energy losses by 97.36% at the time interval when this research data is managed when data collection is carried out in the field.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

Therefore, reaching the maximum UV protection by themselves is difficult. Natural compounds are good consideration to include in sunscreen formulations. Papaya seeds contain large amounts of nutraceutical compounds. However, their presence is often considered as waste. One of many benefits it has is due to the presence of flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, saponins, and tannins. Flavonoid is one of the alternative compounds that provide beneficial effects on skin UV-protection. Therefore, this study aimed to extract the flavonoid compounds in papaya seeds and test its sun protection factor (SPF) value. Extraction was carried out by varying the mass ratio of the solid/solvent (1:10, 1:20, and 1:30), and the solvent concentration of ethanol (50%, 70%, and 96%) at 45oC for 45 minutes. The results of this study indicate the presence of these compounds in papaya seed extract which was extracted using the ultrasound-assisted extraction method with the maximum extraction yield (11.888%) obtained at 1:30 mass ratio with a 50% ethanol concentration; the highest total flavonoid content was 2.854 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g papaya seed at 1:30 ratio with 96% ethanol concentration, and the highest SPF value was at a 50% ethanol concentration which was 12.0775 (at 300 ppm).</jats:p>"

Yet, these catchments are becoming rarer with climate change and anthropogenic pressures that threaten groundwater systems. Restoration of low-gradient meadows and streams can recover a catchment’s natural storage potential, especially in Mediterranean biomes such as the Sierra Nevada of California where summer groundwater recharge is scarce. The degradation of meadows due to intense human modification has decreased groundwater elevations and shifted wet meadow plant communities toward more xeric forest and shrub communities. We applied machine learning tools to find potential “lost meadows” that may no longer support high groundwater elevations or meadow vegetation but do exhibit basic geomorphic and climatic characteristics similar to existing meadows. The model reveals potential meadow habitat in the Sierra Nevada of nearly three times its current extent. We offer two conceptual applications of the model for incorporating meadows in watershed restoration planning. The first application focuses on strategically expanding wet meadows already associated with fuel breaks for increasing wildfire resistance. The second shows how meadow restoration in post-wildfire landscapes could increase capture of sediment from burned hillslopes where increased sediment storage would benefit water storage. Meadows are important habitats that have become degraded due to long-term overuse. Re-envisioning their potential extent shows that, with restoration, meadows could also serve as components of California’s multi-tiered efforts to manage pressing threats to its forests and water supply.</jats:p>"

This study examined the major water supply sources available to students in hostel accommodations; assess the factors influencing the water demand, supply, and distribution; determine the quality of water supplied to some selected hostel accommodations in the study area. The study utilizes a mixed approach for data collection. The quantitative approach was conducted using handheld (GPS) to locate the satellite images of the hostels and sources of water within the neighborhood, three samples of water collected were examined critically at Osun State Water Corporation Laboratory. The data collected were queried using ArcMAP/ArcGIS 10.7.1 with the specified NIS(554) Limit 2015. Similarly, the qualitative approach was conducted by distributing 50% of the entire student’s population which represents 110 questionnaires to randomly selected students staying within the study area. Data collected were analysed using percentages and (mean score) ranking. The results show that the major sources of water are wells and boreholes; water supply are insufficient with 55.6% of occupant’s daily supply between 75-125 liters. The critical factors influencing the adequacy and sufficiency of water supplied includes high electricity bills to pump water from wells, insufficient water in wells during dry season causing damage to water pumps, insufficient voltage drop by electricity authority to pump water regularly, insufficient capacity of water pumps to raise water head and poor maintenance of water pumps were ranked high. The study further shows that the physio-chemical analysis of the sources of water is soft and can corrode metal ion, an evidence of both biological and chemical pollution, moderately hard with high settle-able solids, micro-organism and the non-pathogenic which might have influence on the taste and this may serve as indicator that the water is not fit for human consumptions.

Drawing on organizational learning theory, this study investigates how a firm's implementation of ECS enhances carbon performance via low‐carbon supply chain collaboration, and examines the moderating effect of organizational unlearning. To verify these hypotheses, we conduct hierarchical regression analyses using survey data from 297 Chinese manufacturers. Our results indicate that both supplier and customer low‐carbon collaborations mediate the impact of ECS on carbon performance. In addition, organizational unlearning strengthens the impact of ECS on customer low‐carbon collaboration, but weakens the impact of ECS on supplier low‐carbon collaboration. This study extends the digital transition and sustainability literature by unpacking the “black box” of transforming ECS into carbon performance and considering the contingency role of organizational unlearning. Our findings provide managers with new digital technologies to improve low‐carbon supply chain management and guide governments to appropriately extend policies that accelerate the manufacturing industry's transition to sustainability.</jats:p>",

Based on the primary factors affecting the efficiency and performance of global supply chain activities in logistics for Vietnam's exports, including (1). Customs efficiency (speed, simplicity and predictability of customs clearance procedures) (2). Quality of infrastructure related to trade and transport, including Roads, railways, ports, airports, warehouses and information technology ...(3). The level of ease when arranging to transport import and export goods with competitive prices (costs such as warehousing fees, port fees, tolls ... ) (4). Capacity and quality of logistics service providers ... (5). Ability to track and trace shipments. (6). Timeliness of the shipment to the destination within the specified time limit. The practical impact and logistics results of enterprises in Vietnam.\n \nMethod: The panel approach allows the authors to explore the heterogeneity in data across countries. Fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models were used to estimate the model. Then, the Hausman test is carried out to decide which model is appropriate. The data were collected from 240 observations from Vietnam and 80 major export partner countries of Vietnam.\n \nFindings: The research results show that the cost, time and capacity of providing logistics services have the most significant impact on Vietnam's exports.\n \nPractical &amp; social implications: Overall, to increase the efficiency and logistics efficiency of enterprises. The Vietnamese Government needs to cooperate and propose ideas to partner countries to improve logistics activities for exports from Vietnam. Logistics is beginning to play an increasingly important role in the competitiveness of economies.\n \nOriginality values: This study also confirms the sustainability of the extended gravity model using OLS and RE methods by substituting different variables for the country's logistics efficiency and solving the endogenous problem in the model while applying the regression method to industrial variables. We find that an 1% improvement in Vietnam's logistics would increase Vietnam's exports by 1.443%, and an 1% improvement in a partner country’s performance would help promote Vietnam's exports to this country by 0.546%.</jats:p>"

Buffering distance (BFD) maintained between landfill site and groundwater supply wells is important to prevent drinking water from contamination of hazardous pollutant. Ignoring the leakage increase in the end of landfill life leads to an underestimate of BFD demand, posing potential threat to drinking safety. This paper constructs a framework for BFD prediction with the consideration of landfill performance degradation by coupling landfill performance evaluation model with the aging and defect evolution model of landfill engineering materials, and carries out model application and verification in a coastal hazardous waste landfill. The results show that during the life cycle of a landfill, its BFD experienced a 1.5-time increase from the start of its operation to its life end and reached 3000 m. Under the condition of landfill performance degradation, the BFDs required to attenuate heavy metals experience more increase than those of organic pollutants; BFD required for zinc (Zn), for example, increases 720 m over the no-degradation condition, while 2,4-dichlorophenol(2,4-D) increases by only 288 m. Considering the uncertainty sourced from model parameter and structure, the BFD should be more than 4050 m to ensure long-term safe drinking under unfavorable conditions such as large amount of leachate, weak degradation and fast diffusion of pollutant in vadose and aquifer. If the BFD cannot meet the demand at the end of the landfill life, the leaching behavior of solid waste can be controlled to reduce it depending on BFD. For example, when the leaching concentration of Cd in the waste is reduced from 0.6 mg/L to 0.17 mg/L, the buffering distance is be reduced from 3000 m to 500 m.</jats:p>"

In the Zhejiang coastal region of ECS, the large phytoplankton biomass in summer is attributed to the nutrients pumped up by Zhejiang coastal upwelling (ZCU), and oceanic nutrients supplied by the Kuroshio intrusion (KI) onto continental ECS. However, the yearly variations in these two processes are not consistent, which complicates coastal nutrient supplies. In this study, to understand the contributions of ZCU and KI to the nutrient supplies, nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton biomass in ECS as well as their yearly variations, a physical‐biochemical coupled model was applied. According to model results and observations, the years 2013 and 2018 were identified as strong and weak ZCU years during 2010–2018 period, respectively. In 2013, nutrient and chlorophyll‐<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentrations were higher than 2018 in nearshore areas, but nutrient concentrations were lower than 2018 at the bottom of wide offshore areas. Strong wind stress in 2013 induced strong ZCU and shoreward net nutrient flux along the 60‐m isobath, which was seaward in 2018. The fewer nutrient supplies from KI in the spring of 2013 decreased the nutrient concentrations at the bottom of offshore areas, but its influence on nearshore nutrient concentrations was not as obvious as that caused by ZCU. Phytoplankton biomass in the nearshore and offshore areas reflected different mechanisms of nutrient supplies. In conclusion, the intensity of ZCU, rather than KI, is the principal factor influencing the coastal primary productivity of ECS in summer.</jats:p>",

One contributing factor to this inefficiency is the existence of many high speed diesel (HSD)-fueled power plants. These are distributed across the Indonesian archipelago with a supply chain that only uses sea transportation. The absence of an economical small-scale LNG (SS-LNG) supply chain also demonstrates the inadequate infrastructure for distributing LNG to refineries. This study aims to analyze the probability of risks that occur in SS-LNG supply chains in the Indonesian archipelago. The analytical methods used are descriptive statistical analysis and Delphi analysis through in-depth interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with experts. Results showed that the SS-LNG supply chain process in Indonesia includes LNG loading, unloading, shipping, picking, storage, regasification, and distribution. There are 30 risk indicators that may occur, with the highest risks including ship accidents, equipment damage, lack of transport ships, bad weather, earthquakes, tsunami, poor safety cultures, and low levels of safety leadership. These risk indicators can be used in implementing SS-LNG.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, no effective strategies combined with ICB therapy are available to overcome low therapeutic efficiency and severe side effects. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is an effective and safe technique holding the promise to decrease tumor blood perfusion and activate anti-tumor immune response based on the cavitation effect. Herein, we demonstrated a novel combinatorial therapeutic modality combining low-intensity focused ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (LIFU-TMD) with PD-L1 blockade. LIFU-TMD caused the rupture of abnormal blood vessels to deplete tumor blood perfusion and induced the tumor microenvironment (TME) transformation to sensitize anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, which markedly inhibited 4T1 breast cancer’s growth in mice. We discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD) in a portion of cells induced by the cavitation effect from LIFU-TMD, characterized by the increased expression of calreticulin (CRT) on the tumor cell surface. Additionally, flow cytometry revealed substantially higher levels of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cells in draining lymph nodes and tumor tissue, as induced by pro-inflammatory molecules like IL-12 and TNF-α.

Recent research has examined the effect of green logistics management on the sustainability performance of businesses. However, we contend that the relationship between green logistics management and the sustainability performance of firms is not direct but mediated through circular economy practices. We analyze the direct and indirect effects of green logistics management on business sustainability performance via circular economy practices, using the natural resource-based view and resource dependence theory as our theoretical underpinnings. This study also assesses the moderating effect of supply chain traceability on the associations. Drawing upon the empirical data from 211 Bangladeshi manufacturing SMEs, we performed the PLS-SEM technique to assess the hypotheses. The findings show that green logistics management positively affects organizations’ circular economy practices and sustainability performance. Furthermore, supply chain traceability strongly affects SMEs’ circular economy practice but fails to moderate the linkage between green logistics and sustainability performance. Finally, circular economy practice mediates the linkage between SMEs’ green logistics management and sustainability performance. We also conducted the Sobel test to validate the mediation. Our findings advance the natural resource-based view and resource dependence theory while improving the understanding of green logistics management, circular economy practices, and sustainability performance. Given the dearth of literature assessing the complex interactions among these variables, our findings have pivotal implications.</jats:p>"

In addition, we designed two contracts, cost-sharing contract and two-part pricing contract, to coordinate the supplier’s fresh-keeping decision and the supply chain’s revenue. The results show that: whether the carbon cap-and-trade policy is implemented or not, the higher the consumer’s preference for freshness and the lower the price sensitivity coefficient of consumers, the more favorable it is for suppliers to improve their fresh-keeping efforts. Under the implementation of carbon cap-and-trade policy, suppliers’ fresh-keeping efforts are only related to the carbon transaction price, not the carbon cap; the higher the carbon transaction price, the less the supplier’s fresh-keeping efforts, but the more the supplier’s income; the smaller the cost coefficient of carbon emission reduction and the larger the coefficient of carbon emission reduction, the more favorable it is for suppliers to increase their fresh-keeping efforts; both cost-sharing contract and two-part pricing contract can coordinate the supply chain of fresh agricultural products, but they have different application scope and coordination effect.

The demand for fresh agriproducts in the market has been increasing more than ever. However, the circulation losses of fresh agriproducts is significant during logistic processes, such as long-distance transportation. Statistics show that 20–25% of perishable agriproducts deteriorate in the circulation loop in developing countries, whereas in developed countries, this can be controlled at &amp;lt;5%. Developing countries must improve their cold-chain logistics and reduce post-production losses of this kind of agriproduct. The freshness-keeping effort for fresh agriproducts and the coordination mechanism of the supply chain have become two of the hot topics in this field. Based on the existing research, this study describes the freshness-keeping effort as a joint effort function of the supplier and the manufacturer, and studies the optimization and coordination of a three-echelon fresh agriproduct supply chain. In this research, four decision-making scenarios are modeled and analyzed, including decentralized decision-making, centralized decision-making, and two kinds of collaborative decision-making. Then, the profit distributions of two collaborative decision-making scenarios and centralized decision-making scenarios are calculated using the average tree solution. The study suggests that different cooperation styles of enterprises in the agriproduct supply chain have a different impact on the freshness level of the final product received by consumers. Both the final freshness level and the price of the product depend on the joint freshness-keeping efforts of the supplier and the manufacturer. The cooperation of enterprises in the three-echelon fresh agriproduct supply chain is conducive to the improvement of the final freshness level of agriproducts and the maximization of the supply chain's total profit. In such a three-echelon fresh agriproduct supply chain, the use of average tree solution can effectively distribute the profit and promote cooperation among different parties.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aiming at the problem that the upstream manufacturer cannot accurately formulate the production plan after the link of the nonlinear supply chain system changes under emergencies, an optimization model of production change in a nonlinear supply chain system under emergencies is designed. Firstly, based on the structural characteristics of the supply chain system and the logical relationship between production, sales, and storage parameters, a three-level single-chain nonlinear supply chain dynamic system model containing producers, sellers, and retailers was established based on the introduction of nonlinear parameters. Secondly, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network and improved fast variable power convergence law were introduced to improve the traditional sliding mode control, and the improved adaptive sliding mode control is proposed so that it can have a good control effect on the unknown nonlinear supply chain system. Finally, based on the numerical assumptions, the constructed optimization model was parameterized and simulated for comparison experiments. The simulation results show that the optimized model can reduce the adjustment time by 37.50% and inventory fluctuation by 42.97%, respectively, compared with the traditional sliding mode control, while helping the supply chain system to return the smooth operation after the change within 5 days.</jats:p>"

However, several studies have reported the ESs supply and demand risk in complex mountainous areas. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in ESs supply, demand, and their trade-off and synergy, including water yield, soil conservation, and food provision in the Bailongjiang watershed (BLJW) in western China. The results showed that the total supply and demand of water-yield and soil-conservation services rose with a surplus from 2002 to 2018, except for food provision. A high value characterizes the water-yield and soil-conservation supply in the south, but there are low values in the east BLJW. The spatial distribution of water and food supply–demand featured a high demand in the subareas with population aggregation. Soil-conservation demand is high in the northwest and south of Wudu. The dominant spatial matching type of supply and demand in water yield was a high supply with a low demand. Soil conservation was associated with a low supply and low demand, and food provision with a high supply and increased demand. A synergy existed between water yield and soil conservation. Trade-offs existed between water yield, food provision, and soil conservation. The spatial distribution of trade-off intensity showed distinctive patterns. The supply–demand ratio of WY and SC decreased with the increasing trade-off intensity. This study comprehensively considers ES and supply–demand conflicts, thus providing a new perspective and approach for enhancing ecosystem services and high-quality regional development.</jats:p>"

Therefore, efficient SA is necessary to evaluate the impact of changes in meteorological variables that influence ET0 model estimation. This mini review analyses the various SA methods applied in the field of ET0, based on a comprehensive and comparative analysis of existing SA methods from all around the world. The study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each SA method, as well as the factors affecting the SA of ET0.

This significantly increases the loss of raw materials and the likelihood of draining the well. It is possible to determine a leak in such water supply systems by digitizing the operating parameters of a borehole pump and transmitting this information using the OwenCloud cloud service developed by OWEN. The purpose of the research is to determine the leakage of liquid in the water supply system of rural settlements based on indirect observation and comparative analysis of the total pump operation time per day. The studies were carried out on working days from February 3 to February 9 and during November 1, 2022. For digitization, a PM210 network gateway was used, which transmitted the operation parameters of the frequency converter (the existing control station) via the RS-485 interface, and then to the cloud environment using SIM cards. The digitized data from the cloud environment was processed in the application program according to a given algorithm with simple logic and the total operating time of the pump per day was determined. Based on these calculations, the presence of a fluid leak in the water supply system was established. Determination of the total pump operation time per day by digitizing and analyzing current consumption indicators will significantly speed up the response time to an emergency situation in the water supply system.</jats:p>",

Whilst attention has been paid to farm-level impacts from, and adaptation to, weather extremes, there remains a need to better understand how different actors along the supply chain suffer, react and adapt to these natural hazards and how their resilience-building strategies affect other actors’ and the whole system’s resilience. Taking the UK potato supply chain as a case study, this paper analyses the synergies and trade-offs in drought resilience in a multi-level food supply chain. Data from an online survey (87) and interviews with key informants (27) representing potato supply-chain actors (growers, packers, processors, retailers) were used to analyse drought risk perceptions, impacts and coping strategies, long-term resilience measures and further actions to build system resilience. Results suggest that the potato supply chain has increased its resilience to weather extremes due to retailers and packers having a wider geographical spread of supply, an increasing reliance on forward contracts and favouring growers with water security. However, a conceptual framework of resilience-building strategies adopted by supply chain actors shows that these measures are largely designed to reduce their own risk without considering implications for other parts of the chain and the system as a whole. A more integrated approach to promote drought resilience in complex food supply chains that enables improved vertical collaboration and trust between actors is therefore needed.</jats:p>",

The efforts of state power companies to manage their supply chain systems require a sustainable strategy to increase end-customer satisfaction in global competition. One strategy in achieving sustainable competence can be done through measuring and managing supply chain performance using the SCOR Method and Value Stream Mapping (VSM). The implementation of these two methods will be able to integrate every process and decision making in increasing productivity, especially in the company’s supply chain activities. Measurements result of the supply chain performance on XYZ Berau Company from 2019 to 2021 by implementing the SCOR 12.0 and the value stream mapping (VSM) method showed an increase, where the realization of supply chain performance in 2021 was 91.42 with a good category. However, there is still a gap in the KPI value of 8.58, where the highest Gap value is in KPI P-3 material fulfillment duration. For 2021, the Gap Value for KPI P-3 material fulfillment duration is 4.17 or 48.60% of the total existing gap. The application of the VSM method shows that for KPI P-3 material fulfillment duration, the value-added ratio current state is 63.57% with a value-added activity of 44.5 days, compared to the total process cycle time of 70 days. Research recommendations have brought improvement, resulting in the value-added ratio future state increased by 98.89%, with value-added activity for 44.5 days, from the total process cycle time of 45 days. So, the 45 days target for KPI P-3 material fulfillment duration can be achieved.</jats:p>",

Recently, the introduction of an auto‐inducible expression system depending on microbial physiological state has been suggested as an important tool for the industrial‐scale production of polyketides. In this study, titer improvement by enhancing the pool of CoA‐derived precursors required for polyketide production was driven in a quorum sensing (QS)‐dependent manner. A self‐sustaining and inducer‐independent regulatory system, named the QS‐based metabolic engineering of precursor pool (QMP) system, was constructed, wherein the expression of genes involved in precursor biosynthesis was regulated by the QS‐responsive promoter, <jats:italic>scbA</jats:italic>p. The QMP system was applied for neoaureothin production in a heterologous host, <jats:italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</jats:italic> M1152, and productivity increased by up to 4‐fold. In particular, the engineered hyperproducers produced high levels of neoaureothin without adversely affecting cell growth.

Simulation results show that with the back pressure controlled at 3.4 MPa and the inlet steam flow decreasing to a certain extent, the flow state of the last three stage blades begins to deteriorate. When the back pressure continues to drop, the flow state becomes unstable at the blade root and the blade tip on the suction surface of the rotor blade, while the flow state is stable on the pressure surface of the rotor blade and the surface of the stationary blade. If the flow rate decreases, the flow separation area on the suction surface of the moving blade decreases, and the flow performance can be improved. With the decrease in the boiler load, the total-total isentropic efficiency for the last three stage blades of the HP cylinder gradually decreases. In addition, the isentropic efficiency at the blade root and blade tip is lower than that for the blade body, which is closely related to the flow separation phenomenon of the last three stages of moving blades at the root and tip. In the working condition of the intermedium-pressure adjustment valve, since the temperature variation is within a limited range, operational safety can be guaranteed under the design blade frequency and strength. This paper provides the upper and lower limits of the exhaust gas pressure for the HP cylinder under the intermedium-pressure adjustment valve participation mode concerning various working conditions as well as corresponding constraints. This is conducive to guiding the design and safe operation of the intermedium-pressure adjustment valve. Through adjusting the intermedium-pressure adjustment valve, a specific supply capacity of the unit can also be satisfied at the lower load, which is beneficial to the deep peak regulation of the unit.</jats:p>"

These regulations seek, via the reduction of inefficiencies, to counteract water access crises. This research calculates the level of input-oriented technical efficiency of Ecuador’s potable water service providers in the period 2014–2017. It analyzes its determinants, focusing on the effect of the geographic region (Highlands, Coast, and Amazon), as well as the type of management, specifically municipal departments and autonomous public enterprises. For this purpose, the semi-parametric method of data envelopment analysis (DEA) with double bootstrap is used. The results suggest that drinking water suppliers could save the inputs used while maintaining their level of production. In addition, it was found that the level of technical efficiency differs by geographic region but not by the type of management used. The natural Highlands region is more efficient compared to the Coast and Amazon region, suggesting climatic and natural resource distribution heterogeneities that induce this difference. The result by type of management shows that the advantages indicated by some literature regarding the technical, financial, and administrative autonomy of public companies may not improve efficiency compared to municipal departments.</jats:p>"

A broken connection might produce a food catastrophe. The structural imbalance of India's FGSC is an obstacle to achieving sustainability; this has to be addressed if the country is to preserve national food security. This present study aims to develop a systematic assessment of the risks and the priority of risk‐mitigating solutions in attaining sustainability in the Indian FGSC. Multiple groups of individuals and businesses involved in the FGSC have been surveyed and interviewed, with their responses analyzed. A total of 31 risk factors and 11 risk‐reduction strategies are identified. Further, the identified risk factors are classified into five‐dimensional sustainability criteria (environmental, economic, institutional, technical, and social) by using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Then, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), combined with the fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) method, is adopted to find the most critical risk factors and choose the best course of strategies for risk mitigation. The study finds that inability to incorporate advanced technology imposes the highest risk to sustainability followed by natural disasters. Ensuring end‐to‐end computerization using advanced technology like agri 4.0 is the need of the hour in intercepting the range of FGSC risks. The results may help policymakers create a comprehensive risk mitigation plan and taxonomy to increase supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

The nutrient composition of these products is characterized by a high content of sugar and saturated fatty acids. The content of protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals is low. This predetermines the feasibility of using the latest raw materials. This paper has proven the possibility of using flour from extruded sunflower seed kernels (FESSK). FESSK is a unique protein-mineral raw material ingredient that contains essential amino and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as biologically active substances.\nIn FESSK, compared to high grade wheat flour (HGWF), the content of protein increases by 3.1–3.3 times; minerals – 13.80–13.82 times; fiber – 98.91–98.93 times; fat – 2.54–2.56 times; the total amount of essential amino acids – by 3.15–3.19 times. One should note the balance of amino acid composition and the usefulness of FESSK proteins (amino acid number (AAN) of essential amino acids approaches 100 %). Compared to HGWF, FESSK has increased biological value index and utilization rate of amino acid composition, by 48.74 % and 39.29 %, respectively. Of the 13 vitamins necessary for the human body, 12 vitamins (92.3 % of the total amount of vitamins) were identified as part of the FESSK composition. In FESSK, compared to HGWF, fat-absorbing capacity increases by 1.50–1.52 times and water retention capacity by 3.62–3.64 times.\nIt was found that the addition of 10.0 % FESSK increases wettability by 6.58–11.19 %; expansion rate by (1,0±0,1) %; ash content – 5.71–13.33 times; fat content by 2,19–6,17 %; protein content by 8.29–21.37 %. The integrated quality indicator increases by 5.1–6.8 %. Alkalinity decreases by 1.04–2.06 %.

These are the challenges that participants in the logistics sector are facing, together with rising commodity demand for fundamental requirements. As a result, many scientists are driven to design logistics solutions to mitigate the impact of a growing population, which increases demand for logistics and supply chains, which also has an influence on the community's environment. However, thorough literature survey studies targeted at finding potential treatments for the management of supply chain disorders using bibliometric, network, and theme analyses are still few and limited. According to the findings of the investigation, the primary supply chain themes are provider logistics and reverse logistics. This research has various implications for reverse logistics in the FMCG industry. According to the research, suppliers must understand that implementing environmental activities with their clients may improve their ability to compete in the market, and the \"last mile\" of distribution may thus be completed by electric cars because the distances are so short that they do not present any difficulties or require elaborate human planning. Therefore, we find that employing logistics providers to manage the FMCG industry or looking at the strategies of logistics providers for renewable energy might be an intriguing future study area.</jats:p>"

The results show that (1) the green efficiency of water resources in the Huaihe River Basin decreased first and then increased from 2011 to 2020. (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the provincial-level divisions of green efficiency of water resources in the Huaihe River Basin from high to low are Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui. The elliptical area of green efficiency of water resources keeps expanding, and the efficiency value radiates outward along ‘Yangzhou–Zhengzhou’. (3) At the level of total-factor productivity decomposition, TC (technological change) has a more noticeable impact on factors than EC (efficiency change). TC scale technology changes mainly come from the improvement of MATC (magnitude technical change). (4) Industrial output value has a positive driving effect on the green efficiency of water resources.

A model for the dehydration of a single drop is formulated based on the equations of heat conduction with a source term and diffusion of moisture, taking into account the change in its size due to evaporation. This takes </jats:p><jats:p>into account the influence of the convective vapor flow from the evaporating droplet surface (Stefan flow), as well as the blowing of evaporating vapor into the hot gas flow on the heat transfer coefficient (Spalding correction). The impact of infrared radiation is described by the Bouguer equation. The equation of motion of a drop in a gas flow takes into account the forces due to gravity, the difference in velocities and phase densities. As a result of numerical simulation, it was found that with countercurrent phase movement, the intensity of dehydration is higher than with cocurrent flow. This is due to both an increase in the relative velocity of the phases and an increase in the residence time of the drop in the intense region of infrared radiation. It is shown that further intensification of evaporation is possible due to the creation of pulsed counter gas flows. The calculated results are compared with the experimental data, which confirms the adequacy of the model. The results of the study can be useful in the development of new heat technologies and devices for dehydration of concentrated solutions and suspensions. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the birth of Fordism and the expansion of the markets beyond the states’ borders, national supply chains have evolved into international and global supply chains. Some countries fared much better than others in becoming an irreplaceable part of the said chain. For instance, one could mention Iran due to its rich oil reserves and geopolitical position on the globe, China with its cheap human capital and high-profit margins, and the US with its massive reach all around the world. This study examines the US’s mediatory effect on Iran-China’s relations. Consequently, a derivative of the gravity model has been devised to test the said hypothesis. The dependent variables to test this hypothesis are China’s imports from Iran and China’s exports to Iran. The model controls the two states’ currency value, their inflation rate, and the price of crude oil. Furthermore, the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015 and the US’s Maximum Pressure Policy in 2017 are the main variables of interest in the model in form of two dummy variables. The study employs a novel multidisciplinary approach both on the methodology front by introducing an abstract conception of distance and on the epistemology front by combining international economics literature with that of the international relations. According to the results, the US’s foreign policy has a significant buffering effect on the trade between Iran and China. In other words, the United States acts as a distancing factor between the two states of Iran and China. This distancing effect, however, is stronger for China’s imports from Iran in comparison to China’s exports to Iran.</jats:p>",

A model based on the dynamic quality of post‐harvest ripening agricultural produce (PRAP) was proposed to optimize decisions to improve supply chain profits. To verify its effectiveness and robustness, the model is applied to a real banana supply chain. The theoretical derivations and simulation results show that, first, the optimal retail price and presentation timing based on the model can maximize the supply chain profit. Second, the proper choice of the combination of picking maturity and preservation temperature based on the time from picking to the retailer can effectively improve the on‐shelf quality and supply chain profit. Third, supply chain management strategies for PRAP and fully ripened agricultural produce should be developed based on the different quality change characteristics of these two produce types.</jats:p>",

The proposed ECB control strategy is based on the growth and decay of charge in the series RC circuit and the harmonic elimination by detecting the Fourier expansion series of the auxiliary equipment power supply system’s (AEPSS) three-phase output voltage level. It can quickly adjust each duty cycle to the best value for driving the isolated three-phase inverter (ITPI) and produce a three-phase 380 VAC/60 Hz output. A comparison of the AEPSS output performance using the traditional voltage cancellation method (VCM) and the proposed ECB control strategy was performed. The hardware implementation of the system was performed on the prototype developed in the laboratory. These control strategies are tested under three conditions, i.e., (i) Vi = 550 VDC. (ii) Vi = 750 VDC. (iii) Vi = 800 VDC. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is 13.7%, 14.5%, and 14.9%, and the output voltage Vo is 372.3 VAC, 377.3 VAC, and 385.3 VAC using the traditional control strategy at three test conditions, respectively. However, the THD is 7.2%, 7.8%, and 8.0%, and the output voltage Vo is 382.2 VAC, 381.2 VAC, and 381.9 VAC using the proposed ECB control strategy under the test conditions. It is obvious from the hardware results that the output voltage harmonics and output voltage level for the proposed ECB control strategy are superior to the traditional VCM. The voltage produced from the AEPSS using the proposed ECB control strategy is more stable and has better quality. In addition, the filter size is also reduced.</jats:p>"

We consider a contract coordination mode including three incentive contracts, cost-sharing (cs), revenue-sharing (re) and revenue-and-cost-sharing (rc), to facilitate supply chain coordination. The results show that, as opposed to the case where the supplier takes on the freshness-keeping effort, the optimal freshness-keeping effort level, wholesale price and retail price are not only affected by the retailer’s information sharing strategy but also the freshness-keeping efficiency as the retailer exerts the freshness-keeping effort. Regarding the information sharing strategy, when the freshness-keeping effort is undertaken by the retailer, sharing information sometimes benefits the supplier; however, information sharing is never preferable for the retailer. Consequently, it is necessary to explore the supply chain coordination mode via effective incentive contracts which can improve the supplier and retailer’s profit. We also numerically analyze the effects of freshness-keeping efficiency on equilibrium decisions and expected profits in the decentralized mode, and the effects of the three contract parameters on the expected profits in equilibrium in the coordination mode.</jats:p>"

We take Yuzhong County in the loess hilly region of Longzhong, China as an example; by constructing the matching and coordinating relationship between ecosystem service supply and demand and following the idea of “problem diagnosis—strategic orientation—key optimization”, this paper delimits the ecological restoration zones and proposes corresponding governance strategies. The results show that: (1) The supply and demand of ecosystem services were mainly at a low and medium level, with significant spatial heterogeneity. Overall, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services showed high supply and low demand in the southwest mountainous areas and showed low supply and high demand in the urban gully areas of Yuzhong. (2) There were four types of spatial matching of ecosystem service supply and demand: HH type, LH type, LL type, and HL type. The local spatial autocorrelation of supply and demand was dominated by high-low or low-high spatial misadjustment. The average degree of coordination between supply and demand of ecosystem services was 0.629, indicating that supply and demand were basically coordinated. (3) The ecological restoration zones in Yuzhong County can be divided into six categories: the ecological core protection area, ecological potential restoration area, key ecological restoration area, soil and water conservation restoration area, ecological agriculture development area, and ecological innovation promotion area. The results of this study can provide ideas for the refined management and targeted restoration practice of regional ecosystem services.

An optimization model for the in-series reservoir (ISR) with replenishment pumping stations was developed to obtain the minimum annual sum of water shortage and systematically considered the reservoir operation rule of water spill and replenishment. This model features multiple dimensions; dynamic programming (DP) may cause a ‘curse of dimensions’, while the decomposition-coordination method has difficulty in judging logic conditions in the reservoir operation rules. So, an improved decomposition and DP aggregation (DDPA) method was proposed. The proposed model and the method were applied to a real case in the humid region of southern China. Compared to a conventional scheduling method, the water supply was increased by 0.8% and replenishment was reduced by 2.5%. Moreover, a comparison between DDPA and six heuristic algorithms was discussed. All heuristic algorithms' objective function values only obtained local optimal solutions, and the water shortage of the system was 0.12–20.5%. The obtained results demonstrated that DDPA was the better choice for highly complex multi-reservoir systems. The proposed optimization algorithm enriched the optimization theory of multi-dimensional and multi-variable complex systems.</jats:p>",

Nitrogen limitation stimulated PHB accumulation in the methanotroph but hindered the growth of the syntrophic consortium.

On the basis of measuring the supply and demand of ecosystem services in 125 resource-based cities in China from 2000 to 2020, we analyzed the matching pattern and coupling coordination degree between supply and demand. The Spearman correlation analysis and quantile regression models were used to explore the impacts of the natural and socioeconomic factors on the coupling coordination degree between supply and demand. The results indicate that the supply and demand of ecosystem services in resource-based cities exhibits obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Cities with a higher ecosystem service demand are mainly located in Eastern China. Cities with a higher ecosystem service supply are mainly concentrated in Western China. The ecosystem service supply decreased, while the demand increased over time. In addition, the coupling coordination degree between supply and demand is low and increased slowly over time. Population density, economic density, construction land, arable land and grassland have significant effects on the supply–demand relationship in resource-based cities. The elasticity coefficients obtained from the quantile regression model imply that the effects are significantly heterogeneous in terms of time and the level of coupling coordination degree.</jats:p>"

Building on insights derived from the Rockefeller Foundation’s YieldWise Initiative, this article proposes that while reducing post-harvest loss generally does require technology adoption by small-holder farmers, market-driven supply chains are essential to the sustained use of those technologies. We illustrate this approach using in-depth interview data collected from the YieldWise participants belonging to the Iringa Hope Cooperative in Tanzania. Data on the benefits and challenges of such an approach are provided from the perspective of the small-holder farmer. In addition, we model the economic benefits associated with this approach.</jats:p>"

This means that the heat dissipation efficiency and battery service life are reduced, thus reducing the reliability of the battery. Contraposing the problem of the heat dissipation of energy storage batteries, the full deployment of the ARIZ algorithm has been provided for applications of problem-solving processes in this investigation. The advantage of using the ARIZ algorithm is that while the engineering system is kept unchanged or less changed, the effective heat dissipation of the energy storage battery with increasing energy density can be satisfied. During the process of the ARIZ algorithm, a mini problem is first defined. Moreover, the ideal final result and physical contradiction are defined. Following this, expanded material field resources are used, and finally, 22 innovative designs are obtained using the problem-solving tool in TRIZ theory. The final design scheme is provided by combining multiple schemes, and the heat compensator dispersion of a partially improved system in the optimized scheme has been simulated. The results show that the heat compensator dispersion of the air conditioning cooling system for battery modules has reached the design goals in this investigation, in which the maximum temperature of the module’s surface has been reduced to below 35.68 °C, and the maximum temperature difference of the module has reduced to below 5.6 °C.</jats:p>"

The study shows that: (1) The spatial heterogeneity between the supply and demand of parkland in 85 community units in Daxing New Town is obvious, the overall performance conforms with “demand exceeds supply”, and the supply and demand are generally positively correlated. (2) The correlation degree of the matched supply and demand is analyzed, and it is found that 55 community units show a mismatch between supply and demand and 53 community units have a low level of coordinated development. (3) The superposition analysis shows that the comprehensive level of supply and demand decreases from north to south and from the center to the surrounding area. (4) According to the Daxing New City Park Green Space Coupling Coordination Relationship and Policy Document, we divided the community units in Daxing New Town into six types, and provided differentiated development suggestions. The results of the study can help to guide the sustainable construction of Daxing New City and provide a basis for the future construction of satellite cities in other megacities.</jats:p>"

With the emergence of blockchain, enterprises see an opportunity to mitigate supply chain risks. The purpose of our research is to explore supply chain managers’ intention to adopt blockchain technology from the perspective of supply chain risk management. Using a survey sample of 203 managers in China and the USA, we explored the impact of four perceived benefits of blockchain technology on supply chain risk resistance by extending the technology acceptance model. The results show that the traceability, transparency, information sharing, and decentralization of blockchain can enhance the perceived usefulness of blockchain in supply chain resilience and responsiveness, and the ability to withstand disruption risks and supply and demand coordination risks encountered in the supply chain, thus promoting the adoption of the technology. In addition, the relationships between supply chain resilience and blockchain technology adoption and between supply chain responsiveness and blockchain technology adoption are more salient for managers with high levels of uncertainty avoidance.</jats:p>"

Two magnetic mirror sub-coils placed symmetrically in the vertical direction and connected in series cooperate with a dipole coil to generate a magnetic field environment similar to the Earth’s magnetotail. A capacitor-based pulsed power supply (PPS) system with a modular design is developed to excite two magnetic mirror sub-coils to generate a magnetic field with a magnetic flux density of not less than 200 G at the center of the two sub-coils. The PPS should deliver a pulsed current with a peak of more than 8 kA, and the duration of the current not be less than 95% of the peak over 5 ms to two magnetic mirror sub-coils when the charging voltage is not less than 20 kV. In addition, the duration from the peak to 10% of the peak is not more than 130 ms. The detailed design of the PPS is discussed in this paper, and a test method is designed to reduce the risk of damage to the wires and the connection between the wires and the coaxial cables of the PPS when the PPS discharges at a higher charging voltage.

Existing research focuses largely on the role, priorities, and incentives of local managers to pursue adaptation strategies while mostly neglecting the role of the broader public, despite the strong public support required to fund and implement many climate adaptation plans. In this paper, we interrogate the relationship between personal experiences of household water supply impacts from extreme weather events and hazard exposure with individual concern about future supply reliability among a statewide representative sample of California households. We find that more than one-third of Californians report experiencing impacts of climate change on their household water supplies and show that these reported impacts differently influence residents’ concern about future water supply reliability, depending on the type of event experienced. In contrast, residents’ concern about future water supplies is not significantly associated with hazard exposure. These findings emphasize the importance of local managers’ attending to not only how climate change is projected to affect their water resources, but how, and whether, residents perceive these risks. The critical role of personal experience in increasing concern highlights that post-extreme events with water supply impacts may offer a critical window to advance solutions. Managers should not assume, however, that all extreme events will promote concern in the same way or to the same degree.</jats:p>",

Nine months after the launch of the national vaccination program in March 2021, only 3.4% of the Ethiopian population received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. We used a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to estimate the level of immunity accrued before the launch of vaccination in the Southwest Shewa Zone (SWSZ) and to evaluate the impact of alternative age priority vaccination targets in a context of limited vaccine supply. The model was informed with available epidemiological evidence and detailed contact data collected across different geographical settings (urban, rural, or remote). We found that, during the first year of the pandemic, the mean proportion of critical cases occurred in SWSZ attributable to infectors under 30 years of age would range between 24.9 and 48.0%, depending on the geographical setting. During the Delta wave, the contribution of this age group in causing critical cases was estimated to increase on average to 66.7–70.6%. Our findings suggest that, when considering the vaccine product available at the time (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; 65% efficacy against infection after 2 doses), prioritizing the elderly for vaccination remained the best strategy to minimize the disease burden caused by Delta, irrespectively of the number of available doses. Vaccination of all individuals aged ≥ 50 years would have averted 40 (95%PI: 18–60), 90 (95%PI: 61–111), and 62 (95%PI: 21–108) critical cases per 100,000 residents in urban, rural, and remote areas, respectively. Vaccination of all individuals aged ≥ 30 years would have averted an average of 86–152 critical cases per 100,000 individuals, depending on the setting considered. Despite infections among children and young adults likely caused 70% of critical cases during the Delta wave in SWSZ, most vulnerable ages should remain a key priority target for vaccination against COVID-19.</jats:p>"

While cellulosic biofuels have the potential fuel performance equivalent to petroleum-based jet fuel, the biofuel industry needs to overcome the supply chain barrier caused by temporal and spatial variability of biomass yield and quality. This study highlights the importance of incorporating spatial and temporal variability during biomass supply chain planning via optimization modeling that incorporates 10 years of drought index data, a primary factor contributing to yield and quality variability. The results imply that the cost of delivering biomass to biorefinery may be significantly underestimated if the multi-year temporal and spatial variation in biomass yield and quality is not captured. For long term sustainable biorefinery operations, the industry should optimize supply chain strategy by studying the variability of yield and quality of biomass in their supply sheds.</jats:p>"

We analyzed the characteristics and changes of the hydrologic regimes of the Yangtze River using the Mann–Kendall method, wavelet analysis, and the IHA-RVA method, and explored the response mechanisms of fish to changes in the hydrological regimes. The results show that (1) the average annual discharge of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is decreasing, and the abrupt changes in Pingshan, Cuntan, and Yichang stations occurred in 1985, 1998, and 2002, respectively, with the main period of 24–32 years. (2) The overall degree of hydrological changes at Pingshan, Cuntan, and Yichang stations is 45%, 50%, and 61%, respectively, all of which are moderate changes. (3) Dams in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have caused changes in the flow regime of the Yangtze River. Among them, the changes in the alternating frequency of flow and the annual extreme flow have affected the habitat of aquatic organisms and seriously affected the reproduction of important fishes in the Yangtze River.</jats:p>",

Water issues have been scientifically investigated from several perspectives, namely institutional, economic, social, environmental, managerial, and technological. However, the technological aspects of irrigation and water supply for smallholder farmers in the Mediterranean region have not been adequately addressed. This paper explores irrigation and water supply technologies for smallholder farmers in the selected Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Malta, Morocco, and Portugal). The methods of analysis are literature review, fieldwork, and observation. The literature survey reveals that Mediterranean countries share many common features in terms of climate, water and land resources, and development issues. Nevertheless, the selected countries in the Mediterranean region (Egypt, Malta, Morocco, and Portugal) differ in terms of type of crops, water management regulations, labor force availability, financial sustainability, and economic approaches. These remarks signal the need for applying a specific approach in selecting a technology for irrigation and water supply according to the regional context. Additionally, the financial and economic perspectives of the three key technologies (i.e., SLECI, desalination technology, and engineering constructed wetlands) require further analysis.</jats:p>"

Most existing studies on supply chain resilience have primarily focused on assessing the system’s ability to withstand and recover from disruptions caused by a single type of hazard. However, a supply chain system is exposed to multiple exogenous and endogenous events and conditions over a planning horizon, and a comprehensive assessment of resilience should take into account multiple risk factors. Moreover, contrary to the conventional resilience assessment methods focusing on the short duration during which the system is impacted by a disaster event, the proposed framework measures the resilience capacities of the system over a long-term horizon through multi-risk assessment and multi-component resilience assessment. Specifically, a new multi-component resilience index is proposed to measure (a) hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality, (b) opportunity-induced cumulative gain of functionality, and (c) non-hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality. The case study results indicate that all three types of risk factors contribute to the overall resilience index significantly and ignoring any one of them may result in inaccurate supply chain performance and resilience assessment.</jats:p>"

Likewise, besides managing inventory and pricing strategies adeptly in multi-retailer supply chains, it has become inevitable for firms to embrace green and sustainable business practices. In this context, this paper considers a two-level supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and multiple retailers in which the manufacturer produces a single product and delivers it to the retailers in equal-sized batches. Each retailer faces a price and green-sensitive market demand. The lead time is assumed to be a random variable that follows a normal distribution. Shortages for retailer inventory are allowed to occur and are completely backlogged. The centralized model and a decentralized model based on the leader-follower Stackelberg gaming approach are developed. A price discount mechanism between the manufacturer and retailers is proposed. For the acceptance of this contract, the upper and lower limits of the price discount rate are established. Numerical outcomes exhibit that the price discount mechanism effectively coordinates the supply chain and enhances both environmental and economical performances. A sensitivity analysis with respect to some key parameters is performed, and certain managerial insights are emphasized.</jats:p>",

Companies urgently need to figure out how to achieve carbon neutrality with government rewards and punishments. Moreover, as an important factor affecting the effectiveness of supply chain, it is particularly important to study how to coordinate fairness concerns of such objects. Therefore, a centralized and two-stage Stackelberg game model of a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) of one manufacturer and one retailer is constructed, and the cost-sharing contract, revenue-sharing contract, and cost–revenue-sharing contract are used to coordinate it, taking into account the fairness concerns of downstream enterprises while pursuing carbon neutrality, ensuring the overall benefits of the supply chain, and considering the impact of government subsidies and rewards and punishments on the carbon neutrality of the supply chain. Research shows that (1) compared with the other two contracts, the cost–revenue-sharing contract performs better and can effectively achieve the Pareto optimum; (2) the cost-sharing contract performs better in accomplishing the carbon neutrality of the CLSC; (3) excessively high carbon sink prices are not only detrimental to enterprise efficiency, but also to the realization of carbon neutrality goal; and (4) higher supply chain utility is pursued by enterprises when the unit reward and punishment are not great enough; otherwise, carbon neutrality is pursued. The research results can not only provide decision support for the product pricing, carbon sink reserve and contract design of CLSC enterprises under the goal of carbon neutrality, but can also provide a reference for the setting of government subsidies and rewards and punishment.</jats:p>"

Here, we investigated the role of NO3− in soybean plants exposed to these stresses in combination. Nodulated soybean cultivated under greenhouse conditions and daily fertilised with a nutrient solution without nitrogen were subjected to the following treatments: Water, NO3−, NaCl, and NaCl + NO3−. Then, plants were exposed to waterlogging (6 days) and drainage (2 days). Compared to plants exposed to isolated stress, the saline waterlogging resulted in higher concentrations of H2O2, O2˙−, and lipid peroxidation at the whole-plant level, mainly during drainage. Furthermore, saline waterlogging increased fermentation and the concentrations of Na+ and K+ in roots and leaves both during waterlogging and drainage. NO3− supplementation led to augments in NO3− and NO levels, and stimulated nitrate reductase activity in both organs. In addition, NO3− nutrition alleviated oxidative stress and fermentation besides increasing the K+/Na+ ratio in plants exposed to saline waterlogging. In conclusion, NO3− supplementation is a useful strategy to help soybean plants overcome saline waterlogging stress. These findings are of high relevance for agriculture as soybean is an important commodity and has been cultivated in areas prone to saline waterlogging.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, is abundant in organisms. It is known to produce various biological effects. However, its impact in thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is poorly studied. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the dynamics of thyroid hormones and pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion during bilateral shifts in deuterium supply and assess a possible role of the Na+/I− symporter (NIS), the main iodide transporter, in altered thyroid function. The experiment was performed on adult male Wistar rats, which consumed deuterium-depleted ([D] = 10 ppm) and deuterium-enriched ([D] = 500,000 ppm) water for 21 days. The assessment of total thyroxine and triiodothyronine and their free fractions, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone in blood serum, revealed the rapid response of the thyroid gland to shifts in the deuterium/protium balance. The present investigation shows that the bilateral changes in the deuterium body content similarly modulate thyroid hormone production and functional activity of the pituitary gland, but the responses of the thyroid and pituitary glands differ. The response of the thyroid cells was to increase the synthesis of the hormones and the pituitary thyrotropes, in order to reduce the production of the thyroid-stimulating hormone. The evaluation of NIS serum levels found a gradual increase in the rats that consumed deuterium-enriched water and no differences in the group exposed to deuterium depletion. NIS levels in both groups did not correlate with thyroid hormones and pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone production. The data obtained show that thyroid gland has a higher sensitivity to shifts in the deuterium body content than the hypothalamic–pituitary complex, which responded later but similarly in the case of deuteration or deuterium depletion. It indicates a different sensitivity of the endocrine glands to alterations in deuterium content. It suggests that thyroid hormone production rate may depend on deuterium blood/tissue and cytosol/organelle gradients, which possibly disturb the secretory process independently of the NIS.</jats:p>"

Herein, two chickpea genotypes (<jats:italic>Cicer arietinum</jats:italic>) were analysed for their resilience to low water supply: a commercial white chickpea (kabuli) and a traditional black chickpea (desi) with marginal production in occidental countries. Plants were grown under four levels of water supplies (90%, 75%, 50% and 25% of field capacity) and biometric variables (root, shoot, pods and seeds), proxies of plant fitness (water content and oxidative stress) and the seed nutritional profile (protein and mineral concentrations) were analysed at plant maturity. The results show that the water content in shoots and roots decreased with the decrease in water supplies, with kabuli plants generally having higher water content in shoots and desi in roots. The shoot length was significantly higher in kabuli compared to desi, while the root length increased up to 11% in both species with the decrease in water supplies. The root‐to‐shoot ratio was higher in kabuli and increased with the decrease in the water supply, being negatively correlated with the number of pods and seeds per plant. Lipid peroxidation also increased with the decrease in the water supply, having slight positive correlations with plant growth parameters while being negatively correlated with plant productivity. No significant effects of plant genotype and water supply were observed on seed K, Ca and protein, but desi was able to sustain higher P, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn and B concentrations than kabuli, including at lower water supplies. The results suggest that water stress negatively impacts plant growth and productivity and that the two chickpea genotypes have distinct biomass and water allocation strategies to cope with low water supply. These findings may be useful in strategies for improving the productivity and nutritional profile of chickpea crops under water‐limited conditions.</jats:p>",

In addition, there was no significant impact of MO versus SO lipid emulsion on liver enzymes or most parameters. The lack of significance may be attributed to low sample size from low recruitment and high drop-out rate, short study duration (6 months/arm), and complex care.

In this paper, several scenarios comprising offshore oil &amp; gas production facilities were analyzed in terms of fluid production curves and primary processing plants schemes, so that power and heat demand are estimated. Assuming that heat remains supplied through simple-cycle gas turbines with waste heat recovery units like existing facilities, power importing margins were determined for optimum heat recovery in a number of offshore assets. Three low-carbon external power supply options were investigated: (i) Power from shore; (ii) Offshore power generation with post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCUS) and (iii) Floating offshore wind. Results are analyzed in terms of technical feasibility, economic indicators and emissions reduction potential. The present study consists in evaluating and comparing the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) and emissions reduction of offshore oil and gas projects with power import alternatives. Practical limitations for implementation in brownfields for each scenario are discussed when presenting the challenges that must be faced. Scenarios comprising a wide range of external power supply capacity, and consequently many power import systems, were analyzed and compared. With production units far from the coast, importing power from the national grid may require a lower LCOE than implementing a power hub with CCUS, according to the results of this study, but the required investments (CAPEX and OPEX) are substantial, especially in brownfield projects where the upgrade to external power supply would be redundant with the already existing power generation system of the offshore facility. Additionally, floating offshore wind alternative, in turn, has restrictions because of the intermittent generation and relatively low capacity factor. Nevertheless, the results present some insights regarding the intercomparison among all alternatives to large scale offshore hubs connected to multiple offshore assets. Despite external power supply alternatives requiring substantially higher costs, it is expected for these costs to reduce in the near future with standardization of the required technologies. This trend can unlock opportunities to provide energy to additional subsea Processing &amp; boosting, which may be the key to accelerate the adoption of external and low carbon power supply of O&amp;G assets.</jats:p>",

The demand for mental health care was analyzed through the assessment of the burden of mental health problems and care-seeking behaviors. The burden of mental disorders was assessed by calculating a morbidity indicator (proportion of mental health cases) and through a qualitative analysis of the psychosocial consequences as perceived by the participants. Care-seeking behavior was analyzed by calculating health service utilization indicators and more specifically the relative frequency of mental health complaints in primary health care centers, and by analyzing FGDs participants’ reports. The mental health care supply available was described by using the qualitative analysis of the declarations of the participants (providers and users of care) to the FGDs and by analyzing the package of care available in the primary health care centers.

In this study, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm based on a multi-strategy mixed search is supplemented with variable time period characteristics to construct an optimal reservoir operation model with a maximum generating capacity under multiple constraints in a variable time period. The multi-year non-flood season flood operation of the Wanan Reservoir is considered as an example. After optimization, the average annual power generation in the non-flood season was increased by 14.23 million kW·h. The average utilization rate of water resources was increased by 3% over the studied period, and the utilization of flood resources was improved. The ABC optimization algorithm based on a multi-strategy hybrid search could alleviate the contradiction between the selection of the time interval step and the calculation accuracy and convergence speed, and it effectively improved the optimization efficiency and development ability of the standard ABC optimization algorithm. These results can provide suggestions for the improvement of the comprehensive benefits of reservoirs with non-flood floods as an important water resource.</jats:p>",

To evaluate the potential effectiveness of spring-planted cover crop oats (Avena sativa L.) on weed suppression, productivity, and feed quality of annual forage crops as sole crops and intercrops in order to determine the best agroecological technique, two-year experiments were laid out under arid conditions in the Akmolinsk region in northern Kazakhstan. Three annual forage crops, namely, (Piper) Stapf.-Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense) (control), common millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), and Japanese millet (Echinochloa frumentacea L.), and three annual intercropping systems, i.e., 50% pea (Pisum sativum L.) + 50% barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); 40% pea (Pisum sativum L.) + 30% (Piper) Stapf.-Sudan grass (Sorghum Sudanense) + 30% barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); and 50% pea (Pisum sativum L.) + 50% (Piper) Stapf.-sudan grass (Sorghum Sudanense), as well as the six mentioned treatments with the sole crops and intercrops plus cover crop oats (Avena sativa L.) were used. Japanese millet is a promising newly introduced crop in northern Kazakhstan. It was revealed that the cover crop significantly reduced weed density in the forage sole crops and their intercrops. In all cases, integrating the cover crop with annual forage crops showed higher quality and productivity than non-covered treatments. A highly productive annual crop grown with and without cover intercrop was Sudan grass. The highest yield among the three intercropping systems was recorded with the intercrop constituting 40% pea + 30% Sudan grass + 30% barley. The crude protein content was higher in biomass from sole crops and intercrops constituting cover crops. The overall view was that the use of oats as a cover crop on sole annual forage crops and their intercrops including methods that could be integrated with chemical and non-chemical methods in the field could be a valuable way to reduce weed pressure and improve quality and productivity during the vegetation period.</jats:p>"

The dominant factors and strategies that affect the adaptation of alpine herbs to dry and nutrient-deficient environments remain unclear. Three water gradients were established using two-factor controlled experiments: low water (WL), medium water (WM), and high water (WH). The field water-holding capacities were 35%, 55%, and 75%, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer (N) was applied at four levels: control (CK), low (FL), medium (FM), and high (FH) at 0, 110, 330, and 540 mg/kg, respectively. The results revealed that N was the main limiting factor, rather than phosphorous (P), in Festuca coelestis under drought stress. Under water shortage conditions, F. coelestis accumulated more proline and non-structural carbohydrates, especially in the aboveground parts of the leaves and stems; however, the root diameter and aboveground nitrogen use efficiency were reduced. Appropriate N addition could mitigate the adverse effects by increasing the release of N, P, and enzyme activity in the bulk soil and rhizosphere to balance their ratio, and was mainly transferred to the aboveground parts, which optimized the supply uptake relationship. The effects of water and fertilizer on the physiological adaptability and nutrient utilization of F. coelestis were verified using structural equation modeling. Based on their different sensitivities to water and nitrogen, the WHFM treatment was more suitable for F. coelestis establishment. Our results demonstrated that the disproportionate nutrient supply ability and preferential supply aboveground compared to below ground were the main factors influencing F. coelestis seedling establishment under drought conditions. This study provides evidence for a better understanding of herbaceous plants living in high mountain regions and offers important information for reducing the risk of ecological restoration failure in similar alpine regions.</jats:p>"

How to guarantee the resilience of these supply chains during the low-carbon transition becomes a critical issue. This study aims to recommend corresponding strategies by modelling and analysis. A system dynamics model was developed to analyze scenarios of China’s power-coal supply from 2021 to 2060. The results indicated that, firstly, the capacity redundancy of coal mines will increase from 1.13 to 1.32 before 2045, with the rising power-coal demand and its volatility, followed by a sharp decrease after that, in which demand falls in all scenarios. Secondly, increasing coal stock in each link can effectively reduce capacity redundancy of coal mines and imports during the period of rising demand, resulting in 250 million tons of coal mine capacity reduction, but will lead to an opposite result when demand falls. Finally, under high demand fluctuations, coal transport capacity will become a key constraint. It is recommended that China must improve the capacity redundancy of coal mines, coal stock, and coal transport in the near-term, as well as enhance long-term planning to carefully coordinate these factors during the whole process of low-carbon transition.</jats:p>"

This study developed an intelligent early warning system (EWS) for alarming and controlling risks from bacteria and disinfection byproducts in a drinking water distribution system (DWDS), named BARCS (Bacterial Risk Controlling System). BARCS adopts an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to data-driven prediction and considers total chlorine (TCl) concentration as the pivot indicator for risk identification and control. First, the machine learning-based AI model in BARCS can provide a reliable prediction of TCl concentration in a DWDS, with an average R2 of 0.64 for the validation set, while offering great flexibility for BARCS to adapt to various conditions. Second, TCl concentration was proven to be a good indicator of bacterial risk in a DWDS, as well as a cost-effective surrogate variable to assess disinfection byproduct risk. Third, the robustness analysis demonstrates that with state-of-the-art water quality monitoring technologies, online implementation of BARCS in real-world settings is feasible. Overall, BARCS represents a promising solution to the safe management of drinking water in future smart cities.</jats:p>",

The construction and innovation of the new program of supply the chain faces huge challenges. This study aims to propose a smart resilient supply chain framework with a decision-making schema through the plan-do-check-act management cycle. It can enhance supply chain resilience and strengthen industrial competitiveness. Moreover, an empirical study of demand forecast and risk inference for semiconductor distribution is conducted as a validation. Through demand pattern clustering and forecasting for historic customer order behaviors, the demand status of each customer is classified, and an optimal planning solution is released to support decision-making. The result has shown the practical viability of the proposed approach to drive collaborative efforts in enhancing demand risk management to improve supply chain resilience. The proposed forecast model performs better than all four benchmark models, and the revised recall of the proposed risk reference model shows high accuracy in all demand risk levels. As supply chain resilience is about to be reconstructed due to the industrial revolution, a government and industry alliance should follow the resilient supply chain blueprint to gradually make the manufacturing strategy a technology platform in the Industry 4.0 era.</jats:p>"

We investigated on-farm how indigenous nutrient supply and management practices affected N, P, and K uptake, agronomic efficiency and recovery efficiency of fertiliser, and physiological efficiency of nutrients taken up, under irrigated lowland rice conditions in Uganda. Treatments included recommended agronomic practices (RAP) without fertilisation, farmers’ practice (FP), farmers’ selected intensification practice (FIP), and RAP with NPK fertilisation (RAP + NPK). Indigenous N, P, and K supply varied greatly among farmers’ fields. N, P, and K uptake were significantly higher under RAP + NPK than under RAP, FP, and FIP; however, physiological efficiency (PE; kg grain kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> nutrient uptake) was significantly lower under RAP + NPK by 19% (N), and 12% (P/K), due to a larger effect of NPK application on uptake than on yield, leading to higher tissue concentrations. Indigenous available N reduced apparent N recovery, and agronomic and physiological N efficiencies independent of treatment. Also, P and K PEs decreased with increasing indigenous supply. Delaying weeding beyond recommended time, in interaction with indigenous N supply, decreased agronomic N efficiency, but increased PE of N. Interaction between P rate and timing reduced its PE; K rate and weeding time interaction reduced its PE. The decrease in efficiencies at high indigenous supply and delayed weeding indicates a need for site-specific fertilisation strategies based on naturally available nutrient levels and proper weeding. Weeding and fertilisation timing directly affect nutrient use efficiency, and therefore, fertiliser use efficiency in rice production systems.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, 21 provinces are seen as the research object in China, and the coupling coordination model is constructed, aiming to verify the coupling and coordination relationship between the two subsystems. The results suggest that two subsystems are coupled and coordinated in the same direction, and they feed back and influence each other. During the same period, four echelons are divided and there is variability in the coupling and coordination between the digital economy and rural logistics, according to the coupling degree (CD) and coupling coordination degree (CCD).

The main contributions of this article are (1) presenting the blockchain-enabled financing mode in the three-tier agricultural supply chain and (2) investigating supply chain decision-making in the three-tier supply chain when the tier-2 supplier is financially constrained, comparing advance payment and the blockchain-enabled financing mode. Relevant parameter estimations were realized using the data of the last ten years, and numerical analyses were conducted. The results show that when the farmer’s bank’s financing capability exceeds the acquirer’s, the farmer is motivated to select the blockchain-enabled financing mode. However, a win-win situation among the three-tier supply chain is only achievable when the transmission-fee rate falls within a particular range. In addition, if government agencies wish to promote blockchain technology by subsidizing blockchain-enabled financing, they might support the farmer in obtaining a bank loan at a cheaper interest rate.

The further influence channel test shows that the increase of trade policy uncertainty inhibits the improvement of enterprises’ supply chain efficiency by reducing the export quantity and technological innovation channel of enterprises. From the perspective of trade policy changes, this paper provides a new explanation for understanding the dynamic changes in the supply chain efficiency of Chinese enterprises in recent years and enriches relevant research on evaluating the economic effects of trade policy uncertainty.</jats:p>"
