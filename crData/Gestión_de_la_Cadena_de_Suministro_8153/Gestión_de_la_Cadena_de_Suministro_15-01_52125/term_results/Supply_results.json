      "abstract": "<jats:p>With global expansion and emerging business model complexities such as omni-channel for retail industry, corporations are under pressure to reinvent their supply chains. They fall into the old trap of following supply chain strategies of lean, agile, or postponement. These however are not strategies, but simply the goals of an effective supply chain: to reduce cost and variability, and optimize production. In contrast, a strategy should guide a corporation on how to reach these goals. The author argues that true supply chain strategy must be derived through an evaluation of capabilities to be built to realize the business goals of a corporation. To effectively create such a supply chain, corporations must further align their technology strategy to enable their supply chain capabilities. Only when the three, business, supply chain, and technology strategies, align can truly lean, responsive, and agile supply chains be enabled that create sustained competitive advantages. </jats:p>"

It tries to delve deeper into this context and also highlights the imperative aspects pertinent to it by throwing light on the evolutionary aspects of concepts such as Six Sigma and others. In fact, it has tried to focus upon the innovative concept of Lean by describing in detail what it is about and how it can be very significant for the modern day large and complex forms of organizations. Details regarding this along with the methodology and its implications are also given. Furthermore, the assortment of Case Studies emphasizing its substance was also discussed with thorough analysis and illustrations with especial reference to successful lean implementation. It also draws attention to the pioneering idea of Lean manufacturings integration with Six Sigma and consequently how it facilitates the process improvement. The instances of corporations such as Lockheed Martin and Bank One are also taken into consideration and especially included in this paper.</jats:p>"

In todays world, the manufacturing organizations are trying tooth and nail to get an edge over their competitors. This makes them obligatory to improve their production process which in turn requires a very effective and efficient supply chain system. It has made the researchers focus on this area of manufacturing and add some valuable contributions towards the betterment of manufacturing industry and the society as a whole. Review papers provide a great help to researchers in identifying the areas that need improvement and avoid redundancy of the efforts. Although a wide range of researches has been done on lean and supply chain separately, the integrated view of lean and supply chain is still suffering to receive the attention of a large stream of researchers. In the same context, to help researchers, this paper tries to identify the important researches and also find some key aspects that need to be explored. As, to the knowledge of the researchers, there are no review papers on lean supply chain till now, this paper assumes a greater relevance. The literature on the lean supply chain is exhaustively covered under the limitations of the resources, is classified on the bases of year, country, industry and journal and discussed lucidly followed by findings and conclusion. The literature identifies three phases of researches and highlights future research avenues.</jats:p>"

Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a promising field that considers the parallel influence of all criteria and aims at helping decision makers in expressing their preferences, over a set of predefined alternatives, on the basis of criteria (parameters) that are contradictory in nature. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a useful and widespread MCDM tool for solving such type of problems, as it allows the incorporation of conflicting objectives and decision makers preferences in the decision making. The AHP utilizes the concept of pair wise comparison to find the order of criteria (parameters) and alternatives. The comparison in a pairwise manner becomes quite tedious and complex for problems having eight alternatives or more, thereby, limiting the application of AHP. This paper presents a soft hierarchical process approach based on soft set decision making which eliminates the least promising candidate alternatives and selects the optimum(potential) ones that results in the significant reduction in the number of pairwise comparisons necessary for the selection of the best alternative using AHP, giving the approach a more realistic view. A supplier selection problem is used to illustrate the proposed approach.</jats:p>"

Increased competition, globalization, wide-spread outsourcing, use of information technology and rapid technological advances have contributed in supplier relationship development with the objective to achieve competitive advantage and a high level of performance. It is evident that only if mutual benefits accrue to both Vehicle Assemblers (VA) and their suppliers, the partnership between them would be meaningful and effective. Also, VAs have necessarily, to invest considerable resources and effort in achieving collaboration with their suppliers and cost-effectiveness becomes an issue which leads to supply base rationalization and a segmented approach. Therefore understanding the issues involved and identifying focus areas for successful supplier relationships becomes an imperative. This paper, based on an exploratory study, delves into the VA-supplier interface in Indian automobile supply chains, examines various theoretical and practical dimensions, in order to identify strategic imperatives (key impact drivers), Supplier Management Orientation (SMO) of VAs, adoption of Supplier Development Practices, extent of VA-supplier partnerships and mutual benefits accruing to both entities. Based on this a framework for holistically studying the VA-supplier interface is proposed.</jats:p>"

Fruits and vegetables sector in India has gained its credibility for providing sustainable income, nutritional security and for providing employment opportunities, both in rural and urban areas. India is the second largest food producer in the world, after china and one of the centers of origin of fruits and vegetables with the total production. Various high temperate fruits and vegetables like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, plums, tomato, green leafy vegetables etc. are widely grown in Himalayas and tarai region of Uttarakhand and are important to the large food processing industry. Fruits and vegetables is one of the most significant and thrust sector of the economy of Uttarakhand state. The entire supply chain of fruits and vegetables in Uttarakhand is laden with the various issues which resulting to poor price realization of growers on one hand and exorbitant prices paid by consumers on the other. Highly inefficient supply chain and cold chain infrastructure is the major impediment in the path of speedy growth of F&amp;V production sector in Uttarakhand. The present study undertakes a thorough review of basic and contemporary literature available and discussed the issues and challenges related to supply chain of fruits and vegetables sector in state of Uttarakhand, India and suggested the corresponding mitigation strategies. As Uttarakhand economy is based on agriculture, there is a need to develop efficient supply chain which may play an important role in increasing the shelf life of the F&amp;V and in turn reduce the losses and wastage in fruits and vegetables, increase in farmer income, generate employments opportunities for the local peoples, and improve the livelihood of the farmers which leads to the development of Uttarakhand and Indian economy as a whole.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capability to concurrently design the product and the supply chain is becoming a key competence in manufacturing companies. In spite of this development, this competence is still underdeveloped in industry. Research has not been able to fill this industrial capability gap partly because there is a lack of convergence of the methodologies for concurrent product and supply chain design in the research community. Today, businesses depend on strategic collaboration with their suppliers and customers to create value to develop product and to obtain better market-share. Designing products to match the processes and supply chains processes to match product platforms and supply chains, and supply chains to match the product platforms and process are the ingredients in todays fast developing markets. If this co-design is done well upfront with sufficient focus on product development process managing, product will cost much less overall and the time to market will decrease substantially. This paper presents a supply chain collaboration dynamic model with two innovative R&amp;D sectors for each supplier and buyer: A vertical R&amp;D sector that improves the quality of existing differentiated products and a horizontal R&amp;D sector that creates new differentiated products. The supplier and buyer exchange differentiated products and beneficiate from knowledge spillovers (possibly impulsed by R&amp;D subsidies). The long term policy effects of R&amp;D subsidies in this context had been studied in this paper. In this contribution, we have realized an attempt to integrate the product development model in a supply chain collaboration framework. This enables us to discuss of the optimal research policy integrating some feedback effects from innovation and knowledge spillovers. Our main result is that the effect of a subsidy to vertical R&amp;D (the only subsidy that has a long term effect) depends on the relative innovative capacities of the supplier or buyer that realized this policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main purpose of this chapter is to present a possible alternative for optimization of supply chain management. The chapter discusses the virtual organization as an important tool for optimization of supply chain management. A simple model for discussing organization of supply chain is introduced, which serves as an important starting point for assessing the current organization of the supply chain. Issues regarding collaboration between supply chain members are often emphasized in small, emerging economies in Central Europe. In these economies, supply chain management practices are not in the forefront. This chapter addresses issues regarding the collaboration of supply chain members based on a proposed model that can help responsible peoples in organizations to assess the current state of collaboration and show possible further directions in optimizing supply chain management, based on an increasing amount of virtual collaboration. In terms of practical implications, usage of selected tools in the frame of the proposed model of virtual organization is discussed, where usage, benefits, and drawbacks are outlined. </jats:p>"

In response to the dramatic changes in the business landscape over the last few years, many companies are launching business transformation programs to drive sweeping changes in their supply chain processes. These transformations are required to match the ever-growing customer demand and drive competition in the market. The supply chain transformation can be evident in exploring new sourcing networks, establishing collaborative forecasting processes, optimizing networks and inventories, reducing supply chain complexities, improving margins, etc. In today's world, it is no longer an option whether or not to opt for supply chain business transformations. Instead, it is a strategic mandate in order to stay relevant in the industry. This chapter provides the analysis of the most common transformation failures and suggests a practical framework leveraging some of the best practices in change management. </jats:p>"

Most of these companies have examined the problems and issues that they encounter during the implementation of this international supply chain. These problems are related to the attitude and culture of people around the world or rooted in the nature of the supply chain. Thus, this study compares the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) in two different countries with different cultures and attitudes. This study highlights the similarities of the problems and benefits of SCM implementation in the two countries. This study identifies the characteristics that are not related to attitude and culture and are rooted in the nature of SCM. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to 600 automotive companies in Malaysia and Iran. Several interviews were conducted to find solutions to the problems. Limited information and the lack of expert employees were identified as the most serious problems, whereas the improvement of warehouse management was identified as an important benefit of SCM implementation. Benchmarking and training courses were the important solutions to these problems. These results reveal that most issues in SCM implementation are rooted in its nature.</p>",

Maturity models are essentially a reflection of theories about how the capabilities of an organization evolve. Therefore, by design, they provide a roadmap to the next level of performance. The authors propose using maturity models as a structured way of identifying current capability or maturity level of any supply chain. They then provide guidance on selecting the right “causal linkages” between supply chain objectives and performance measures and define a mechanism for specifying more granular definitions of measures linked to strategic objectives for progressive levels of maturity. The authors survey widely used business process maturity models, current practices for measuring operational metrics, and then present a tiered framework for operational metric alignment and KPI governance, based on perspective-based design principles.</jats:p>"

A statistical analysis of the survey is introduced including a ranking of the difficulties and a grouping of those using factorial analysis. A difficulty, as understood throughout this paper, is any factor that significantly impacts, or has impacted in recent years, the performance of SCs. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Eighteen main difficulties hindering SC performance were identified.

Once the difficulties over the SCs are identified, strategies can be designed and implemented to attain desired benefits. Today’s intense competition requires firms to be more aware of their SC and to achieve excellence in many areas, especially at small- and medium-sized enterprises. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – There is a growing body of literature concerning isolated issues that SCs have to face; however, an exhaustive list of difficulties is hardly available.

It provides a holistic corporate context and grapples with tougher issues often deferred or stalled as other initiatives or crises grab corporate attention. This chapter introduces his frameworks and guidelines and selective examples of success and failure in implementation. This chapter assigns primary responsibility for supply chain strategy senior executives. It observes these areas as gradually becoming too operationalized, even commoditized, with local efficiencies emphasized at the cost of gradual overall ineffectiveness. It also dispels six myths that have taken root over time, highlighting their impact and substituting these with today's realities. To make this work more practical, this chapter shares first-hand examples of supply chain practices. </jats:p>"

The top-line and bottom-line impact would be so huge that it would be a no-brainer for supply chain leaders to make the needed investment. Over these years, globalized network strategies such as source-anywhere, make-anywhere, and sell-anywhere have become an implementable reality. At the same time, the efficiency (economic profitability) of that very design continues to see risks due to several geo-political and macro-economic factors. For want of a nail, manufacturing and distribution companies face the risk of losing the shoe. In this chapter, the author outlines a prescriptive approach to manage such risks through synchronous collaborative planning and proactive supply chain visibility that would help enterprises not only continue to be agile but also remain profitable. </jats:p>"

This study conducts an analysis to utilize linear programming and bootstrapping, targeting 12 Korean companies among the selected companies in Fortune Global 500. According to the results from the analysis, 4 companies with relatively high management efficiency of the factors which cause the supply complexity and 8 companies with relatively low management efficiency are found. The research findings reveal that public companies with the small number of products, factories, and providers relatively manage the supply complexity compared to private companies. Moreover, this study suggests projection point as a direction for relatively less efficient companies and excess quantity of input which should reduce for its achievement. This study also has an implication to establish a further standard of efficiency to manage the supply complexity for companies.</jats:p>"

The empirical work comprised three main phases: focussed interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey. Each phase used the authors’ definitional construct as its basis. While the context of the paper’s empirical work is Ireland, the insights and results are generalisable to other geographical contexts. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The data collected during the various stages of the empirical research supported the essence of the definitional construct and allowed it to be further developed and refined.

However, these efforts have generally focused on the building scale. A comprehensive reduction of carbon emissions from construction requires a wider focus, considering the building as well as the lifecycle of materials and their supply chains. There is a need for robust analysis of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) implications of construction supply chains and to optimize supply chains configurations so as to minimize GHG emissions across multiple organizations. This chapter provides a rigorous means of assessing the dynamic and complex supply chains of construction to obtain optimal and sustainable levels of GHG reductions in a whole-of-chain approach. Outcomes represent critical new knowledge, enabling deeper understanding as well as enhanced capacity to maximize energy savings from the built environment.</jats:p>"

The extant studies investigating the antecedents of SCI focus mainly on environments, interfirm relationships and other firm-level factors. These studies generally overlook the role of organizational culture. The few studies that do examine the effects of organizational culture on SCI show inconsistent findings.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– By placing organizational culture within the competing value framework (CVF), this study establishes a conceptual model for the relationships between organizational culture and SCI. The study uses both a contingency approach and a configuration approach to examine these proposed relationships using data collected from 317 manufacturers across ten countries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The contingency results indicate that both development and group culture are positively related to all three dimensions of SCI. However, rational culture is positively related only to internal integration, and hierarchical culture is negatively related to both internal and customer integration. The configuration approach identifies four profiles of organizational culture: the Hierarchical, Flexible, Flatness and Across-the-Board profiles. The Flatness profile shows the highest levels of development, group and rational cultures and the lowest level of hierarchical culture. The Flatness profile also achieves the highest levels of internal, customer and supplier integration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– This study is subject to several limitations. In theoretical terms, this study does not resolve all of the inconsistencies in the relationship between organizational culture and SCI. In terms of methodology, this study uses cross-sectional data from high-performance manufacturers. Such data cannot provide strong causal explanations, but only broad and general findings.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– This study reminds managers to consider organizational culture when they implement SCI. The study also provides clues to help managers in assessing and adjusting organizational culture as necessary for SCI.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This study makes two theoretical contributions. First, by examining the relationships between organizational culture and SCI in a new context, the findings of the study provide additional evidence to reconcile the previously inconsistent findings on this subject. Second, by departing from the previous practice of investigating only particular dimensions of organizational culture, this study adopts a combined contingency and configuration approach to address both the individual and synergistic effects of all dimensions of organizational culture. This more comprehensive approach deepens our understanding of the relationship between organizational culture and SCI.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This is a relevant question, because firms seek stability in their operations, and therefore managers need to know how the structure of their supply chains affects the occurrence of disruptions. The present study addresses this issue with a specific focus on upstream supply chain (supply‐side) disruptions. Drawing on the literature on supply chain complexity, we devise and test a model that predicts the frequency of supply chain disruptions based on a multi‐dimensional conceptualization of upstream supply chain complexity. Not only do the empirical findings suggest that all of the three investigated complexity drivers – horizontal, vertical, and spatial complexity – increase the frequency of disruptions, but also that they interact and amplify each other's effects in a synergistic fashion.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

As corporations' awareness increases on the jeopardizing impact they have caused to the deteriorating environment, more corporations have established a more eco-friendly operation. Greening the supply chain is one significant example of such moves. Realizing the green supply chain tendency in the industry, this proposed chapter focuses on highlighting the supply chain integration with business partners (suppliers, shippers, distributors, and customers) on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices. The chapter shows the literature supporting the important integration of GSCM as it enables corporations to gather collective strength, skills, and capabilities in achieving its ecological as well as business objectives. Both practitioners in companies and corporations might find this review useful, as it outlines major lines of research in the field.</jats:p>"

A channel of distribution is a special type of supply chain. Recycling is often made part of the supply chain. Quite often only parts of a supply chain are studied at one time and the study is made from one organization's perspective. When looking from an organization towards a supplier it is called to view the chain upstream, and downstream when the view is towards the customer. Studies of supply chains include besides raw material or supplies, various types of financial transactions, knowledge exchange, adaption and social relations. Due to various reasons, companies may choose to move, also called to integrate, up or down the supply chain. A move up the supply chain for a certain company involves taking over activities and responsibilities previously carried out by one or more suppliers. A move down the supply chain may involve making products more complete before moving them on to the next step.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We introduce a new type of critical supplier—the nexus supplier—that becomes evident when we consider suppliers from a network perspective. The extant literature focuses on the importance of strategic suppliers and identifies strategic suppliers as critical due to their significant impact on a buying firm's profit and risk position. These strategic suppliers are considered one‐at‐a‐time and tend to be top‐tier suppliers. In contrast, a nexus supplier can come from anywhere in a multitier supply network and is critical due to its network position and the resultant portfolio of interorganizational ties. In this study, we offer a theory of the nexus supplier by integrating the supply management and social network literature. The theory is presented in the form of typologies, which articulate three ideal types of nexus suppliers and how they distinctively influence a focal buying firm's operational performance. We use real‐world examples to build our arguments. We discuss implications of the nexus supplier for both theory and practice.</jats:p>",

With the increasing demand for reducing carbon foot prints, there is a need to study the drivers of sustainable development. There is also need for developing the sustainability model. Using resource based theory (RBT) the present model for sustainable strategy has been developed. On the basis of data collected, the key drivers of sustainability were developed. We used regression and correlation analysis for developing the final model.  The study findings suggest that the drivers of GSCM are the environmental policy and the green human resource management (GHRM). This can be done by providing training for adopting sustainability practices. Besides this, another key driver is the sustainability criteria in supplier selection which was found to be enhancing the outcomes of sustainability. The model has practical and theoretical value as it proposes that management support for implementing the sustainability strategy in the organization is essential. The study also guides the managers for implementing sustainable supply chain management practices in the organization.</jats:p>"

The introduction of the Internet and subsequent widespread use of web‐enabled computers from around 2000 onwards, means that it is now common practice for buyers and suppliers to exchange information using systems spanning more than a single organization. As part of a supply network strategy, IOS continue to proliferate as companies become aware of the potential of these systems to affect inter‐organizational interactions in terms of economic efficiency and strategic conduct (Bakos, 1991). For example, inter‐organizational systems enable firms to participate in electronic markets, offering considerable benefits in terms of improving transaction efficiency (e.g., elimination of paper‐based systems), eliminating uncertainty, and competing in electronic bids for new business (Gadde and Hakansson, 2001). At the ultimate level of integration, IOS enable all firms in the supply chain to be continuously supplied with information in real time.</jats:p>"

While logistics management is limited to managing product flows across the supply chain, supply chain management is about the management and integration of key value‐adding business processes within and between firms in a supply chain. Over the past decade, numerous authors, both academics and practitioners, have worked to provide guidelines for implementing intra‐ and inter‐firm integrations of business processes. Two prominent frameworks that have emerged from these efforts, namely, the supply chain management framework developed by the Global Supply Chain Forum and the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR®) model developed by the Supply Chain Council. This article summarizes these frameworks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper aims to explore empirically the perceptions of regulatory bodies about the ethical behavior of retailers. In the modern competitive and globalized business unfair ethical practices as highlighted by media are common. In this context need arises to examine the ethical behavior of retailer as well. In fact, the retailers are expected to follow the ethical virtues in their dealings with all the stakeholders in retail business. This initiates an investigation of perceptions of regulatory bodies about the extent to which retailers are being ethical in their conduct. The study is based upon the data obtained from regulatory bodies of a northern Indian city with a specific designed schedule. The exploratory factor analysis was carried out for data summarization along with ANOVA to extract the mean difference in the perceptions of various regulatory bodies. The retailers are respectful but the hide some facts about retail business. They often criticize their competitors with regulatory bodies officials and corruption also prevails to some extent in the relationship between retailers and regulatory bodies.</jats:p>"

The first important component of the supply chain refers to the reduction of traffic, correspondence and communication lines, the second refers to the process of balancing by layers of the activities and the third important component relates to micro processes of differently balanced states of units to generate the best compositions. Factors in terms of control are of strategic, tactical and operational level, the application of which increases the effectiveness and efficiency of logistic systems. This paper pays attention to the factors of efficiency in logistics centers, i.e. in processes and operations as a function of compositional equilibrium of status and location changes of loading units.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, a SRAM cell structure which uses pMOS access transistors and predischarged bitlines is presented. By using the strained pMOS transistor technology, the degradation of the read static noise margin (SNM) at high supply voltages due to the aging, especially in the presence of symmetric stress, is suppressed. In contrast to conventional cell, the write margin of the proposed cell does not degrade considerably at low supply voltages. To assess the efficacy, the proposed cell is compared with conventional cell for two cases of unstrained and strained pMOS. A comparative study is performed using mixed mode device/circuit simulations for a gate length of 22 nm. The results show that the read SNM degradation due to the symmetric aging at the supply voltage of 1 V is about 6% after three years for the proposed strained structure, while degradations are 14%, 12%, and 11% for the unstrained proposed structure, unstrained, and strained conventional structures, respectively. In addition, the proposed cell has both read and write cell sigma yields higher than six for supply voltages ranging from 1 V down to 0.5 V while the other structures have read or write yields less than six at the minimum supply voltage. Through some work function tuning, the cell sigma yields of the other structures reach above six for both read and write while being still lower than those of the proposed structure.

The leading edge of MAR technology is the integration of data obtained using conventional and advanced aquifer characterization technologies into groundwater models that have improved predictive capabilities. Borehole and surface geophysical technologies and geostatistical and stochastic modeling methods, in particular, offer opportunities for improved aquifer characterization and modeling. The objective is to develop more accurate groundwater models that can be used as site-screening tools to identify locations and aquifers that have the greatest potential for successful implementation of MAR and to evaluate various design and operational options to find optimal local solutions.</jats:p>",

However, the absence of standard manufacturing processes and the selection of materials with defined properties hinder the configuration of the composites materials supply chain. An interesting alternative for a “high‐tech” industry such as composite materials would be to review supply chain lessons and practices in “low‐tech” industries such as food. The main motivation of this study is to identify lessons and practices that comprise innovations in the supply chain of a firm in a perceived “low‐tech” industry that can be used to provide guidelines in the design of the supply chain of a “high‐tech” industry, in this case composite materials. This work uses the case study/site visit with analogy methodology to collect data from a Spanish leading producer of fresh fruit juice which is sold in major European markets and makes use of a cold chain. The study highlights supply base management and visibility/traceability as two elements of the supply chain in a “low‐tech” industry that can provide guidelines that can be used in the configuration of the supply chain of the composite materials industry.</jats:p>",

The Weighted Product Model (WPM) is an effective approach in dealing with this kind of decision problem, because in the proposed approach, system with poor performance in some attributes is penalized more heavily. Therefore, the application of the WPM in supplier selection field is the aim of this paper. The main findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of the proposed models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of solar energy as source of power is becoming not a choice but a necessity due to the unprecedented growth in the demand and consumption of electrical power for various applications. The solar power from the Photovoltaic (PV) systems is currently used as a standalone PV system or integrated with the electric grid. However, the generated DC power from PV systems is not stable due to weather, atmospheric and environmental conditions, which requires the design of a DC power supply to produce a stable and regulated DC voltage output. In this paper, a new design of power supply is presented that provides a stable output voltage (Vout = +12 V, 0 V, -12V) over significant range of input voltage variations (Vin = +15 V to +50 V) emulating the variation of output voltage of PV systems. The stabilization of the output voltage reflects the effectiveness of the proposed design for photovoltaic systems applications. The system is simulated using NI-MULTISIM software. A satisfactory simulation result is obtained showing a strong promise to practically implement using discrete components.</jats:p>"

The present paper assesses the mean ranking of variables impacting supply chain network of 44 small scale industries operating in district Udhampur of J&amp;K State. The industries are working under SIDCO and SICOP. Census method was applied to collect data from these industries. The data so collected were subjected to factor analysis for its purification and proper elucidation. The results of the ranking table and linear regression explored that the main factors/variables impacting supply chain network were Clarity of goals, Customer satisfaction, Long term relationships, Clear accountabilities, Internal congruity, and Opportunities for self-engagement. The efficacy of supply chain network is the result of gratifying customers needs, clarity of goals in relationships, and personal accountability to smoothen networks relationships. The results of linear regression revealed that effective supply chain network leads to customer satisfaction and supply chain relationships results in developing long term relationships.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article considers the problem of international supply chains in machinery-building. The meanings of appropriate terms are specified (outsourcing, international production sharing, vertical specialization). It is clarified (following D. Hummels et al.) the definition of vertical specialization as a structure of supply chain when a country is using imported inputs to produce goods for exports. It is emphasized that countries exporting raw materials usually show high share of vertical specialization-based trade in their exports but not in imports. Developed industrial countries (excluding Japan) usually show high content of vertical specialization-based trade in both exports and imports. Statistical analysis of the intra-industry labor division in the office, accounting and computing machinery of Asia and Pacific is made. In China and Japan most inputs consumed by office, accounting and computing machinery are of domestic origin. The larger share of intermediate production of the office, accounting and computing machinery, consumed by the same branch, in China is of domestic origin, too. It means that a queue of successive components of supply chains is placed on the territory of China. At the same time, what concerns the territory of Korea assembling industries are prevailing. In USA and Japan the branch is using as inputs mostly intermediate production of domestic origin. Still, a larger fraction of the intermediate production of the computer industry itself is imported. In the four from five countries reviewed (USA, Japan, Republic of Korea, Thailand) the imported intermediate production for computer industry used by the respective industry as inputs is larger than the domestic production. This proves high degree of internationalization of this industry in Asia and Pacific.</jats:p>"

It was established that distribution of hot water for domestic needs has random character and constitutes non-stationary process. It was proposed for hot water supply systems calculation to employ “rated mode of water consumption”. Rated mode is a simplified mathematical description of entire ordered collection of hourly consumptions anticipated during rated period of hot water supply system operation. Most precise description of water consumption rated mode may be obtained with coefficient of general hourly discontinuity at 98% coverage. Selection of hot water metering devices for residential house requires that operating flow rate of water meter should correspond by maximum to residential building water consumption parameters. Methods of calculation of daily water volumes passing through water meter at flow rates lower than transient flow rate value for the specified device were proposed.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to provide a short review on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) being used in social sciences research. A comprehensive literature review of article appearing in top journals is conducted in order to identify how often SEM theory is used.

This paper aims to highlight the potential of machine learning approaches as effective forecasting methods for predicting customer demand at the first level of organization of a supply chain where products are presented and sold to customers. For this purpose, we utilize Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with an effective second order algorithm, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for regression. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed approach using public data from the Netflix movie rental online DVD store in order to predict the demand for movie rentals during an especially critical for sales season, which is the Christmas holiday season. In our analysis we also integrated data from two other sources of information, namely an aggregator for movie reviews (Rotten Tomatoes), and a movie oriented social network (Flixster). Consequently, the approach presented in this paper combines the integration of data from various sources of information and the power of advanced machine learning algorithms for lowering the uncertainty barrier in forecasting supply chain demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Droughts will likely become more frequent, of greater magnitude and of longer duration in the future due to climate change. Already in the present climate, a variety of drought events may occur with different exceedance frequencies. These frequencies are becoming more uncertain due to climate change. Many methods in support of drought risk management focus on providing insight into changing drought frequencies, and use water supply reliability as key decision criterion. In contrast, robustness analysis focuses on providing insight into the full range of drought events and their impact on a system's functioning. This method has been developed for flood risk systems, but applications on drought risk systems are lacking. This paper aims to develop robustness analysis for drought risk systems, and illustrates the approach through a case study with a water supply reservoir and its users. We explore drought characterization and the assessment of a system's ability to deal with drought events, by quantifying the severity and socio-economic impact of a variety of drought events, both frequent and rare ones. Furthermore, we show the effect of three common drought management strategies (increasing supply, reducing demand and implementing hedging rules) on the robustness of the coupled water supply and socio-economic system. The case is inspired by Oologah Lake, a multipurpose reservoir in Oklahoma, United States. Results demonstrate that although demand reduction and supply increase may have a comparable effect on the supply reliability, demand reduction may be preferred from a robustness perspective. To prepare drought management plans for dealing with current and future droughts, it is thus recommended to test how alternative drought strategies contribute to a system's robustness rather than relying solely on water reliability as the decision criterion.\n                        </jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to improve the ecological validity of a well-studied congruency effect. The Simon effect (Simon, 1969) is the observation that an irrelevant stimulus location can facilitate or impede task performance when it is congruent or incongruent with the response location. Secondly, we wanted to investigate the role of action experience on the Simon effect. In this study, experienced bowlers were asked to hit either the left- or rightmost pin, depending on the pitch of a tone. Irrelevant to the task, this tone could be presented in the congruent or incongruent ear. Our results demonstrate that the Simon effect can be observed outside the laboratory and that weekly training at bowling may help in shielding against irrelevant location stimuli.</jats:p>",

While many water treatment processes do not work with metaldehyde degradation, a photocatalytic degradation process has been proved to have a significant effect on metaldehyde stability. Nanosized ZnO/laponite composite (NZLC) was used as a photocatalyst in this investigation of metaldehyde degradation. The reactions were carried out in a ultraviolet C (UVC) lamp fitted batch reactor by considering the following parameters: initial metaldehyde concentration, pH of solution, and light intensity. A comparison of degradation efficiency between photolysis, photocatalysis, and adsorptive ability on NZLC indicated that the latter had the highest efficiency. Furthermore, higher metaldehyde degradation was observed as the initial concentration decreased. However, the fastest metaldehyde degradation rate in heterogeneous photocatalysis was obtained when pH values were greater than 7.0. Consequently, the findings suggest that the removal of metaldehyde by adsorption and photocatalytic degradation using NZLC under UV irradiation was a hybrid reaction process (i.e. photolysis, adsorption, and photocatalysis).</jats:p>",

The flow of materials and equipment is critical to preserving the schedule and budget; however, in most projects, the location of critical materials is manually tracked using spreadsheets or relies on limited enterprise resource planning (ERP) system functionality. This creates a number of problems, as there is no automated or accurate method of locating or ensuring material is available after it has left the manufacturer/supply base and is issued for installation; for example:\nRecent analysis showed 50–70% of materials are subject to some type of waste (rework, wait time, transport and over processing).\nAdditional resources are required to manage constantly changing shutdown schedules and chase up material locations for job-card staging.\nMaterials expedite costs for a four-week shutdown in a remote area can exceed up to $250,000 a week.\nUp to 30% of materials sent for a shutdown can be returned to inventory, which increases transport and labour costs.\n\n\nThis extended abstract outlines the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and lean supply chain techniques for improving plant shutdown performance, following two major Brownfield engineering projects that used technology innovations, such as active RFID tags, cloud software, solar energy, GPS, 3G/wireless network and mobile devices.\nRFID real-time location material tracking and LEAN principles were applied to critical materials to remove waste from shutdown processes, protect the integrity of the shutdown plan and help reduce costs by up to 14%.\n</jats:p>"

Various critical aspects affect the strategic design and development of healthcare logistic networks in practice. The conceptual discussion is empirically derived on the basis of the challenge created by the development of centralized healthcare supply networks supported by the implementation of new IT/IS investments and advanced logistic hubs for hospital material inventory management. The study moves towards the development of a newer “Healthcare Supply Network Causal Loop Diagram”, to analyse and predict the growth pattern of a healthcare logistic network in its complexity, and understand how well the supply network will fit with the benefit provided by new logistic economies of scale and the risk of failures under uncertainty. </jats:p>"

This agenda has called for an integrated, coordinated, ecologically-oriented, and participatory approach to the reliable protection of water resources. Malaysia, endowed with its rich natural resources and diversity recognizes the need to adopt a sound developmental framework to transform the country's water management landscape to a high quality and excellent level. In parallel with this development, both government and non-governmental organizations continue to advocate national efforts to address environmental research for incorporating the sustainability of environmental literacy and conservation of ecosystems. The plan espouses the establishment of urban water recycling, bio-retention systems, and constructed wetlands to buffer the impacts of water pollution, and preserve ecosystems for the neighboring communities. The impetus is accompanied by the integration of water quality monitoring systems, and boosted by the implementation of expert analysis. The present work attempts to address the dynamic pressure, key challenges, and benefits of urban water management practices in Malaysia. The sustainable concepts of waterfronts, constructed wetlands, and implementation of water monitoring analysis are elucidated. In addition, the research breakthroughs, major obstacles, and co-operative ventures for the promotion of urban water management are outlined.</jats:p>",

With the growing importance of transportation, logistics, and supply chain economics to support industrial activities, specific supply chain asset investments can significantly impact national, local, and regional economies. At the same time, the relative availability, quality, and cost of a range of transportation services, particularly those relevant to essential intermodal activities and infrastructure influence firms' location decisions. By introducing an economic-geography perspective to a thus-far transportation-centric conversation, this article explores how states and their regions compete based on economic value propositions adopted on a much broader scale.</jats:p>",

The emergence of supply chain management has shifted this competition to one reflective of supply chains competing against one another rather than just firms. However, this “toward the customer only”–based competition may not represent the fullest basis of potential competition between supply chains. For example, over the centuries nations have fielded military forces that have competed not only in the open field against opposing forces, but also behind the scenes by constraining the resource base of the opposing force, in an effort to limit or avoid face-to-face struggles altogether. The military term for this competitive strategy is “interdiction,” and reflects long-standing military theory development, including practical as well as ethical considerations. This work outlines the military theory behind bidirectional channel competition, and compares historical military and contemporary business examples of the supply side–focused competition that interdiction prescribes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainability in supply chain operations fundamentally relies on environmental standards, the traditional driver of investment in pollution control and a major factor in facilities site selection. While environmental standardization has traditionally focused on activities in nations and in some multinational regions, in the future a more international perspective is needed. Environmental standards spur investment in technologies enabling sustainable supply chain networks. The complex institutional framework of environmental standardization is a widely misunderstood socio-technical, political process. Experience with the development of legal constraints on standardization in the U.S. has produced problems in areas like intellectual property (IP), antitrust and public participation. Standardization venues often host collaborative development of innovation by uniquely fusing technology design and public policy development. Various constituencies are typically engaged: environmentalists; technologists; legislatures at national, regional or provincial levels; regulators at various levels of government; standards-setting organizations; upstream suppliers; downstream users; the connecting supply chains; and society's varied range of affected communities. This article reviews the role of standardization activities in setting environmental constraints, in the development of green technologies and in establishing metrics for environmental metrology, certification and monitoring. Implications from U.S. experience in managing environmental standardization are examined here to guide participation in international standardization activities. The risks of misunderstanding standardization are so significant that their disregard imperils competitiveness. </jats:p>"

Yet, the issuance of trust has become a concern in the cloud web as cloud computing service technologies advance faster than measures to secure it. This research presents a framework to determine which specific supply chain functions can derive the most value from cloud capabilities and to understand how to leverage these technologies strategically to develop a competitive advantage. It proposes a strategic integration of cloud functionalities to create profitable supply chain network partnerships and to improve the processes, quality and innovation potential in the overall Supply Chain Management (SCM), while maintaining a trusted cloud environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>l outsourcing with a return policy is quite commonly adopted in the fashion supply chain. Under the return policy, the supplier as a brand owner may focus on production, and then outsource retailing to the retailer. In the meanwhile, the retailer may receive some support money from the supplier for subsidizing the loss of unsold products at the end of the selling season and be asked for shipping back. Motivated by this real practice in the fashion industry, we examine a two-echelon supply chain with one supplier and one retailer under the return policy. Several interesting findings are obtained from our analysis. First, we find that when the supply chain achieves channel coordination, the cost of physical return is at least partially borne by the supplier, no matter who is responsible for it in reality. Second, we find that the cost of physical return is significantly affecting the sustainability factors such as the expected amount leftover (which represents environmental friendliness), the expected sales to expected goods leftover ratio (which implies both environmental friendliness and economic sustainability), and the rate of return on investment (which indicates economic sustainability). Third, from a sustainability perspective, we find that the pure wholesale price contract is more sustainable than the coordinating return policy.  A numerical study by the real company data is conducted and managerial insights from analysis are discussed.</jats:p>"

Critics argue these goals are stubbornly irreconcilable tradeoffs. However, there is significant evidence of their complementarity. This article discusses how many opposing public-policy forces interact to impose the appearance of daunting contradiction. The policy analysis demonstrated here offers a logical path out of the apparent morass. It is argued that the advantages of standardization for key energy supply chain elements can harmonize these existing and other emerging interests, both foreseeable and unforeseeable. The crude-by-rail controversy illustrates how these standardization matters impact national energy policy.</jats:p>",

Im Maschinen- und Anlagenbau betrifft das die Montage, da hier eine hohe Anzahl an Komponenten pünktlich und zeitgleich bereitzustellen ist. Der Beitrag entwickelt die bekannte Methode des Bereitstellungsdiagramms mit dem Ziel weiter, notwendige Verbesserungsmaßnahmen für die Entscheidungsträger verständlicher abzuleiten und somit deren Umsetzung zu unterstützen.</p>\n          <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>\n          <p>Manufacturing companies have to meet rising demands for improved punctuality and cost reduction while process complexity is growing. Assembly in machinery and plant engineering is especially challenging, since a high number of components must be provided both on time and simultaneously. This article advances the known ’allocation diagram’ model to increase the intelligibility of improvement actions for managers and support their implementation.</p>"

It has been proven by numerous studies that the anthropogenic activities generate GHG emissions, and actions can be undertaken to mitigate the problem, and the impact of them on the market. This study addresses the issue of the accurate calculation of the so-called Carbon Footprint of an enterprise. During their research, the authors point out the ways that enterprises could avail from it, and how Carbon Footprint influences the purchases. It is evident, though, that there is still much work to be done concerning measuring Carbon Footprint, since common guidelines and standards used are being developed in global scale. This study recommends that empirical studies need to be made in order to inquire into the cost-benefit analysis of implementing a Carbon Footprint calculation.</p>",

The environment for supply chain activities has changed considerably since 2000, and many experts predict that even more significant change will occur over the next decade. This article will review industry progress on a set of 10 megatrends originally proposed in 2000, as well as extrapolate what the state of these trends may be over the next decade. In addition, new trends are identified that were not yet on the horizon in 2000, but will likely be influential in driving the changing supply chain over the next 10 years.</jats:p>",

In order to prevent and reduce food waste, the main causes have to be identified systematically along the food supply chain (FSC). The aim of this study is (1) to shed light on the causes and effects of food waste through the analysis of 44 qualitative expert interviews examining the processes and intermediaries along the German food chain and  (2) to find methods to reduce it. Results indicate that food waste occurs at all stages in the food chain. Thus, there is no single culprit to be blamed. Besides, the identified reasons for food waste differ between product groups; not a single solution can cause notable change. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that the causes and effects of food waste are to be found at different stages of the value chain. Hence, it is of high importance to improve communication and to raise a new appreciation for food among all stakeholders of the food supply chain in order to develop a more sustainable food system. Information on the topic of food waste needs to be shared among all actors of the supply chain. They need to share responsibility and work together to reduce food waste.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to propose the idea of briefly explaining the balance scorecard by highlighting its use, application in depth. A critical enabler in achieving desired performance goals is the ability to measure performance. Despite the importance of accurately measuring organizational performance in most areas of academic research, there have been very few studies that have directly addressed the question of how overall organizational performance is or should be measured. Perhaps more importantly, none of these studies seems to have significantly influenced how overall organizational performance is actually measured in most of the empirical research that uses this construct as a dependent measure. The most popular of the performance measurement framework has been the balanced scorecard abbreviated as BSC. The BSC is widely acknowledged to have moved beyond the original ideology. It has now become a strategic change management and performance management process. The approach used in this paper is the combination of literature review on evolution of balance score card and its applications in various sectors/organizations/ areas. This paper identify that the balanced scorecard is a powerful but simple strategic tool and the simplicity of the scorecard is in its design. By encompassing four primary perspectives, the tool allows an organization to turn its attention to external concerns, such as the financial outcomes and its customers expectations, and internal areas, which include its internal processes to meet external requirements and its integration of learning and growth, to successfully meet its strategic expectations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the balanced scorecard combined with application and strategy, which are now in a better position to begin to recognize managements expectations and to discover new ways to build value for workplace learning and performance within organization.</jats:p>"

The tool, the Material Management Operating Guidelines/Logistics Evaluation (MMOG/ LE), was developed by the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), and Odette International – a European alliance of automotive companies. The article begins with an introduction to the topic of quality and materials management assessment systems. The author’s then report on what they learned about MMOG/LE based on a review of the system and other comparable systems, and based on interviews with OEM’s and tier 1 and 2 auto suppliers that use the system. The article begins with a description of what the MMOG/LE system is, and how it works. The article then has a section comparing MMOG/LE and ISO/TS16949, and then another section comparing MMOG/LE and the SCOR model. The authors then address and comment on various strengths and weaknesses of the MMOG/LE model. Finally, the authors make several recommendations on how the system and processes for managing it could be improved. Overall, the authors find that MMOG/LE is an effective system for improving materials management and logistics performance.</jats:p>"

Supply chain risks emanate from multiple sources and similarly risk mitigation in supply chains is dependent on several variables. The most difficult part of supply chain risk management is prioritizing risks and an understanding of the relationships among various types of risks and risk mitigation variables. Drawing from the standard framework, in this research a modified house of quality is developed to understand the relationships between various supply chain risks and risk mitigation variables. It helps to prioritize various risks and understand the current status of the supply chain and the deficient areas with regard to risk mitigation capabilities. The structured QFD process provides the supply chain managers a conceptual map that enables the improvement of planning and control of various risks that could impact a supply chain. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The harmful effects of air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, and energy consumption can be minimized by more and more use of public transport system. But the service quality is an obstruction in use of public transport. Managing the service quality is crucial and more important factor for increasing the use of public transport. In this paper researchers used SERVQUAL for measuring service quality of one of the modes of public transport. Service quality is an amalgamation of a variety of criteria, among them some vague criteria are difficult to measure. This attribute introduces the problem for respondent to response to the survey. To conquer this issue, the researchers used Fuzzy TOPSIS for assess the service quality of public transport system. To measure the service quality, the researchers firstly developed a questionnaire based on SERVQUAL for collected the data. The respondents provided the linguistic assessment for rating the criteria of service quality and the various alternatives available. Then linguistic assessments are combined by Fuzzy TOPSIS for measurement of overall performance of each and every alternative. The better criterion is chosen on the basis of overall performance score and ranks them. The potency of the presented move toward is its convenient applicability and skill to endow with quantitative information. The utility of this proposed approach for assessment of service quality of public transport will be applicable in the capital city and neighboring townships i.e. Delhi &amp; NCR.</jats:p>"

A wealth of literature on crisis stresses on the need to enhance crisis management capabilities such as decision making, and leadership. Such capabilities are already in practice in the developed countries but have been mostly ignored in developing countries like Pakistan. Because of the neglect of the crisis management capabilities particularly in relation to utilities, Pakistan is facing acute shortage of electricity which is the life and blood of the industrial development in the country. Due to the electricity crisis, many of the industries have been forced to shut down and hundreds of thousands have become unemployed. The present study is an attempt to propose a framework that would help enhance the crisis management  capabilities of the companies involved in electricity production and supply. A comprehensive review of literature has been carried out in order to propose a conceptual framework accordingly. </jats:p>"

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the reliability and validity of the measurement and structural model developed to study the relationship among the linkages. Findings from the study supports that logistics service satisfaction, price satisfaction, relational satisfaction and commitment do influence loyalty positively. The analysis suggests that service satisfaction is the most important antecedent having primary influence in the formation of customer loyalty. Service satisfaction also has secondary influence on loyalty by acting as a strong driver in both relational satisfaction and commitment aspects of the service dimensions. Price satisfaction though positively been driven by service satisfaction, was found to have less significant effect as a predictor of loyalty in this context. The present study suggests that relational satisfaction is the second major predictor of loyalty which also drives commitment. This research is not an end-point but an attempt to establish the linkages and the effect among the antecedents driving the building and retention of good buyer-seller relationship in logistics outsourcing.</jats:p>"

The GSCM concepts can be implemented in inbound, internal, and outbound stages of the retail supply chain. The research examines each of these functions separately and determines its impact on the overall performance. For this purpose, a conceptual model was developed from literature sources and data collected using a structured questionnaire circulated among mid-size retail firms in Southern India. Thereafter, a confirmatory model was tested using structural equation modeling to validate the conceptual hypothesis. The analysis identified that greening the different phases of the supply chain leads to an integrated green supply chain, which ultimately leads to competitiveness and economic performance. The research findings suggest that if the retail firms green their supply chains not only would they achieve substantial cost savings, but also enhance sales, market share, and exploit new market opportunities which lead to greater profit margins, all of which contribute to the economic performance of the firm.</jats:p>"

Though many contributing factors have been cited in the literature, the authors argue that the integrated nature of ERP systems, which generally requires an organization to adopt standardized business processes reflected in the software, is one of the key factors contributing to these failures. The integration and standardization imposed by most ERP systems may not be suitable for all types of organizational structures and it seems that some characteristics in organizational structures affect the likelihood of implementation success or failure. Based on the theory of organizational structure, this paper analyzes how the traditional variables which define a firm's organizational structure such as formalization, complexity, and centralization along with two variables of size and CIO position in an organization influence ERP projects success. The paper tests five hypotheses using a sample of 203 Iranian cases. The results show that all of the research variables on organizational structure exert a positive influence on ERP success which confirms all the research hypotheses.</p>",

But the conventional capacitor step-down power supply has no voltage stabilizing, it cannot work between wide voltage ranges from 180V to 260V. This power can drive LED lamp group which power range is from 5W to 20W. It has less EMI, stable work, low cost and simple maintenance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past decades, natural organic matter (NOM), which is a complex heterogeneous mixture of organic materials that are commonly present in all surface, ground and soil waters, has had an adverse effect on drinking water treatment. The existence of NOM results in many problems in drinking water treatment processes, and the properties and amount of NOM can significantly affect the efficiency of these processes. NOM not only influences the water quality with respect to taste, color and odor problems, but it also reacts with disinfectants, increasing the amount of disinfection by-products. NOM can be removed from drinking water via several treatment processes, but different drinking water treatment processes have diverse influences on NOM removal and the safety of the drinking water. Several treatment options, including coagulation, adsorption, oxidation, membrane and biological treatment, have been widely used in drinking water purification processes. Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to study the influence of different treatment processes on NOM in raw waters. The present review focuses on the methods, including coagulation, adsorption, oxidation, membrane, biological treatment processes and the combination of different treatment processes, which are used for removing NOM from drinking water.</jats:p>",

It is based on a methodological approach that outlines two main results: a conceptual model and an operational one. These two models take into account the different characteristics and mechanisms of the supply chain. The conceptual level is based on four views: product, organizational, functional and informational. At this level, a meta-model that contains the basic generic concepts of the supply chain is proposed. The operational level uses the agent paradigm to model the different actors of the supply chain and the relationships between them. According to the characteristics of supply chains, a negotiation protocol between the different agents is presented. Simulations prove that the presented negotiation protocol can increase the efficiency and successful cooperation ratio for supply chain negotiation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines how power generation in the European Union (EU) can be modernised along the lines of a sustainable solution pursuant to WEC principles. This means a re-design with the goal of implementing the EU's internal market and far-reaching decarbonisation. </jats:p><jats:p> The example of Germany's energy U-turn shows one possible route, one that is marked by a massive expansion of renewable energies coupled with a phase-out of nuclear energy. Other European countries are pursuing different strategies. Current developments show that solutions chosen in any one country have direct implications for its neighbours. This is because electricity markets are continuing to grow together. In a spirit of solidarity between the member states, the closest possible review and coordination and/or harmonisation of policies are needed. This will allow the conversion process, which is associated with macroeconomic costs, to be shaped on a cost-efficient basis. </jats:p><jats:p> For utilities, the energy turnaround brings with it a multitude of challenges. Utilities must convert their generation portfolio and, in particular, perceptibly increase their share of low-carbon energies. Conventional power plants must be designed flexibly, so that – besides volatility in consumption – fluctuations in the feed-in of renewable energies, too, can be offset. In addition to this technical requirement, energy suppliers are facing a situation in which the utilisation period of conventional power stations is falling as a result of the growing feed-in of renewables. On top of this comes the fact that wholesale electricity prices on sunny days are pushed down despite high demand owing to the growing feed-in of electricity from photovoltaic systems. Both factors limit the options for obtaining the necessary contributions to cover fixed costs on the market. This raises the issue of the market design of the future. The launch of capacity mechanisms, ie remuneration for the product ‘firm capacity’ supplementing the income obtained from the sale of electricity, could help. At the same time, capacity mechanisms could be a suitable instrument for coping with power failures. </jats:p><jats:p> This brings politics into the game. With electricity markets growing together, the central requirement to be met by a capacity-market mechanism is that harmonised regulations, a discrimination-free design and technology neutrality are ensured throughout Europe. This is regarded as indispensable for creating a level playing field. </jats:p><jats:p> Also as regards reaching the goal of Europe's climate policy, viz. a lowering of greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared with 1990, the rule must be to prioritise European solutions over any national regulation. In addition, a procedure in climate policy that is more stringently reviewed at international level is considered unavoidable. Cost efficiency in reaching climate goals means backing market instruments. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions trading should be accorded the role of leading instrument in climate protection. The instrument can be used to achieve agreed quantity targets for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions reliably and at the least possible costs. </jats:p><jats:p> One argument in favour of anchoring the trade in emissions as leading instrument to shape a sustainable energy supply is that the costs of transforming the energy system can be kept within bounds. Renewable energies enter the system with rising CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> prices on a market-driven basis. The various technologies compete with one another and with other CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>- avoidance technologies, like increases in efficiency, utilisation of nuclear energy and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> capture and storage (CCS). </jats:p><jats:p> One current study says that the expected growth in electricity consumption in the EU by some 1,000 TWh by 2050 will be covered by adding renewable energies if the focus is on trade in emissions as leading instrument. This doubles the share of renewables in power generation by 2050 to about 50%. After 2030, with rising CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> prices, CCS, too, becomes profitable. If we were to rule out this technology for lowering CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, much higher costs for the aimed-at decarbonisation of power generation would have to be accepted. </jats:p>",

The organ with higher RGR (stem in sunflower and apical part with expanded trifoliate leaf- in bean plant) was the dominant acceptor even in conditions of limited supply of assimilates.Specific activity of root - donor of phosphorus, depends on the roofs metabolic and physiological activity only in the case, when supply of P to the aerial parts is not a factor limiting photosynthesis. If the activity of the whole root system is relatively low (like in preshaded series of sunflower) the photosynthetic compensation observed in plants replaced into better conditions coincides with compensation of P-absorption (both calculated per g of dry matter). It may explain the existence of a functional balance between shoot and root activity in the case of a changed proportion between their sizes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The validity and accuracy of information and its fast distribution is significant in effective wood fuel procurement. The authors' objectives were i) to define the solid wood fuel procurement process of regional power plants, ii) to define a conceptual data model for the wood fuel order-supply process and iii) to create an application for managing the process. They did an interview study for representatives of 38 power plants, their fuel suppliers and subcontractors about wood fuel procurement. They studied further six plants and one major supplier with focus group interviews. It was found that a lot of data is available, but it's not utilized efficiently. The authors used a methodology of designing information systems architecture and use-case derived methodology to determine the conceptual data model for the order-supply process and to develop an application to control it. Altogether, the hypothesis of the significant and wide-ranging role of information in the order-supply process was confirmed. The study gives a basis to further develop the systems to manage this information.</p>",

This chapter explores the online presences of the main candidates and their parties who stood in the 2012 French presidential election. The research focuses not only on the supply side but also explores demand, utilising data from the Mediapolis survey to ascertain what citizens search for online and in particular what citizens seeking help with their voter decisions seek online. The data shows that citizens are provided with a rich online experience during election campaigns. Information is presented in engaging ways and candidates attempt to mobilise their supporters and offer various opportunities to interact with the campaign and other Website visitors. Interaction is augmented in particular by the use of social networking sites. Citizens, however, appear to mostly go online to find detailed information on the policies and programmes of the candidates. There appears little call for engaging communication, interactive opportunities, or details on the personal lives or personalities of the candidates. The data may, therefore, suggest that information may need to be packaged for accessibility and presented in a way that allows voters to make up their own minds, rather than following the norms of corporate sales campaign Websites.</jats:p>"

An inclusive industry with strong economic linkages should encourage broader distribution of income and welfare. Field work was undertaken to assess stakeholders’ views on their commercial activity with the tourism industry. The sampled participants report stagnant and in some cases declining economic linkages with the industry.

Free chlorine is widely used as the disinfectant in drinking water, which can be used as a surrogate parameter to provide indications of potential contaminants. In this article, the periodic fluctuation of free chlorine is studied and the fluctuation pattern is extracted by the singular vector decomposition method, and an anomaly detection scheme for free chlorine is proposed and tested. Firstly, the normal periodic pattern and current pattern of free chlorine are both extracted from the historical and online data, and then the difference between the current data pattern and the normal data pattern are compared with thresholds for anomaly declaration. The single point detection and data series detection are investigated for the purpose of short-term and long-term inspection. Further, the anomaly data treatment and the detection method using sub-patterns are discussed. Performance tests show that the proposed method is sensitive to the anomaly data, and is effective to detect anomalous condition in typical contamination scenes.</jats:p>",

The pilot tests showed that the use of sorption materials could possibly decrease the antimony content in water to the values limited for drinking water (5 μg/L Sb). A more suitable adsorbent for removing antimony was READ-As. At a concentration of antimony in raw water ranging from 21.5 to 31.1 μg/L, a filtration rate of 5.58 m/h, the value of the bed volume of 3,967, and the adsorption capacity of 128.4 μg/g, which was achieved at a breakthrough concentration of 5 μg Sb/L, were determined. The surface characteristics of the sorption materials used through the physical adsorption of nitrogen, mercury porosimetry, X-ray microanalysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were studied.</jats:p>",

However, no existing animal models have established a direct link between ischemia and anastomotic leakage. The aim of this study was to establish a model of colon anastomotic leakage as a result of tissue ischemia. In colon anastomoses of 53 C57BL/6 mice, varying degrees of ischemia were induced. Supplying vessels were divided with bipolar coagulation in order to reduce anastomotic breaking strength and create clinical anastomotic leakage. Breaking strength of all the ischemic anastomoses were significantly lower compared with controls. Increasing ischemia resulted in higher rates of large bowel obstruction without creating anastomotic leakage. Healing was compromised as a result of impaired blood supply. However, clinical leakage was absent. Pure ischemia in otherwise healthy experimental animals may be too simple of an approach to create clinical leakage.</jats:p>",

Some of those opportunities arise from the deployment of modern systems that encompass the three most important components in supply chains management: namely, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and e-commerce. The current technology available in cloud systems appears to satisfy the needs of supply chain firms for managing resource planning, customer relationship, and e-commerce simultaneously. The main purpose of this chapter is to alert supply chain firms to the risks that they could face if their cloud system implementation is not carefully managed or if not appropriately selected and supported. The proposed investment strategies could assist supply chain firms in ensuring that their cloud system activities are positioned to assist and sustain their competitive advantages. </jats:p>"

Results are presented showing impacts on natural organic matter (NOM) due to intake location on the same water body and from individual unit processes including ozonation, granular-activated carbon filtration, and coagulation/flocculation. For validation and comparison of fluorescence methods, organic matter was quantified and characterized using liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). Principal component analysis (PCA) and parallel factors analysis were used for dimensionality reduction and to represent individual organic components observed through fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. Fluorescence results generally agreed with LC-OCD characterization, indicating that complete treatment reduced organic concentrations and preferential removal of humic-like material was associated with coagulation/flocculation. PCA results indicated higher concentrations of humic-like material at the Island water treatment plant intake that was not well reduced by inline polyaluminum chloride coagulation and direct filtration. Through fluorescence spectroscopy, ozonation increased Rayleigh scattering, which is correlated to small colloidal/particulate concentrations. Full-scale results from four water treatment plants presented demonstrate that fluorescence methods can characterize NOM, providing similar identification of trends to LC-OCD, with possible online application and use in real-time water treatment process control.</jats:p>",

However, feedback control during maturational growth or adaptive remodelling of local muscle capillarisation is likely more complex than simply matching O2 supply and demand in response to integrated tissue function. We tested the hypothesis that the maximal oxygen consumption (MO2max) supported by a capillary is relatively constant, and independent of the volume of tissue supplied (capillary domain). We demonstrate that local MO2max assessed by succinate dehydrogenase histochemistry 1) varied more than 100-fold between individual capillaries and 2) was positively correlated to capillary domain area in both human vastus lateralis (R=0.750, P&amp;lt;0.001) and soleus (R=0.697, P&amp;lt;0.001) muscles. This suggests that, in contrast to common assumptions, capillarisation is not primarily dictated by local oxidative capacity, but rather by factors such as fibre size, or consequences of differences in fibre size such as substrate delivery/metabolite removal.</jats:p>",

And one manufacturer provides the high wholesale price with low supply disruption risk and the other is completely the opposite. This differs from the previous supply chain coordination model. Firstly, supply disruption is added to the three-echelon supply chain. Secondly, considering the coordination of the supply chain, we deploy the combined option and back contracts which are seldom used in the previous study. Furthermore, it is interesting that supply disruption risk and buyback factor do not affect the distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer who has low product price and unreliable operating ability, while the order quantity increases with the rise of option premium and option strike price. The distributor’s order quantity from the manufacturer, which has high product price and reliable operating ability, increases with the rise of supply disruption risk but decreases when the buyback factor, option premium, and option strike price decrease.</jats:p>"

The object of the study is the Mudan River of Mudanjiang city region, China. Samples were collected on a regular monthly basis in 2007–2011 from all sampling sites along the river, involving six major water quality parameters. The grouping of water parameters and the clustering of sampling events by the use of SOM has helped in their pre-processing for application of the HDT. The HDT orders clusters according to the pre-clustered water sampling events. The water quality was ranked against norms established by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China in order to assess in detail the water quality of the whole river system. The resulting map of the spatial and temporal changes in the water quality at each sampling site was specifically described by ArcGIS.</jats:p>",

In this paper we have applied the use of an Adaptive Weighted Sum Genetic Algorithm to optimize the system operations such that it minimizes the high energy consumption as well as ensuring the overall reliability of the water level in the reservoir.  The results obtained from the optimized model of the system show a promising and a significant reduction to the tune of 34.97% in the amount of energy consumed as compared with that of normal operations.</jats:p>"

Some statistical tools like Bivariate and Multiple Regression Analyses with diagrammatical representations are used for the purpose. The paper concludes with the major findings that the shipping performance in terms of the growth of total vessels is significant in response to both the growth of total and category–wise cargo traffic respectively over the said period. This may be primarily due to the dominant rise in the total bulk cargo vessels rather than the container cargo vessels, though there is a significant growth in container traffic. In particular, the liquid bulk cargo has a greater impact on the growth of total shipping, though there is a significant growth of liquid bulk cargo in total cargo traffic.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study sought to determine the effect of the Distribution Strategy on the performance of MSP intermediary organizations. It is imperative to note that there has been a high recognition of the role played by the telecommunication sector towards Kenyas economic growth and has multiplier effects on other aspects. This has underscored its importance in the countrys development agenda. However, it still remains validly appreciated that there exist intermediary organizations in the same fast-growing telecommunication sector whose contribution in this acclaimed progress is little appreciated. Thus, the MSP intermediary organizations must implement the appropriate distribution strategies that will enable them deliver their own objectives and those of their parent organizations. The study employed a descripto-explanatory cross-sectional survey research design and collected primary data from 219 respondents from a target population of 397. This study established that choice of distribution strategy contributed significantly to the MSP Intermediary organizations performance. The study recommends that the sales manager need to lobby its management to invest in more people and an ICT system that will enable tracing, tracking and trending of performance of each salesperson and route to ensure adequate coverage of the territory. In addition, sales managers need to lobby the management to approve a performance compensation plan and bonus/incentive scheme that will motivate the salesperson to ensure efficient routing of the customers thus improved performance of the MSP intermediary organization.</jats:p>"

The principal objective of this research is to identify and assess supply chain risks in dairy products sector. A set of supply chain risks is identified through extensive literature survey and is divided into five major categories and 28 components through Risk Breakdown Structure approach. A questionnaire is developed based upon these 28 components and data collected from 170 respondents. Risks are assessed through Probability and Impact scores obtained from responses and then slotted into 2x2 Risk Matrix. A risk matrix comprising of 04 quadrants is formulated through low and high scores of probability and impact of all 28 risks. It is found that 16 risks fall in high risk quadrant, 08 in moderate and 04 in low risk quadrant. Risks of competition, deceases, terrorism, quality of raw materials, natural disasters along with those falling high risk quadrants are required to be promptly responded by dairy sector operators for effective risk mitigation. Similarly risk responses have been suggested for moderate and low gravity risks as well.</jats:p>"

Secondary, focused coding revealed that much of what the counterfeiting strategies set out to achieve involves the generation, suppression or exploitation of signals. A theoretical account of counterfeiting and its impact on competitive resources (quality, reputation and trademark) is then developed based on signalling theory and the resource-based view. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A set of counter-measures for dealing with the counterfeiting threat are proposed.

Novel parameters affecting businesses make them remain with two choices: adapt or perish. The fact that a once-thriving company like Nokia could not last in the market would provide a factual example of how the new business environment may be challenging. Business transformation is a term with ranges of definitions: an ultimate change in organizational process, which was caused by or resulted in a basic major alteration in structure, processes, and behaviors. It relates to new ideas, strategies, and management processes. Strategies not only affect the inner side of the company but also have peripheral consequences on the total supply chain. The chapter is an exertion to introduce some of the foremost factors on which businesses are being influenced, such as the Internet, e-business, globalization, etc. In addition, the relationships between supply chain management and business transformation and the reciprocal impacts are studied.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increased demand from the market to carry out rapid business transactions has led many companies to seek to improve their regular business transactions. The progressive development of the internet in establishing a variety of electronic marketplaces has facilitated companies to move towards applying e-procurement technologies. This indirectly increases the competitiveness of companies due to well managed purchasing activities using e-procurement technologies. The strategic decision by the top management in implementing e-procurement technologies is mainly concentrated on managing the supply of external resources and preferred to focus on the implementation of green supply chain activities to increase the environmental performance with e-procurement technologies. With the spread of internet technologies, which led to changes in business strategy and its uses, companies will be provided with a digital platform for online business transactions. Therefore, business through electronic media (e-media) have the potential and power to transform business transactions and business relationships. E-procurement became the most important strategy for the business to purchase or procure goods or materials from global suppliers. Despite the claims on usability of e-procurement technologies, some companies however show little interest in applying e-procurement technologies because of the difficulty the companies to perform purchasing activities and other key aspects that influence the companies to exploit the technologies. As a major contributor to the growth of the agriculture sector, the Malaysia Palm Oil Industry (MPOI) should explore the potential of e-procurement and other relevant technologies to be exploited in the industry and enhance its competitiveness. The information on the applicability of e-procurement technologies for different types of materials at different stages of the industry supply chain will assist the industry players to achieve efficient purchasing activities. Hence, in this chapter the case study discussed will provide relevant e-procurement solutions with respect to the MPOI and will provide comprehensive purchasing activities of different types of products along the supply chain through e-procurement technologies. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Recent developments in catalysts have enhanced the potential for the utilisation of carbon dioxide as a chemical feedstock. Using the appropriate energy efficient catalyst enables a range of chemical pathways leading to desirable products. In doing so, CO<sub>2</sub> provides an economically and environmentally beneficial source of C<sub>1</sub> feedstock, while improving the issues relating to security of supply that are associated with fossil-based feedstocks. However, the dependence on catalysts brings other supply chains into consideration, supply chains that may also have security of supply issues. The choice of chemical pathways for specific products will therefore entail an assessment not only of economic factors but also the security of supply issues for the catalysts. This is a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we present a modified 4A framework based on the framework suggested by the Asian Pacific Energy Research centre for macro-economic applications. The 4A methodology is named after the criteria used to compare alternatives: availability, acceptability, applicability and affordability. We have adapted this framework for the consideration of alternative chemical reaction processes using a micro-economic outlook. Data from a number of sources were collected and used to quantify each of the 4A criteria. A graphical representation of the assessments is used to support the decision maker in comparing alternatives. The framework not only allows for the comparison of processes but also highlights current limitations in the CCU processes. The framework presented can be used by a variety of stakeholders, including regulators, investors, and process industries, with the aim of identifying promising routes within a broader multi-criteria decision making process.</p>"

To carry out the distribution process we need to have quick Order processing mechanism, Quick and reliable transportation system, Quick delivery, Use of latest technology, efficient Ware housing and dedicated human factors. Companies can take advantage of the just-in-time (JIT) approach to integrate those requirements to achieve in cost reduction, lead-time reduction, quality assurance, and overall customer’s satisfaction. And that is how company establishes a long lasting relationship with the customers. This paper examines the important factors attributing the JIT distribution process (JDP) in Indian Industries. To know the difficulties faced by Indian firms in implementing the concept is explored by the survey method. It is concluded that the implementation problem of JDP are short sightedness of top management, Well connectivity of Warehouses, Cross docking, Small shipment size, Multi functional workers and JIT adopting as culture.</jats:p>"

Trade credit is the separation between the delivery of goods and their payments. It is affected by two types of factors including firm specific characteristics and macroeconomic conditions. This study investigates the following firm specific variables such as firm size, liquidity, product quality, price discrimination and macro-economic conditions viz GDP. Data have been collected for trade credit supply determinants of non-financial firms listed in Karachi Stock Exchange, Pakistan. The number counts for 156 firms in 13 sectors with 11 years data from 2001-2011. The results show that all the variables are significantly related to trade credit supply as hypothesized.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Supply chain coordination consists of multiple aspects, among which inventory coordination is the most widely used in practice. Inventory coordination is challenging due to the uncertainty of customers' demand. Existing researches typically assume that the demand is either a deterministic constant or a stochastic variable following a known distribution function. However, the former cannot reflect the practical costumers' demand, and the later make the model inaccurate when the demand distribution is ambiguous or highly variable. In this paper, the authors propose a Monte Carlo simulation model of such problem, which can mimic the inventory changing procedure of a supply chain with uncertain demand following an arbitrary distribution function. Then, a PSO is combined with the simulation model to achieve a coordination decision scheme to minimize the total inventory cost. Experiments show that their approach is able to produce a high quality solution within a short computational time and outperforms comparative approaches.</p>",

The filters are typically made using local labor and locally available materials including clay soils and various burn out materials used to create porosity. Artisanal approaches may be used to manufacture the filters, and there have been efforts to improve CPF performance through laboratory studies. The importation of soil to make the filters may be highly regulated and could be cost prohibitive, so some researchers use commercially available clay to fabricate experimental filters. However, such efforts typically do not include a comparison of the engineered clay to native clay soil, nor do most studies compare the performance of experimental CPFs fabricated from engineered clay to CPFs made from native clay. This study compares mineralogical and geotechnical properties of a clay soil from Rabinal, Guatemala, used to produce CPFs in that country to an engineered clay developed for use in laboratory experiments. Flowrate is the primary quality control parameter used in CPF production, and performance testing indicated that experimental CPF flowrates were not necessarily a function of clay composition. However, engineered clay could be used as a surrogate for native soil with some limitations.</jats:p>",

For example, five out of the top global Research and Development (R&amp;D) companies were pharmaceutical companies. However, the industry is lagging behind other industries in adopting Business-to-Business (B2B) and supply chain technologies. With supply chain costs constituting around 25-40% of an organization's operating expenses, it is imperative for senior pharmaceutical executives to minimize this cost. Hence, the main objective of this chapter is to identify key B2B e-commerce management, evaluation, and benefits realization factors and challenges within the Australian pharmaceutical supply chain. The results of this study suggest that pharmaceutical companies not only need to carefully examine their B2B investment management and evaluation practices but also must invest in using appropriate evaluation methodologies for identifying and managing benefits, risks, and costs associated with their investments in B2B and supply chains.</jats:p>"

These alliances, generally characterised by large dissimilarities between the partners, often facilitate value-creating opportunities. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Using case studies, the paper analyses similarities and differences in SCM between symmetric and asymmetric alliances within supply networks. It focusses on the key dimensions of complementarity, value distribution, relational management and specialisation. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – It was found that the question of complementarity, although important, should not be equated to the need for symmetry but to the ability of the firms in the supply network to learn to work together. For small firms who seek co-creation with large partners, this means collaboration, specialisation through relation-specific investments, flexibility and understanding the overall value system in which their business relationships compete is important. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Small firms seeking to develop advanced SCM capabilities have to accept responsibility for selecting a reduced number of key partners and managing relationships. Firms should proactively use the contractual process to learn about partners' expectations and goals and to identify committed champions. These factors play an important role in developing communications and trust, as small firms do not have easy access to senior managers in large corporations. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper discovered a novel concept – dual value appropriation – where partners do not divide the total value generated as frequently proposed in the literature, but that it is fully appropriated, as it represents a different value proposition for each of them.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Photovoltaic systems are suggested to be used as an alternative energy resource to ensure in-house demand for heating. Inputs of solar radiation on the surfaces oriented in different directions have been estimated herein. A computation method and estimations for energy production of PV-modules placed under conditions of partial shading cased by the building’s wings have been presented herein as well. An optimal inclination angle of the modules with respect to the horizon, which can ensure maximum energy gains under weather conditions of Saint-Petersburg, has amounted to 35°.</jats:p>"

This study deployed a pilot-scale grid flocculation system to treat melt water from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China. A range of traditional coagulants were used on the low temperature, low turbidity, and micro-polluted melt water, to investigate the effect of coagulant types on flocculation performance and floc properties. Flocculation performance varied, depending upon the coagulant used. Turbidity and organic matter were removed with the greatest efficiency by polyaluminum chloride (PAC), followed by polyaluminum ferric chloride, followed by aluminum sulfate (alum). At a PAC dosage of 25 mg/L, the settled water's residual turbidity was lower than 1 NTU, meeting the Chinese national water-quality standard. Floc fractal dimensions of the three coagulants initially decreased, and then increased as the flocculation process yielded larger particles. This suggested that low turbidity could significantly affect the floc fractal dimension. Studying floc size distribution indicated that floc size in the grid flocculation tank was relatively uniform; the floc size distribution of PAC was the narrowest. The results could be used to inform operations of the Xining water treatment plant.</jats:p>",

The result of the research suggests that the quality of the knowledge and the understanding of the BSC within an organisation is a major determinant to the level of positive impact that implementing the BSC can have on an organisation. This research concluded that the same principle applies to any performance measurement and performance improvement initiatives, and that non BSC implemented firms are not necessary worse-off than BSC implemented firms from a performance perspective. Only few numbers of organisations were sampled. These sampled organisations are not a complete representation of the rest. The research acknowledges that the sources of information under which conclusions and assumptions were made were not based on primary sources. It is possible these data may not fully reflect the current state of all sampled organisations in this research. </jats:p>"

The essence of this methodology is to have a system-based outlook to the products quality phenomena. Three key components of activities defined in SCQM are Upstream Quality Management, Inter-organizational Quality Practices, and Downstream Quality Practices. While suppliers are considered as the input providers through the supply chain, Supplier Quality Management is considered as the core activity in this methodology. A comprehensive review of papers and industrial and military SQM manuals made it possible to propose a novel classification in this area which is based on defining four interrelated fields of study. This article has been divided into three parts which are: 1. academic, military, and industrial literature review: firstly, by reviewing academically literature, three different fields of studies were reviewed as: (i) supplier selection methods, (ii) supplier performance monitoring, and (iii) supplier relationship management. Next, some of the novel industrial and military supplier quality management approaches have been reviewed. 2. defining selection/assessment criteria and KPIS in seven possible areas of outsourcing, and finally 3. conclusion which proposes a clear and detailed research direction by which the reader can find a good vision of the applicability of subjects analyzed in this study and the reason we have got so far into the SQM concept.</jats:p>"

However, it is the performance of the seedling on the outplanting site that is the most important. For species seedlings, little information is known about the field performance of plants cultured with different nutrient rates, especially with exponential fertilization. In this study, Chinese pine ( Carr.) seedlings grown in 187 ml containers were fertilized exponentially in 6 treatments ranging from 10 to 120 mg N seedling for 25 weeks before outplanting. Dry mass and N content were measured at planting. Survival and field growth were monitored for two growing seasons. In the nursery, our data showed no difference in dry mass among the 40, 80, 100, and 120 mg N seedling fertilizer treatments; collectively, these treatments were significantly greater than at 10 and 20 mg N seedling treatments. Seedling N content was greatest for the 100 and 120 mg N seedling rates. These data suggested that nursery optimum N fertilization rate was no less than 100 mg N seedling. Outplanting height and root-collar diameter growth characteristics were not significantly different after two years, whereas maximum mean survival was best for seedlings nursery-fertilized at 80 mg N seedling. In consideration of both nursery and field performance metrics, our data suggest that exponentially fertilizing Chinese pine seedlings at 80 mg N seedling maximizes both nursery biomass accumulation and outplanting survival.<ja:italic>Pinus </ja:italic><ja:italic>Pinus tabulaeformis</ja:italic><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup><ja:sup>â1</ja:sup></ja:p>"

The model serves as a framework for analyzing the student-borrower motivations (the demand side), the bank-lender motivations (the supply side), externalities that motivate government support for student loans, and the perverse incentives government regulations spawn for educational institutions and lenders. Analysis of the model reveals that the crisis is driven by students desire to increase their socioeconomic standing, by banks search for profits in a climate of decreasing risk, and by the governments efforts to lessen the impact of externalities.</jats:p>"

However, few studies have directly investigated the dependence of thermal limits on oxygen transport capacity. By manipulating oxygen availability (via environmental hyperoxia) and blood oxygen carrying capacity (via experimentally-induced anemia) in European perch (Perca fluviatilis, Linneaus), we investigated the effects of oxygen transport capacity on aerobic scope and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). Hyperoxia resulted in a two-fold increase in aerobic scope at the control temperature of 23°C, but this did not translate to an elevated CTmax in comparison with control fish (34.6±0.1°C vs. 34.0±0.5°C, respectively). Anemia (∼43% reduction in haemoglobin concentration) did not cause a reduction in aerobic scope nor CTmax (33.8±0.3°C) compared with control fish. Additionally, oxygen consumption rates of anemic perch during thermal ramping increased in a similar exponential manner as in control fish, highlighting that perch have an impressive capacity to compensate for a substantial reduction in blood oxygen carrying capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that oxygen limitation is not a universal mechanism determining the CTmax of fishes.</jats:p>",

Currently, this sector is facing several challenges in this entire region, threatening its growth and sustainability. Hence, if the policymakers need to improve the economic conditions of the nations, then the only way to do that is to improve the agricultural sectors of this region. This can be achieved by successful implementation of Supply Chain Management (SCM). This chapter is concerned with the concept of SCM and how it can play a vital role in developing the agricultural sectors in the SAARC countries. Another aspect of this chapter is concerned with the effectiveness of the application of SCM in agriculture; it can be implemented by using a fully integrated software package like SAP ERP. By the application of this IT software package, SCM can be made more efficient and lead to time and inventory reduction. </jats:p>"

Physico­­–chemical characteristics of AOM spiked into a water sample, before and after coagulation, were investigated using high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with UV and fluorescence detection, three dimensional-fluorescence excitation emission matrix (3D-FEEM) measurement and resin fractionation in which three fractions were determined including very hydrophobic acid (VHA), slightly hydrophobic acid (SHA) and hydrophilic fractions. Release of AOM from algal cells with consequential increases in dissolved organic carbon and UV absorbance led to changes in 3D-FEEM spectra indicative of increased aromatic protein presence. Changes in disinfection by-product formation potential after the AOM spiking indicated possible interactions between natural organic matter and AOM. A study of the treatability of the AOM spiked water using two coagulants, alum and a polyaluminum composite coagulant, was conducted with the relative percentages of UV absorbance values of both the SHA and hydrophilic fractions higher in the post coagulated AOM spiked water than in the coagulated water, with corresponding reductions in the VHA proportion. It was found that the increased SHA and hydrophilic components in the AOM spiked natural water were recalcitrant to removal by both coagulants.</jats:p>",

The feasibility of solar photocatalytic degradation of an organochlorine compound, namely trichloroethanoic acid (TCA), which is commonly used in the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago, was separately assessed using titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as photocatalysts in suspended solution. Overall the prototype solar photoreactor operated and performed efficiently for the photodegradation of TCA. This study showed that a basic photocatalytic oxidation method for treating water using solar energy as the primary driver gives enhanced decomposition rates of the organochlorine compound when coupled to the additional application of the two separate semiconductor photocatalysts. The results further showed that for varying concentrations of TCA and photocatalysts alike, the organochlorine compound could be completely photocatalytically degraded using short exposure times under the applied influx of solar radiation. This means that this process could be optimised by judicious use of sensors so that dosage rates of the photocatalyst could be altered with variations in influent contamination levels, and the exposure time in the reactor could be altered according to daily variations in solar radiation intensity.</jats:p>",

Firms exhibit heterogeneity both within and across industries regarding foreign direct investment (FDI). We propose that firms making vertical or resource-seeking investments abroad will be less likely to file AD petitions, and firms are likely to undertake vertical FDI in the context of currency undervaluation. Hence, we argue, the increasing vertical FDI of US firms makes trade disputes far less likely. We use firm-level data to examine the universe of US manufacturing firms and find that AD filers generally conduct no intrafirm trade with filed-against countries. We also find that persistent currency undervaluation is associated over time with increased vertical FDI and intrafirm trade by US multinational corporations (MNCs) in the undervaluing country. Among larger US MNCs, the likelihood of an AD filing is negatively associated with increases in intrafirm trade. In the context of currency undervaluation, we confirm the existing finding that undervaluation is associated with more AD filings. We also find, however, that high levels of intrafirm imports from countries with undervalued currencies significantly decrease the likelihood of AD filings. Our study highlights the centrality of firm heterogeneity in international trade and investment in understanding political mobilization over international economic policy.</jats:p>"

The case of Jiamusi was studied as an example: an MCRC water use model was established and the model was solved to derive Jiamusi's initial water use plan in the target year of 2020. The relationships between the economic benefits produced by water consumption and the groundwater exploitation rate, agricultural water consumption, chemical oxygen demand, and ecological water consumption were analyzed based on this plan: the trade-off among indicators of various dimensions was analyzed to obtain the relationship curves between the regulation indicators of the economic dimension and those of the other dimensions (resource, social, environmental and ecological dimensions). Finally, multi-dimensional regulation was applied to the plan based on the relationship curves from the trade-off analysis, and the best water use plan for the target year was proposed. This study provided a strong basis for setting thresholds for the planning and management of water use in Jiamusi.</jats:p>",

We study the impact of supply chain contracts with endogenous upstream innovation, focusing on three different contract scenarios: (i) a wholesale price contract, (ii) a quality‐dependent wholesale price contract, and (iii) a revenue‐sharing contract. We confirm that the revenue‐sharing contract can coordinate supply chain decisions including the innovation investment, whereas the other two contracts may result in underinvestment in innovation. However, the downstream manufacturer does not always prefer the revenue‐sharing contract; the manufacturer's profit can be higher with a quality‐dependent wholesale price contract than with a revenue‐sharing contract, specifically when the upstream supplier's innovation cost is low. We then extend our model to incorporate upstream competition between suppliers. By inviting upstream competition, with the wholesale price contract, the manufacturer can increase his profit substantially. Furthermore, under upstream competition, the revenue‐sharing contract coordinates the supply chain, and results in an optimal contract form for the manufacturer when suppliers are symmetric. We also analyze the case of complementary components suppliers, and show that most of our results are robust. </jats:p>",

Traditional supply chain management involved a salesperson, who was the focal point in the supply or logistical chain. In a traditional supply chain model, a business would contact a salesperson to inquire about a product or a salesperson would pitch a product to a business; then the ordering process or supply chain management of movement of goods would funnel through the salesperson as the initial interface. Today, the supply chain has evolved; IT has changed the landscape of the supply chain with applications, such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), CRM (Customer Relationship Management systems), and ERP (Enterprise Resource Programs). The result is major changes in competitiveness, efficiency, costs, and strategy. This chapter examines the evolution of supply chain management and the impact of IT.</jats:p>"

Flow of Information has become a crucial function in setting objective, drawing strategy, taking right decision regarding supply chain of LP Gas throughout the whole country by linking the supplier, manufacturer, distributor, dealer/ retailer and customer to achieve optimum productivity, overall satisfaction and joyful relationship at competitive costing. As LP Gas is a necessary commodity, quick and effective information system helps a manager to understand the customer response, their demand, inventory in stock, amount to be produced, time frame and location of delivery. This study, we have focused on application of information systems in the supply chain of LPG industry. Here we used multi-method to get the best result. The study is compiled with the help of both primary and secondary data. We have collected data from 152 respondents in the relevant field. To achieve objective properly we developed a semi-structured interview schedule for collecting the information. We have analyzed our data by employing descriptive statistics and Cronbach’s alpha test. This paper illustrated the role of IS in sourcing, network designing, transportation, inventory management, forecasting, aggregate planning, setting goal, benchmarking the goal, troubleshooting from very beginning of the supplier relationship to the end customer relationship keeping smooth internal information flow throughout the process. We found that, if we apply information systems in all steps and drivers of supply chain of LPG industry then it can develop the integrated supplier relationship, strong internal supply chain management, maintain the customer relationship management and so on. This study we have also given some recommendations to the LPG industry of Bangladesh for applying information systems in the supply chain process.</jats:p>"

The proposed tool is based on an incremental perspective, according to two main dimensions: mutual trust among partners and the extent of the cooperation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– This study used a “synthesising” approach to gauge potential contributions previously spread across different streams of research and disciplines that are now integrated into the framework. We conduct a deep literature review to characterise the horizontal collaboration phenomenon along two levels of analysis. In doing so, we examined relevant literature in the field of horizontal cooperation in logistics to critically appraise aims of, impediments to and existing models for horizontal collaboration. Additionally, we reviewed seminal literature of four organisational theories to assess their potential to contribute to the theoretical foundations of the growing topic of horizontal collaboration. Transaction Cost Economics, Social Exchange, Resource Dependence and Social Dilemma represent the theoretical foundations to cast light to how to design and implement inter-organisational horizontal initiatives.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The proposed tool organises horizontal collaborations within three steps for each of the two levels of classification: trust and extent of the cooperation. The organisational theories reviewed play different roles to help in different stages of the horizontal collaboration. Additionally, for each combination of trust/extent of the cooperation coherent pairs of aims of the collaboration and assets that are to be shared are defined.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The article represents the first attempt to analyse horizontal collaboration from within the discipline itself and from the wider field of SCM through other well-established theoretical lenses. The proposed tool has shed some light into the black box of (un)successful horizontal collaboration, but it is theory based – which represents its main limitations – thus, requiring further testing of the research streams suggested in the paper.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The article not only gives insights into theoretical challenges of horizontal collaborations that needs further investigation but is also useful to companies involved in horizontal collaborations by helping define coherent assets that are to be shared to achieve specific goals. In its more theoretical underpinning, the framework can also inspire the partnership philosophy and help sketch a collaborative evolutionary path.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The lack of a theoretically robust landmark that could help understand, design and implement horizontal collaborations has been defined as a major theoretical and practical shortcoming.

Many have found his enigmatic formula “I would prefer not to” to be the embodiment of a long sought-after remedy for seemingly fruitless revolts against oppressive capitalist mechanisms. In order to examine the potential of Bartleby’s challenge to power, I will read it against the representational authority of economic theory, and, more specifically, the supply and demand model. The close reading of Melville’s short story reveals that Bartleby’s resistance to productivity and consumption indeed “opens up a new space outside the hegemonic position and its negation” (Žižek 393). In addition, I will provide a reading regarding representational power in relation to the narrator and the (de)stabilization of systems of meaning production, in which I will draw mostly on works by Agamben and Deleuze. Bringing together these three readings, however, renders doubtful the potential of such challenges to power. In fact, Bartleby’s “I would prefer not to” might end up reaffirming already existing power structures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health care systems in Austria and Slovenia are currently facing challenges due to scarce resources and demographic change which can be seen especially along the supply chains. The main objective of this paper is to present an option to improve the use of assistive technologies. An extensive literature research for the theoretic part as well as a qualitative survey for the empiric part focusing on short-term care were carried out. Results show that there is a lack of information and training on assistive technologies. As a consequence, their full potential cannot be exploited. Therefore a guideline for nursing consultations was developed. To conclude, both the literature research and the qualitative survey show that assistive technologies have high potentials to improve the supply chains in the health care and social services sector, but there is a lot of information and training on them needed.</jats:p>"

Apart from water, nitrogen (N) is also an important limiting factor in grape growing. The effects of N deficiency on grapevine growth were investigated in this study. Two-year-old Vitis vinifera L.cv. Shiraz plants grafted on 110 R were grown in pots placed outside and exposed to various N supplies (0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 12 g plant–1) under well-watered conditions. At veraison, plants were harvested and organs separately dried, weighed and analysed for N. During plant growth, the length of the primary and secondary axes and the number of leaves on them were recorded. The N content of leaves was also analysed at three phenological stages (flowering, bunch closure and veraison). All growth processes were inhibited by N deficiency in an intensity-dependent manner. Quantitative relationships with N supply were established. Vegetative growth responded negatively to N stress when comparing control N supply with no N supply: primary axis elongation (–61%), leaf emergence on the primary axis (–47%), leaf emergence on the secondary axis (–94%) and lamina area expansion (–45%). Significant differences on the plant N status were observed from flowering onwards which might be useful for managing fertilisation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates a closed-loop supply chain network, including plants, demand centers, as well as collection centers, and disposal centers. In forward flow, the products are directly sent to demand centers, after being produced by plants, but in the reverse flow, reused products are returned to collection centers and, after investigating, are partly sent to disposal centers and the other part is resent to plants for remanufacturing. The proposed mathematical model is based on mixed-integer programming and helps minimizing the total cost. Total costs include the expenditure of establishing new centers, producing new products, cargo transport in the network, and disposal. The model aims to answer these two questions. (1) What number and in which places the plants, collection centers, and disposal centers will be constructed. (2) What amount of products will be flowing in each segment of the chain, in order to minimize the total cost. Four types of tuned metaheuristic algorithms were used, which are hybrid forms of genetic and firefly algorithms. Finally an adequate number of instances are generated to analyse the behavior of proposed algorithms. Computational results reveal that iterative sequentialization hybrid provides better solution compared with the other approaches in large size.</jats:p>"

The goal of this paper is to show the usefulness of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a decision-making tool for IT sourcing decisions, based on an analysis of factors that recent literature found to be associated with IT sourcing risk. Although the AHP previously has been suggested for IT outsourcing decision making, this study is the first to consider evaluating the risks of offshore outsourcing, rural outsourcing, and in-sourcing IT processes by using the AHP. From the perspective of the expert decision maker, three IT sourcing strategies were evaluated with respect to 58 criteria. The case study example presented in this paper shows the effectiveness of the AHP to support management for this business decision. The authors' results show that a systematic approach to analyzing outsourcing can reduce the uncertainty and risk that is common in such decisions.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaysia has committed to a 40% reduction of carbon emissions by 2020. The government has encouraged industry, society, and non-government organizations to work together to achieve this objective. The government has provided incentives through several energy programmes such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, green technology, and green building. One key area that has been targeted is logistics and supply chain, which has been contributing to high carbon emissions in manufacturing industries. Scholars and practitioners have only recently begun to pay attention to creating a low carbon supply chain. Furthermore, Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have faced several challenges in adopting low carbon activities. SMEs are unable to take the advantage of energy initiatives because of a lack of knowledge, a shortage of funds, and inadequate facilities. Almost 90% of firms are in the service industry working with large manufacturing firms and some SMEs working in manufacturing industry are working closely with their supply chain networks; achieving low carbon targets is hampered by the readiness of the manufacturing itself. This chapter discusses the challenges and future agenda of creating low carbon supply chains in manufacturing in Malaysia. Possible solutions are provided at the end of the chapter. </jats:p>"

However, the discussions in marketing and logistic literature universally conclude that it would be desirable to determine the life cycle of products in the firm, as they have a great impact on appropriate supply chain design. Designing a supply chain effectively is a complex and challenging task, due to the increasing outsourcing, globalization of businesses, continuous advances in information technology, and product life cycle uncertainty. Indeed, uncertainty is one of the characteristics of the product life cycle. In particular, the strategic design of the supply chain has to take uncertain information into account. This chapter presents a two-phase mathematical programming approach for effective supply chain design with product life cycle uncertainty considerations. </jats:p>"

Consequently, researchers are trying to find the best solution to address this problem by introducing new desalination technologies that are able to accommodate the increasing demand for clean water. One of the new technologies introduced is desalination of seawater through freeze concentration. In this study, progressive freeze concentration (PFC) was implemented to produce pure water in the form of an ice crystal block, leaving behind higher concentration seawater using a coil crystallizer. The effect of operating parameters such as initial concentration and coolant temperature were investigated. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the system was reviewed based on the value of the effective partition constant K which is defined by the ratio of solute in ice and liquid phase. A low value of K indicates when the system is most efficient. In addition, the results for the overall heat transfer coefficient are also presented to observe the heat transfer involved in the system.</jats:p>",

The production of bioenergy is expected to increase in the years to come, and one of the most important obstacles in increased bioenergy utilization are the logistics problems, which involve complex and large-scale optimization problems. Solving these problems constitutes a daunting task, and often, traditional mathematical approaches fail to converge to the optimal solution within a reasonable time. Thus, more robust methods are required in order to overcome complexity. Metaheuristics are strategies for solving complex and large-scale optimization problems, which provide a near-optimal or practically useful solution. The aim of this chapter is to present a survey of metaheuristics and the available literature regarding the application of metaheuristics in the bioenergy supply chain field as well as the uniqueness and challenges of the mathematical problems applied to bioenergy. </jats:p>"

It is common in SCM environments that the participating entities’ behaviors are random and unpredictable and so can only be modeled in a probabilistic way. In this paper, we consider the shipping problem of determining the optimal quantity of perishable products with a limited time to be stored in the warehouse. The optimal quantity minimizes the overall operational costs including those of inventory and shipping. We develop a mathematical model, from which the probability distribution function, mean, and variance of the length of the build-up period are derived and we establish a cost function for determining the optimal shipping value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, to simulate a biogas desulfurization process, a modified  Monod-Gompertz kinetic model incorporating a dissolved oxygen (DO) effect was proposed for a sulfur-oxidizing bacterial (SOB) strain, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, under extremely acidic conditions of pH 2. The kinetic model was calibrated and validated using experimental data obtained from a bubble-column bioreactor. The SOB strain was effective for H2S degradation, but the H2S removal efficiency dropped rapidly at DO concentrations less than 2.0 mg/L. A low H2S loading was effectively treated with oxygen supplied in a range of  2%–6%, but a H2S guideline of 10 ppm could not be met, even with an oxygen supply greater than 6%, when the H2S loading was high at a short gas retention time of  1 min and a H2S inlet concentration of 5000 ppm. The oxygen supply should be increased in the aerobic desulfurization to meet the H2S guideline; however, the excess oxygen above the optimum was not effective because of the decline in oxygen efficiency. The model estimation indicated that the maximum H2S removal rate was approximately 400 ppm/%-O2 at the influent oxygen concentration of 4.9% under the given condition. The kinetic  model with a low DO threshold for the interacting substrates was a useful tool to  simulate the effect of the oxygen supply on the H2S removal and to determine the optimal oxygen concentration.</jats:p>"

In sand, plants received 100 μM, 300 μM, 500 μM and 700 µM N at a low P level of 10 µM and a high P level of 100 µM. In solution, plants received 200 μM and 500 µM N at a low P level of 5 µM and a high P level of 15 µM. Cluster roots formed only in plants with low P supply. Roots showed greater citrate and malate production and phosphatase activity at 5 µM P than at 15 µM P. At 10 µM P, greater N supply enhanced cluster root formation to 60% of root biomass, and increased the phosphatase activity of noncluster roots and succinate release by both root types. At a high P supply of 15 µM, greater N supply stimulated phosphatase activity of roots by 50%, increasing P uptake and plant growth. With increased resource partitioning towards P acquisition due to greater P demand, A. linearis is tolerant of low P supply and highly responsive to combined addition of N and P.\n</jats:p>"

This TSDR estimation model is supported by the system dynamic principle and the VENSIM (an application that simulates the real system). It was accomplished by long-term observation of eight cities’ transport conditions and by analyzing the estimated results of TSDR from fifteen sets of refined data. The estimated results indicate that an urban TSDR can be classified into four grades representing four transport conditions: “scarce supply,” “short supply,” “supply-demand balance,” and “excess supply.” These results imply that transport policies or measures can be quantified to facilitate the process of ordering and screening them.</jats:p>"

The 1SLP is an integrator that assembles the resources, capabilities, and technologies of supply chain networks to design and implement comprehensive logistic solutions. The research develops the 1SLP process framework by dividing the service scope into four service models. We use a case example to demonstrate the improved process. The case company is a leading manufacturer in producing projectors for the global market. The current material procurement process causes long lead times, delays the manufacturing process, and does not integrate all information in the supply chain. In the to-be model, a 1SLP incorporated model 2 services and provides a VMI warehouse as a value-added service and integrated information platform to ensure the buyer's inventory level and implements appropriate logistics optimization for efficient delivery. The AnyLogic Simulation Software is used to model the current and the to-be business processes. The comparison between the as-is and the to-be models demonstrates that the improved material procurement process increases the current process's efficiency under the one-stop services without impeding product availability to the target market.</jats:p>"

Based on the literature revision, a framework analyzing client-supplier relationships throughout the supply chain is proposed. The framework uses the strategic alignment concept between clients and suppliers. Finally, 61 questions were developed to identify the innovative suppliers. </jats:p>"

The analogy of diving with sharks can also be used for the medical tourism supply chain. The importance of the contribution of medical tourism to the business entities in the healthcare industry, and to the economics of healthcare is often noted. Yet, what factors make the medical tourism supply chain itself a winning business strategy are just as often unknown. In this chapter analysis of the medical tourism supply chain is undertaken, based on a specific pattern of analytical categories derived from a typical literature search process. The numbers of articles published in peer-reviewed journals on particular keywords and factors impinging on the medical tourism supply chain have been systematically analysed. The chapter suggests that four issues in the medical tourism supply chain require further investigation. </jats:p>"

It also involves various barriers from implementation perspective, as well as the concerns related with vendor lock-in, security, reliability, privacy and data ownership. This chapter provides a comprehensive coverage of the opportunities and barriers as well as the generic treatment from SC perspective. It also highlights how the cloud technology represents a perfect fit with the ideas of ‘Collaborative Supply Chains', ‘Business Process Outsourcing' and ‘long-term strategic partnerships, which are the key themes characterizing the Supply Chains of today's era. This chapter reveals that the intersection of the topics ‘Cloud computing' and ‘Supply Chain' is a promising area for further research.

The findings reveal that not only is SCRM loosely defined, but that there are various fragmented supply chain risks enablers and that there is a strong need for a clear terminology for its building enablers. In addition to that, the review points to a lack of empirical confirmation concerning the connection between SCRM and performance. This paper contributes an overview of 80 peer-reviewed journal articles on SCRM from 2000 to the beginning of 2015. We offer an overarching definition of SCRM, synthesise and assemble the numerous enablers into preventive and responsive strategies by means of a conceptual framework. Moreover, indicating the social network theory (SNT) as a potential theoretical foundation for SCRM, we further contribute to the supply chain management (SCM) literature by providing propositions that guide future research.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on leak detection by using vibration monitoring techniques. The long-term goal is the development of a system for automatic early detection of burst leaks in service pipes. An experimental campaign was started to measure vibrations transmitted along water pipes by real burst leaks occurring in actual water supply networks. The first experimental data were used for assessing the leak detection performance of a prototypal algorithm based on the calculation of the standard deviation of acceleration signals. The experimental campaign is here described and discussed. The proposed algorithm, enhanced by means of proper signal filtering techniques, was successfully tested on all monitored leaks, thus proving effective for leak detection purpose.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to determine supply practices of Victorian community pharmacies in relation to the emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), following release of an updated guideline by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Telephone call scripts were developed for three scenarios in which the ECP was requested: outside the licensed 72-h time frame (Scenario 1); by a woman under 16 years (Scenario 2); and for future use (Scenario 3). From 1222 pharmacies, 515 were randomly selected and allocated into three groups: 177 to Scenario 1 and 169 to each of Scenarios 2 and 3. Pharmacists’ responses were categorised as ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘ambiguous’ and descriptive statistics were calculated. The results are as follows. Scenario 1: over half (55.4%; 92/166) declined supply and most referred to the doctor, citing the time frame or the ECP as no longer being effective reasons. Decreased effectiveness was readily discussed among those willing to supply. Scenario 2: more than half (53.9%, 89/165) agreed to supply, assessing the request against eligibility criteria outlined in the guideline; however, 5.6% (5/89) were only willing if the woman obtained a doctor’s prescription or recommendation. Scenario 3: less than half (40.5%; 66/163) declined supply, mainly due to no therapeutic need. Only four respondents willing to give the ECP knew that supply was bona fide. In conclusion, pharmacists’ practices are variable and not always in line with the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia guideline. Pharmacists’ awareness of the guideline needs to be raised so women can unobtrusively access the ECP.</jats:p>"

A multi-objective function is used to address decisions about capacity sizing, sourcing, and facility location, with the scope of maximizing supply chain profits. The model is dynamic and is applied to a multi-echelon, multi-facility and multi-product supply chain in hypotheses of delocalization. The model is characterized by the specific attention given to cost, revenue and financial factor modelling, which has been obtained by means of an activity-based approach and the inclusion of two drivers that are usually neglected in the literature: energy and labour. The model's applicability and flexibility have been proved via a scenario analysis in which 12 different scenarios were implemented to reproduce the behaviour of major industries. </jats:p>",

Specifically, we study the recent development of SOs optimization associated with supply chain by categorizing them into four different industries (i.e., e-commerce industry, consumer service industry, public sector, and fashion industry) and four various SOs features (i.e., advertising, channel coordination, pricing, and inventory). Moreover, we conduct the technical review on the stylish industries/topics and typical optimization models. The classical optimization approaches for SOs management in supply chain are presented. The managerial implications of SOs in supply chain are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although global manufacturers can produce most of their final products in local plants, they need to source components or parts from desirable overseas manufacturing partners at low cost in order to fulfill customer orders. In this global manufacturing environment, capacity information for planning is usually imprecise owing to the various risks of overseas plants (e.g., foreign governments’ policies and labor stability). It is therefore not easy for decision-makers to generate a global production plan showing the production amounts at local plants and overseas manufacturing facilities operated by manufacturing partners. In this paper, we present a new global production planning process considering the supply risk of overseas manufacturing sites. First, local experts estimate the supply capacity of an overseas plant using their judgment to determine when the risk could occur and how large the risk impact would be. Next, we run a global production planning model with the estimated supply capacities. The proposed process systematically adopts the qualitative judgments of local experts in the global production planning process and thus can provide companies with a realistic global production plan. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed process with a real world case.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Outsourcing in the textile industry has been playing an important role in the global economy for six decades. Recently, reshoring is an emerging trend due to various complexities involved in supply chain management. As compared with basic textile and apparel products, fast fashion products are complex in their own way. A single assortment contains several new styles, colors, and sizes with unpredictable demand and urgent deadlines. Numerous assortments run simultaneously in the supply chain. For each assortment, the garment manufacturer has to source various types of fabrics and materials from different suppliers and then manufacture the garments to ship within the deadlines. This complexity contributes to supply chain disruption. This paper develops a model to estimate supply chain disruption cost as a function of fast fashion product complexity in the global outsourcing environment. Estimation of disruption cost will help us to increase visibility and eliminate the bottlenecks in supply chain. Model conclusions are used to develop a method to manage the level of product complexity from the global supply chain perspective. Several strategies are proposed to manage the impact of product complexity on supply chain design.</jats:p>"

The results show that the wholesale price and retail price are negative correlation, while the recycling rate and total profit of supply chain system are positive correlation with the proportion of reusability component designed in new product and quality of recycling product. Moreover, there are conclusions that the wholesale price and retail price are lower while the recycling rate and total profit of supply chain system are higher with centralized decision. Then, in order to coordinate the closed-loop supply chain, this paper develops a revenue-sharing contract, in which the revenue share parameter is determined based on absolute deviation approach.

We have identified a putative P transporter (PT) from L. perenne mycorrhizal roots (LpPT1) and assessed its transcriptional regulation by soil P availability and mycorrhizal colonisation. We also investigated transcript levels of fungal PTs from the two arbuscular mycorrhizal species Rhizophagus intraradices and Funneliformis mosseae. Our analyses indicated that LpPT1 codes for a high affinity PT most likely responsible for direct P uptake from the soil. LpPT1 is highly expressed in roots of plants grown at low P, whereas high P repressed its expression. LpPT1 was not expressed in above-ground plant tissues. Colonisation with R. intraradices did not affect expression of LpPT1 significantly. Transcript levels of the R. intraradices PT were not affected by P availability but the F. mosseae PT was repressed by high P supply, particularly in intraradical hyphae. Our study could assist in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of P uptake in the pasture grass L. perenne.</jats:p>"

This new approach considers the multi-choice programming into the cost coefficients of objective function and stochastic programming, which is incorporated in three constraints, namely sources, destinations, and capacities constraints, followed by Cauchy's distribution for solid transportation problem. The multi-choice programming and stochastic programming are combined into a solid transportation problem, and this new problem is called Multi-Choice Stochastic Solid Transportation Problem (MCSSTP). The solution concepts behind the MCSSTP are based on a new transformation technique that will select an appropriate choice from a set of multi-choice, which optimize the objective function. The stochastic constraints of STP converts into deterministic constraints by stochastic programming approach. Finally, the authors construct a non-linear programming problem for MCSSTP, and by solving it, they derive an optimal solution of the specified problem. A realistic example on STP is considered to illustrate the methodology. </jats:p>"

This study addressed a strategic multistage expansion (e.g., a decade) of a cellulosic biofuel supply chain system with supplements of corn grain biofuels. A multiobjective, multiyear optimization framework was proposed, and the compromise method was used to seek best-compromise solutions between economic competitiveness and environmental quality of the supply chain while satisfying evolving fuel demand, feedstock resources, and technological constraints. The model was implemented in an illustrative case study of planning an in-state ethanol supply chain in California between 2015 and 2025. The results indicated that significant trade-offs existed between cost and greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain and that cellulosic ethanol produced from corn stover and forest residues could be an important alternative to corn ethanol with a low cost of $2.20/gal and emissions of 1.5 carbon dioxide equivalent kg/gal. </jats:p>",

Today, in the changing world of many contradictions bioterrorism is a real challenge for many non-state and state actors. The main target of bioterrorist acts are humans while a critical infrastructure can be used as a target depending on its impact on life and everyday activities. Among them, food supplies and distribution systems are extremely important and their deliberate contamination as a part of terrorist action is a real threat that can cause even global and serious health, ecological, economic and political consequences. Most health professionals have limited knowledge in the recognition of diseases from either natural or intentional contamination of food. They are not trained to respond appropriately to a terrorist assault for management of the consequences. Outbreaks of both unintentional and intentional food-borne disease can be managed by the same mechanisms contained in a crisis management plan. So, in order to be prepared for any incidents of food and water terrorism, it is essential to establish procedures, plans, to train the experts and to improve response capacities. The other subjects of society, especially decision makers as well as security professionals must also pay more attention to this problem in order to prevent it.</jats:p>"

Oat and sunflower plants were grown in pots on a peat soil under copper deficiency conditions (–Cu) or with the optimal copper supply (+Cu). In plants the following measurements were carried out: 1) the activity of ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) and of catechol oxidase (PPO) in different plant organs and at different stages of plant development, 2) the activity and the rate of photosynthesis, 3) the activity of RuDP-carboxylase, 4) the intensity of plant respiration. The activity of AAO and of PPO, and also the rate and the activity of photosynthesis were significantly lower under conditions of copper deficiency. The activity of both discussed oxidases depended on: 1) the plant species, 2) plant organs, 3) stage of plant development. Copper deficiency caused decrease of the respiration intensity of sunflower leaves but it increased to some extent the respiration of oat tops. Obtained results are consistent with the earlier suggestion of the authors that the PPO activity in sunflower leaves could be a sensitive indicator of copper supply of the plants, farther experiments are in progress.</jats:p>"

The SC‐Mark experiential lab game is a real‐life business environment simulation that explores complexities in advertising industry service supply chains. One hundred sixty‐one undergraduate students participated in the game at two business schools over two semesters. The effectiveness of the game was measured and analyzed, qualitatively and quantitatively, based on text analysis of the feedback received from participating students. The results revealed five themes that helped student teams understand how advertising companies integrate and improve their service supply chains—buyer‐supplier relationships, supply chain functions and operations, consumer focus and orientation, community focus, and overall risk management.</jats:p>",

By considering the Supply Hub and lateral transshipment simultaneously, ones can reduce the total cost of the supply chain system and improve the response to customer requirement and the customers’ satisfaction. We investigate the distribution policies for the supply chain which consists of multisuppliers, single Supply Hub, and multidistributors. In the system, both Supply Hub and distributors adopt the (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>,<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>) policy, Supply Hub will not be out of stock, and backlogging is forbidden. Customer requirements at distributors are assumed to be independent random variables complying with uniform distribution; transshipment is assumed to be bidirectional, instantaneous, and emergent. We establish the distribution models, respectively, for the cases of transshipment or no transshipment. For the case with transshipment, we design a GA-based solution method involving a two-stage selection technology, that is, firstly, selecting individuals from parent population to generate offspring chromosomes and, secondly, selecting individuals from the interim population comprising all of the parent and offspring genomes, to form the next-generation population. We show that lateral transshipment can increase the overall profit of the supply chain by the comparison examinations between the models with and without transshipment.</jats:p>"

The methodology is based on concepts derived from the social network theory and graph theory (namely, community detection and shortest path respectively); and also on a multi-objective optimization process by means of agent swarm optimization (ASO). A series of energy, operative, and economic criteria are optimized in this process. The core idea is to form sectors over the distribution network based on communities found using a community detection algorithm (Walktrap). The methodology is flexible and enables the technical staff in water utilities to make decisions at different stages. It has been tested by generating four feasible solutions over a portion of a real WSN.</jats:p>",

For instance, small‐scale coffee farmers sell their produce to a middleman, who in turn sells the coffee onward to an exporter, often a foreign multinational, with monopsony power in the hands of the purchasers at both levels. We analyze pricing behavior and welfare with different assumptions regarding market power. In particular, we show that a more powerful exporter is likely to benefit the producers and may even lead to higher welfare for the producer country as a whole.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information sharing in supply chains may result in concerns related to information security, information access privileges, and allocation of claimed benefits. To mitigate such concerns in order to efficiently and effectively share information, relationships among the supply chain actors need to be managed and effective governance structures need to be chosen. Despite initial research, a comprehensible supply chain analysis of the role of governance structures in information sharing is missing. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to investigate how and to what extent supply chain information sharing can be explained by supply chain governance structures. To take into account the multi-dimensionality of information sharing, the specifications of which information to share and how to share it are considered. Based on case study data from three European pork supply chains, we conclude that information sharing cannot be solely explained by governance structures. The results show that information sharing is apart from governance structures strongly determined by quality regulations, financial strength (power) of the chain partners, and the relationships that are aimed for. Consequently, our study challenges the general assumption that a more integrated governance structure is accompanied by more types of information shared through the use of automated information systems. </jats:p>",

In a supply chain system, the supplier may suffer from the product cost disruption and the retailer suffers from the demand disruption simultaneously. The purpose of this study is to design proper supply chain contracts, under which the supply chain with double sided disruption can be coordinated. Firstly, the centralized decision-making models are applied to find the optimal price and quantity under three cases as the baseline. The different cases are divided by the different relationship between the product cost disruption and the demand disruption. Secondly, two different types of contracts are introduced to coordinate the whole supply chain. One is all-unit wholesale quantity discount policy (AQDP) contract, and the other one is capacitated linear pricing policy (CLPP) contract. And it is found out that the gap between the demand disruption and the product cost disruption is the key factor to influence the supply chain coordination. Some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the models. The AQDP contracts are listed out under different cases to show how to use it under double sided disruptions.</jats:p>"

The changes in root morphology in response to major essential elements are largely documented, but little is known about how the root system responds to magnesium (Mg) availability. Thirty-six natural accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana were subjected to an in vitro screen for identifying variation in root system architecture in response to Mg availability. Response of root morphology was observed on 2-dimensional agar plates. Low Mg supply repressed the elongation of the lateral roots more than of the primary root. However, some accessions exhibited higher number and length of lateral roots than the reference Columbia-0. Across all accessions, the root morphological traits did not correlate with tissue Mg concentrations. Interestingly, shoot calcium and root phosphorus concentrations were positively correlated with the number and length of lateral roots, whereas root iron concentration was negatively correlated with the primary root length. The diversity of root phenotypes identified in this report is a useful resource to study the genetic component determining root morphology in response to Mg availability.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Potential environmental benefits have been identified for the utilization of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a feedstock for polyurethanes (PUR). CO<sub>2</sub> can be utilized in the PUR supply chain in a wide variety of ways ranging from direct CO<sub>2</sub> utilization for polyols as a PUR precursor, to indirect CO<sub>2</sub> utilization for basic chemicals in the PUR supply chain. In this paper, we present a systematic exploration and environmental evaluation of all direct and indirect CO<sub>2</sub> utilization options for flexible and rigid PUR foams. The analysis is based on an LCA-based PUR supply chain optimization model using linear programming to identify PUR production with minimal environmental impacts. The direct utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> for polyols allows for large specific impact reductions of up to 4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. and 2 kg oil-eq. per kg CO<sub>2</sub> utilized, but the amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be utilized are limited to 0.30 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg PUR. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> utilized can be increased to up to 1.7 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg PUR by indirect CO<sub>2</sub> utilization in the PUR supply chain. Indirect CO<sub>2</sub> utilization requires hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). The environmental impacts of H<sub>2</sub> production strongly affect the impact of indirect CO<sub>2</sub> utilization in PUR. To achieve optimal environmental performance under the current fossil-based H<sub>2</sub> generation, PUR production can only utilize much less CO<sub>2</sub> than theoretically possible. Thus, utilizing as much CO<sub>2</sub> in the PUR supply chain as possible is not always environmentally optimal. Clean H<sub>2</sub> production is required to exploit the full CO<sub>2</sub> utilization potential for environmental impact reduction in PUR production.</p>"

Supply chain management entails configuration, collaboration, and coordination. The company that uses only costing for creating brands without resource availability exposes its supply chain to an insufferable risk. Consequently, the company hoping to create its brand in the world market needs to be more resilient in the supply chain process and resources. A strategic and holistic approach to supply chain in collaboration with different companies will help to identify the different strategies, which can be more resilient and efficient supply chain. Supply chain management acts as branding tool and is vital for conveying branded goods to the market in optimal time and cost. The creation of a brand name is linked to management strategies, but persistence and character are possible solely by using supply chain efficiently. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Port managers need to be able to identify and prioritize port investments to take advantage of opportunities for growth. Those who serve the needs of beneficial cargo owners and shipping lines must know how to evaluate their customer service delivery efforts. Although this area has received research attention, this paper adds to the understanding by focusing on performance evaluations of ports by supply chain partners, key actors in the effectiveness of a port's service delivery. The current literature relevant to the assessment of port performance and the perspectives of this user group is reviewed. The range of port-related roles performed by supply chain partners is then examined to create context for the results. Four measures that provide general (as opposed to port-specific) indications of the relative need for attention to each criterion are identified and discussed. Finally, the statements are used to create a formative supply chain partner port assessment construct used to measure relevant criteria. Port managers can use these criteria when formulating high-quality service to their supply chain partners, which in turn will support port efforts to improve performance for cargo owners and shipping lines. </jats:p>",

We proposed that recycler make reflect for the government policy by adjusting the recycling ratio and recycling delay. We use vensim software to simulate this model and investigate how the products (parts) recyclers behavior influences the loop supply chain distribution system. The result shows that (1) when recyclers respond positively to government policies, recycling will increase the proportion of recyclers. When recyclers respond negatively to government policy making, recycling will reduce the proportion of recyclers. (2) When the recovery percentage of recyclers improves, manufacturers, Retailer 1, and Retailer 2 quantity fluctuations will reduce and the bullwhip effect will diminish. (3) When the proportion of recycled parts recyclers is lowered, manufacturers, Retailer 1, and Retailer 2 inventory fluctuation will increase and the bullwhip effect will be enhanced. (4) When recyclers recycling product delays increased, volatility manufacturers order quantity will rise, but there is little change in the amount of fluctuation of orders of the two retailers. (5) When recycling parts recyclers delay increases, fluctuations in the supplier order quantity will rise, but there is little change in the amount of fluctuation of orders of the two retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The floricultural sector is facing market developments that have forced a redesign of the European logistics network. Via workshops and interviews with key stakeholders the main developments and industry needs are identified. These are then summarised in three central themes that require further investigation, i.e. decision problems (e.g. network design and control), context factors (e.g. demand uncertainty and product perishability), and objectives (e.g. efficiency and product quality). Thereafter, 17 articles that review Supply Chain Management (SCM) research are analysed to obtain more insight into the state-of-the-art on these themes and to identify the main issues within the themes and their interrelationships. This resulted in a conceptual research framework in which particular attention is given to how decision problems could be modelled and solved in order to get quantitative insights into the impact of logistics network redesign. Successively, 71 SCM articles were analysed in depth to classify current SCM research and to determine research gaps and challenges. Results show that Floricultural SCM research challenges can be found in integrated, quality-driven and responsive network design and control using hybrid optimisation and simulation. </jats:p>",

To compare quality, quantity, and trends of food supply from 1984 to 2009 and degree of food westernization in Taiwan with Asian countries and world continents by using food balance data.<jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. We compiled data from food balance sheets of Taiwan and Food and Agriculture Organization, including five continents and three most populated countries each in Eastern, Southern, and Southeastern Asia over the period 1984–2009. Quantity of food supply per capita was referenced to Taiwan food guides. The population-weighted means of food supply from Europe, North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand continents in terms of energy and nutrient distributions, animal/plant sources, and sugar/alcohol contribution were used as indicators of westernization. Trends of food supply per capita of six food groups were plotted, and linear regression was applied to evaluate food changes.<jats:italic>Findings</jats:italic>. Taiwan’s food supply provided sufficient quantity in food energy, with the lowest cereals/roots supply and rice to wheat ratio, but the highest meat and oil supplies per capita among the 10 studied Asian countries. Taiwan food supply showed the most westernization among these countries.<jats:italic>Conclusion</jats:italic>. Food supply of Taiwan, although currently sufficient, indicated some security problems and high tendency of diet westernization.</jats:p>"

It is assumed that the shipment lot size of each delivery is unequal and variable. The buyer inspects all received products and returns defective items to vendor for reworking process. Because of this policy, end customers will only obtain nondefective items. The analytical optimization is considered to obtain the optimum solution of the model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnesium (Mg) is an essential mineral micronutrient in humans. Risks of dietary Mg deficiency are affected by the quantity of Mg ingested and its bioavailability, which is influenced by the consumption of other nutrients and ‘anti-nutrients’. Here, we assess global dietary Mg supplies and risks of dietary deficiency, including the influence of other nutrients. Food supply and food composition data were used to derive the amount of Mg available per capita at national levels. Supplies of Mg were compared with estimated national per capita average requirement ‘cut points’. In 2011, global weighted mean Mg supply was 613 ± 69 mg person–1 day–1 compared with a weighted estimated average requirement for Mg of 173 mg person–1 day–1. This indicates a low risk of dietary Mg deficiency of 0.26% based on supply. This contrasts with published data from national individual-level dietary surveys, which indicate greater Mg deficiency risks. However, individuals in high-income countries are likely to under-report food consumption, which could lead to overestimation of deficiency risks. Furthermore, estimates of deficiency risk based on supply do not account for potential inhibitors of Mg absorption, including calcium, phytic acid and oxalate, and do not consider household food wastage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nThis study assessed whether more potassium (K) was required for optimal growth and grain yield of cereal crops under drought and salinity than under non-stressed conditions. In 2011, three experiments on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with four K rates (0, 20, 40, 80 kg K/ha), four application times (0, 5, 10, 15 weeks after sowing, WAS) and two sources (KCl, K2SO4) were conducted in the central and southern grainbelts of Western Australia. The lack of plant response to K supply at the sites of Bolgart (36 mg K/kg at 0–30 cm) and Borden (25 mg K/kg at 0–30 cm), compared with significant gain in K uptake, dry matter and grain yield at Dowerin (29 mg K/kg at 0–30 cm), was not explained by differences in soil K levels. However, rain fell regularly through the growing season at Bolgart and Borden, whereas a dry spell occurred from stem elongation to grain development at Dowerin. The effectiveness of K application time followed the trend of 0, 5 &gt; 10 &gt; 15 WAS. In 2012, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown on a moderately saline (saturation extract electrical conductivity ~4 dS/m) and low K (20 mg K/kg) farm in the central grainbelt and treated with 0, 20, 40 and 120 kg K/ha. Applying K increased K uptake but decreased Na uptake, especially at 120 kg K/ha. Plant growth and grain yield increased with K supply, but the difference between the K rates was relatively small, indicating possible partial K substitution by Na. Higher than normal fertiliser K supply on low K soils would enhance the adaptation by cereals to water-limited environments, but K-fertiliser management on moderately saline soils may need to account for both K and Na uptake and use by the crops.\n</jats:p>"

During such delayed period, the buyer is entitled to keep the products without having to pay the sale price. However, the vendor usually hopes to receive full payment as soon as possible, especially when the transaction involves valuable items; yet, the buyer would offer a higher purchasing price in exchange of a longer postponement. Therefore, we assumed such permissible delayed period is dependent on the purchasing price. As for the manufacturing side, defective products are inevitable from time to time, and not all of those defective products can be repaired. Hence, we would like to add defective production and repair rate to our proposed model and discuss how these factors may affect profits. In addition, holding cost, ordering cost, and transportation cost will also be considered as we develop the integrated inventory model with price-dependent payment period under the possible condition of defective products. We would like to find the maximum of the joint expected total profit for our model and come up with a suitable inventory policy accordingly. In the end, we have also provided a numerical example to clearly illustrate possible solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The amount of woody biomass available for biofuel production depends on tree growth rate, harvesting techniques, harvest cost, government policies, and established traditions within the industry. Comparing estimates of biomass availability across studies is difficult because of different methodologies for estimating biomass supply, compounded by inconsistent and often unspecified assumptions. Studies differ in their definition of biomass (i.e., tree size, parts of tree) and consideration of ecological and economic factors (i.e., harvest productivity and costs, competing demand, compliance with existing regulations). In particular, existing restrictions on bio-mass harvesting for biofuels under the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard often are not included. Additionally, because most biomass availability studies ignore current biomass uses, an overestimation of available bio-mass for future uses results. Presented are new estimates for the amount of economically available biomass in Maine, taking into consideration both economic (integrated harvesting for pulp and precommercial thinning) and ecological factors. It is found that biomass availability varies greatly, depending on the relative location of the biorefinery, biomass harvesting site, and existing wood consumers (e.g., pulp mill). Indeed, harvesting and transporting woody biomass without an existing use for the high-value forest products (saw logs and pulp) probably makes woody biomass for energy production uneconomical. This finding is contrary to some existing studies and suggests that economic consideration needs greater emphasis in estimating biomass availability for biofuels. </jats:p>",

Since that time little progress has been made towards addressing this constraint with the ongoing decline of native vegetation communities, especially since 2000, further challenging seed supply. We provide examples of the size of this demand for seed, as well as major issues associated with seed sourcing. We also discuss how invoking the concept of market forces to drive seed supply and demand is inappropriate and highlight the need for an industry body to oversee seed collection and utilisation standards. We further propose key actions that are required to secure the seed supply chain within the next 20 years to meet existing and future restoration targets. We argue that concerted, coordinated action at Commonwealth, State and regional levels are required to underpin effective future restoration outcomes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product recall gains considerable importance in recent times; the reason may be the huge losses faced by manufacturers because of product recall issues. Furthermore, the revenue of the firm is immensely affected as a result of product recall, which may lead to serious outcomes. Huge recall cost (such as repairing or destroying the recalled products and cost of notification) occurs as a result of large recall. Therefore, in order to minimize the quantity and probability of recalls the traceability systems are widely used and considered as a necessary part of product safety strategies. However, from literature it is clear that manufacturers are still struggling to obtain the significant results. This study helps the managers to understand the importance of recall cost by analysing its impact on shareholders profit. Keeping in view the importance of problem, the paper proposed an integrated optimization model to minimize the expected loss to shareholders in recall crisis using batch dispersion methodology. The analysed results show that reduction in traceability level increases the expected shareholders losses while decreasing the operational costs. This will help managers to optimally set the production batch sizes in order to reduce the product recall impact.</jats:p>"

This approach involves both the demand side—data about items being sold, inventories, order, and receipt of goods—and the supply side—data about available capacities for packing, shipping, and transporting freight. Dynamic, reliable, and relevant information and data are essential to improving the whole freight transportation process through such factors as security information (e.g., theft, tampering), location and condition of cargo (e.g., temperature variations, humidity), and routing optimization. Technologies that make this information available to enterprises have several benefits, including the financial advantages of more efficient management of stock and supply chain operations. This paper identi-fies and quantifies these benefits according to research results based on the monitoring specific supply chains through the development and use of container monitoring devices. This quantification of benefits is possible because of specific practical tests and experience gained through field research at enterprises that apply the systems and through participation in international research projects funded under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme. </jats:p>",

Under deregulation, there are several players in electrical market: generation companies, power suppliers, transmission service providers, and consumers. Each player in this model tries to maximize its own profit and competes with others in a noncooperative manner. The Nash equilibrium conditions of these players in this model form a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem (VIP). By solving this VIP via an extragradient method based on an interior point algorithm, the optimal carbon taxes of power plants can be determined.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Human water use has significantly increased during the recent past. Water withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources have altered terrestrial discharge and storage, with large variability in time and space. These withdrawals are driven by sectoral demands for water, but are commonly subject to supply constraints, which determine water allocation. Water supply and allocation, therefore, should be considered together with water demand and appropriately included in Earth system models to address various large-scale effects with or without considering possible climate interactions. In a companion paper, we review the modeling of demand in large-scale models. Here, we review the algorithms developed to represent the elements of water supply and allocation in land surface and global hydrologic models. We note that some potentially important online implications, such as the effects of large reservoirs on land–atmospheric feedbacks, have not yet been fully investigated. Regarding offline implications, we find that there are important elements, such as groundwater availability and withdrawals, and the representation of large reservoirs, which should be improved. We identify major sources of uncertainty in current simulations due to limitations in data support, water allocation algorithms, host large-scale models as well as propagation of various biases across the integrated modeling system. Considering these findings with those highlighted in our companion paper, we note that advancements in computation and coupling techniques as well as improvements in natural and anthropogenic process representation and parameterization in host large-scale models, in conjunction with remote sensing and data assimilation can facilitate inclusion of water resource management at larger scales. Nonetheless, various modeling options should be carefully considered, diagnosed and intercompared. We propose a modular framework to develop integrated models based on multiple hypotheses for data support, water resource management algorithms and host models in a unified uncertainty assessment framework. A key to this development is the availability of regional-scale data for model development, diagnosis and validation. We argue that the time is right for a global initiative, based on regional case studies, to move this agenda forward.\n                    </jats:p>"

The LINGO software is used to solve the model for some problem cases. The study conducts various numerical experiments to illustrate the applicability of the developed model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For an online-shopping company, whether it can provide its customers with customized service is the key to enhance its customers’ experience value and its own competence. A good customized service requires effective integration and reasonable allocation of the company’s supply chain resources running in the background. Based on the analysis of the allocation of supply chain resources in the customized online shopping service mode and its operational characteristics, this paper puts forward an optimization model for the resource allocation and builds an improved ant algorithm to solve it. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization method and algorithm are demonstrated by a numerical simulation. This paper finds that the special online shopping environments lead to many dynamic and uncertain characters of the service demands. Different customized service patterns and their combination patterns should match with different supply chain resource allocations. The optimization model not only reflects the required service cost and delivery time in the objective function, but also considers the service scale effect optimization and the relations of integration benefits and risks. The improved ant algorithm has obvious advantages in flexibly balancing the multiobjective optimizations, adjusting the convergence speed, and adjusting the operation parameters.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer has three commonality strategies for the high-end and low-end products: common high-quality component, common low-quality component, and dedicated components. We consider both wholesale price first scenario and commonality strategy first scenario. Under the wholesale price first scenario, we identify the range of each commonality strategy and find that (i) the common low-quality component strategy is harmful to the supplier; (ii) if the quality of low-quality component and the unit production cost of high-quality component are sufficiently low, the supplier induces the common high-quality component strategy by strategically decreasing the unit wholesale price of high-quality component, while if they are sufficiently high, the supplier induces the dedicated components strategy by increasing the unit wholesale price of high-quality component and decreasing that of low-quality one. Under the commonality strategy first scenario, the common low-quality component strategy may exist. By comparing the two scenarios, we find that (i) if the unit production cost of low-quality component is medium, the equilibrium outcomes under both scenarios are identical; (ii) there exists a first-mover advantage for the two players.</jats:p>"

Previous analyses of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> genotypes separated by centuries of evolution in a lake using methods in resurrection ecology revealed striking genetic and phenotypic shifts that were highly correlated with anthropogenic environmental change, specifically phosphorus (P)‐driven nutrient enrichment (i.e. eutrophication). Here, we compared the transcriptomes of two ancient (~700‐year‐old) and two modern (~10‐year‐old) genotypes in historic (low P) and contemporary (high P) environmental conditions using microarrays. We found considerable transcriptomic variation between ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’ genotypes in both treatments, with stressful (low P) conditions eliciting differential expression (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DE</jats:styled-content>) of a larger number of genes. Further, more genes were <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DE</jats:styled-content> between ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’ genotypes than within these groups. Expression patterns of individual genes differed greatly among genotypes, suggesting that different transcriptomic responses can result in similar phenotypes. While this confounded patterns between ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’ genotypes at the gene level, patterns were discernible at the functional level: annotation of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DE</jats:styled-content> genes revealed particular enrichment of genes involved in metabolic pathways in response to P‐treatments. Analyses of gene families suggested significant <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DE</jats:styled-content> in pathways already known to be important in dealing with P‐limitation in <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> as well as in other organisms. Such observations on genotypes of a single natural population, separated by hundreds of years of evolution in contrasting environmental conditions before and during anthropogenic environmental changes, highlight the important role of transcriptional mechanisms in the evolutionary responses of populations.</jats:p>",

Then, it was assumed that the demand process complied with mutually independent compound Poisson process. Based on this assumption, an optimization model for inventory control of circulation enterprises was established with the goal of minimizing the average total costs in unit time of inventory system. In addition, the optimal computing algorithm for inventory costs was presented. Meanwhile, taking the agricultural enterprises in Aksu, Xinjiang, China, for example, the researchers conducted numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis. Through constantly adjusting and modifying the parameters values in model, the optimal stock and the optimal inventory costs were obtained. Therein, the numerical results showed that the uncertainty of lead time greatly influenced the optimal inventory strategy. Besides, it was demonstrated that the research results provided a valuable reference for the agricultural enterprises in terms of optimal management for inventory system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past several decades, road space and curb space have become increasingly scarce in urban areas. Commercial vehicles are then forced to compete with passenger vehicles for this limited space; this situation leads to an increase in illegal commercial vehicle parking. Increased commercial vehicle parking causes increased congestion, reduced safety for other road users, and an increase in the cost of final goods and services. For appropriate policies to be selected to address this problem, the relationships between illegal commercial vehicle parking and the built environment must be better understood. This research aimed to quantify the relationships of illegal commercial vehicle parking, parking supply, and parking demand through the estimation of a distance-decay-weighted regression model. Data on commercial vehicle parking citations from 2012 for the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, are presented. This information was used together with employment data and a parking inventory to estimate the number of tickets issued by address. A distance-decay-weighted method was applied in an attempt to capture the spatial relationships between these variables. Results of this model showed that off-street parking facilities, such as loading bays, surface lots, and parking garages, were related to lower rates of illegal commercial vehicle parking, whereas higher business densities and the restriction of existing on-street parking spaces were related to increased illegal commercial vehicle parking. These results suggest that policies encouraging the creation of off-street loading facilities for commercial vehicles and making off-street parking more attractive for passenger vehicles may help reduce the incidence of illegal commercial vehicle parking. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the booming natural gas trade, liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers—the primary transportation method for intercontinental trade on natural gas—have been experiencing enormous growth. This study offers a novel analysis that connects 2011's in-use LNG fleet characteristics, global satellite data on ship movement, and literature on LNG trade to assess the long-term prospects for increasing the energy efficiency of LNG carriers. This analysis also investigates how efficiency characteristics (such as age, size, technology, and operational practices) influence the efficiency of the LNG fleet and develops a ship stock model to independently track technical and operational efficiency practices in LNG carriers. The findings indicate that industry-leading LNG carriers are about 40% more efficient than industry laggards. This analysis indicates that by fully embracing the available technical and in-use practices of the low-carbon industry leaders of today, the fleet could reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions by 30 million metric tons by 2040—about 8 million metric tons of natural gas, equivalent to $4 billion savings in the LNG supply chain. This study has important implications for the shipping industry and policy makers. The industry has to address split incentives to take advantage of energy-saving opportunities. Regulations that set targets for the energy efficiency of the in-use fleet may ultimately help the industry harvest the efficiency gains while mitigating climate impact from the industry. </jats:p>",

Despite a significant body of research on private vehicle reliability, little attention has been paid to bus travel time reliability at the stop-to-stop link level on different types of roads. This study aims to identify and quantify the underlying determinants of bus travel time reliability on links of different road types with the use of supply and demand data from automatic vehicle location and smart card systems collected in Brisbane, Australia. Three general bus-related models were developed with respect to the main concerns of travelers and planners: average travel time, buffer time, and coefficient of variation of travel time. Five groups of alternative models were developed to account for variations caused by different road types, including arterial road, motorway, busway, and central business district. Seemingly unrelated regression equations estimation were applied to account for cross-equation correlations across regression models in each group. Three main categories of unreliability contributory factors were identified and tested in this study, namely, planning, operational, and environmental. Model results provided insights into these factors that affect bus travel time and its variability. The most important predictors were found to be the recurrent congestion index, traffic signals, and passenger demand at stops. Results could be used to target specific strategies aimed at reducing unreliability on different types of roads. </jats:p>",

Hypotheses trying to explain why birds join a colony usually assume that food is not limited, whereas those explaining variation in colony size suggest that food is under constraint. In this study, we investigate the composition and amount of food items not eaten by the nestlings and found in nest burrows of colonially nesting European bee‐eaters (<jats:italic>Merops apiaster</jats:italic>). We aimed to determine whether this unconsumed food is an indicator of unlimited food supply, the result of mistakes during food transfer between parents and chicks or foraging selectivity of chicks. Therefore, we investigated the amount of dropped food for each nest in relation to reproductive performance and parameters reflecting parental quality. Our data suggest that parents carry more food to the nest than chicks can eat and, hence, food is not limited. This assumption is supported by the facts that there is a positive relationship between dropped food found in a nest and the number of fledglings, nestling age, and chick health condition and that the amount of dropped food is independent of colony size. There is variation in the amount of dropped food within colonies, suggesting that parent foraging efficiency may also be an important determinant. Pairs nesting in the center of a colony performed better than those nesting on the edge, which supports the assumption that quality differences between parents are important as well. However, dropped food cannot be used as an indicator of local food availability as (1) within‐colony variation in dropped food is larger than between colony variation and, (2) the average amount of dropped food is not related to colony size.</jats:p>",

Leaf blade elongation rate (LER), leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N) in the expanding leaf blade (ELB, sink) and photosynthesis (A) and C and N status in the last fully expanded leaf blade (LFELB, source) were measured. Plants were grown at ambient [CO2] (~384µmolmol–1) and elevated [CO2] (~550µmolmol–1) in the Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment facility. Elevated [CO2] increased leaf area and total dry mass production, respectively, by 42 and 53% for Yitpi compared with 2 and 13% for H45. Elevated [CO2] also stimulated the LER by 36% for Yitpi compared with 5% for H45. Yitpi showed a 99% increase in A at elevated [CO2] but no A stimulation was found for H45. There was a strong correlation (r2=0.807) between LER of the ELB and soluble carbohydrate concentration in LFELB. In ELB, the highest spatial N concentration was observed in the cell division zone, where N concentrations were 67.3 and 60.6mg g–1 for Yitpi compared with 51.1 and 39.2mg g–1 for H45 at ambient and elevated [CO2]. In contrast, C concentration increased only in the cell division and cell expansion zone of the ELB of Yitpi. These findings suggest that C supply from the source (LFELB) is cultivar dependent and well correlated with LER, leaf area expansion and whole-plant growth response to elevated [CO2].\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Gasoline price increases since 1999 have generated substantial discussion about their effect on travel behavior. With panel data for 10 selected U.S. urbanized areas between 2002 and 2011, this study analyzed the effects of gasoline prices and three factors that were internal to transit agencies—fare, service supply, and service frequency—on ridership of bus, light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail, as well as their aggregate ridership. Improving on past studies on the subject, this study accounted for the simultaneous relationship between service supply and ridership and controlled for factors that were external to transit agencies' control but might have influenced ridership. With fixed-effects models that examined temporal changes within each urbanized area, the analysis found that the possibility of simultaneity was low. The results of estimated coefficients showed that the short-term increase in ridership due to gasoline price increases was relatively small for bus and aggregate transit and marginal for rails, certainly smaller than the effects of the three internal factors. The total influence of the three internal factors was found to be more substantial than that of external factors; this finding indicated the potential to increase ridership by transit agencies' efforts when resources were available. In addition, it is recommended that transit agencies prepare for a ridership increase more for bus than for rail because of gasoline prices, considering that even a small increase could require a substantial service increase to accommodate travelers' needs during peak periods. </jats:p>",

The main difference between these two systems is that, in a branched network system, the flow within each pipe is a known value, whereas in a looped network system, the flow in each pipe is considered an unknown value. Therefore, an analysis of a looped network system is a more complex task. This study aims to develop a technique for estimating the optimal pipe diameter for a looped agricultural irrigation water supply system using a harmony search algorithm, which is an optimization technique. This study mainly serves two purposes. The first is to develop an algorithm and a program for estimating a cost‐effective pipe diameter for agricultural irrigation water supply systems using optimization techniques. The second is to validate the developed program by applying the proposed optimized cost‐effective pipe diameter to an actual study region (Saemangeum project area, zone 6). The results suggest that the optimal design program, which applies an optimization theory and enhances user convenience, can be effectively applied for the real systems of a looped agricultural irrigation water supply.</jats:p>",

Some significant conclusions are obtained. Firstly, supply chain control power does have great impact on the supply chain profits. The profit of the whole supply chain with centralized decision-making is higher than those of the other three modes, while the overall profit of supply chain with decentralized decision-making is superior to the profit when retailer and manufacturer dominate the supply chain together. Secondly, with decentralized decision-making, for manufacturer and retailer, it is beneficial to gain the control powers of the supply chain; however, control power has an optimal value, not the bigger, the better. Thirdly, under certain circumstances, order quantity will increase and the wholesale price will decrease when control power is transferred from manufacturer to retailer. In this case, the total profit of supply chain dominated by retailer will be greater than that dominated by manufacturer.</jats:p>"

The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of immune system activation on N retention and AA metabolism in growing pigs, depending on dietary protein supply. A total of sixteen barrows received an adequate (Ad) or restricted (Res) amount of dietary protein, and were challenged at day 0 with intravenous complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). At days − 5, 3 and 8, an irreversible loss rate (ILR) of eight AA was determined. CFA successfully activated the immune system, as indicated by a 2- to 4-fold increase in serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins (APP). Pre-challenge C-reactive protein concentrations were lower (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·05) and pre- and post-challenge albumin tended to be lower in Res-pigs. These findings indicate that a restricted protein supply can limit the acute-phase response. CFA increased urinary N losses (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0·04) and tended to reduce N retention in Ad-pigs, but not in Res-pigs (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0·07). The ILR for Val was lower (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0·05) at day 8 than at day 3 in the post-challenge period. The ILR of most AA, except for Trp, were strongly affected by dietary protein supply and positively correlated with N retention.

Additionally, salinity improved fruit nutritional value, with higher contents of antioxidants compounds (first sampling). During first and second samplings, strawberries grown under N reduction and non‐saline conditions showed higher values for firmness compared to fruits developed under other treatments. Regarding health‐related compounds, few differences were found except for total polyphenols concentration and antioxidant activity for the first sampling, where strawberries grown under saline treatments obtained the highest values for both parameters.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title><jats:p>The use of low‐quality waters, such as those found in Almeria (salinity, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N9S</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N5S</jats:styled-content>) and low nitrogen inputs (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N5</jats:styled-content>, avoid environmental impact) for strawberry cultivation does not exert a negative impact on overall quality.

These problems include the effectiveness of the quality and safety efforts, the profits, the effect of the losses that the food safety incidents caused on the quality efforts’ efficacy, and the social welfare comparison. Meanwhile, we constructed evolutionary game model to analyze the macro and micro factors that influenced the cooperation strategy and demonstrated the effect of diversity of decision-making parameters on evolution results based on numerical simulation. By the theoretical and simulation analysis, we found that (1) the quality efforts’ efficacy, the profits, the sensitivity coefficient of the quality efforts efficiency to the losses, and the social welfare without thinking about the externality all met their maximum under the full cooperation situation; (2) strengthening supervision over the source of the food supply chain can reduce the probability of food safety incidents; (3) macro and micro environment will be the important basis for companies’ decision-making on cooperation strategy in the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

We consider a two-echelon supply chain with one manufacturer and one dominant retailer. The retailer has a physical store in a monopolist market. Depending on whether the Internet stores are opened successfully by them, we firstly obtain equilibrium prices and profits under four possible supply chain structures. Secondly, we identify several strategic conditions when it is optimal to open an Internet store for the manufacturer and dominant retailer and discuss its implications. It is interesting to note that multichannel retailing is not necessarily the best strategy for the dominant retailer. In addition, we investigate the impacts of problem parameters (the dominant retailer’s bargaining power and consumers’ disutility of purchasing a product from Internet store) on the manufacturer and dominant retailer’s pricing policies. We find that the manufacturer’s optimal price at her Internet store is not always being lower than the dominant retailer’s. Finally, we conduct numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical results.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we consider an integrated production and distribution batch scheduling problem on a single machine for the orders with a short lifespan, because it may be cheaper or faster to process and distribute orders in a batch than to process and distribute them individually. Assume that the orders have the identical processing time and come from the same location, and the batch setup time is a constant. The problem is to choose the number of batches and batch sizes to minimize the total delivery time without violating the order lifespan. We first give a backward dynamic programming algorithm, but it is not an actually polynomial-time algorithm. Then we propose a constant time partial dynamic programming algorithm by doing further research into the recursion formula in the algorithm. Further, using the difference characteristics of the optimal value function, a specific calculating formula to solve the problem with the setup time being integer times of the processing time is obtained.</jats:p>"

Complex network theories made a rapid progress in recent years, but the classical models such as BA model and WS model can not resolve the widespread problems of manufacturing supply chain, such as the repeated attachment of edge and fixed number of vertices, but edges increased with preferential connectivity, and flexible edges’ probability. A core model is proposed to resolve the problem in the paper: it maps the parts supply relationship as a repeatable core; a vertex’s probability distribution function integrating the edge’s rate and vertex’s degree is put forward; some simulations, such as the growth of core, the degree distribution characteristics, and the impacting of parameter, are carried out in our experiments, and the case study is set also. The paper proposed a novel model to analyze the manufacturing supply chain system from the insights of complex network.</jats:p>"

Supply routes are typically in the wilderness where the route conditions change over time. This paper proposes a power‐saving algorithm allowing supply troops to collect route information using wireless sensor network technology. Each member in the marching supply troop is equipped with a battery‐powered sensor. To save power consumption, the proposed methods schedule the sleeping period for each member according to the size of the marching supply troop and its moving velocity. Two data carrying methods are proposed to reduce the frequency of long‐distance data uploading. The first method allows the uploaded data to be carried within a single‐round data collection period, and the second method extends the data carrying period to multiple rounds. The simulation results show that scheduling a sleep period can prolong the sensing distance along the route. These two proposed methods can add an additional 18–70% in distance data over methods without scheduling a sleep period. The energy spent on long‐distance data transmissions can be improved by 7–25%.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Vivaldi antennas have wide applications in practice due to the ultra-wide band properties; however, their gain and directivity are relatively low. In this paper, a new method is presented to improve the gain and directivity of Vivaldi antennas in a broad band using split-ring resonator (SRR). Based on the peculiar electromagnetic properties of SRR, a novel high-gain SRR-Vivaldi end-fire antenna in C and X bands is designed and fabricated. The size of the antenna is only 0.33λ ×0.33λ ×0.013λ, a significant miniaturization. Equivalent analysis method has been adopted to study the resonance characteristic of an SRR structure. By adding the SRR structures the singular metamaterials in the front of the Vivaldi antenna have an exponential taper slot, and the SRR structures can play a role as a director which has the ability to enhance the antenna's directivity so that the surface currents will focus on the end-fire direction. The SRR structures have been analyzed, designed, and fabricated, which can be embedded into the original Vivaldi antenna smoothly and compactly. As a result, the gain of the SRR-Vivaldi antenna are enhanced effectively, while the size and bandwidth of the original antenna can be kept, with the reflection coeffcient less than -10 dB from 4 to 13.6 GHz after using SRR. The novel Vivaldi antenna based on the SRR has good features of high gain, high directivity, low return loss and low cross-polarization. Compared to the original Vivaldi antenna, the simulation and measured results demonstrate that the gain of the novel SRR-Vivaldi antenna in C band has been increased by an average value of 75.44% and the half-power beam width has been decreased by 20 degrees in xoy and xoz planes. Meanwhile, the gain has been increased by an average value of 24.46% in X band and the half-power beam width has been decreased by 25 degrees in xoz plane. Testing result of the fabricated antenna demonstrates the reliability of the design. A good agreement between simulations and measurements is obtained. The design owns the merits of low cost, simple design and ease in fabrication and conformation, thus provides a new idea for end-fire antenna gain and directivity improvement. The new antenna has great potentials in applications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, the first oligopolistic competition model of the closed-loop supply chain network involving uncertain demand and return has been established. This model belongs to the context of oligopolistic firms that compete noncooperatively in a Cournot-Nash framework. In this paper, we modify the above model in two different directions. (i) For each returned product from demand market to firm in the reverse logistics, we calculate the percentage of its optimal product flows in each individual path connecting the demand market to the firm. This modification provides the optimal product flow routings for each product in the supply chain and increases the optimal profit of each firm at the Cournot-Nash equilibrium. (ii) Our model extends the method of finding the Cournot-Nash equilibrium involving smooth objective functions to problems involving nondifferentiable objective functions. This modification caters for more real-life applications as a lot of supply chain problems involve nonsmooth functions. Existence of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium is established without the assumption of differentiability of the given functions. Intelligent algorithms, such as the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the genetic algorithm, are applied to find the Cournot-Nash equilibrium for such nonsmooth problems. Numerical examples are solved to illustrate the efficiency of these algorithms.</jats:p>"

When South Zarghun gas fields were discovered in Pakistan, gas transmission pipeline laying process between gas fields and Quetta city was as challenging task for the Government of Pakistan. Very rough terrain and extreme weather conditions especially in winter season were the two major constraints for the alignment of pipeline. Geomatics survey was essential before transmission pipeline construction work, done twice by private consultant in Pakistan’s local geographic coordinate system. SSGC took decision in 2006 for the construction of pipeline but unfortunately it could not be executed due to law &amp; order situation in Pakistan especially in Balochistan province and later all bench marks of pipeline alignment route were vanished by the locals. In 2012, SSGC again started pipeline construction work on war steps. Previous pipeline alignment survey was converted into existing SSGC’s GIS coordinate system i.e. UTM Zone 42 WGS84 using ESRI ArcGIS software. Identification &amp; re-installation of all bench marks and re-routing of pipeline were done by SSGC GIS survey team with the help of global positioning system (GPS) and satellite data. Finally, right of way (ROW) of transmission pipeline from Zarghun gas fields to Quetta city was designed and produced in the form of GIS map for pipeline construction activities.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management is another key component of the strategy as being adopted by an increasing number of companies. There are many interactions between electronic market and supply chain. One of the key questions is to select one type of electronic market from the view of supply chain. This paper develops some models to explore the issue of selection between public electronic market and private electronic market in three scenarios where electronic market is used for buying, for selling, and for both selling and buying, respectively. In a public electronic market, neither the supplier nor the retailer is the owner of the electronic market. However, in a private electronic market, there is an owner that is either the supplier or the retailer. Besides demand uncertainty, we take into account the price uncertainty in electronic market. We explore the conditions under which the agent of supply chain selects one certain type of electronic market by comparing expected profits of supply chain members in different scenarios. Some sensitivity analyses are conducted to explore the impact of the customer demand, electronic market retail price, and e-market use fee on the selection of electronic market. Finally, some interesting managerial and academic insights are obtained.</jats:p>"

Yet, the traditional techniques for identifying CSCs have strong theoretical antecedents, but seem to have little traction in the field. We believe this is because the standard techniques fail to capture evolution over time, nor provide useful intervention measures to reach goals. To address these problems, we introduce an agent-based modeling approach to evaluate CSCs. Taking collaborative procurement as research object, our approach is composed of three parts: model construction, model instantiation, and computational experiment. We use the approach to explore the service charging policy problem in collaborative procurement. Three kinds of service charging polices are compared in the same experiment environment. Finally, “Fixed Cost” is identified as the optimal policy under the stable market environment. The case study can help us to understand the workflow of applying the approach, and provide valuable decision support applications to industry.</jats:p>"

However, studies related to service supply chains with mass customization (MC) are lacking. Considering the equity of benefit distribution between the members of service supply chains, in this paper, we designed two revenue-sharing contracts. The first contract for the maximum equity of a single logistics service integrator (LSI) and single functional logistics service provider (FLSP) in a two-echelon logistics service supply chain was designed by introducing the fair entropy function (“one to one” model). Furthermore, the method is extended to a more complex supply chain, which consists of a single LSI and multiple FLSPs. A new contract was designed not only for considering the equity of an LSI and each FLSP but also for the equity between each FLSP (“one to<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>” model).

When biomass prices are raised exogenously, we find that the subregional models overestimate the supply, the land use, and the beneficial environmental aspects of perennial biomass crops. Multi‐market price feedbacks tied to realistic policy parameters predict high threshold absolute prices for biomass to enter production, resulting in intensified production of biomass from annual grain crops with damaging environmental impacts. Multi‐market feedbacks also predict regional specialization in energy biomass production in areas with lower yields of food crops. Policies promoting biofuels will not necessarily generate environmental benefits in the absence of environmental regulations.</jats:p>",

In the model, two adjustment parameters are adopted to describe individual differences in decision makers. The simulation result demonstrates that the behavioral adjustment with different extent results in different supply chain performance. The impact of two parameters is very different.

A two-dimensional (2D) fault model is first proposed based on collaborative analysis of supply current and output voltage. This model is a family of circle loci on the complex plane, and it simplifies greatly the algorithms for test point selection and potential fault simulations, which are primary difficulties in fault diagnosis of analog circuits. Furthermore, in order to reduce the difficulty of fault location, an improved fault model in three-dimensional (3D) complex space is proposed, which achieves a far better fault detection ratio (FDR) against measurement error and parametric tolerance. To address the problem of fault masking in both 2D and 3D fault models, this paper proposes an effective design for testability (DFT) method. By adding redundant bypassing-components in the circuit under test (CUT), this method achieves excellent fault isolation ratio (FIR) in ambiguity group isolation. The efficacy of the proposed model and testing method is validated through experimental results provided in this paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper tries to add the network structure factors of agile supply chain network into agility evaluation. The paper firstly presents three concepts including node strength centrality, betweenness centrality, and network centrality. They are used to calculate the weight of node enterprises in the agile supply chain network. And then, a series of agility indicators are designed to evaluate agility of agile supply chain network. AHP is used to calculate the weight of the indicators. Next, these indicators are used to get initial agility evaluation matrix by means of Delphi method, Data Mining, and so forth. Then FCE is used to calculate the membership degree on agility of node enterprises by combining the evaluation matrix with the weight of indicators. Last, the evaluation result of comprehensive agility of agile supply chain network is calculated on the basis of considering the weight of node enterprises. This method can reflect the effect which the network structure of supply chain network makes on the agility of the supply chain network. It is a complement to the current evaluation methods of agility.</jats:p>"

Simultaneously, we work out the boundaries of ordering quantity and production quantity, which simplify the computation. Furthermore, numerical examples are presented to test the feasibility of the model. The results show that assuming the unit cost of compressing lead time in accordance with exponential distribution is realistic. It also notices that the optimal order and production decision for fashion supply chains are constrained obviously by the service level and safety factors. What is more, the holding cost rate of both the service level and safety factors has a certain influence on it.

The impact of network structure and collaboration on the dynamics and robustness of supply chain network, however, remains to be explored. In this paper, a unified state space model for a two-layer supply chain network composed of multiple distributors and multiple retailers is developed. A robust control algorithm is advocated to reduce both order and demand fluctuations for unknown demand. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the robust control approach has the advantage to reduce both inventory and order fluctuations. In the simulation experiment, it is interesting to notice that complex network structure and collaborations might contribute to the reduction of inventory and order oscillations. This paper yields new insights into the overestimated bullwhip effect problem and helps us understand the complexities of supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

We derive the risk-neutral buyer’s optimal order policy and the loss-averse supplier’s optimal production policy under shortage-penalty-surplus-subsidy (SPSS) contracts. We also analyze the impacts of loss aversion on the loss-averse supplier’s production decision making and find that the loss-averse supplier may produce less than, equal to, or more than the risk-neutral supplier. Then, we provide explicit conditions on which the random yield supply chain with a loss-averse supplier can be coordinated under SPSS contracts. Finally, adopting numerical examples, we find that when the shortage penalty is low, the buyer’s optimal order quantity will increase, while the supplier’s optimal production quantity will first decrease and then increase as the loss aversion level increases. When the shortage penalty is high, the buyer’s optimal order quantity will decrease but the supplier’s optimal production quantity will always increase as the loss aversion level increases. Furthermore, the numerical examples provide strong evidence for the view that SPSS contracts can effectively improve the performance of the whole supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we focus our discussion on price increase and demand contraction caused by inflation, integrate the effect of inflation and option contracts within the model framework, and analyze how to use option contracts to achieve supply chain coordination under inflation scenarios. We consider a one-period two-stage supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer and explore the effect of inflation on the optimal ordering and production decisions under three different types of contracts: wholesale price contracts, option contracts, and portfolio contracts. Moreover, we explore the impact of option contracts on the supply chain through using wholesale price contracts model as the benchmark. We find that the retailer prefers adopting portfolio contracts, but the supplier prefers providing option contracts under inflation scenarios. Ultimately, option contracts will be implemented owing to the supplier’s market dominant position. In addition, we discuss the supply chain bilateral coordination mechanism with option contracts from the perspectives of two members and derive that option contracts can coordinate the supply chain and achieve Pareto improvement under inflation scenarios.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>R&amp;D outsourcing becomes the often-adopted strategy for firms to innovate. However, R&amp;D cooperation often ends up with failure because of its inherent quality of instability. One of the main reasons for cooperation failure is the opportunistic behavior. As the R&amp;D contract between firms is inherently incomplete, opportunistic behavior always cannot be avoided in the collaborative process. R&amp;D cooperation has been divided into horizontal and vertical types. This paper utilizes game theory to study opportunistic behavior in the vertical R&amp;D cooperation and analyzes the equilibrium of the cooperation. Based on the equilibrium and numerical results, it is found that the vertical R&amp;D cooperation is inherently unstable, and the downstream firm is more likely to break the agreement. The level of knowledge spillovers and the cost of R&amp;D efforts have different effects on firms’ payoffs. When the level of knowledge spillover is low or the cost of R&amp;D efforts is high, mechanisms such as punishment for opportunism may be more effective to guarantee the stability of cooperation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of market competition, company faces more and more pressures. Meanwhile, procurement has a vital effect on achieving competitive advantages in a supply chain. Selecting the appropriate suppliers is one of the most important sections in purchase management. However, in real situation, supplier selection is a multiple objective problem about different items with vagueness and randomness of the data. It is very complex. Hence, research about supplier selection is relatively scarce under considering multiple items, discount price, and fuzzy and stochastic information. In our paper, we develop a fuzzy multiobjective supplier selection model for overcoming uncertainty and multiple items. Stochastic demand, fuzzy objectives, and weights are simultaneously applied to help the managers to select the suitable suppliers about different items. For illustration purpose, a numerical example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The number of patients with autoimmune diseases and severe allergies and recipients of transplants increases worldwide. Currently, these patients require lifelong administration of immunomodulatory drugs. Often, these drugs are expensive and show immediate or late‐occurring severe side effects. Treatment would be greatly improved by targeting the cause of autoimmunity, that is, loss of tolerance to self‐antigens. Accumulating knowledge on immune mechanisms has led to the development of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC), with the specific objective to restrain unwanted immune reactions in the long term. The first clinical trials with tolDC have recently been conducted and more tolDC trials are underway. Although the safety trials have been encouraging, many questions relating to tolDC, for example, cell‐manufacturing protocols, administration route, amount and frequency, or mechanism of action, remain to be answered. Aiming to join efforts in translating tolDC and other tolerogenic cellular products (e.g., Tregs and macrophages) to the clinic, a European COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) network has been initiated—A FACTT (action to focus and accelerate cell‐based tolerance‐inducing therapies). A FACTT aims to minimize overlap and maximize comparison of tolDC approaches through establishment of minimum information models and consensus monitoring parameters, ensuring that progress will be in an efficient, safe, and cost‐effective way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Customized transportation has received growing concerns by researchers and practitioners in recent years. Despite the fact that one consignor often holds partial ownership of its carrier within a supply chain, the existing interpretations behind them remain relatively unexplored. Based on the game models, we find that a simple take-or-pay contract is not likely to solve the low-efficient customized production problem, and equity participation mechanism plus simple contract may improve the cooperation performance of customized transportation. In the case of the owner-managed carrier, only when purchasing at par can it be ensured to obtain the socially optimal customization investment, but when purchasing at premium or discount, the optimal partial ownership selected by consignor cannot motivate the carrier to make the most efficient customization investment. With the optimal solutions, we also provide a theoretic foundation for calculating the optimal partial ownership and for interpreting why the interfirm share-holding ratios of the member-firms within the familial-type logistic supply chains are much larger than the ratios within the public-type logistic supply chains. Finally, our results show that the familial-type logistic supply chains may choose more efficient customized production level than public-type logistic supply chains.</jats:p>"

        "Informal Care and Economic Stressors11In this chapter, I use the term informal care because it is a standard term used in the academic literature. The term is intended to distinguish care from family members and friends, who are typically untrained and unpaid, from formal care, in which care is provided by paid, and usually trained, semiprofessionals or professionals who have no preexisting personal relationship with the care recipient. An alternative term is family caregiver, but I prefer the term informal caregiver because it does not exclude care provided by nonfamily members. In addition, the word informal reflects the reality that caregiving in the United States typically occurs in an informal market, where there are no explicit prices for the services provided, with rarely explicit direct payments, and it is therefore very difficult to quantify directly the supply, cost, or value of informal care. The very absence of a market for caregiving has spurred a great deal of economics (and other) research in understanding the value and costs of informal care in the United States and internationally, due to labor market impacts, health impacts, and other unintended consequences of caregiving."

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the real circumstances of service supply chain, there is one demand appearing as the sensitive feature, to face the increasing uncertainty. It could be elaborated upon the decision variables such as price, quantity, and efforts. The member behaviors are operated and coordinated in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Based on the multiperiod dynamic game theory, the service demand and price, quantity of goods, and efforts of members in the secondary service supply chain are considered. The paper discusses the reputation effect and ratchet effect in the multiperiod dynamic game service supply chain. Additionally, the paper describes this problem, builds a programming model based on the multiperiod dynamic game, and deduces the optimal solution. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of reputation effect and ratchet effect on the agent’s revenue. Through the simulation, it is found that the agency efforts are a combination result of reputation effect and ratchet effect in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Through the long-term dynamic game, the short-term moral risk in service supply chain can be restrained so that the result under the asymmetric information is the same as that under the complete information.</jats:p>"
