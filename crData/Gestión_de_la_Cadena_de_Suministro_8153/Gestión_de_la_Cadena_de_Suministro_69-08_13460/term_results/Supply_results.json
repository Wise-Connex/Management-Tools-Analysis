      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptakes from forty-four arable soils from England by 1 cm portions of the roots of intact onion seedlings during 10 days growth were measured. A single-split-root arrangement was used, enabling the determination of uptake by known surface area of the root. Transpiration was restricted to make K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> diffusion in the soil the predominant supply mechanism. These were compared with calculated values using separately determined K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> diffusion coefficients in the soils.</jats:p><jats:p>Two methods were followed, namely (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) measuring K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> diffusion to a hydrogen form of cation exchange resin paper and calculating diffusion coefficients assuming total depletion of the (ammonium acetate) exchangeable K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> at the resin paper: soil boundary; and (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) deriving diffusion coefficients from estimated values of the impedance factor and the measured K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> buffer power of each soil, for 50, 60, 90 and 100% depletion of the initial soil solution K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>at the root:soil boundary. None of the predictions adequately accounted for the observed uptake. Calculations of the root:soil boundary concentrations showed a wide range of depletion. Soils with initial soil solution K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the range 0.04–0.4 μmoles/ml were depleted of the solution K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> to near zero or even less. A negative concentration of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in solution indicates the probable contribution of non-exchangeable K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. When the initial soil solution K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> was more than 0.4 μmoles/ml, the uptake of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> could be accounted for by 30–85 % depletion at the root:soil boundary.</jats:p><jats:p>Partial and multiple regression of the measured uptake on the initial exchangeable K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content and the initial soil solution K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> concentration were calculated. A simple relationship between the uptake and the exchangeable K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> content accounted for about three-quarters the variance. The uptake was less closely associated with the K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in solution or its ratio to Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> + Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> in solution. These correlations are discussed from the diffusion point of view and in relation to the usually reported correlations from pot experiments.</jats:p><jats:p>Potato yield response to K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> fertilizer additions in field experiments are examined in relation to the supply of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> by diffusion in the soils. When K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> uptake by 1 cm portion of onion root from the unfertilized soil exceeded l.2 μmoles/10 days, yield response to K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> addition became erratic and occasionally negative.</jats:p>",
