Grayson focuses on the national challenge of a shortage of water supply facilities, and emphasizes that they are inadequate to meet the needs of the growing population. The problem is so acute in many urban areas that, on a hot summer day, almost half the people are exposed to the danger of insufficient water to put out a major fire. Although safe to drink, the water in the average community would probably not pass the quality standards that are recommended by water utility engineers. The inadequacy of our water supply facilities constitutes a serious threat to public safety, health and welfare. We must start now to correct the problem. In 25 years our water needs may well be 270 per cent of what they are today. Water is the biggest bargain in the family budget, and we have a system that will do the job for as little as 1.5 cents more per person per day. The key to the problem is public understanding.</jats:p>",

In May 1958, the committee planned a follow‐up survey of representative water and sewage treatment plants in the continental United States. A total of 191 cities were selected, which represented the range of urban population sizes in each of five geographic sections of the country. Approximately the same number of cities in each population range were selected for each section. From each city, water and sewage treatment plants serving the same communities were chosen. Of the total number selected data were received from 151 water plants and 51 sewage treatment plants; these data have been used to develop the compilations and analyses of this report. The small number of returns from the sewage treatment plants is attributed to the relatively small percentage of sewage plants using chlorine.</jats:p>",
