The municipal water supply pool has a volume of 149,500 acre‐ft and is calculated to produce a yield of 35 mgd during a drought period such as that of 1952‐56. Under normal rainfall conditions, the pool can be expected to provide 60 mgd. Major works constructed by the city include the Cheney Reservoir pumping station, pretreatment works and appurtenances, the raw‐water transmission line, and a communication and control cable. For convenience, the pumping facilities and the pretreatment works are discussed separately, although they are housed in the same structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Measurements of the wing-beat frequency, wing-stroke amplitude and stroke plane and of abdominal ventilation have been made during the tethered flight of twenty-six species of beetles belonging to five families, mainly in Uganda. Abdominal ventilation is weak or absent in all species of Cerambycidae, Elateridae and Anthribidae examined in flight. The tracheal system in these families is characterized by the complete absence of air sacs, and in larger species by the presence of four giant trunks running through the metathorax between spiracles 2 and 3 and forming the primary supply to the flight muscles. Abdominal ventilation is strong during the flight of all species over o·6 g. in weight of the Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae which were examined. Their tracheal systems contain an abundance of air sacs while giant trunks are absent. Measurements of the thoracic volume changes which accompany each wing beat show that the amount of air which can be pumped in this way increases in larger Cerambycidae per second per gram as compared with small species. Large Cerambycidae pump more per gram than Scarabaeidae of comparable size. During the flight of the cerambycid Petrognatha the thoracic pump exchanges 540 μ1. air/sec./g. Its action is mainly on the compressible secondary tracheae. In a wind speed of 5 m./sec. 1050 μ1. air/sec./g. are driven through the four giant trunks, entering through spiracle 2 and leaving from spiracle 3. The trunks are stout-walled and probably unaffected by the thoracic pump.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>S<jats:sc>ummary</jats:sc></jats:title><jats:p>Young tomato plants grown in nutrient solution cultures in which all of the nitrogen supply was in the form of nitrate had a higher relative growth rate than plants grown with ammonium nitrogen. Total phosphorus content expressed on a unit dry weight basis was not significantly different in the two treatments, but inorganic phosphorus content was high and organic phosphorus correspondingly low in ammonium‐grown as compared to nitrate‐grown plants. After 13 days this difference was found only in the shoots, but after 17 days the composition of the roots was similarly affected. Nitrate fed to ammonia‐grown plants resulted in a rapid increase in the dry matter and in organic phosphorus content in the young, incompletely expanded leaves. Total potassium content expressed on a dry weight basis did not differ in the two treatments for the first 10 days but thereafter the concentration in the ammonia‐grown plants fell whilst that in the nitrate grown plants remained approximately constant. The lowered potassium content in ammonia‐grown plants was first apparent in the leaves after 10 days, in the stems later and finally in the roots after 21 days. The causes of this reduced potassium content and its relationship to the lowered phosphate esterification and declining unit leaf rate are discussed.</jats:p>",
