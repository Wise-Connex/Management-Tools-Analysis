      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite myriad attempts by supply chain managers and exhortation by scholars, many firms remain insufficiently integrated across internal functional areas. Supply chain management research has hinted that the difficulty may be due to social dynamics occurring within and between organizational departments (i.e., organizational politics) and the perceptions thereof held by employees. This study examines whether perceptions of organizational politics held by firm employees negatively impact internal integration directly, or indirectly via inhibiting the firm's supply chain orientation. Based on social exchange theory and social influence theory, the research also assesses whether the potentially harmful impacts of political perceptions on internal integration are/can be mitigated by employees' perception of the political skill of the top supply chain management executive—a person charged with ensuring the firm's supply chain will function successfully. The findings of a broad managerial survey conducted within the U.S. retail industry suggest that perceptions of organizational politics within organizations do directly influence internal integration. Furthermore, the relationship between organizational politics and supply chain orientation is impacted when the top supply chain executive is perceived to be politically skilled.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Much has been written in the literature on the adoption of supply chain technologies (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content>). However, little has been written on why once adopted, the levels of utilization and the effectiveness of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> differ. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to investigate (1) why firms achieve more or less <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization and (2) how <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization relates to performance. To address the first objective and, using a survey of manufacturing firms in Australia, we identify and investigate how efficiency and legitimacy motivations for adopting <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> can help explain different levels of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization in firms. To address the second objective, we investigate the link between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization and delivery performance and the role that both information sharing and logistics integration play as moderators of that link. Our empirical results show that: (1) efficiency motivation for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> adoption more significantly and positively relates to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization in firms than does legitimacy motivation for adoption; and (2) there is a positive relationship between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization and firm performance and this increases when the level of information sharing between supply chain partners increases. This study contributes to the extant literature which has generally reported inconsistent results in terms of how <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization actually affects performance as well as taking a nascent step toward understanding the conditions under which <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCT</jats:styled-content> utilization is more or less effective in so far as it relates to delivery performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This paper presents a new practical game which helps undergraduate students to understand how the concept of supply chain management (SCM) works. The game uses a simple supply chain structure incorporating three entities of the supply chain: supplier, plant, and customer. The game employs a set of toy building blocks such as LEGO® blocks and has the rules of the game, responsibility of each player, product descriptions and bill of materials. This competitive game is used supply chain cost as the measuring to determine the winner team of the game and the Bloom's taxonomy as guidelines to develop the assessment testing based on the learning objectives of courses. This proposed board game has been tested by many undergraduate students who are taking SCM and Logistics Management courses. The results show that the students who played the game reached the higher scores of assessment testing than students who didn't play the game. Furthermore, most students have also positive view about this game.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In this paper, the authors study the capacity decision problem in an express delivery supply chain consisting of an online retailer and an express delivery provider where products sold by the online retailer are delivered by the express delivery provider to end customers. Unlike the case of the traditional manufacturer-retailer channels, the delivery capacity is a kind of “service product” that cannot be inventoried. To avoid the risk of unprofitable capacity, the delivery provider tends to build a limited delivery capacity which is smaller than the system-wide optimal capacity. To solve such a problem, the authors investigate the capacity coordination issue in this service supply chain using option contracts. By allowing the online retailer to reserve the capacity in advance, the delivery provider could rent a part of capacity which surpasses its self-owned capacity from a third party logistics. It is demonstrated that, compared with the benchmark based on a newsvendor model, option contracts can coordinate the delivery service supply chain. The authors also figure out the feasible option contracts that improve member's expected profit and show the degree of improvement that could be achieved.</p>",

The results from a partial least squares structural equation model support <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FMC</jats:styled-content> as a significant driver for three outcomes: forecast accuracy, cost reduction, and delivery performance, thereby establishing predictive validity. The study provides insights to the relative effectiveness of the four sets of forecasting practices constituting <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FMC</jats:styled-content>. A mediator–moderator analysis shows that forecast accuracy is not a mediator or a moderator between <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FMC</jats:styled-content> and the other two outcome variables of cost reduction and delivery performance. This indicates that in addition to effective demand forecasting practices, other processes such as sales and operations planning (S&amp;<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OP</jats:styled-content>) are also important for translating the benefits of effective forecasting to realize favorable business outcomes. A multigroup analysis shows that the impact of the four practice elements on the three performance outcomes also differs based on specific business contexts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This paper studies the design and development of an inventory model for manufacturers with constant production rates considering location and allocation decisions in a three-level supply chain. In this supply chain, the demands of customers and the lead times are assumed to be uncertain. Therefore, each distribution center retains some amount of safety stock to provide suitable service level for customers. The proposed non-linear model aims to minimize location and inventory costs of distribution centers, manufacturers and transportation costs subject to relevant constraints. To solve the model, an efficient imperialist competitive algorithm and a Tabu search algorithm, each using variable neighborhood search, are proposed. The model outputs are decisions such as which distribution centers and manufacturers are opened, the allocation of customers to distribution centers, and distribution centers to manufacturers. Results are also the ordering quantity of each opened distribution center and the production rate of each opened manufacturer. The computational results for several instances of the problem are represented to show the efficiency of proposed algorithm.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seeking to benefit from higher levels of purchasing maturity, many organizations strive to formalize their purchasing practices. Why these practices are not adopted by certain organizations or for certain types of purchases is less well understood, however. It has been argued that the purchasing of knowledge‐intensive services is particularly difficult to formalize, but an in‐depth understanding of the inter‐ and intra‐organizational dynamics influencing this process is lacking. This study contributes to the purchasing and supply management literature by providing a fine‐grained understanding of how actors respond to formalization initiatives. Building on an exploratory interview methodology and using institutional logic and power theory as foundations, we show that formalization initiatives lead to institutional complexity and conflicts. Sets of strategies and counterstrategies for how to deal with the complexity and conflicts are identified, and relational power is found to moderate which strategy is used by the actors. Based on the empirical findings, a conceptual model is developed to describe the response process.</jats:p>",

The data were gathered from conducted surveys with the food manufacturing companies in both countries, and tested by Structural Equation Modeling. The empirical results show that supply chain capabilities play an important role in business improvement in both countries. While, supply chain integration is considered as a critical factor for the Vietnamese food industry, human resource management is much regarded as important for the Thai food industry. These findings help companies in each country decide the best strategy for differentiating themselves in their business environment.</p>",

With the foundation development costs mostly sunk and production ramping up, investment exposure is at its lifecycle peak and there is intense focus on safe and reliable operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, there is also a need to continue to mature upstream gas supply opportunities.

To maintain the quality, as expected by consumers, it needs a system that could be utilized to manage production planning of those perishable products. By utilizing this system should also minimize human error hence reducing the loss. To increase the availability of fruits and vegetables for people who live in cities is by shortening the distance between supplier (farmer) and consumer (citizen). Urban Farming is one way to increase the availability of fruits and vegetables for people who live in city. To create an efective Urban Farming infrastructure, it need a system by utilizing information technology to manage its supply chain. All members of the supply chain network including producers (farmers), distribution center, administrator, retailers, and consumer can access this system. Members of the supply chains can manage every information related to him/her, and able to see the information of the other members when needed. With the integrated information, the planting schedule planning process, the selection of products that will be planted, harvest schedules, and reports related to the fulfillment of the request can be done easily and faster</jats:p>"

Each risk depends upon its environment and context; thus, for risk managers to prevent or manage risks, they must understand them within a broad context. This article provides a detailed analysis and assessment of supply chain risks related to cargo theft. The research method is deductive, with the analysis based on the data in the Transported Asset Protection Association's (TAPA) transport-related crime database. The results are analyzed and discussed within a frame of reference based on supply chain risk management literature and on the premise that cargo theft risk is a function of both impact and probability. The findings show that practitioners can understand and address cargo theft risks more effectively when they examine the frequency and impact of such theft separately. The article also concludes that risk and related theft should be considered in the context of criminological theories.</jats:p>",

The bulk decay coefficient is usually gained by using a laboratory bottle test method, but the wall decay coefficient is calibrated with field data of residual chlorine at nodes. This paper aims to present a method to adjust the wall decay coefficients of pipes. A metamodelling approach is developed by the combination of an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN) with the EPANET simulator. The proposed method is applied on a two-loop test example and real water distribution network. Results showed that the proposed method can increase the speed of solution 58 times more rapidly than the simple method in the two-loop network. In the real network, the classification based on the average flow velocity produced the best results among all categories, and the classification based on material, diameter, and age of pipes produced the best results among the physical criteria. Also, comparison of results between the measured and calculated data for testing data showed an average error of 3.85% and the calibration model gave good performance.</jats:p>",

Water shortages resulting from spatio-temporal heterogeneity of climate condition or human activities present serious problems in the Guizhou Province of southwest China. This study aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal changes of water supply service using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, explore how climate and land-use changes impact water supply provision, and discuss the impact of parameters associated with climate and land-use in the InVEST model on water supply in the region. We used data and the model to forecast trends for the year 2030 and found that water supply has been declining in the region at the watershed scale since 1990. Climate and land-use change played important roles in affecting the water supply. Water supply was overwhelmingly driven by the reference evapotranspiration and annual average precipitation, while the plant evapotranspiration coefficients for each land-use type had a relatively small effect. The method for sensitivity analysis developed in this study allowed exploration of the relative importance of parameters in the InVEST water yield model. The Grain-for-Green project, afforestation, and urban expansion control should be accelerated in this region to protect the water supply.</jats:p>",

The optimization and design of the supply chain network (SCN) is one of the relevant topics that has directed the attention of many scholars. Sound decisions in this regard, including the proper selection of the facility’s location, transportation modes and routes and inventory management policies, can noticeably improve the systems performance. Over 380 articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the ISI/Web of Science database have applied advanced O.R. techniques in SCN optimization studies. This paper offers a systematic review of these published contributions by focusing on two categories of O.R. approaches most recently applied for the design of SC systems: integrated mathematical modeling and simulation-optimization (S-O) frameworks. A taxonomy analysis of the mentioned approaches is presented based on the supply chain elements. A bibliometric analysis is also conducted to provide technical insights into the possible gaps in the field. Moreover, the relevant studies on SC sustainability are highlighted. The research results are supportive of the S-O frameworks as either an alternative approach or an effective solution method for the integrated problems. The research outcomes can provide researchers in the field with useful details of the integrated problems and S-O frameworks as the most recent O.R. methodologies in the field of SC optimization.</jats:p>"

More specifically, with focus on cloud computing’s suitability and benefits by offering a thorough review and analysis to previous and current research, including all types of published materials that lead to an adequate answer for the main research problem, as follows:What are the prospects and benefits of cloud computing technology in the supply chain of business organizations?This research method relies solely on secondary data, such as research papers, reference materials, conference proceedings, and all types of reliable data that serve the purpose of this paper.The major conclusion of this study is that; Organizations that work in a more turbulent environment are the ones that feel the effect of the cloud computing technology on their supply chain performance compared to those that work in a more stable business environment. Therefore, the degree of importance of cloud computing adoption varies from one sector to another, therefore, cloud computing—if adopted properly—can improve the supply chain performance in terms of cost, quality, speed, and flexibility.</jats:p>"

Previous investigations identified that rapid monochloramine decay was microbiological in nature and observed in samples taken after media filtration but was absent in filtered water samples from a fourth WTP of similar design. The filters at the WTP not exhibiting rapid decay are backwashed with filtered non-disinfected water whereas the other WTPs backwash with treated chloraminated water. It was therefore hypothesised that backwashing filters with chloraminated water was the cause of the rapid monochloramine decay. A pilot-scale study was conducted to investigate the impact of backwashing with chloraminated water on the occurrence of microbiologically accelerated monochloramine decay. Additional samples were analysed to assess the impact of chloraminated backwash water on N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and biological degradation of taste and odour compounds 2-methyl isoborneol (MIB) and geosmin in the filter media. Backwashing with chloraminated filtered water was concluded to be the cause of the observed rapid monochloramine decay, with rapid decay observed within 8 weeks for the filters backwashing with chloramines. Additionally, backwashing with chloraminated filtered water was observed to increase NDMA formation and impair the biological degradation performance of MIB and geosmin.</jats:p>",

The present work fills this gap and investigates the use of MDA for supply chain management (SCM). In doing so, we address several shortcomings noted in extant technology acceptance research and merge this framework with the resource-based view. First, arguments are developed for the central role played by behavioral intention in the relationship from perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness to usage behavior, positioning behavioral intention as an important process element. Second, competitive pressure is theorized to represent an influential contingency, moderating the impact of behavioral intention on usage behavior. Third, the impact of usage behavior on five important strategic performance measures necessary for competitive success (delivery, flexibility, quality, cost, and innovation performance) is assessed, pinpointing the value of MDA for SCM across these crucial measures of performance. And fourth, information uncertainty is positioned as a contextual force that can enhance the value of using MDA for competitive performance. Survey data from 217 adopters of MDA for SCM are used to test our expectations.</jats:p>",

The colossal task of ‘decarbonizing’ the current energy system, with ~85% of the primary energy produced from fossil sources is discussed. There are at the moment only two options that can contribute to a solution: renewable energy (sun, wind, hydro, etc.) or nuclear fission. Their contributions, ~2% for sun and wind, ~6% for hydro and ~5% for fission, will need to be enormously increased in a relatively short time, to meet the targets set by policy makers. The possible role and large potential for fusion to contribute to a solution in the future as a safe, nearly inexhaustible and environmentally compatible energy source is discussed. The principles of magnetic and inertial confinement are outlined, and the two main options for magnetic confinement, tokamak and stellarator, are explained. The status of magnetic fusion is summarized and the next steps in fusion research, ITER and DEMO, briefly presented.</jats:p>",

However, the literature shows evidence that such decisions at least partly depend on nonwage benefits encompassed in jobs and occupations. In this paper, I develop and estimate a stochastic dynamic model of occupation and job choice, where nonwage benefits are directly incorporated into the decision alongside wages (a full model). Nested within the full model is a wage model, which represents the common practice in the literature of basing selection solely on wages and disregarding nonwage benefits. I separately estimate the full model and the nested wage model to compare the implications (biases) of omitting nonwage benefits. I compare the two models' estimates of elasticities and an inequality reduction intervention policy. I find that disregarding nonwage benefits generally causes biases. There are cases when the two models predict very similar outcomes and have close estimates, such as in occupation‐specific elasticities and job transition elasticities. But these special cases are products of canceling biases. In most cases, ignoring nonwage benefits will bias estimates by overestimating the importance of wage in the selection process and by disregarding changes in relative prices between wage and nonwage benefits.

The conventional treatment process was shown to be capable of removing aluminium and iron from the source water as both were within water quality limits in the final water.

Owing to the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed a network optimization model for a sustainable and resilient supply chain network by considering sustainability via embodied carbon footprints and carbon emissions and resilience by considering resilience index. In this paper, initially, a possibilistic fuzzy multi-objective sustainable and resilient supply chain network model is developed for the garment industry considering economic, sustainable, and resilience objectives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of numerical simulations to improve the management of water distribution networks (WDNs) has dramatically increased in recent decades. Nevertheless, the modeling of leakages is still a major issue to face when setting up a model of a WDN. Because water losses increase at increasing pressure, they are usually modeled by assuming a leakage node behaves like an emitter. Unfortunately, a definitive assessment of the leakage law exponent is as yet lacking in the literature. Consequently, a field analysis was carried out on an existing WDN: (a) to assess whether the power law can effectively represent the relationship between leakage and pressure; and (b) to calculate the value of the exponent. A 3-month measurement campaign was developed, aiming at assessing the dependence of the losses to the pressure. The analysis showed that the power law equation with an exponent around 0.7 can well represent the pressure–leakage relationship.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Automotive industrial groups consider the impacts of packaging very important, mainly focusing on the cost effectiveness and environmentally conscious nature thereof. In the literature, the packaging supply chain is not a significantly researched area as regards the supply of the complete automotive engines. But the selection of packaging and the relevant development process in engine production are among the main elements of the extensive automotive industry, because participants sometimes have the same interests and considerations. This way, decision-making and strategies on using different packaging solutions and systems can be very varied. The reason is that each automotive group practically produces its own engines and transports them to their assembling subsidiaries all over the world. These groups often apply similar logistics policies and supply systems to use, take-back and recover their packaging. This is being driven as much by group strategies as it is by the need to reduce costs and increase efficiency in supply chains. The focus of this paper will be on the components and elements of packaging supply chain management in the field of engine supply for automotive industry groups, and on how the decision-making framework is determined. This paper shows models defining the network process for decision-making within the automotive groups as regards the packaging supply chain.</jats:p>"

Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported. Monitoring costs will become a lesser part of a water utility budget due to the fact that automation and technological simplification will abate human cost factors, and reduce the complexity of laboratory procedures.</jats:p>",

Cameroon is one of the most active volcanoes in Africa and poses a possible threat to about half a million people in the area, yet knowledge of the volcano’s underlying magma supply system is sparse. To characterize Mt. Cameroon’s magma plumbing system, we employed mineral-melt equilibrium thermobarometry on the products of the volcano’s two most recent eruptions of 1999 and 2000. Our results suggest pre-eruptive magma storage between 20 and 39 km beneath Mt. Cameroon, which corresponds to the Moho level and below. Additionally, the 1999 eruption products reveal several shallow magma pockets between 3 and 12 km depth, which are not detected in the 2000 lavas. This implies that small-volume magma batches actively migrate through the plumbing system during repose intervals. Evolving and migrating magma parcels potentially cause temporary unrest and short-lived explosive outbursts, and may be remobilized during major eruptions that are fed from sub-Moho magma reservoirs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Zika virus can be transmitted by transfusion, but the harm caused to recipients is not clear in most cases. It is very likely that the virus could also be transmitted by transplanted organs. Sensitivity to the risk from transfusion is elevated by consideration of possible severe neurologic damage in fetuses. Strategies for dealing with transfusion risk vary with the presence of Zika in the region. In nonendemic areas, risks can be reduced by excluding donors who have exposure through travel or sexual contact with someone at risk. In both endemic and nonendemic areas, the risk can be further reduced by nucleic acid testing of donors, or pathogen reduction of platelet and plasma products. The real risk to the population depends on the frequency of infection as well as the efficacy of these interventions. The interventions chosen will depend on the risk assessment for any situation; in the United States at this time, a combination of travel deferrals, testing, and, to a lesser extent, pathogen reduction is being used, but universal testing of US blood donors under investigational use has been mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration, beginning with states most at risk of local transmission. Canada is largely using travel deferrals. A precautionary approach may be taken; however, a formal decision-making framework has been suggested. The situation globally is clearly very fluid, as the epidemic continues to spread and we continue to learn how to best protect recipients of blood and transplants.</jats:p>",

While recent studies show that preference heterogeneity across countries explains little of this variation, we focus on two other important features: observation period and estimation method. We start with a thorough survey of existing evidence for both Western Europe and the USA, over a long period and from different empirical approaches. Then, our meta-analysis attempts to disentangle the role of time changes and estimation methods. We highlight the key role of time changes, documenting the incredible fall in labor supply elasticities since the 1980s not only for the USA but also in the EU. In contrast, we find no compelling evidence that the choice of estimation method explains variation in elasticity estimates. From our analysis, we derive important guidelines for policy simulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of the Internet of Things infrastructure requires the deployment of millions of heterogeneous sensors embedded in the environment. The powering of these sensors cannot be done with wired connections, and the use of batteries is often impracticable. Energy harvesting is the common proposed solution, and many devices have been developed for this purpose, using light, mechanical vibrations, and temperature differences as energetic sources. In this paper we present a novel energy-harvester device able to capture the kinetic energy from a fluid in motion and transform it in electrical energy. This device, named FLEHAP (FLuttering Energy Harvester for Autonomous Powering), is based on an aeroelastic effect, named fluttering, in which a totally passive airfoil shows large and regular self-sustained motions (limit cycle oscillations) even in extreme conditions (low Reynolds numbers), thanks to its peculiar mechanical configuration. This system shows, in some centimeter-sized configurations, an electrical conversion efficiency that exceeds 8% at low wind speed (3.5 m/s). By using a specialized electronic circuit, it is possible to store the electrical energy in a super capacitor, and so guarantee self-powering in such environmental conditions.</jats:p>"

The goal of DQSA is to enhance FDA’s ability to help protect consumers by detecting and removing potential dangerous products from the pharmaceutics distribution supply chain. A new electronic, interoperable system will identify and trace only prescription drugs in the finished form for human use while distributed in the United States. The purpose of this review was to shed light on a complex and complicated process that it will require cooperation between FDA and drug manufactures, wholesale drug distributors, repackagers and dispensers. The implementation of the DSCSA is based on several law requirements and FDA has developed a schedule with time frames for each of them to be executed over a 10-year period. From this review, FDA recommendations are provided through the FDA Guidance on Identifying Suspect Product document to help trading partners and provide information about the risk of suspect drugs entering the supply chain. Moreover, FDA organized on April 5-6, 2016 in Silver Spring, MD a public workshop to gather valuable feedback from stakeholders who shared their input about the implementation of the new electronic system and its requirements. By the end of 2023, a unified system will provide easier data exchange and less errors, and will increase the safety and security of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nType: Student Project</jats:p>"

On average, the supply shock leads to a moderate decline in local native wages and a sharp decline in local native employment. These average effects mask considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly pronounced for older natives. This pattern is inconsistent with standard models of immigration but can be accounted for by a model that allows for a larger labor supply elasticity or a higher degree of wage rigidity for older than for young workers. We further show that the employment response is almost entirely driven by diminished inflows of natives into work rather than outflows into other areas or nonemployment, suggesting that “outsiders” shield “insiders” from the increased competition.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the power supply is to generate dielectric barrier discharges for industrial applications. The power supply is compact and has the advantage of low cost, over current protection, and convenient control for voltage and frequency selection. The power supply can generate high voltage pulses of up to 45 kV at the repetitive frequency range of 1 kHz–50 kHz with 1.2 kW input power. The output current of the power supply is limited to 500 mA. The pulse rise time and fall time are less than 2 μs and the pulse width is 2 μs. The power supply is short circuit proof and can withstand variable plasma load conditions. The power supply mainly consists of a half bridge series resonant converter to charge an intermediate capacitor, which discharges through a step-up transformer at high frequency to generate high voltage pulses. Semiconductor switches and amorphous cores are used for power modulation at higher frequencies. The power supply is tested with quartz tube dielectric barrier discharge load and worked stably. The design details and the performance of the power supply on no load and dielectric barrier discharge load are presented.</jats:p>",

The data envelopment analysis is applied for the estimation of efficiencies, while the structural equation modelling (SEM) is conducted for identification of possible integration impacts on the efficiency. Results show that integration with other supply chain members indeed has some positive impacts on the agencies’ efficiency. Also, the developed SEM model implies that in-depth forms of collaboration would enable more effective exploitation of the identified relations between the integration and efficiency of the agencies.

Being able to fully understand both the complex static and dynamic structures of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN) are key to being able to make more informed management decisions and prioritize resources and production throughout the network. Previous efforts to model and analyze CASN have been impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems. However, drawing from other complex adaptive systems sciences, information theory provides a model-free methodology removing many of those barriers, especially concerning complex network structure and dynamics. With minimal information about the network nodes, transfer entropy can be used to reverse engineer the network structure while local transfer entropy can be used to analyze the network structure’s dynamics. Both simulated and real-world networks were analyzed using this methodology. Applying the methodology to CASNs allows the practitioner to capitalize on observations from the highly multidisciplinary field of information theory which provides insights into CASN’s self-organization, emergence, stability/instability, and distributed computation. This not only provides managers with a more thorough understanding of a system’s structure and dynamics for management purposes, but also opens up research opportunities into eventual strategies to monitor and manage emergence and adaption within the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In today’s ever-changing global business environment, successful survival of manufacturing firms/production units depends on the extent of fulfillment of dynamic customers’ demands. Appropriate supply chain strategy is of vital concern in this context. Lean principles correspond to zero inventory level; whereas, agile concepts motivate safety inventory to face and withstand in turbulent market conditions. The leagile paradigm is gaining prime importance in the contemporary scenario which includes salient features of both leanness and agility. While lean strategy affords markets with predictable demand, low variety and long product life cycle; agility performs best in a volatile environment with high variety, mass-customization and short product life cycle. Successful implementation of leagile concept requires evaluation of the total performance metric and development of a route map for integrating lean production and agile supply in the total supply chain. To this end, the purpose of this paper is to propose a leagility evaluation framework using fuzzy logic.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A structured framework consisting of leagile capabilities/attributes as well as criterions has been explored to assess an overall leagility index, for a case enterprise and the data, obtained thereof, has been analyzed. Future opportunities toward improving leagility degree have been identified as well. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Overall Performance Index to assess the combined agility and leanness measure (leagility) of the organizational supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The proposed method has been found fruitful from managerial implication viewpoint.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper aimed to present an integrated fuzzy-based performance appraisement module in an organizational leagile supply chain. This evaluation module helps to assess existing organizational leagility degree; it can be considered as a ready reference to compare performance of different leagile organization (running under similar supply chain architecture) and to benchmark candidate leagile enterprises; so that best practices can be transmitted to the less-performing organizations. Moreover, there is scope to identify ill-performing areas (barriers of leagility) which require special managerial attention for future improvement.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Using panel data on golf demand (number of golf players) and supply (number of courses), and indicators of the economic situation for 15 European countries, encompassing years 2000 through 2014, we estimate a dynamic panel data model in order to evaluate the influence of the economic conditions and golf supply on the number of registered golfers. Economic situation is assessed through two variables: the gross domestic product (GDP) and the main stock market index of each country. We also test the hypothesis of uneven effects of the GDP before and after the beginning of the economic recession. The most crucial finding is that from the start of the financial crisis, the level of GDP imposes statistically significant effect on golf demand, making those countries with higher GDP per capita the ones whose golf demand is harmed the least by the financial crisis. The number of golf players responds to the state of the economy after the start of the economic downturns, while the high persistence of the golf demand makes it rather difficult to find significant differences in the changes in GDP before the recession. We also find that the number of golf courses is not seen to bear a close relationship with the number of players unless we control for economic factors and business cycle. Within the economic factors, the level of development of a country, as measured by GDP per capita, outweighs stock market role in determining the demand for golf. </jats:p>",

This adsorbent was prepared by loading Fe(III) onto porous amidoximated polyacrynitrile (AN)/itaconic acid (IA) copolymers (Fe(III)-AO AN/IA). Negligible ferric ion dissolution was observed from Fe(III)-AO AN/IA in solution of acidic pHs up to 2. As(V) adsorption by Fe(III)-AO AN/IA is a pH-dependent process with maximum capacity of 1.32 mg/g at pH 2–3. The adsorption process was found to be governed by pseudo-second-order kinetics, and could be described by the Freundlich model. Fe(III)-AO AN/IA had higher adsorption selectivity for As(V) than other anions in a simulated groundwater body such as Cl−, SO42−, PO43−, SiO32−. Fixed-bed adsorption indicated that As(V) in simulated groundwater could be effectively captured from 400 μg/L to &amp;lt;10 μg/L within 190 bed volumes (BV). The As(V) adsorbed on Fe(III)-AO AN/IA could be efficiently eluted with 10 BV of 5% NaCl solution (at pH = 9.0).</jats:p>",

An exemplary application is the continuous feeding of oxygen and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> for on-chip cell cultivation of mammalian cells. In our device, the surrounding air diffuses into the culture medium inside the chip through a porous wall of agarose hydrogel resulting in an easy and robust design.\nOne common method is the usage of gas permeable PDMS chips. However, liquid medium in which the cells grow is absorbed by PDMS causing unknown concentrations and memory effects. Another possibility is a complex setup where medium with already dissolved gas is pumped constantly through the chip.\nWe designed and realized a silicon and borosilicate glass chip containing a gas permeable wall of agarose preventing leakage of medium. In order to precisely position the walls in the chip, we made use of surficial phaseguides (50nm high).\nThe blue-bottle-experiment makes the effective dissipation of oxygen visible when the colorless leucomethylen-blue reacts to methylene-blue. Successful results were achieved when applying 0.5 g/l methylene blue, 10 g/l glucose and a pH of 12.6 set by a buffer solution. As a result a continuous color gradient through the chip was obtained, which reflects the oxygen gradient and confirms the oxygen diffusion.</jats:p>"

Aeration is one of the key components of the activated sludge process, and is one of the most important aspects of modelling wastewater treatment systems. However, aeration systems are typically not modelled in detail in most wastewater treatment process modelling studies. A comprehensive dynamic aeration system model has been developed that captures both air supply and demand. The model includes sub-models for blowers, pipes, fittings, and valves. An extended diffuser model predicts both oxygen transfer efficiency within an aeration basin and pressure drop across the diffusers. The aeration system model allows engineers to analyse aeration systems as a whole to determine biological air requirements, blower performance, air distribution, control valve impacts, controller design and tuning, and energy costs. This enables engineers to trouble-shoot the entire aeration system including process, equipment and controls. It also allows much more realistic design of these highly complex systems.</jats:p>",

In France, ‘short food chains’ are both a continuation of a long tradition and a recent trend which now extends beyond activists, to consumers and producers as well. This paper will explore the conditions under which these chains can change the practices and knowledge of ordinary actors in urban food systems, from producers to urban consumers and policy-makers, in the area of agriculture and sustainability. It will consider the case study of the creation and development of an urban open-air market which has been analyzed using intervention research with input from economic sociology. We will highlight how personal relations, which are encouraged by a participatory context, support the evolution of practices and knowledge. We will also illustrate how a system of produce labelling has emerged as a mediation resource, and has increased changes as well as participation within the re-territorialization of the urban food system. By describing a concrete expression of food democracy which is spreading in France via a free collective trademark, and by showing its role in the transition of ‘ordinary’ actors towards a more sustainable agriculture, this paper will shine new light onto local food chains as well as traditional short food chains, and will call for more research on the subject.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply with daily consumer goods is a time consuming and quite inefficient task. Furthermore, some people may be dependent on caregivers resulting in additional costs. Hence, it offers opportunities for developing e-commerce solutions in order to enable customers to use otherwise wasted time for replenishment of their private food stocks more efficiently. Although, some digital stores for consumer goods have evolved recently, still only a small part of total sales, especially in food retail, is realized online. Due to inappropriate packaging there still are problems with the quality of fresh products. Also, current solutions for depositing parcels if the customer is absent are not suitable for fresh or cooled goods. Therefore, we show state of the art and developments necessary to establish the logistical integration and thereby enabling automated consumer goods supply in smart home environments. As smart appliances are playing an important role for enabling the automation, our focus is set on such hardware. To demonstrate customer acceptance of smart stocks in their private households, market research has been performed on smart refrigerators in place for every conceivable appliance capable of capturing consumer goods. Our results prove that especially younger generations are very interested in and willing to pay for intelligent appliances.</jats:p>"

However, two parallel bus and metro lines belonging to different operators may lead to supply competition and consequently yield over-supply. Taking two parallel bus and metro lines in Harbin city, China as a case study, this paper, drawing on game theory, establishes a utility model based on the two lines’ frequencies, and reveals and explains the fundamental reason for the over-supply problem using a Nash equilibrium. In an attempt to resolve this issue, the study proposes a new operation mode: integrating frequencies of the two modes to obtain larger total profits then reallocating the total profits to the two modes. The case study shows that this new operation mode can effectively solve the over-supply problem while satisfying both operators of the two modes, and hence having practical value.</jats:p>"

We find that without a deal‐of‐the‐day (DOTD) retailer, it is suboptimal for the manufacturer to offer a quantity discount while it is optimal for the retailer to offer periodic price discounts to consumers. With the addition of a DOTD retailer, it is likely to be optimal for the manufacturer to offer a quantity discount. We show that even without market expansion, i.e., no exclusive DOTD retailer consumers, opening the intermittent channel can leave the permanent retailer no worse‐off while increasing the manufacturer's profit. We identify the regular and discounted wholesale prices and the threshold quantity at which the manufacturer should give the discount. We also identify the optimal retail prices. We find that opening the intermittent channel increases the profit of the manufacturer, is likely to decrease the average retail price and to increase sales, and may increase the permanent retailer's profit. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

What did we learn from the earlier crisis, and how did the credit crunch literature help guide policy in the more recent crisis? Two important changes were the consolidation of the banking sector and the dramatic growth in nonbank financial intermediaries, which are much more susceptible than banks to liquidity risks because of a lack of deposit insurance. This article highlights that, although security broker-dealers, money market mutual funds, and issuers of asset-backed securities were not particularly important in the early 1990s, when the bank credit crunch occurred, they grew dramatically to become both major sources of financing and key elements in exacerbating the problems experienced during the recent financial crisis. </jats:p>",

The Broadband Ecosystem provided a comprehensive framework for examining broadband infrastructure supply and household use and satisfaction with broadband services. Publicly available data was used to map the coverage of broadband access technologies in WDR. A large scale survey assessed household use and satisfaction with broadband services available in WDR. Our findings indicate that rural regions such as WDR are highly reliant on wireless broadband which is more variable in reliability and less affordable comparative to wired broadband. Our findings also indicate that household dissatisfaction with wireless broadband services is particularly evident in remote and outer regional areas. This suggests that the lack of reliable and affordable wireless broadband services with adequate data quotas are a real barrier to rural communities such as the WDR actively participating in a digital future. This study provided a number of important contributions. The broadband ecosystem provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex problem of broadband access in rural Australia by analysing two units of analysis, broadband infrastructure (supply) and broadband use and satisfaction (demand). Broadband infrastructure is an important and under-researched area in information systems. Future government policy needs to ensure that access to reliable and high speed broadband services is part of its universal service obligation so that the current shortcomings in broadband infrastructure in rural Australia will be prioritised and addressed. We believe this will require a commitment from future Governments to facilitate both public and private investment in broadband infrastructure in rural Australia.</jats:p>"

However, for a better determination of the alternatives and a more profound evaluation of the tradeoffs among them, a comprehensive analysis of the results and a thorough investigation of their impact on the parties involved in swap are crucial. This research performs a detailed sensitivity analysis of the swap problem to examine the effect of different operational parameters on the cost savings realized along the supply chain of the organizations involved in swap. Findings of this study suggest that, if performed properly, swap can significantly reduce supply chain costs and may result in substantial savings, creating a win-win situation for all parties engaged in swap.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A novel gas turbine combustor is investigated by means of a global flow analysis. Its main feature is the helical arrangement of the burners, which allows the utilization of the high angular momentum of the flow from compressor, so that the length of the flame tube and the number of NGV can be reduced. The concept was studied in Ariatabar et al. (2016, “Short Helical Combustor: Concept Study of an Innovative Gas Turbine Combustor With Angular Air Supply,” ASME J. Eng. Gas Turbines Power, 138(3), p. 031503) based on similarity considerations and a kinematic assessment of the simulated flow in various combustor models. For the best configuration found in the previous work, the exit mean flow angle was lower than the half of its initial value at the combustor inlet. The reason for this unwanted decay of the initial high angular momentum flux was not clear. In the present work, the underlying physics of the strong reduction of the mean flow angle is elucidated by analysis of the integral balance equation of angular momentum. It is shown that the flow in the vicinity of the burners is governed by inertial forces associated with an asymmetric pressure distribution on the sidewall and the combustor dome. The friction and turbulent mixing phenomena are found to have marginal effects on the flow pattern. To compare mean flow quantities of different combustor designs, a physically consistent averaging method is introduced, which can also be applied to a conventional combustor to assess different swirl configurations regarding the resulting flow pattern, mixing performance, and total pressure loss.</jats:p>",

Because the cost of unit commitment increases with larger reserve margins, cost analysis to determine the most economical reserve margin is an important issue in power system operation. Here, we define the “short-term reliability of balance” and describe a method to determine the reserve margin based on the short-term reliability of balance. We describe a case study, in which we calculate the reserve margin using this method with various standards of short-term reliability of balance. A cost analysis is then performed to determine the most economic standard, and a comparison between our method and a conventional method is carried out. The results show that our method with an economic short-term reliability of balance enables more reliable and efficient operation of the power system. Moreover, with an hourly reserve margin, we show that an increase in wind power generation can result in a significant decrease in the operating cost, which makes wind power generation economically viable.</jats:p>"

These previous omissions have been addressed in the present paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bottled water consumption has increased significantly in recent decades. Eighty percent of bottled water is sold in plastic containers usually made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Trace leaching of phthalate esters (PEs) from these bottles into the water and their effects on human health has become a serious concern. In this study, the effects of freezing on the release of PEs from PET bottles have been investigated. Four common PEs were determined in bottled water samples before and after freezing–remelting by a dispersive liquid–liquid micro-extraction method and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. PE levels after freezing–remelting of samples were significantly lower than before (mean ± SD = 0.71 ± 0.28 and 0.33 ± 0.003 ppb, respectively). Electrical conductivity (EC) also decreased after freezing–remelting of the water (mean ± SD = 260.2 ± 80.6 and 130.6 ± 17.4 μs/cm, respectively). Significant correlation has been detected between reduction in water EC and elimination of PEs from water. Dissolved minerals and contaminants in water concentrate and conglomerate in the center of the ice during the freezing process and form white sediments mainly of calcium bicarbonate after remelting of the water. It seems that calcium bicarbonate effectively adsorbs PEs and traps them in its structures. These sediments do not have significant gastrointestinal absorption and cannot pose health consequences. The freezing–remelting process could be introduced as an effective procedure for water treatment.</jats:p>",

Choosing appropriate locations is not easy and frequently based on opportunities rather than rational decisions. Dedicated decision‐support systems could help humanitarian practitioners design their supply networks. Academic literature suggests the use of commercial sector models but rarely considers the constraints and specific context of humanitarian operations, such as obtaining accurate data, high uncertainties, limited budgets and increasing pressure on cost efficiency. We propose a tooled methodology to properly support humanitarian decision makers in the design of their supply chains. Our contribution is based on the definition of aggregate scenarios to reliably forecast demand using past disaster data and future trends. Demand for relief items based on these scenarios is then fed to a mixed‐integer linear programming model in order to improve current supply networks. The specifications of this model have been defined in close collaboration with humanitarian workers. The model allows analysis of the impact of alternative sourcing strategies and service level requirements on operational efficiency. It provides clear and actionable recommendations for a given context, bridging the gap between academics and humanitarian logisticians. The methodology was developed to be useful to a broad range of humanitarian organizations, and a specific application to the supply chain design of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is discussed in detail.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We collected data from four case‐study Original Equipment Manufacturers and six associated suppliers and analysed these using Template Analysis and cross‐case analysis. Our findings reveal how the power of the system, operationalized through relative performance measures, performance measurement mechanisms and the individuals in‐charge of them, provides a facilitative context within which other dimensions of power operate. Here, the power of resources (expert and legitimate power), processes (associated with raising issues, cross‐functional teams, early supplier involvement and reviews) and meaning (creating legitimacy through reviews) interact to support knowledge integration within innovation projects in supply chains. This, we argue, emphasises the plurality of power dimensions deployed and importance of their interrelationships in facilitating knowledge integration within hierarchical supply chain networks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Numerous green regulations currently require companies to be responsible for their effect on the natural environment, in addition to achieving their economic goals. In view of this, many companies have implemented the ISO14001 system in their supply chain to comply with green regulations. However, implementing such a system involves technical and communication efforts; hence, an effective method is needed to support the implementation. In this paper, the authors propose a value engineering (VE)-based model with quality tools to support the implementation of the ISO14001 system in the Green Supply Chains. In it, they applied the framework of VE with the quality engineering tools Fishbone Analysis and Failure Mode Effect Analysis for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of green issues in supply chains to cover quality, risk, and value of the system. The proposed method was applied to a global electronics manufacturing company in Taiwan, and the application results showed positive outputs in terms of CO2 emission, power consumption, water consumption, and waste water recovery. Based on the evidence, academic and industrial implications are discussed.</p>",

The research aims to receive the experimental data on pattern of motor oil distribution by circumference of cylinder for the specified type of internal-combustion engine. The measurement method is based on organization of drainage and following quantity control of oil that is removed by piston rings from internal surface of the cylinder. Experimental device corresponding to this method represents the low-sized high-speed four-stroke air-cooled TMZ-450D diesel engine having a cylinder with six oil-catch through holes executed in its bottom support belt and supplied with thin-walled tubes. Tests were performed under rotation of crankshaft by means of outside source (balanced engine) with nominal speed. The oil filling of any first of six tubes was considered as a moment of ending for each experience. The quantity of oil in tubes was controlled by measuring of oil column length in every tube. During cranking both with air compression and without it, experiments show that quantity of motor oil removed by piston rings from non-loaded cylinder wall side in all cases is more by 15-18% than from the loaded one. Such pattern of oil distribution by circumference of a cylinder at which non-loaded side receives more oil than the loaded one, points to the infringement of principle of coordination between lubricating and loading conditions. That increases the risk of wear and bore scuffing in cylinder-piston unit. In spite of limitation by only one method and one object, the received results show the expediency of following studies of features of cylinder oil supply for the specified type of engines to increase their work reliability.</jats:p>"

The article derives equilibrium prices and quantities in the output and equipment rental or outsourcing markets. The prices and quantities are a function of the heterogeneity of farmers and the features of the technology. Introducing the new indivisible technology will benefit larger adopting farmers and consumers but may hurt non‐adopters. We illustrate our conceptual findings.</jats:p>",

By interleaving CSC converters, input current is shared amongst them so that high reliability and efficiency is obtained for high‐power applications. I‐CSC converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to achieve unity power factor inherently at utility interface. DCM operation together with interleaving technique bring additional size and performance benefits such as reduced reverse recovery loss, less switching stress, high efficiency, etc. I‐CSC converter is followed by three full bridge buck converters in parallel to perform DC‐DC conversion and to provide galvanic isolation desired for safe operation during welding. The modularity of SMPS allows flexibility in current, voltage and power levels, usage of devices of lower rating and ease of maintenance. The proposed SMPS operates in constant voltage mode; however, during extreme overload condition it maintains constant current at the output to improve the weld bead quality. Test results confirm the effectiveness of proposed SMPS in maintaining power quality indices within the acceptable limits of international standards over wide load range while over‐current handling capability leads to improved welding performance.</jats:p>",

This is the second part of a two-part article discussing labour standards in China. Although some private rule-making institutions have increased their governance role in a cross-border regulatory scenario, a more viable governance regime is still arguably perceived as a national rather than a global phenomenon. Given the ineffective enforcement of labour standards in China, some authoritative standards, like the UN Tri-Pillar Framework, hold the keys to an emerging internationally recognized regime for global labour governance. It remains a challenge to strike a balance between hard law and soft law, so as to ensure multinational companies (MNCs)’s profit maximization and the protection of human rights. With an examination of counter-conventional approaches to legal pluralism and globalized supply chains, it is proposed that more multipronged forms of governance may incentivize foreign MNCs to improve labour practices across various governance levels. MNCs will need to operate beyond merely abiding by Chinese law, and contribute more by self-regulation along with other stakeholders in the implementation of human rights standards.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Globalization, innovation, social media, and exposure to natural and man-made disasters have increased organizations’ need to cope with demand surges: random, significant increases in demand in an otherwise relatively stable demand environment. To build supply chain capabilities, organizations face a choice between two fundamentally different sourcing strategies—reactive capacity and safety stock. We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time—a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems. Finally, through stochastic comparison techniques, we show how the magnitude and predictability of surge demand characteristics (mentioned above) and the cost profiles of each strategy impact the optimal joint strategy. </jats:p>",

Soon after this initial finding, XMRV was also detected in samples from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The blood community, which is highly sensitive to the threat of emerging infectious diseases since the HIV/AIDS crisis, recommended indefinite deferral of all blood donors with a history of CFS. As XMRV research progressed, conflicting results emerged regarding the importance of this virus in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer and/or CFS. Molecular biologists traced the development of XMRV to a recombination event in a laboratory mouse that likely occurred circa 1993. The virus was propagated via cell lines derived from a tumor present in this mouse and spread through contamination of laboratory samples. Well-controlled experiments showed that detection of XMRV was due to contaminated samples and was not a marker of or a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS. This paper traces the development of XMRV in the prostate and CFS scientific communities and explores the effect it had on the blood community.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of the paper is to study how wholesale price and revenue sharing contracts affect operations and marketing decisions in a supply chain under different dynamic informational structures. We suggest a differential game model of a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a single retailer that agree on the contract parameters at the outset of the game. The model includes key operational and marketing activities related to a single product in the supply chain. The manufacturer sets a production rate and the rate of advertising efforts while the retailer chooses a purchase rate and the consumer price. The state of the game is summarized in the firms’ backlogs and the manufacturer’s advertising goodwill. Depending on whether the supply chain members have and share state information, they may either make decisions contingent on the current state of the game (feedback Nash strategy), or precommit to a plan of action during the whole game (open-loop Nash strategy). Given a contract type, the impact of the availability of information regarding the state of the game on the firms’ decisions and payoffs is investigated. It is shown that double marginalization can be better mitigated if the supply chain members adopt a contingent strategy under a wholesale price contract and a commitment strategy under a revenue sharing contract. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Stockpiling inventory is an essential strategy for building supply chain resilience. It enables firms to continue operating while finding a solution to an unexpected event that causes a supply disruption or demand surge. While extremely valuable when actually deployed, stockpiles incur large holding costs and usually provide no benefits until such a time. To help to reduce this cost, this study presents a new approach for managing stockpiles. We show that if leveraged intelligently, stockpiles can also help an organization better meet its own regular demand by enabling a type of virtual pooling we call virtual stockpile pooling (VSP). The idea of VSP is to first integrate the stockpile into several locations’ regular inventory buffers and then dynamically reallocate the stockpile among these locations in reaction to the demand realizations to achieve a kind of virtual transshipment. To study how to execute VSP and determine when it can provide the most value, we formulate a stylized multi‐location stochastic inventory model and solve for the optimal stockpile allocation and inventory order policies. We show that VSP can provide significant cost savings: in some cases nearly the full holding cost of the stockpile (i.e., VSP effectively maintains the stockpile for free), in other cases nearly the savings of traditional physical inventory pooling. Last, our results prescribe implementing VSP with many locations for large stockpiles, but only a few locations for small stockpiles. </jats:p>",

During implementation of such projects, collecting large amount of information about the area and detailed investigations are crucial. Joint use of the aerospace monitoring and GIS play an essential role for the studies of the impact of environmental factors, development of the analytical information systems and others, while achieving the reliable performance of the existing and designed major water supply pipelines, as well as construction and exploitation of the technical installations. With our participation the GIS has been created in “Azersu” OJSC that includes systematic database of the drinking water supply and sewerage system, and rain water networks to carry out necessary geo information analysis. GIScreated based on “Microstation” platform and aerospace data.  Should be mentioned that, in the country, specifically in large cities (i.e. Baku, Ganja, Sumqait, etc.,) drinking water supply pipelines cross regions with different physico-geographical conditions, geo-morphological compositions and seismotectonics.Mains water supply lines in many accidents occur during the operation, it also creates problems with drinking water consumers. In some cases the damage is caused by large-scale accidents. Long-term experience gives reason to say that the elimination of the consequences of accidents is a major cost. Therefore, to avoid such events and to prevent their exploitation and geodetic monitoring system to improve the rules on key issues. Therefore, constant control of the plan-height positioning, geodetic measurements for the detailed examination of the dynamics, repetition of the geodetic measurements for certain time intervals, or in other words regular monitoring is very important. During geodetic monitoring using the GIS has special significance. Given that, collecting geodetic monitoring measurements of the main pipelines on the same coordinate system and processing these data on a single GIS system allows the implementation of overall assessment of plan-height state of major water supply pipeline network facilities and the study of the impact of water supply network on environment and alternatively, the impact of natural processes on major pipeline.\n                    </jats:p>"

Sixteen human auricles from eight body donors (five females/three males, 84.33 ± 9.0 years) were investigated using the unique ‘Spalteholz’ method. After arterial injection of silicone, a complete transparency of the tissue was achieved and the auricular arteries and branches were visible. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the arterial vascular pattern was performed. The superior and the inferior anterior auricular artery provided the vascular supply to the helical rim, forming an arcade, i.e. helical rim arcade. On the superior third of the helical rim another arcade was confirmed between the superior anterior auricular artery and the posterior auricular artery (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PAA</jats:styled-content>), i.e. the helical arcade.

There is currently a wide selection of possible feedstocks, a variety of conversion routes, and a number of different end products that can be produced at a range of scales. However, economic slowdown, low oil prices, lack of global political will, and lingering questions regarding land use change and the sustainability of bioenergy production systems provide a challenging global context to speed the pace of investment. The opinions expressed in this paper are derived from our collaboration within <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IEA</jats:styled-content> Bioenergy to determine opportunities as well as barriers that need to be overcome to realize opportunities on a wider scale. This comprehensive and novel collaborative effort confirmed that feedstocks produced using logistically efficient production systems can be mobilized to make significant contributions to achieving global targets for bioenergy. At the same time, significant barriers to large‐scale implementation exist in many regions. The mobilization potential identified in the study will depend on both increases in supply chain efficiencies and profits and strong policy support to increase stakeholder and investor confidence. <jats:italic>WIREs Energy Environ</jats:italic> 2017, 6:e237. doi: 10.1002/wene.237</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Bioenergy &gt; Economics and Policy</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Energy Policy and Planning &gt; Climate and Environment</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

The sorbent was observed to be most effective and stable within the pH range 6.70–8.12, where the lowest concentrations of Al and Fe (&amp;lt;1 mg/L) in treated water were recorded. Thus, sorbent loss was minimal at that pH range. It was observed that the sorbent lost its efficiency and stability at calcination temperatures above 600 °C. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer analysis of metals in supernatants and thermogravimetric analysis of the sorbent showed that there was substantive loss of Al and Fe from the sorbent at temperatures above 600 °C because of evaporation. K2SO4 solution proved to be the best regenerant for spent sorbent compared to NaOH and Na2CO3, which caused sorbent loss owing to high solution pH. The CO32– from Na2CO3 bound to regenerated sorbent so much that it could not be displaced by fluoride during subsequent defluoridation experiments. Sorbent regenerated with 0.1 M K2SO4 solution could reduce 10 mg/L fluoride in artificial water at a dosage of 0.8 g/100 mL by 81.8% and 67.2% at the second and third cycles, respectively.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the results of a study on mixing and water demand in roof tanks, based on physical and numerical models. Tracer tests were carried out on a real scale transparent wall laboratory model of a roof tank, and a three-parameter residence time distribution model was applied, showing that the model that best describes mixing in roof water tanks is the one with a completely stirred flow reactor with a small portion of bypassing. This result was confirmed by computational fluid dynamic simulations and visual observation. The instantaneous water flow derived from activating typical home water-using fixtures was measured at the pipe feeding the tank, the pipe exiting the tank, and without a roof tank. Stochastic water demand patterns were generated with the measured data and used in the numerical model of a small distribution network. Based on this model it was found that water demand and pipe flow behave differently in continuous and intermittent water supply networks. The instantaneous flow rate withdrawn from the water distribution network pipes is lower in systems with roof tanks.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is necessary that the reactor operations can be continued even if abnormal events occur in the systems. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency has developed a calculation code to evaluate the absorption of thermal-load fluctuations by the reactors when the reactor operations are continued after such events, and has improved the code based on the high-temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) operating data. However, there were insufficient data on the transient temperature behavior of the metallic components and the graphite core support structures corresponding to the fluctuation of the reactor inlet coolant temperature for further improvement of the code. Thus, nuclear heat supply fluctuation tests with the HTTR were carried out in non-nuclear heating operation to focus on the thermal effect. In the tests, the coolant helium gas temperature was heated to 120°C by the compression heat of the gas circulators in the HTTR, and a sufficiently large fluctuation of 17°C for the reactor inlet coolant was achieved by devising a new test procedure under the ideal condition without the effect of the nuclear power. Then, the temperature responses of the metallic components and the graphite core support structures were investigated. The test results adequately showed as predicted that the temperature responses of the metallic components are faster than those of the graphite blocks, and the mechanism of the thermal-load fluctuation absorption by the metallic components was clarified.</jats:p>",

The dc analysis and design procedure are verified experimentally, with calculated and measured parameters shown to be in good agreement. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The concept of the agile supply chain (ASC) has become increasingly important as a means of achieving a competitive edge in highly turbulent business environments. An ASC is a dynamic alliance of member enterprises, the formation of which is likely to introduce velocity, responsiveness, and flexibility into the manufacturing system. In ASC management, supplier/partner selection is a key strategic concern. Apart from traditional supplier/partner selection criteria; different agility-related criteria/attributes need to be taken under consideration while selecting an appropriate supplier in an ASC. The paper aims to discuss these issues.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Therefore, evaluation and selection of potential supplier in an ASC have become an important multi-criteria decision making problem. Most of the evaluation criteria being subjective in nature; traditional decision-making approaches (mostly dealing with objective data) fail to solve this problem. However, fuzzy set theory appears an important mean to tackle with vague and imprecise data given by the experts. In this work, application potential of the fuzzy multi-level multi-criteria decision making (FMLMCDM) approach proposed by Chu and Velásquez (2009) and Chu and Varma (2012) has been examined and compared to that of Fuzzy-techniques for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Fuzzy-MOORA in the context of supplier selection in ASC.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>It has been observed that similar ranking order appears in FMLMCDM as well as Fuzzy-TOPSIS.

A comparative analysis has also been made in view of working principles of FMLMCDM, Fuzzy-TOPSIS as well as Fuzzy-MOORA.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Application feasibility of FMLMCDM approach has been verified in comparison with Fuzzy-TOPSIS and Fuzzy-MOORA in the context of agile supplier selection.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Consequently improving water efficiency is the key to realizing the sustainable utilization of water resources, and water efficiency evaluation is an important part of water resources management. Emergy theory aims to convert different dimensions of material and energy into solar energy, which can be analyzed and compared uniformly. Therefore, a new approach to assessing the economic efficiency of water resources, based on the water contribution to economic production, is evaluated using an emergy theory model. Water efficiency and system sustainability are explained by variables and emergy indicators in a regional water ecological–economic system (WEES) for Zhengzhou, China. The general status and economic efficiency of water resources in Zhengzhou are identified from the WEES. The average water contribution quantity and water contribution rate were 50.99 × 1020 sej and 6.13% during 2000–2011, respectively. Results also show that industrial water efficiency is higher than that of agriculture. This quantification method will help decision-makers to adjust water prices and provide better water services.</jats:p>",

It exploits available internet resources for supplemental information, thus requiring no physical setup or experimentation, and eliminating material costs. The project provides a complex business problem in a familiar setting, allowing students to focus their learning efforts on technical mastery of concepts and tools rather than underlying business descriptions. It emphasizes critical thinking, team work, and project management, in addition to the fundamental concepts and supporting tools of the process improvement method.</jats:p>",

Innovators such as firms and other agents develop supply chains to accommodate the nature of the innovations. In this article we analyze an innovator's supply chain design problem. The design of the supply chain involves three sets of decisions. The first is how much to produce. The second involves how to undertake production, and how many resources to allocate to the production of feedstock (agricultural products that are inputs for processing), processing, and marketing. The third set involves deciding on the amount of feedstock to be obtained through contracts with farmers. We show that the innovator determines its overall level of production by taking advantage of its monopoly power, derived from the innovation in the output market, and behaves as a monopsony in buying feedstock from contractors. These decisions are constrained by the marginal cost of capital and the properties of production and marketing technologies. When the innovator is risk averse, risks in farm production, processing, and marketing will affect both processed output and the share of feedstock bought through contracts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway by which fixed carbon in the biosphere is returned to the atmosphere, yet there are limits to our ability to predict respiration rates using environmental drivers at the global scale. While temperature, moisture, carbon supply, and other site characteristics are known to regulate soil respiration rates at plot scales within certain biomes, quantitative frameworks for evaluating the relative importance of these factors across different biomes and at the global scale require tests of the relationships between field estimates and global climatic data. This study evaluates the factors driving Rs at the global scale by linking global datasets of soil moisture, soil temperature, primary productivity, and soil carbon estimates with observations of annual Rs from the Global Soil Respiration Database (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRDB</jats:styled-content>). We find that calibrating models with parabolic soil moisture functions can improve predictive power over similar models with asymptotic functions of mean annual precipitation. Soil temperature is comparable with previously reported air temperature observations used in predicting Rs and is the dominant driver of Rs in global models; however, within certain biomes soil moisture and soil carbon emerge as dominant predictors of Rs. We identify regions where typical temperature‐driven responses are further mediated by soil moisture, precipitation, and carbon supply and regions in which environmental controls on high Rs values are difficult to ascertain due to limited field data. Because soil moisture integrates temperature and precipitation dynamics, it can more directly constrain the heterotrophic component of Rs, but global‐scale models tend to smooth its spatial heterogeneity by aggregating factors that increase moisture variability within and across biomes. We compare statistical and mechanistic models that provide independent estimates of global Rs ranging from 83 to 108 Pg yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, but also highlight regions of uncertainty where more observations are required or environmental controls are hard to constrain.</jats:p>",

Difficulties in imaging the complex microanatomy of the cortex have so far restricted insight about blood flow distribution in the microcirculation. A new methodology combining advanced microscopy data with large scale hemodynamic simulations enabled us to quantify the effect of the angioarchitecture on the cerebral microcirculation. High-resolution images of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex were input into with a comprehensive computational model of cerebral perfusion and oxygen supply ranging from the pial vessels to individual brain cells. Simulations of blood flow, hematocrit and oxygen tension show that the wide variation of hemodynamic states in the tortuous, randomly organized capillary bed is responsible for relatively uniform cortical tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Computational analysis of microcirculatory blood flow and pressure drops further indicates that the capillary bed, including capillaries adjacent to feeding arterioles (d &lt; 10 µm), are the largest contributors to hydraulic resistance. </jats:p>",

We experimentally manipulated light, nutrient supply, and nutrient ratio (N:P) in a field experiment to generate variation in algal quantity and elemental composition, and assessed the stoichiometric responses of juvenile carnivorous fish (bluegill, <jats:italic>Lepomis macrochirus</jats:italic>). Algal quantity (primary production) and stoichiometry (ratios of carbon [C], nitrogen [N], and phosphorus [P]) varied greatly in response to manipulations, as did bluegill body and excretion stoichiometry. Algal primary production (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PP</jats:styled-content>r) was greatest at high light and high P supply (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HL HP</jats:styled-content>). Algal stoichiometry responded in accordance with the light:nutrient hypothesis; that is, C:P ratios were highest at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HL LP</jats:styled-content> and lowest at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LL HP</jats:styled-content>. Variation in fish body stoichiometry was strongly related to basal resource supply (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PP</jats:styled-content>r), while excretion stoichiometry was driven by both <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PP</jats:styled-content>r and algal stoichiometry.

Thus, bluegill body C:P, C:N, and N:P were highest under <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HL HN</jats:styled-content> and lowest under <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LL LN</jats:styled-content>. Per capita excretion rates of bluegill were strongly related to body mass and hence were highest at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HL HN</jats:styled-content>, where fish grew largest. However, P excretion rates normalized for body mass increased with phytoplankton P and zooplankton production. In accordance with ecological stoichiometry theory, N:P excretion ratio increased with basal resource (algal) N:P and decreased with estimated bluegill P ingestion. Variation in both body and excretion stoichiometry in this single cohort of fish was comparable to or exceeded variation observed in other studies of bluegill stoichiometry across multiple ecosystems. Our results illustrate the pronounced intraspecific variation in carnivore nutrient stoichiometry as a function of basal resource quantity and quality.</jats:p>",

A field study on canola (Brassica napus L.), treated with preplant and sidedress nitrogen (N) applications under ample phosphorus (P) supply conditions, was conducted to determine seasonal plant dry matter (DM) and N and P uptake patterns. We found that periodic DM measured at 20% flowering (FL), from FL to 50% pods reaching maximum size (FL-RI), and from RI to physiological maturity (RI-PM) contributed to 30%, 57%, and 14% of total DM, respectively. Yields ranged from 111 to 447 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> with a sharp decline in 2012 induced by heat and drought. The crop took up about 58%–71% of total plant N by FL, whereas up to 42% of total plant P was assembled during the RI-PM. Canola seed accounted for 60%–66% of total plant N and 59%–63% of total plant P. Accumulation of DM and N post-FL, and of P during RI-PM could explain 69%, 43%, and 55%, respectively, variations in yield, seed N, and seed P. Our data indicated that plant P uptake under adequate P supply conditions in canola was largely enhanced by N application. </jats:p>",

The reduction of water losses from water supply systems can help fill the gap between supply and demand. This strategy is characterized by the variety of options, and identification of the most appropriate option is a demanding process. An integrated multi-criteria decision making framework, precisely analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to prioritize water loss reduction options for a typical intermittent water supply network in Palestine. The AHP was applied to structure the decision problem into a hierarchy framework, and four groups of decision makers were engaged to evaluate the elements. The results show that the strategic plan, which comprises controlling and managing operational pressure, was the best option. The selection of this option was highly connected to the conditions of the case study and to the well-known advantages of this strategy to reduce losses. It is anticipated that the developed methodology will help water utilities to identify integrated water loss management plans that will guide utility managers to conduct better control for water losses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, increased light has been shed on the large amounts of food wasted along the food supply chain (FSC). As lifecycle assessments (LCAs) are commonly used for estimations of environmental impacts from food production, it is relevant to investigate and discuss how such wastage is reflected in foodstuff LCAs. The objective of the present paper is to review a larger set of LCAs of foodstuff in order to (1) investigate if and how wastage along the FSC is addressed and (2) explore the importance of including wastage accumulated along the FSC in terms of environmental impacts. Twenty-eight LCA case studies and two review papers, focusing on tomatoes, were reviewed and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions chosen as indicator for the second objective. Only one third of the studies consider wastage at some part of the supply chain, in many cases in an inconsistent manner, and only in nine cases were GHG emissions from wastage included in overall systems GHG emissions. In these, wastage accounts for between 2 and 33% of total contribution to climate change. Omitting wastage when conducting LCA of foodstuff could result in underestimations of environmental impacts. Occurrence of wastage along all phases of the supply chain should be acknowledged in order to estimate environmental benefits from prevention and to identify areas where strategies with the aim of reducing wastage could be most efficient. </jats:p>",

Such standards play an increasingly important role in today’s business environment. However, to generate adoption benefits, they must be first widely accepted – a situation where they have become viewed as the de facto norms. For this state to occur early adopters play a critical role. Past research has argued that early adopters, in exchange for assuming more risk, are rewarded with higher economic returns. Yet, these findings are based on private, not public standards. With public standards, early adopters do not receive such benefits. There is evidence that public standards are becoming more important. This situation leads to a simple but important question addressed in this study – if early adopters assume the risks of embracing a new public standard without economic benefits, then what is their motivation? To resolve this question, this study draws on agency theory and prospect theory. The authors argue that early adopters embrace such standards because of their desire to minimize risk resulting from failure to support the goal at the heart of the public standards.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Data were obtained from the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) Partners Cost Benefit Survey and analyzed through structural equation modeling.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Early adopters of public standards are not driven by economic benefits but rather by the need to minimize their exposure to the risks associated with failing to satisfy the goals associated with a public standard.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Piezoelectric transducers are commonly operated at their resonance frequency. However, from a power dissipation standpoint, this is not the ideal driving frequency. In this paper, an optimized driving frequency in between the resonance and antiresonance frequencies is proposed for the piezo-transducer. First, the optimum driving frequency is characterized using a constant vibration velocity measurement method. The actual input power reveals the lowest power dissipation frequency between the resonance and the antiresonance frequencies, where the transducer behaves inductive. The electrical parameters of the transducer are then determined by an equivalent circuit formulation, which is useful for the electrical circuit analysis of the driver design. A Class E resonant inverter is used to design a capacitive output impedance driver at the optimized frequency by utilizing a series capacitor. Compared with the traditional resonance drive, driving at the optimized frequency reduces the required power by approximately half according to the measurements performed.</jats:p>",

The energy industry, however, is closely linked to the financial sector. In view of this, using a non-linear Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model, this paper examines the threshold effects of financial developments on energy supply structures for 17 energy supply provinces in China observed over 2000–2014. The main results are: (1) The ratio of coal supply (LCSR) specification is seen to be a four-regime PSTR model with added value in the financial industry/GDP (LFIR) as the threshold variable. The LFIR and LCSR show a positive correlation, and the elastic coefficients change between 0.02 and ~0.085; the impact of financial institutions’ loan balance/GDP (LLAN) on LCSR takes on an inverse U-shaped curve: first positive, then negative, and again positive with the financial crisis in 2008 as the turning point; (2) The ratio of thermal power generation (LTPG) specification is seen to be a two-regime PSTR model with investment in the coal industry/GDP (LCIR) as the threshold variable. Results show that LFIR has a negative effect on LTPG, and the coefficients in the low regime tend to be 0.344%, then gradually decrease to 0.051% in the high regime. The influence of LLAN on the LTPG is positive before and negative after the financial crisis. The influence of the foreign direct investment GDP proportion (LFDI, the degree of financial openness) on the LCSR and LTPG both remain negative. Therefore, in the process of formulating energy conservation policies and adjusting energy-intensive industrial structures, the government should fully consider the effect of financial developments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The reintroduction of anadromous salmonids in reservoirs is being proposed with increasing frequency, requiring baseline studies to evaluate feasibility and estimate the capacity of reservoir food webs to support reintroduced populations. Using three reservoirs on the north fork Lewis River as a case study, we demonstrate a method to determine juvenile salmonid smolt rearing capacities for lakes and reservoirs. To determine if the Lewis River reservoirs can support reintroduced populations of juvenile stream‐type Chinook Salmon <jats:italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</jats:italic>, we evaluated the monthly production of daphnia <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> spp. (the primary zooplankton consumed by resident salmonids in the system) and used bioenergetics to model the consumption demand of resident fishes in each reservoir. To estimate the surplus of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> prey available for reintroduced salmonids, we assumed a maximum sustainable exploitation rate and accounted for the consumption demand of resident fishes. The number of smolts that could have been supported was estimated by dividing any surplus <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> production by the simulated consumption demand of an individual Chinook Salmon fry rearing in the reservoir to successful smolt size. In all three reservoirs, densities of <jats:italic>Daphnia</jats:italic> were highest in the epilimnion, but warm epilimnetic temperatures and the vertical distribution of planktivores suggested that access to abundant epilimnetic prey was limited. By comparing accessible prey supply and demand on a monthly basis, we were able to identify potential prey supply bottlenecks that could limit smolt production and growth. These results demonstrate that a bioenergetics approach can be a valuable method of examining constraints on lake and reservoir rearing capacity, such as thermal structure and temporal food supply. This method enables numerical estimation of rearing capacity, which is a useful metric for managers evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing Pacific salmon <jats:italic>Oncorhynchus</jats:italic> spp. in lentic systems.</jats:p><jats:p>Received April 24, 2016; accepted July 28, 2016 Published online October 11, 2016</jats:p>",

The application of biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) plastic film has had a significant influence on the economic, environmental and social performance of supply chain management. However, research on the integration of these three sustainable dimensions is still rare in this field. In this paper, we identify sustainability criteria based on a triple bottom line approach (economic benefit, environmental protection and social responsibility) from the supply chain perspective, develop a hybrid multi-criteria decision making framework to evaluate the criteria and select alternatives and apply the proposed approach to a real case study at a focal BOPP plastic film company in China. In the framework, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is used to determine the performance criteria weights and a fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) is applied to rank the alternatives. The case study finds that the economic dimension was the most important aspect with environmental second and social third. The results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This paper develops an effective and systematic approach for decision makers to conduct evaluations and select optimal alternatives for focal plastic film companies.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted to determine the impacts of different N rates (0, 122, 174, and 300 kg/ha) on the distribution and speciation of Fe and Zn in wheat grain milling fractions under field conditions. Zn and protein concentrations were increased, whereas Fe was less affected in the flour fractions with increasing N rates. Further analysis with size‐exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that Fe and Zn bound to low‐molecular‐weight (LMW) compounds in the flour fractions (probably Fe‐nicotianamine [NA], Fe‐deoxymugineic acid, or Zn‐NA) were less affected by increasing N supply, representing 3.5–10.9% of total Fe and 2.5–56.6% of total Zn. In the shorts fraction, LMW‐Fe was absent, and LMW‐Zn with higher N supply was over twice as high as that in control and 3–27 times as high as that in the other milling fractions. In the flour fractions, the molar ratios of phytic acid (PA)/Fe and PA/Zn (both less than 30.5) decreased, whereas soluble LMW‐Fe/Zn was not affected with increasing N rates.</jats:p>",
