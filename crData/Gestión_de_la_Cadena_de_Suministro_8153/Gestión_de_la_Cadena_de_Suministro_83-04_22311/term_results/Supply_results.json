The growth in output does not seem to be matched by growth in use. While national bibliographic control of theses has long been practiced in some countries in many it has yet to be achieved. Availability is a more serious problem. Theses are no longer produced in multiple copies in many countries and exchange activity is declining. There is a trend towards centralized microfilming of theses for bibliographic control, loan and sale. Only a limited number of theses are subsequently published by conventional methods. The centralization of provision has much to commend it, but improvements achieved may be undermined by sponsored research and reserved publication rights.</jats:p>",

In particular, the payroll tax, the earnings test, the offsetting actuarial adjustment, and the dependence of the size of future benefits on the level of current earnings all affect the net return to extra work. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the size of the net tax rate on labor income in a variety of circumstances, taking into account all these provisions, as well as the personal income tax. We find that the Social Security Program on net in the past has provided a large subsidy to labor supply, which for many people effectively offset the personal income tax. This subsidy rate, however, has been declining steadily over time</jats:p>",

The present difficult economic situation is caused by the country's increasing dependence on imported oil which has risen from 50% of total energy consumption in 1962 to 75% in 1981. Contributing factors include basic problems in energy consumption patterns, inadequate pricing structures and a lack of a clearly‐defined responsibility over the country's energy management. To remedy the present situation the Government is embarking on a large‐scale programme based on the utilization of natural gas, hydroelectric power, lignite and imported coal, which should reduce the share of imported oil in Thailand's total energy consumption to 38% in 1990.</jats:p><jats:p>En 1981, la Thailande a consacré 42 pour cent du revenu de ses exportations à régler sa facture pétrolière qui s'est chiffrée à 3 milliards de dollars des Etats‐Unis. Les difficultés de la situation économique actuelle sont le résultat de la dépendance croissante du pays à l'égard du brut d'importation qui représentait, en 1981, 70 pour cent de la consommation totale d'énergie contre 50 pour cent en 1962. Parmi les causes de cette situation, il faut citer les problèmes qui sont à la base des changements de structures de la consommation d'énergie, de mauvaises politiques de prix et l'absence d'une stratégie clairement établie en ce qui concerne la gestion des ressources énergétiques du pays. Pour remédier à cette situation, le gouvernement s'est lancé dans un programme à grande échelle basé sur l'utilisation du gaz naturel, de la force hydroélectrique, du lignite et du charbon d'importation qui devraient pouvoir réquire à 38%, en 1990, la part d'importation du pétrole d'origine érangère de la Thailande</jats:p><jats:p>Tailandia utilizó el 42 porciento de su ingreso por exportación para pagar tres mil millones de dólares correspondiente a la importación de petróleo durante 1981.

Surgery taking place within a patient's home area and that taking place outside this area are discussed. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses are compared. Although the average surgeon does more surgical procedures than does the average general practitioner, the number of procedures performed varies greatly within each specialty. Individual physician workloads remained fairly stable over time when a surgically active physician moved into an area, while population utilization increased 17 per cent. When such physicians left an area, the surgical workloads of the physicians increased significantly (18.7 per cent) while population utilization stayed essentially the same. Both physician workload and surgical utilization in control areas increased gradually (between 6 and 7 per cent) over the period studied. Several models of physician behavior were investigated using data on individual procedures as well as overall figures. A model emphasizing the importance of physician discretion appeared to provide the best fit with the data. </jats:p>",

The PIAT-Dictated condition conformed to instructions in the manual with the exception that the subjects were asked to spell dictated test items (supply) rather than choose the correct spelling from among four choices (selection). A dependent t-test indicated that subjects performed significantly better under the PIAT-Regular condition than under the PIAT-Dictated condition.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the supply elasticity estimates reported for Australian agriculture are derived from equations estimated using time series data and incorporating ad hoc assumptions about price expectations. The authors' aim is to compare previously obtained supply elasticity estimates with those derived using theoretically more acceptable survey data on both producers' intentions and price expectations. Surveys were conducted in three regions in N.S.W., namely, the Southern Tablelands, the South‐West Slopes and a portion of the Western Division centred on Cobar. The results of the research show that there are no major differences between the supply elasticities derived using the traditional time series approach and those obtained using the survey data. This finding is reassuring, given the cost of collecting survey data.</jats:p>",
