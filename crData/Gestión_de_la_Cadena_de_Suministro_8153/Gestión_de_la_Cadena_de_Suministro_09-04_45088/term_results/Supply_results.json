In the studied situation, one company, or supplier, supplies one product to the other company, who is a retailer. The companies are going to coordinate by two types of decisions: economic (concerning prices fixed on a contract), and physical exchange (concerning the inventory to be held). Two types of contracts will be presented: one contract with a simple pricing scheme and two contracts with inventory holding cost shared among the companies of the supply chain. The objective is to show that contracts with inventory holding cost share allow the two companies to efficiently coordinate the chain they form.</p>",

In this article we consider a three-echelon direct sell supply chain model and focus on the problem of coordinated decision-making between its members. Our contribution is a first approach that measures the impact of the degree of coordination between the members. Demand behavior is modeled using a geometric Brownian process. Simulation models are run in order to analyze various cooperation scenarios. Our results show a direct relation between the degree of coordination within the supply chain and the total system cost. Although this result is intuitive, our simulations allowed us to quantify such a relation and in which measure these costs are whether or not associated to imperfect coordination</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In the contingent situation of extreme reduction of credit flows, enterprises try to extract liquidity, as much as possible, through better and more efficient management of their operations. It becomes paramount, therefore, to understand the sources of possible internal financing. It is about aligning the operational flow with the financial flow. It is about fully evaluating the processes and the 'end-to-end' information that determine the values of liquidity, of the accounts and of the corporate working capital. The supply chain is a network of participants who trade goods, services and information in front of purchase and sales orders. The financial component, expressed through invoices and payments, acts as the 'glue' between the various participants. In such a context, control passes from corporates to the issuing institutions, that is, the banks. Banks also find themselves in dire straits owing to the serious economic crisis. They need to innovate products and services in an ever-more competitive — and prudent — market. By mapping the operational processes in front of these as well as other financial solutions, the supply-chain manager can guide the finance colleague proactively to involve the bank of reference to obtain solutions and services that positively condition the corporation's working capital.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Kurzfassung</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Wer Supply Chains gestalten möchte, muss zunächst die Märkte kennen. Dabei gilt es, die logistischen Anforderungen der Kunden zu segmentieren und in ein Supply Chain Design zu überführen. Um „Lean Supply Chains“ zu initiieren, bedarf es einer Visualisierung des Handlungsbedarfs, um Veränderungsbereitschaft zu erzeugen. Zur Gestaltung von globalen Materialflüssen haben sich Supply Chain-Modelle bewährt, die auf einer „Makro-Ebene“ Wertströme abbilden. Eine robuste, zügige und aussagekräftige Szenarien-Bewertung mittels Supply Chain-Simulation wird hierdurch ermöglicht. Nachdem sich ein großer Verbesserungshebel im Inbound-Bereich befindet, erschließen sich beträchtliche Optimierungspotenziale durch eine aktive Lieferantenintegration und -entwicklung sowie eine gemeinsame, partnerschaftliche Prozessoptimierung. Eine beruhigte Versorgung und damit begrenzte Bestände über die gesamte Versorgungskette verlangen auch nach einer getakteten Versorgung auf der Beschaffungsseite und nicht nur auf dem eigenen Werksgelände. In verlässlicheren und konstanteren Lieferabrufen liegen zudem noch erhebliche Chancen zur Optimierung der Versorgungskette. In jedem Fall sind kurze Durchlaufzeiten Voraussetzung für „Lean Supply Chains“.</jats:p>",

However, they have evolved in similar ways to reach the same ultimate goal: customer satisfaction. TQM emphasizes internal (employee) participation and SCM focuses on external (business partners) partnerships but there is a need to emphasize both internal and external partnerships to further strengthen the emphasis on “total” TQM and the entire supply chain in SCM.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper is one of the first to discuss comparisons between TQM and SCM. Although both are critical to organizational competitiveness, research so far has tended to focus on either one or the other. A comparative understanding of the philosophies, goals, evolution, and integration of both approaches therefore could improve opportunities for integrated implementation and further research. Thus, this paper can be used as a basis for future empirical studies.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The arterial supply to the liver is highly variable with variations occurring slightly less than 50% of the time. Variations occur, for example, when hepatic arteries are replaced or accessory arteries are present. Clinically, it is important to appreciate and recognize these hepatic arterial variations during radiologic and surgical procedures in the upper abdomen to affect positive patient outcomes. Consequently, the purpose of our study was to examine the frequency of variations in the hepatic arterial supply. Our study examined 84 cadavers for the presence of replaced and accessory arteries and the variant origin of the common hepatic artery (CHA). The most frequent pattern was type 2 (16.3%) which is characterized by the left gastric artery issuing an accessory vessel (n=13) or replaced left hepatic artery. A type III pattern [superior mesenteric artery (SMA) issuing a replaced right hepatic (n=13) or accessory artery] occurred 14% of the time. Infrequently, a replaced right hepatic artery originated from the gastroduodenal (GD) artery (3.5%) or celiac trunk (2.3%). In one instance, an accessory artery sprung from the GD. Lastly, the CHA was observed issuing from the aorta (2.3%) and SMA (1.2%). In summary, our study observed 35 instances of hepatic arterial variations (40.7%). The frequent occurrence of these variations underscores the importance of properly planning clinical procedures in the upper abdomen.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, many organizations deploy technology without due consideration for how their employees access, create, and share information and knowledge. This article explores the subject empirically through the study of how employees work with information and knowledge around a core business function—in this case a supply chain process. In order to do this, the organization needs to be viewed from a network perspective as it relates to specific business processes. Viewing the organization in this way enabled the author to see how employees’ preferred knowledge and information transfer mechanisms varied across the core process. In some cases, the identified transfer mechanisms where at odds with the prescribed organization wide mechanisms. However, when the organization considered the employees’ preferred transfer mechanisms as part of an overall process improvement, the E2E supply chain performance was seen to improve significantly.</p>",

An important prerequisite of interfirm collaboration is information sharing. Extant research suggests clear advantages of information sharing. The research at hand addresses antecedents of interorganizational information sharing. Based on findings from interorganizational systems adoption and interfirm collaboration research, a structural model is developed and validated by a quantitative survey among Austrian retailers and manufacturers in the fast-moving consumer-goods sector. The proposed model analyzes the effect of internal factors (commitment, information policy, and technical readiness), interorganizational factors (relationship, trust, power, and trading partners’ technical readiness), and economic factors (perceived benefits and costs) on information-sharing behavior. The results show the relevance of internal factors and perceived benefits. The study reveals particularities of information-sharing behavior and can help practitioners to understand what motivates their trading partners to share information.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dual sourcing and inventory are two prevalent and widely studied strategies firms use to manage yield risk. A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of “supply learning” (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model. </jats:p>",

Screening activities undertaken by the main contracting organization for the case of large project deliveries and parameters to be considered are identified, a multi‐level quantitative framework to support the decision‐making process in effectively selecting an efficient and a compatible set of partners is proposed. Different agent behaviours are introduced and modelled; their impact on the results of the bidding processes is analysed through a simulation model specifically developed for this purpose.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Among the biggest challenges, companies confront with is the finding of appropriate action lines, methods or IT tools to overcome problems introduced by the saturation of the market, fierce competition and downfall of entry‐barriers. The paper uses a paradigm that is seen as one of the most promising in responding to the needs of modern companies: the agent‐based paradigm.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Designing an efficient supply network greatly influences the level of uncertainty that a company is encountering. An agent‐based model may efficiently help the inter‐organizational networks partners' selection process. To operate effectively in open environments such as supply chains, agents must be adaptive. System/agents performance can be improved by doing what‐if simulation runs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>A further possible work direction, considering that nowadays a society must find a compromise between being internationally competitive and having a healthy environment, would be the introduction in the model of a special type of agent, namely the project delivery waste management agent.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>In addition to contributing to the scientific literature, this research also aims at supporting practical business situations in the industry by creating a normative decision‐making model based on an agent‐based approach. The simulation model developed supports the tuning of parameters used in the evaluation process and makes possible analyzing the effect of different agent behaviours.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Research that identifies means to constrain the pre‐contracting selection problem for specific delivery chains as bridge constructions is needed. The paper details the particularities of such chains, and makes a presentment of roles of actors with impact on the assessment process. One specific of the approach is that in addition to participants as suppliers and main contracting organization also issues (goals) relevant in the supplier's appraisal process are represented by independent agents.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It states that it is all too often assumed that there is not adequate water supply because shortages develop under status quo water management strategies, when new approaches could result in a more efficient allocation of water resources. The article provides an example of questionably sustainable water supply practices currently in use that will require significant management improvements in the future to remain sustainable. The article lists considerations that share a common basis in institutional legal policies for water resource allocation, and discusses the fact that effective and efficient water management should combine public interest regulation with clearly defined rights to use water resources.</jats:p>",

Most approaches reported in the literature have been ad‐hoc and specific to certain risks; a general and comprehensive approach is lacking. To address this, we present a structured methodology for risk identification. Supply chain networks are in many ways similar to chemical plants, therefore well‐established methods and concepts from chemical process risk management can be adapted to supply chains. Drawing from this analogy, we propose to represent supply chain structure and operations using flow and work‐flow diagrams, equivalent to process flow diagrams (PFDs) and operating procedures. Following the HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis method common in process safety, risk identification can be performed by systematically generating deviations in different supply chain parameters and identifying their possible causes, consequences, safeguards, and mitigating actions. The application and benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated using a refinery supply chain case study. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold><jats:sc>summary</jats:sc></jats:bold> Dengue is the most common arthropod‐borne infection worldwide, affecting at least 50 million people every year and endemic in more than 100 countries. The dengue virus is a single‐stranded RNA virus with four major serotypes. Infection with one serotype confers homotypic immunity but not heterologous immunity, and secondary infection with another serotype may lead to more severe disease. The major route of transmission occurs through the <jats:italic>Aedes aegypti </jats:italic>mosquito vector, but dengue has also been transmitted through blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) to dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks. A trend has also been observed towards increasing age among infected patients. This will impact blood supply availability as more blood donors are deferred because of dengue infection or exposure to infection. The risk of transmission through transfusion of blood from asymptomatic viraemic donors will also increase. Although screening tests for dengue and effective pathogen reduction processes are now available for the blood supply, the value of implementing these costly measures needs to be carefully considered. Demand for platelets and fresh frozen plasma will rise with increasing number of DHF/DSS. Evidence‐based guidelines for the clinical use of these blood components in the management of patients with DHF/DSS have not been well established, and inappropriate use will contribute to the challenges faced by blood services.</jats:p>",

It is also said Vasa nervorum of facial nerve concerns facial nerve palsy. Therefore the morphological features of the blood supply of the facial nerve out of the stylomastoid foramen were observed. Eighteen adult cadavers from 46 to 80 years old in whom dye was injected were observed under stereo microscope. Moreover, the region of the epineuria was observed with SEM. As a result, Vasa nervorum was derived from complex reticulation structure that were formed of mainly superficial temporal, facial, transverse facial and zygomatico‐orbital artery and collaterally supraorbital, deep temporal, buccal artery and parotid branches.

The method preserves bounds on the production of turbulent energy in the sense of the [Formula: see text] norm of perturbations from a notional laminar profile. This is achieved by decomposing the Navier–Stokes system into a feedback arrangement between the linearized system and the remaining, normally neglected, nonlinear part. The linear system is reduced using a method similar to balanced truncation, but preserving bounds on the supply rate. The method involves balancing two algebraic Riccati equations. The bounds are then used to derive bounds on the turbulent energy production. An example of the application of the procedure to flow through a long straight pipe is presented. Comparison shows that the new method approximates the supply rate at least as well as, or better than, canonical balanced truncation. </jats:p>",

The near-optimal order quantities for each of the supply chain agents are calculated with a mathematical model in which the integrality constraints are relaxed. A number of instances were generated and tested. The results show the validity of the proposed approach.</p>",

We employed two indicators of MH – the K6 scale of Mental Illness (MI) and an indicator for symptoms of Mania or Delusions (M/D). Instrumental variable (IV) models used measures of social support as instruments for MI. Unadjusted work rates were higher for immigrants (vs US‐born adults). Regressions show that MI is associated with lower rates of work among US‐born males but not immigrant males and females; M/D is associated lower rates of work among US‐born males and females, and among immigrant males. Results did not change using IV models for MI. Most persons with MI work, yet symptom severity reduces labor supply among natives especially. Immigrants' labor supply is less affected by MI.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a framework that describes the boundary spanning supply chain management (SCM) initiatives taken by leading companies. Supported by existing literature and interviews with managers from large companies reflecting a cross section of businesses, the framework suggests four motivating domains or factors that could support SCM initiatives. They are supply chain understanding, design, improvement, and coordination. Based on the sand cone model, the framework also suggests four levels of SCM integration over which these motivating factors are relevant to the firm and/or supply chain. They range from no integration outside the functional silos of a single firm to a fully integrated multi‐tier supply chain. Unlike existing frameworks that are based upon the flow of material and information through the supply chain, our framework is derived by combining the concept of integration with the motivating domains that characterize SCM initiatives. It captures the combined and overlapping impact of supply chain initiatives from a more strategic perspective and is a useful additional resource for practitioners who seek to chart potential improvements to their supply chain from a competitive standpoint.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hotels in arid coastal areas use mainly desalinated water for their domestic water demands, and treated wastewater for irrigating green areas. Private water companies supply these hotels with their domestic water needs. There is normally a contractual agreement stating a minimum requirement that has to be supplied by the water company and that the hotel management has to pay for regardless of its actual consumption (“contracted-for water supply”). This paper describes a model to determine what value a hotel should choose for its contracted-for water supply in order to minimize its total annual water costs. An example from an arid coastal tourism-dominated city is presented: Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The managers of hotels with expected high occupancy rates (74% and above) can contract for more than 80%. On the other hand, hotels with expected lower occupancy rates (60% and less) can contract for less than 70% of the peak daily domestic water demand. With a green area ratio of 40 m2/room or less, an on-site wastewater treatment plant can satisfy the required irrigation demand for an occupancy rate as low as 42%. Increasing the ratio of green irrigated area to 100 m2/room does not affect the contracted-for water supply at occupancy rates above 72%; at lower occupancy rates, however, on-site treated wastewater is insufficient for irrigating the green areas. Increasing the green irrigated area to 120 m2/room increases the need for additional water, either from externally sourced treated wastewater or potable water. The cost of the former is much lower than the latter (0.58 versus 1.52 to 2.14 US$/m3 in the case study area).</jats:p>",

However, few studies have been done on the impact of such collaboration strategies at one of the lower short-term decision levels: production scheduling. This article is devoted to the study of information sharing between the members of a supply chain in a dynamic context. We consider a typical make-to-order direct sell supply chain without finished products inventory, similar to the one implemented by Internet PC sellers. We compare various scheduling algorithms implemented to study different scenarios of information sharing among the members of the chain. We have considered scenarios where no information is shared and scenarios where some or all information is shared. A simulation study is developed in order to get some insights about the impact of information sharing on the performance of the chain. Our results suggest improvement in the performance that shows the importance of collaboration and information sharing between the members of the chain.</p>",

In the present study, a novel quantitative approach developed for the inherent safety assessment of process flow diagrams in early design stages is presented. The output of the approach is a metric that quantifies the inherent safety fingerprint of the process scheme by a set of key performance indicators. Physical parameters are used for the quantification of the hazard deriving from materials, process conditions and equipment characteristics. The assessment resorts to the identification and modeling of credible accident consequences on humans and equipment. The adoption of tangible parameters based on consequence modeling yields a clear and sound picture of the inherent safety performance of a design option. An example of application focused on some envisaged options of the hydrogen supply chain (production, distribution, and utilization) is presented. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Process Saf Prog, 2009</jats:p>",

Supply chain scheduling: Batching and delivery. Oper. Res. 51(4) 566–584]. The supplier has to manufacture multiple products and deliver them to customers in batches. There is an associated delivery cost with each batch. The objective of the supplier is to minimize the total inventory holding and delivery costs. We present simple approximation algorithms for this strongly NP-hard problem, which find a solution that is guaranteed to have a cost at most 3/2 times the minimum. We also prove that the approximation algorithms have worst-case bounds that vary parametrically with the data and that for realistic parameter values are much better than 3/2. The theoretical results are also supported by the findings of a computational study. </jats:p>",

We combined logic from agency and real options theories to explain why the outcomes of technology commercialization are a function of licensing strategies, the autonomy of technology licensing offices (TLOs), and the incentives bestowed on scientists, research departments, and TLO officers. We rely on data from licensing surveys, interviews with 128 TLO directors, and – for convergent validity – from web‐based searches of the TLOs of American universities and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Results suggest that commercialization outcomes (in this case, revenue and start‐up creation) are enhanced when TLOs employ diverse licensing strategies, TLOs enjoy greater autonomy, universities share revenues with scientists' departments, and universities compensate TLOs officers well. Results also show that late entrants – typically underperforming universities – inflate royalty shares to scientists as a means to rectify their commercialization record. We conclude with a discussion of this study's contribution to the literature on innovation and technology commercialization.</jats:p>",

A GARCH process is used to estimate expected price and price volatility, while price and supply equations are estimated jointly. In addition to the standard GARCH model, several different symmetric, asymmetric, and nonlinear GARCH models are estimated. The empirical results indicate that among the estimated GARCH models, the quadratic NAGARCH model seems to better describe producers' price volatility, which was found to be an important risk factor of the supply response function of the Greek pork market. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that feed price is an important cost factor of the supply response function and that high uncertainty restricts the expansion of the Greek pork sector.

The major problems in the application of the linear induction motor are meandering of thin steel sheet by the electromagnetic force in the normal direction, the heating characteristic, and the evaluation of the thrust force as a tension. As a result of the investigation of the frequency characteristic by means of electromagnetic FEM calculation, it is confirmed that the electromagnetic force in the normal direction which consists of repelling force caused by the magnetization and repulsive force caused by Lorentz force becomes almost zero at the crossover frequency. In this frequency, the temperature of the steel sheet at the front and back have almost the same distribution. Since the tension value converted from the thrust force is about 10% of experiment equipment, the linear induction motor is also useful for the auxiliary function of the tension roll. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For the above challenges, the tradeoffs in terms of four key drivers of supply chain performance – transportation, inventory, information, and facilities and relate these to key measures of supply chain performance are described.

We find that the impact on overall labor supply is rather modest, but these modest changes shadow for stronger sectoral changes. The tax reform stimulated the women to shift their labor from the public to the private sector and to work longer hours. A calculation of mean compensated variation, calculated within the framework of a random utility model, shows that the richest households benefited far more from the 1992 tax reform than did the poorest households.</jats:p>",

To our knowledge, it is the first time that a standard CI has been constructed for this purpose. Econometric analysis of the determinants of variation in this index provides decision‐makers with an empirical focus for analyzing distributional aspects of the movie exhibition market, with particular emphasis on product differentiation. Specifically, (i) do cinemas based in a city area have a different or ‘specialized’ focus in contrast to cinemas in small towns? or (ii) do multiplexes have a different or more specialized focus in comparison with cinemas? To this end, cross‐sectional econometric models are estimated to help analyze these effects in three Italian regions for a sample of cinemas covering the 2006 season.

This article contributes to this literature by utilizing the 2000 wave of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to examine variation in husbands’ and wives’ relative income by race/ethnicity, human capital, labor supply, and life stage. The author finds that Black women’s disproportionate concentration among high relative earning wives can be attributed more to their greater attachment to paid labor than to their husbands’ labor supply. Nonetheless, Black women’s odds of earning as much as or more than their husbands are greater than those of White women. In addition, unlike research on the motherhood wage gap more generally, the author finds that the impact of motherhood on women’s earnings relative to their husbands can be largely explained by mothers’ lower labor supply relative to their childless counterparts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a supply chain where an upstream supplier auctions his inventory or capacity as a bundle. The importance of this setting is twofold: From a practical point of view, there are several examples, both in manufacturing (e.g., auctioning the capacity of a wafer fabrication facility) and service industries (e.g., auctioning the sponsorship of a website), where a supplier's capacity is sold as a single piece; from a theoretical side, it highlights the information asymmetry introduced on the downstream supply chain parties when the auction result is disclosed. </jats:p><jats:p> We formulate the problem as a two-stage supply chain comprising a single supplier and two resellers. Each reseller receives a signal of the consumer demand and bids for the capacity of the supplier. The supplier announces the winner as well as the auction price. Both resellers can get additional units in a procurement market and then engage in Cournot competition in the consumer market. </jats:p><jats:p> We analyze the impact of the information elicited by the supplier in the early stage of the game. We characterize sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium behavior, derive the equilibrium bidding functions under both first- and second-price auctions, and show that the bidding functions are lower than the corresponding ones for a single-shot auction without resale. Our computational experiments indicate that both the supplier and resellers are better off running a second-price auction and that consumers benefit if the resellers have very different signals on the total demand. Overall, our results suggest that traditional auctions may have a profound impact in the context of a supply chain because of the information disclosure in the upstream stages. </jats:p>",

In order to investigate N effects on WUE over a wider range of N‐supply levels, oriental tobacco was cultivated in pots under six (Exp. 1) and four (Exp. 2) N levels until flowering stage. Water‐use efficiency, intrinsic water‐use efficiency (A/g), carbon isotope discrimination (CID), average daily canopy transpiration rate (E<jats:sub>C</jats:sub>; from 12 to 7 d before harvest), and biomass‐partitioning parameters were determined. Water‐use efficiency increased from the lowest to the highest N level and was positively correlated with biomass. Intrinsic water‐use efficiency was positively correlated with leaf N and chlorophyll concentration. Whole‐plant CID was significantly less negative under high compared to low N supply. Biomass‐partitioning parameters were only slightly affected by N supply except for leaf‐area ratio, which significantly increased with N supply. The low planting density of Exp. 2 resulted in an increase of WUE and substantially less negative whole‐plant CID compared to Exp. 1. In both experiments, E<jats:sub>C</jats:sub> was lower under high compared to low N supply and was negatively correlated with WUE.

In designing these incentives it is apparent that customers’ preferences have rarely been obtained for consideration in the regulatory process. As a result, there is relatively limited understanding of customers’ willingness to pay for improved quality of electricity supply. Several studies have examined the willingness of households to pay for improved quality of electricity supply, however, few studies have examined the willingness of businesses to pay for improved quality of supply. In this study we use choice modelling with random parameters logit models to identify the willingness to pay of business for various service related attributes. Furthermore, we examine the values held by both service and manufacturing businesses, from both rural/regional and urban areas, and observe the differences between them. We find several differences in willingness to pay across business types and locations, however overall the value estimates are relatively homogeneous. </jats:p>",

However, arterial pressure level changes in a variety of conditions and it is not clear what mechanism readjusts the postulated set point. Alternatively, we propose that the circulatory system is, at a very fundamental level, a supply and demand system in which demand determines the overall flow of product through the system. In this model the interaction between autoregulatory mechanisms of the peripheral circulation and intrinsic mechanisms of the heart (Starling's Law) determine cardiac output. Arterial pressure is not a regulated variable. This model resembles a modified free‐market economic system in which central control mechanisms modify, rather than set, supply and demand. In principle, this model should be superior to a central command model in optimizing tissue homeostasis. .A model based on this principle predicts the observed effects of decreasing vascular resistance, static exercise and dynamic exercise on cardiac output and arterial pressure.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Historically, both the theory and practice of supply chain management have placed an emphasis on manufacturing and distribution operations, i.e., the forward channel, which consists of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Recently, increased attention to product recovery practices has extended the scope of traditional supply chain management by drawing attention to collection, demanufacturing, and remanufacturing operations, i.e., the reverse channel, which consists of final‐users, collectors, demanufacturers, and remanufacturers. To optimize the performance of the extended supply chain, there is a need to establish an effective and efficient infrastructure via optimal network design. As a result, network design for product recovery has attracted the attention of a growing number of researchers in the past decade. In an attempt to draw more academic attention to this area, this annotated bibliography provides a detailed account of the published literature. The article is organized into two main sections that focus on (i) reverse supply chain network design, which is concerned with establishing an infrastructure to manage the reverse channel only and (ii) closed‐loop supply chain network design, which is concerned with establishing an infrastructure to manage both forward and reverse channels in a coordinated manner. Specifically, we describe the operational characteristics of the underlying supply chain system considered in each paper, highlight the features of the network design model proposed therein, and discuss the proposed solution approach along with a brief description of significant computational work, if available. In conclusion, a critical review of the published literature is given and potential areas for future research are identified. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, 2009</jats:p>",

Samples also were collected from 28 monitoring wells in the UFA and the overlying surficial aquifer system (SAS) and intermediate confining unit located within the contributing recharge area to the PSW. Age tracer and geochemical data from the earlier stage of the study (2003 through 2005) were combined with new data (2006) on concentrations of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>), tritium (<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H), and helium‐3, which were consistent with binary mixtures of water for the PSW dominated by young water (less than 7 years). Water samples from the SAS also indicated mostly young water (less than 7 years); however, most water samples from monitoring wells in the UFA had lower SF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H concentrations than the PSW and SAS, indicating mixtures containing high proportions of older water (more than 60 years). Vulnerability of the PSW to contamination was indicated by predominantly young water and elevated nitrate‐N and volatile organic compound concentrations that were similar to those in the SAS. Elevated arsenic (As) concentrations (3 to 19 μg/L) and higher As(V)/As(III) ratios in the PSW than in water from UFA monitoring wells indicate that oxic water from the SAS likely mobilizes As from pyrite in the UFA matrix. Young water found in the PSW also was present in UFA monitoring wells that tap a highly transmissive zone (43‐ to 53‐m depth) in the UFA.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reconstruction of sediment supply is hampered by the incompleteness of the stratigraphic record. This problem may be partly circumvented by studying mass accumulation rates in closed systems, i.e., basins in which no sediment has bypassed the site of deposition over the time interval of interest. We present time‐averaged basin‐wide mass accumulation rates and their associated uncertainties from a well‐documented closed basin, the Northern Adriatic Basin (Italy), spanning the time interval from 19 ka B.P. to the present. The sediment masses of five basin‐wide lithosomes and their associated uncertainties are derived by means of stochastic simulation, using high‐resolution seismic data, porosity profiles, and radiocarbon datings. This study demonstrates that inferring rates of sediment supply from conformity‐bounded stratigraphic units is feasible, as indicated by the excellent agreement of our results of mass accumulation over the past 400 years with two independently derived estimates. Formation of the stratigraphic record is not an instantaneous process. By comparing spatial patterns of mass accumulation rates on three different timescales (decadal, centennial, and millennial) we demonstrate a low preservation potential of sediments presently accumulating near the coast, and a continuous cross‐shore and alongshore sediment transport regime. The change from transient to persistent accumulation patterns in the highstand systems tract of the Northern Adriatic Basin occurs at the centennial to millennial timescale. Intrabasinal erosion and recycling of sediments obscure the relation between rates of sediment supply and net basin‐wide mass accumulation, which limits the amount of information that can be extracted from the stratigraphic record. Hence, a mismatch between rates of sediment supply and accumulation rates is expected for unconformity‐bounded sequence‐stratigraphic units. Given the uncertainties associated with our estimates, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that net basin‐wide mass accumulation rates have been constant over the time interval of 19,000 years (at a 10% significance level).</jats:p>",

However, experiments in plant communities suggest that many communities are unsaturated and species richness can be increased by adding propagules of new species. We experimentally tested for community saturation and measured the effects of propagule supply on community structure in a benthic marine system. We manipulated propagule supply (arrival of individuals of numerous species) of mobile grazers in experimental mesocosms over multiple generations and, unlike previous tests, we examined the cascading effects of propagule supply on prey (macroalgae) biomass. We found little evidence for saturation, despite the absence of processes such as disturbance and predation that are thought to alleviate saturation in nature. Increasing propagule supply increased the total number of species and made rare species more abundant. Perhaps surprisingly, given the strong effect of propagule supply on species richness, supply-related changes in body size and composition suggest that competitive interactions remained important. Grazer supply also had strong cascading effects on primary production, possibly because of dietary complementarity modified by territorial behavior. Our results indicate that propagule supply can directly influence the diversity and composition of communities of mobile animals. Furthermore, the supply of consumer propagules can have strong indirect effects on prey and fundamental ecosystem properties.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Procurement of a dc −1 MV power supply system for the ITER neutral beam injector (NBI) is shared by Japan and the EU. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency as the Japan Domestic Agency (JADA) for ITER contributes to the procurement of dc −1 MV ultra-high voltage (UHV) components such as a dc −1 MV generator, a transmission line and a −1 MV insulating transformer for the ITER NBI power supply. The inverter frequency of 150 Hz in the −1 MV power supply and major circuit parameters have been proposed and adopted in the ITER NBI. The dc UHV insulation has been carefully designed since dc long pulse insulation is quite different from conventional ac insulation or dc short pulse systems. A multi-layer insulation structure of the transformer for a long pulse up to 3600 s has been designed with electric field simulation. Based on the simulation the overall dimensions of the dc UHV components have been finalized. A surge energy suppression system is also essential to protect the accelerator from electric breakdowns. The JADA contributes to provide an effective surge suppression system composed of core snubbers and resistors. Input energy into the accelerator from the power supply can be reduced to about 20 J, which satisfies the design criteria of 50 J in total in the case of breakdown at −1 MV.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>River beds are often arranged into patches of similar grain size and sorting. Patches can be distinguished into “free patches,” which are zones of sorted material that move freely, such as bed load sheets; “forced patches,” which are areas of sorting forced by topographic controls; and “fixed patches” of bed material rendered immobile through localized coarsening that remain fairly persistent through time. Two sets of flume experiments (one using bimodal, sand‐rich sediment and the other using unimodal, sand‐free sediment) are used to explore how fixed and free patches respond to stepwise reductions in sediment supply. At high sediment supply, migrating bed load sheets formed even in unimodal, sand‐free sediment, yet grain interactions visibly played a central role in their formation. In both sets of experiments, reductions in supply led to the development of fixed coarse patches, which expanded at the expense of finer, more mobile patches, narrowing the zone of active bed load transport and leading to the eventual disappearance of migrating bed load sheets. Reductions in sediment supply decreased the migration rate of bed load sheets and increased the spacing between successive sheets. One‐dimensional morphodynamic models of river channel beds generally are not designed to capture the observed variability, but should be capable of capturing the time‐averaged character of the channel. When applied to our experiments, a 1‐D morphodynamic model (RTe‐bookAgDegNormGravMixPW.xls) predicted the bed load flux well, but overpredicted slope changes and was unable to predict the substantial variability in bed load flux (and load grain size) because of the migration of mobile patches. Our results suggest that (1) the distribution of free and fixed patches is primarily a function of sediment supply, (2) the dynamics of bed load sheets are primarily scaled by sediment supply, (3) channels with reduced sediment supply may inherently be unable to transport sediment uniformly across their width, and (4) cross‐stream variability in shear stress and grain size can produce potentially large errors in width‐averaged sediment flux calculations.</jats:p>",

Discussions of this problem have assumed that psychologists hold negative attitudes toward rural work for many reasons, leading to a supply shortage. The present study attempts to examine the accuracy of this hypothesis by examining attitudes of current doctoral students in clinical psychology. Eight hundred eighty‐four students responded to an online survey. Results indicate that attitudes toward rural practice were not overwhelmingly negative as predicted. Additionally, a significant number of respondents endorsed positive attitudes toward rural practice. A follow‐up study was conducted to determine if the shortage of rural psychologists might be attributed to a lack of demand from rural employers. A search of three popular job resources revealed that few rural jobs were advertised, indicating weak demand for psychologists in rural areas. Results indicate that efforts to recruit psychologists to rural areas should be rethought, and increasing the visibility of available opportunities for psychologists should be made a priority. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The findings illustrate that the complexity of data consumption patterns drove increased interdependence within the financial information supply chain requiring the co‐operative development of context sensitive data exchanges and commodity‐like IT infrastructures. The paper concludes that the co‐operative model to IOS development exhibited here is likely to be more suited to the development of systems for financial information supply chains than the hub and spoke model characteristic of IOS in other sectors.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In organic farming systems, it has been demonstrated that grain pulses such as peas often do not enhance soil N supply to the following crops. This may be due to large N removals <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> harvested grains as well as N‐leaching losses during winter. In two field‐trial series, the effects of legume (common vetch, hairy vetch, peas) and nonlegume (oil radish) cover crops (CC), and mixtures of both, sown after peas, on soil nitrate content, N uptake, and yield of following potatoes or winter wheat were studied. The overall objective of these experiments was to obtain detailed information on how to influence N availability after main‐crop peas by adapting cover‐cropping strategies. Cover crops accumulated 56 to 108 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> in aboveground biomass, and legume CC fixed 30–70 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1 </jats:sup>by N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation, depending on the soil N supply and the length of the growing period of the CC. Nitrogen concentration in the aboveground biomass of legume CC was much higher and the C : N ratio much lower than in the nonlegume oil radish CC. At the time of CC incorporation (wheat series) as well as at the end of the growing season (potato series), soil nitrate content did not differ between the nonlegume CC species and mixtures, whereas pure stands of legume CC showed slightly increased soil nitrate content. When the CC were incorporated in autumn (beginning of October) nitrate leaching increased, especially from leguminous CC. However, most of the N leached only into soil layers down to 1.50 m and was recovered more or less by the following winter wheat. When CC were incorporated in late winter (February) no increase in nitrate leaching was observed. In spring, N availability for winter wheat or potatoes was much greater after legumes and, after mixtures containing legumes, resulting in significantly higher N uptake and yields in both crops. In conclusion, autumn‐incorporated CC mixtures of legumes and nonlegumes accomplished both: reduced nitrate leaching and larger N availability to the succeeding crop. When the CC were incorporated in winter and a spring‐sown main crop followed even pure stands of legume CC were able to achieve both goals.</jats:p>",

The number of food inventory items at the beginning of each month was significantly higher than at the end of the month (Month 1: 83.6 vs. 65.9; Month 2: 83.7 vs. 68.1; p=0.01). With the exemption of oils, the numbers of food inventory items by food groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, meat &amp; beans, and oils) were significantly higher at the beginning of both months. The biggest difference was observed in the meat &amp; beans group (Month 1: 10.3 vs. 6.9; Month 2: 10.4 vs. 7.5; p=0.01). These findings indicate that food insecure households may suffer monthly cycles with drastic decreases of the food supply by the end of the month.

Even if the compliance rate increased, limited endoscopic capacity and cost would be prohibitive. There is a need for an accurate method to target colonoscopy to those most at risk of harboring colonic neoplasia. Exploiting field carcinogenesis seems to be a promising avenue. Our group recently reported that an early increase in blood supply (EIBS) is a reliable marker of field carcinogenesis in experimental models. We now investigate whether in situ detection of EIBS in the rectum can predict neoplasia elsewhere in the colon.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experimental Design: We developed a novel polarization-gated spectroscopy fiber-optic probe that allows depth-selective interrogation of microvascular blood content. Using the probe, we examined the blood content in vivo from the rectal mucosa of 216 patients undergoing screening colonoscopy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Microvascular blood content was increased by ∼50% in the endoscopically normal rectal mucosa of patients harboring advanced adenomas when compared with neoplasia-free patients irrespective of lesion location. Demographic factors and nonneoplastic lesions did not confound this observation. Logistic regression using mucosal oxyhemoglobin concentration and patient age resulted in a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 82%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 for the detection of advanced adenomas.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: Increased microvascular blood supply in the normal rectal mucosa is associated with the presence of clinically significant neoplasia elsewhere in the colon, supporting the development of rectal EIBS as a colon cancer risk-stratification tool.</jats:p>",

In this study, own-rooted 10-month-old tea trees were supplied three times weekly for 17 weeks with 500 mL of nutrient solution at a P concentration of 0, 40, 80, 160, 400 or 1000 μM.

The expansion has occurred both within the Arctic as well as by the colonization of temperate areas. Studies of performance of individuals in expanding populations provide information on how well species can adapt to novel environments and global warming. We, therefore, studied the availability of high quality food as well as timing of reproduction, wing moult, fledgling production and postfledging survival of individually marked geese in three recently established populations: one Arctic (Barents Sea) and two temperate (Baltic, North Sea). In the Barents Sea population, timing of hatching was synchronized with the peak in food availability and there was strong stabilizing selection. Although birds in the Baltic and North Sea populations bred 6–7 weeks earlier than Arctic birds, timing of hatching was late in relation to the peak in food availability, and there was moderate to strong directional selection for early breeding. In the Baltic, absolute timing of egg laying advanced considerably over the 20‐year study period, but advanced little relative to spring phenology, and directional selection on lay date increased over time. Wing moult of adults started only 2–4 weeks earlier in the temperate populations than in the Arctic. Synchronization between fledging of young and end of wing moult decreased in the temperate populations. Arctic‐breeding geese may gradually accumulate body stores from the food they encounter during spring migration, which allows them to breed relatively early and their young to use the peak of the Arctic food resources. By contrast, temperate‐breeding birds are not able to acquire adequate body stores from local resources early enough, that is before the quality of food for their young starts to decrease. When global temperatures continue to rise, Arctic‐breeding barnacle geese might encounter similar problems.</jats:p>",

Apoptosis was indicated by a 3‐fold increase in <jats:italic>Bad</jats:italic> labeling and a 72% decrease in <jats:italic>Bcl‐2</jats:italic> labeling. In addition, microvessel density within the treated tumors fell by 93%. This new therapy utilizing nanosecond pulsed electric fields has the advantages of highly localized targeting of tumor cells and a total exposure time of only 180 μsec. These pulses penetrate into the interior of every tumor cell and initiate DNA fragmentation and apoptosis while at the same time reducing blood flow to the tumor. This new physical tumor therapy is drug free, highly localized, uses low energy, has no significant side effects and results in very little scarring. © 2009 UICC</jats:p>",
