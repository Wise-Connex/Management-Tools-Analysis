A model is developed to provide a structural base for estimating response relationships that encompass these dimensions. The model rests on assumptions of rational producer behavior which takes account of possible actions of other producers and of the aggregate effect of these actions on total production and profits. Because important data series often are not available, modifications of the basic model are suggested to facilitate estimation within a more restricted empirical framework. The model is illustrated by an application to asparagus, a perennial vegetable crop.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A high voltage power supply has been constructed for use with the ORNL Superconducting Microscope described elsewhere in these proceedings. A simplified schematic diagram of the system is shown in Figure 1. The regulator circuit employs a “bouncer” with a cathode-follower output. This configuration results in a low output impedance and the bouncer can thus drive a load capacitance over a wider bandwidth than the conventional common-cathode circuit. The voltage divider for the regulator is a dual unit originally developed to determine the stability of resistive high-voltage dividers. A dual capacitive divider is an integral part of the voltage divider as shown in Figure 1. The dual units have proven to be very useful in practice since one divider may be used in the regulator while the second is used to monitor the noise present on the high voltage. Mercury cells are used as reference elements in the regulator. Wide-band noise on the output is about one ppm at present. Modifications are now under way to eliminate at least two of the known sources of noise in the system.</jats:p>",

Improved Pelican, L.Z. and Pennsoy were grown at 30/20 deg C day/night temperatures and under the prevailing natural photoperiod (16.2, 14.2 and 12.7 h in July, Aug. and Sept., respectively) or a controlled 12-h photoperiod. Plants were given 25, 50, 75 or 100% of a standard water application. In a further laboratory experiment, rates of photosynthesis and transpiration were determined under different light intensities. DM production, seed production, water consumption and the rate of photosynthesis did not differ between cv. and there was a rectilinear relationship between seed production and DM production and between DM production and water consumption. Plants given a &gt;12-h daylength did not flower. In the controlled 12-h daylength, productivity/unit of water consumption was smaller than in the prevailing daylength. The rate of photosynthesis was somewhat lower than the rate presented by de Wit for most agricultural crops and the relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration was curvilinear for short periods.

Applied through a share payment to government, private marginal costs are increased and supply is decreased. The government also has a food fund to be used for aid or similar purposes. The mechanism requires neither government payments nor compulsory market quotas to lessen supply. However, compulsory sharing is necessary to prevent “free riders.” Variants of the mechanism would include a gross sales tax collected in conjunction with income taxes. The mechanism provides a policy alternative with interesting potentials in income distribution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One- or 2-year-old Golden Delicious apple trees on M.IX were grown either in a clay loam (in 60-1 containers) or in nutrient solution and the effects were studied of several aeration regimes. With the soil-grown trees these comprised flooding to various soil depths and for different times. With the trees grown in nutrient solution the aeration regimes compared were nutrient solution without aeration, tap water with or without aeration, and aerated nutrient solution (control). Shoot growth was depressed by high water tables, and that of trees receiving non-aerated nutrient solution or tap water (whether aerated or not) ceased after about 2 weeks. The root growth of trees receiving non-aerated nutrient solution or tap water was similarly depressed, but, by contrast, aerated tap water enhanced root growth. Details are given of treatment effects on the Ca, K, N and soluble sugar contents of the young and old leaves and of the young roots. The uptake of all mineral elements was similarly affected by lack of aeration, suggesting that the relationship between low Ca content and increased bitter pit incidence is not associated with differential absorption but rather with differential Ca distribution.
