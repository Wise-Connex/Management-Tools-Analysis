In the case of a SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mask with width of more than 20 µm, lateral vapor-phase diffusion dominated over increment of selective epilayers because of short surface-diffusion length on SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> surfaces (&lt;1 µm). It was apparent experimentally and analytically that long ridged tails of selective epilayers were formed by lateral vapor-phase diffusion. Appearance of wavelike tails at mask edges was due to surface diffusion from (111)B facets. Surface-diffusion length on (111)B surfaces was estimated at 3 µm. \n </jats:p>",

While designed for probabilistic outlooks, it is assessed for giving deterministic outlooks along with other net basin supply forecast methods of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Environment Canada, and with a stochastic approach commissioned by the Corps. The methods are compared to a simple clima‐tological forecast and to actual time series of net basin supplies. Aetual net basin supplies are currently determined by estimating all components directly, instead of as water‐balance residuals. This is judged more accurate and appropriate for both forecasting and simulation. GLERL's physically‐based method forecasts component supplies while the other methods are based on residual supplies. These other methods should be rederived to be based on component supplies. For each of these other methods, differences between their outlooks and residual supplies are used as error estimates for the rederived methods and component supplies. The evaluations are made over a recent period of record high levels followed by a record drought. Net basin supply outlooks are better than climatology, and GLERL's physically‐based method performs best with regard to either component or residual net basin supplies. Until advances are made in long‐range climate outlooks, deterministic supply outlooks cannot be improved significantly.</jats:p>",

Parameters for the duration, growth, and the efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance (ECI) of each instar were established for seven different dietary regimes. Larvae that had a suboptimal food supply in the first instar had a significantly longer developmental time, gained significantly less weight, and had a slightly lower ECI in that instar larvae. Suboptimally‐fed second less, but remained only slightly longer in that instar and had a similar ECI to optimally‐fed second instar larvae. The developmental time of suboptimally‐fed third instar larvae was similar to that of optimally‐fed larvae of that stage. Whereas the growth of the former was significantly less than that of larvae optimally fed in that instar, the ECI of the former was significantly higher. Despite the relatively smaller size of larvae fed suboptimally in the first and/or second instar, when such larvae were subsequently supplied with an overabundance of prey eggs, they consumed approximately the same number of eggs during the remainder of their larval life as did larvae whose food supply had not been restricted previously. When larvae were allowed to consume different numbers of eggs in their third instar, their gain in weight and therefore the weights attained by the resulting adults (based on the weights of 3‐day‐old cocoons) had a highly significant positive correlation with the number of eggs consumed in this instar.</jats:p>",
