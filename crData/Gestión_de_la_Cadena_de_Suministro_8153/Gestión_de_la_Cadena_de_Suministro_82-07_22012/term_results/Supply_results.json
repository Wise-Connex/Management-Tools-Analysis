Data obtained on the lead content of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and shellfish indicate that the mean levels in these unprocessed foods varied from 0.02 to about 0.4 ppm, with the lowest level in milk. The major food processing source of lead in food is the lead-soldered can. FDA had assigned top priority to the reduction of lead in foods for infants because of their greater susceptibility to the toxic effects of this metal. The lead levels in foods for infants are now only 1/5 to 1/10 of what they were when FDA expressed its concern about lead to the manufacturers of canned infant formula, evaporated milk, canned infant juices, and glass-packed infant foods. FDA priority interest has now shifted to reduction of lead in adult canned foods, especially those eaten by young children. The mean levels in such foods have decreased from 0.35-0.40 ppm in 1974 to 0.20-0.25 ppm in 1980.</jats:p>",

The sources of vascular supply to the dog’s coxofemoral joint, from most to least contributory, were the lateral circumflex femoral artery, the medial circumflex femoral artery, the caudal gluteal artery, the cranial gluteal artery, and the iliolumbar artery.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In addition, important vascular relationships were demonstrated. Many blood vessels were associated with the periosteal surfaces of the coxofemoral joint in areas of muscular and articular capsular attachment; fewer vessels were present in areas of loose periosteal attachment.

The extracapsular vascular ring was formed by branches of the lateral and medial circumflex femoral and caudal gluteal arteries.</jats:p>",

A solution for a one‐dimensional time‐dependent model is given. Experiments were conducted in 3‐m long channels of a homogeneous nutrient solution. Predicted results agreed with the measured data. For cases in which the Michaelis‐Menten inhibition factor is much smaller than the initial ion concentration, the time dependence of the depletion curve can be approximated by a linear form, which when expressed in terms of dimensionless variables is the same for all ions. The model suggests an algorithm for a number of decisions that should be taken through the process of fertilization. Finally, when extended to the use of saline water under evaporative conditions, the model determines explicitly the worst quality irrigation water that can be used.</jats:p>",

Phosphate-limited bacteria were deficient in wall teichoic acid and contained less than half as much cellular phosphate as did bacteria grown in excess of phosphate. Approximately 70% of the additional phosphate in the latter bacteria was present as wall teichoic acid, indicating that the ability of the bacteria to discontinue teichoic acid synthesis when grown under phosphate limitation permits a substantial increase in their growth yield. Since not all of the additional phosphate is present as wall teichoic acid other cellular phosphates may also be present in reduced amounts in the phosphate-limited bacteria. The content of phosphate groups in walls of magnesium-limited bacteria was similar to the content of uronic acid groups in walls of phosphate-limited bacteria, and walls of bacteria grown in media of intermediate composition contained intermediate proportions of the two anionic polymers. Phage SP50, used as a marker for the presence of teichoic acid, bound densely to nearly all of the bacteria in samples containing down to 22% of the maximum content of teichoic acid. Apparently, therefore, nearly all of these bacteria contain teichoic acid, and the population does not consist of a mixture of individuals having exclusively one kind of anionic polymer. Bacteria containing less than 22% of the maximum content of teichoic bound in a nonuniform manner, and possible explanations for this are discussed.</jats:p>",
