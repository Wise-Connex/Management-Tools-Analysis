This has had major repercussions on all sectors of the book trade but the library sector is the segment most affected by its change. This article looks at how the collapse of the NBA has led to major changes in the competitive environment of library supply. It achieves this through the application of a well established model of competition in business strategy. The article concludes that there have been major changes in the competitive environment of library supply and these have had a knock‐on effect on industry profitability. The industry is still highly unstable with the new rules of the game yet to be established. Firms need to identify how their own position in the industry has changed and develop a strategy to make any new rules work in their favour.</jats:p>",

The Sterns owned real property in the town that was served by privately owned well water. The municipality ordered the Sterns to connect to the municipal water supply. They refused and brought this suit alleging that the mandatory connection requirement was unconstitutional because it was a taking of their property without just compensation and unlawfully forced them into an unwanted contract. The trial court ruled against the Sterns. The appellate court said that the challenged ordinance's goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of township inhabitants was plainly in the public interest. The potential harms of private wells ‐ carcinogenic radon, salt from road‐salting stockpiles, pesticides, fertilizers, and bacteria‐laden waste ‐ amply justify government action to safeguard citizens. Mandatory connection to public water is a legitimate exercise of the police power, the court said. The court also concluded that the ordinance did not result in a compensable taking of the Sterns' property. The lower court decision was affirmed.</jats:p>",

Such arrangements are integral to the structure of Japanese business networks (Gerlach, 1993), and they have also been a companion to Japanese direct investment in overseas manufacturing facilities. In the auto industry, Japanese companies initially used parts from Japan in the new assembly plants built in North America in the 1980s. But, since then, they have steadily increased the percentage of parts purchased from U.S.-located suppliers of both U.S. and Japanese ownership (Kenney and Florida, 1993; Mair, 1993). In the process, some of these Japanese companies have taken the unusual step of working extensively with their suppliers to teach them “lean production”often by sending their own employees into supplier plants for weeks or months to redesign work stations, reorganize process flow, modify equipment, and establish problem-solving groups.</jats:p>",

It briefly explores how the structure of the automotive supply chain is changing due to the pressures of increasing complexity and urgency. Then it highlights the inevitability of instability in the supply chain, through an evaluation of turbulence. Agility is identified as a response for coping with this uncertainty. The tool identified for introducing agility in the supply chain is Virtual Teaming. It achieves this by forming collaborative supply chain partnerships, unconstrained by geography that can quickly apply knowledge and expertise as corrective and preventive mechanisms. A survey of the suppliers to a major automotive manufacturer has highlighted the need for this form of working.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply Chain Management (SCM) has recently become a popular theme at management conferences and in international journals. However, the concept is not well defined and only implemented in relatively few companies in Europe, typically large, multinational companies. Also, research and educational programs within SCM are exceptional at most European business schools and universities. One reason may be that SCM is a new discipline without established theoretical frameworks and generally accepted methodologies. The paper begins with a definition of supply chain management and discusses the need for a new paradigm for logistics research. It then introduces three different theoretical perspectives on supply chain management: the transaction cost approach; the network perspective; and, the resource‐based view. The three perspectives represent an economic, a sociological and a strategic approach to an analysis of supply chain management. In combination, these approaches can provide logistics researchers and managers with a strong conceptual framework for analyzing supply chain management in theory and practice. This is illustrated by a discussion of two strategic supply chain issues: managing a portfolio of supplier relationships and third‐ logistics.</jats:p>",

However, to maximize improvement in supply chain dynamics, information flow is equally important. Many of the problems exhibited in the material flow pipeline are the result of the distortion of marketplace sales information as it is transferred upstream through the supply chain. This research expands on the traditional material decoupling point methodology and establishes the role of an information decoupling point within the supply chain. The authors demonstrate the business opportunities generated by first recognizing the existence of the supply chain information decoupling point and then learning how to utilize it to gain strategic advantage. In order to make sensible planning and delivery decisions, a business must be able to separate out contingency from real orders as they move upstream from the marketplace. It is the basis for supply chains moving towards continuous flow and away from point‐to‐point movements and ultimately, where appropriate, to holistic control.</jats:p>",

Inventory holding costs are charged at each stage, and each stage may incur a consumer backorder penalty cost, e.g. the upper stage (the supplier) may dislike backorders at the lower stage (the retailer). We consider two games. In both, the stages independently choose base stock policies to minimize their costs. The games differ in how the firms track their inventory levels (in one, the firms are committed to tracking echelon inventory; in the other they track local inventory). We compare the policies chosen under this competitive regime to those selected to minimize total supply chain costs, i.e., the optimal solution. We show that the games (nearly always) have a unique Nash equilibrium, and it differs from the optimal solution. Hence, competition reduces efficiency. Furthermore, the two games' equilibria are different, so the tracking method influences strategic behavior. We show that the system optimal solution can be achieved as a Nash equilibrium using simple linear transfer payments. The value of cooperation is context specific: In some settings competition increases total cost by only a fraction of a percent, whereas in other settings the cost increase is enormous. We also discuss Stackelberg equilibria. </jats:p>",

Because of the large number of potential actions and the nonconvexity of the decision space, it is quite difficult to find nondominated subsets of actions. Instead, a modified goal programming technique is suggested to identify promising subsets.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Redesigns of supply chains have been largely limited to the differentiation of delivery processes to offer customers different delivery lead‐times on different products. In the future, differentiation will go much deeper, back into the supply chains within and across companies. Companies, together with partner companies in a supply chain, will increasingly have to design business processes that meet many different kinds of customer needs. This article describes how differentiated service will be realized through the reconstruction of the traditional sales and fulfillment cycle, whereby the traditional process is broken down and reconstructed in a manner that maximizes the overall efficiency of the chain. The article is based on the results of a year‐long study to develop supply chain improvements within two sectors ‐ electrical installations and pharmaceuticals. Distinctive aspects of this study were that it looked at supply chains that connected three echelons of independent companies in a project environment. The major players in the industries were involved in the project. The article describes three elements for reconstructing the sales and fulfillment cycle: i) reallocating activities to most efficient players; ii) reallocating inventory to reduce duplication; and, iii) using knowledge of end‐user demand to streamline (parts of) the supply chain. The article also examines two barriers to implementation and how to deal with these: the need for openness between supply chain partners; and the fact that current systems cannot handle the degree of differentiation and cooperation required.</jats:p>",

Two broad sets of potential factors are considered: characteristics of\na woman which influence her desire for children and thus her propensity to\nuse contraception, and factors relating to the family planning service\nenvironment in which she lives. The results from a multivariate analysis show\nthat certain individual characteristics, such as family composition and\neducation, have a strong impact on the level of contraceptive use and on the\nproportion of total demand for spacing or limiting childbearing that is met\nby use of family planning. Unmet need, however, remains fairly constant\nacross demographic and socioeconomic subgroups of the population. The\nlargest variations in unmet need are regional, but elements of the family\nplanning services, namely the provision of a community-based nurse who\ndistributes family planning and female doctors at clinics, also play an\nimportant role.</jats:p>",

Our objective was to determine, under field conditions, the effect of timing and method of termination on the pattern of N release from perennial alfalfa, and on N uptake and yield of subsequent wheat crops. Four field experiments were initiated on perennial alfalfa (<jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic>L.) in southern Manitoba in 1992 and 1993. A factorial of three methods (herbicide, tillage, herbicide + tillage) and two times of termination (early summer, after first alfalfa cut, and late summer, after second alfalfa cut) was arranged in a randomized complete block design. A spring‐applied herbicide treatment was also included. Spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic>L.) was established after alfalfa termination. Soil NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>content, plant N uptake, and yield were then monitored for one to two years. In three of four experiments, plant‐available N in the spring after termination was higher in tilled treatments than in treatments receiving only herbicides. Regardless of method, plant‐available N in the spring after termination was reduced when termination was delayed from early to late season. Despite the lower short‐term plant‐available N supply in early‐ and late‐summer herbicide treatments, wheat yields in herbicide treatments were similar to or greater than those in tillage treatments. Differences in the N content among treatments diminished with time; by the fall of the second growing season after termination, differences in the cumulative available N supply were no longer evident. These results suggest that termination of alfalfa with herbicides may improve the synchrony between N release and N demand of a subsequent spring wheat crop, thereby improving N use efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deposition and subsequent preservation of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Etjo Sandstone Formation of Namibia represents a complex interplay between climatic and tectonic factors and related variations in extrabasinal sediment supply. The aeolian and fluvial deposits indicate semi-arid to arid climatic conditions throughout the deposition of four distinct sedimentary units. The succession records either an upward increase in aridity or an upward increase in aeolian sediment supply, represented by a transition from a fluvially dominated basal unit, through a marginal fluvial-aeolian unit to an exclusively aeolian unit. A combination of inherited palaeotopography and syndepositional extensional faulting provided the space necessary for the accumulation of much of the succession. A basinwide unconformity (super surface) divides the succession. This hiatus resulted partly from a lack of available preservation space and partly from a shutdown in aeolian activity related to a regional climatic reorganization. A subsequent shift in the palaeowind direction from northwesterly to southwesterly exploited sand reserves in the Paraná Basin of South America and led to the resumption of aeolian sedimentation across the region. Variations in preserved bedform thickness were directly controlled by differential amounts of tectonic subsidence across the basin. A second major super surface towards the top of the succession resulted from the regional shutdown of large tracts of the aeolian system following the eruption of Etendeka flood basalts across the region.</jats:p>",

Predictor variables include changes in rates of inflation; technological, cyclical, and frictional unemployment; arrest rates for property crimes disaggregated by race (ARPCDR); the interaction of ARPCDR and technological unemployment (to test effects of rising unemployment on whites versus blacks); and a measure of police provisioning. A Beach‐MacKinnon Full Maximum‐Likelihood FGLS AR1 Method (accompanied by residual analysis) is employed. Significant positive effects are established for (a) inflation, (b) cyclical unemployment, (c) frictional unemployment, and (d) the interaction of white arrest rates and technological unemployment. Police provisioning is not found to be significant. Policy implications are explored along with future policy considerations.</jats:p>",
