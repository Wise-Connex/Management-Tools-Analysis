Approximately 400 supply systems were sampled from 1961‐66. Samples were taken from the final effluent of a treatment plant or well discharge. The ratio of groundwater to surface water supplies was approximately 1:2, as was the ratio of untreated to treated supplies. The chemical data were compiled by state and U.S. Public Health Service laboratories.</jats:p>",
