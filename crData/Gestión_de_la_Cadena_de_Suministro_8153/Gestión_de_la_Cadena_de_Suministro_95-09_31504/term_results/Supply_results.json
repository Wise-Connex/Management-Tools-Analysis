This continued until 1923, when the situation was brought under a degree of control by a coup d’etat and restrictions on public expenditure. The economic crisis of 1929–33 saw a sharp fall in prices and a further change in the general direction of policy from a broadly free market to intensive state intervention. This included state controls on the prices of grain and some industrial products, the creation of state monopoly enterprises, and intervention in the exchange regime and in foreign trade. The inter‐war periods also saw the emergence of a central bank with responsibility for the note issue.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We performed supplemental feeding experiments during three breeding seasons of the Blue Tit (Parus caeruleus L.) in order to establish the importance of food in reproductive timing. In particular, we addressed the question of why the response to supplemental food is restricted to 3—6 d in many bird species. Supplemental food advanced the start of egg—laying in all three breeding seasons. The mean difference between fed and control pairs was 4 d in two years and 6 d in another. The amount and quality of the supplemental food used in the experiment were not limiting, since pairs receiving a further increase in amount and quality of food did not start laying earlier than pairs with a standard feeding regime. The amount of food that was consumed increased during the period from 15 d before egg formation until the beginning of egg formation and then remained at a high utilization rate until clutch completion. Although fed pairs, on average, started egg—laying earlier than control pairs, the earliest control females started to lay eggs as early as the first females. Fed pairs were also relatively late in a year when control pairs were late. In 1992, fed pairs did not produce larger clutches or more fledglings, but had nestlings with lower mass at 13 d post—hatching than those of control pairs. Analysis at the territory level revealed that supplemental food affected laying date to a greater extent in low—quality territories, in which laying could be advanced by up to 9—10 d, compared to high—quality territories in which laying was not advanced at all. We conclude that laying date in most Blue Tit females is limited by low food supply early in spring, but some females, occupying high—quality territories, will not advance laying in response to food. Thus, above a certain critical limit, laying date is unrelated to food supply, and birds use other cues in their decision to commence breeding. Such cues are probably also responsible for the between—year variation in laying dates of food—supplemented pairs, since these were provided with the same amount of food during the different years.</jats:p>",

The contamination originated from leaking underground storage tanks and gasoline lines, which were removed. A pilot study indicated the contaminated area extended to 240′ x 180′ and affected soil as well as groundwater. A remediation plan was designed by and implemented by Continental Remediation Systems, Inc., a Natick, Massachusetts, firm. The remediation plan is ongoing and includes an interceptor trench to stop gasoline from flowing into the creek, as well as air sparging to vent and treat the contaminated soil. It is anticipated that the remediation project will take six months to complete. The chief advantage of on‐site remediation is that it avoids the costs and liabilities associated with landfill disposal and no materials need leave the site.</jats:p>",

The objectives were to provide early warning of a deterioration in the food and nutrition situation and identify particularly vulnerable groups so that action could be taken to prevent potential undernutrition and target resources to the most needy. Before the cease‐fire, which came into effect at the end of February 1994, trends in various indicators (weight loss, decline of household food stocks, rising food prices, reduction in food aid distribution, sale of possessions) suggested that the situation was deteriorating. Access to food improved as a result of the cease‐fire, however, which was reflected in improvements in indicators of food security and weight gain. The impact of, and response to, the food emergency differed between individuals, households and locations; the elderly were found to be more nutritionally vulnerable than children or adults, households with the least access to resources were the most food insecure, while the city of Zenica appeared to be particularly hard hit. The findings show the effects of an uncertain and reduced food supply on a previously well‐fed healthy population in an industrialised country. The value and constraints of an Early Warning System set up to monitor trends in an emergency in a European context are discussed.</jats:p>",

Prominent footwall escarpments within the rift are created by E–W-trending normal faults, and variations in the topography of these escarpments are related to fault segmentation and bedrock lithology. Drainage catchments within the rift are classified on the basis of morphology, area, bedrock lithology and relationship to fault geometries. Five drainage domains can be identified within the Sperchios rift: (i) footwall, (ii) hanging wall, (iii) transfer zone, (iv) axial and (v) karst domains. Bedrock lithology has a major control on the size of catchments in all drainage domains. In addition, topographic lows associated with transfer zones along the border fault are sites of major drainage catchments and act as conduits for sediment supply to the rift. Variations in drainage catchments, the resultant sediment supply and accommodation development along the rift produce a range of stratigraphic architectures. Along fault segments, low sediment supply and high subsidence rates lead to aggradational sequence sets, whereas progradational sequence sets develop at transfer zones where rates of sedimentation are high and the rate of subsidence is low.</jats:p>",

In this study, the vascular response to eroding polylactide‐polyglycolide copolymer threads was observed chronically in a bone chamber implant, with use of intravital microscopy. A bone chamber implant loaded with 100 μm thick polylactide‐polyglycolide threads was implanted into the right tibia in 15 mature female New Zealand White rabbits. Periodic intravital microscopic observations were performed from the third to the tenth or twelfth week after implantation. Vascularization, blood flow, and trabecular growth into the chambers from the medial cortex were recorded on videotape and analyzed using digital image processing. A statistically significant delay of neo‐osteogenesis in the presence of this copolymer was described in an earlier report. The present report describes the measures of neoangiogenesis and blood supply; there was a significant delay in neoangiogenesis. It is suggested that both delayed angiogenesis and osteogenesis were secondary consequences of the macrophage response to slowly eroding poly‐<jats:sc>L</jats:sc>‐lactide crystal nanoparticles and the influence of reduced nutrient exchange. The lesser effect on blood supply and vascular volume fraction was seen to be linked to the slowing down of angiogenesis, as the latter allowed vessels to mature, with a widening of their calibers. This homeostatic adjustment was interpreted as being only partially successful in restoring control levels of oxygen delivery, because resulting increases in vessel surface area did not reach control levels. Thus, in the presence of eroding polylactide‐polyglycolide, the oxygen supply and extravasation of other nutrients may be below normal during healing phases when the need is critical.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measurements of dissolved methane in the surface waters of the western Sea of Okhotsk are evaluated in terms of methane exchange rates and are used to assess the magnitude of seasonal variations of methane fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere in this area. Methane concentrations northeast of Sakhalin were observed to range from 385 nmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> under the ice cover in winter to 6 nmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the icefree midsummer season. The magnitude of supersaturations indicates that this part of the Okhotsk Sea is a significant source for atmospheric methane. From the seasonal variation of the supersaturations in the surface waters it is evident that the air‐sea exchange is interrupted during the winter and methane from sedimentary sources accumulates under the ice cover. According to our measurements an initial early summer methane pulse into the atmosphere of the order of 560 mol km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> can be expected when the supersaturated surface waters are exposed by the retreating ice. The methane flux in July is approximately 150 mol km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> which is of the order of the average annual flux in the survey area. The magnitude of the seasonal CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> flux variation northeast of Sakhalin corresponds to an amount of 7.3 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> g km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> whereby 74% or 5.4 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> g km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> are supplied to the atmosphere between April and July. For the whole Sea of Okhotsk the annual methane flux is roughly 0.13 × 10<jats:sup>12</jats:sup> g (terragrams), based on the assumption that 15% of the entire area emit methane. Variations of long‐term data of atmospheric methane which are recorded at the same latitude adjacent to areas with seasonal ice cover show a regional methane pulse between April and July. The large‐scale level of atmospheric methane in the northern hemisphere undergoes an amplitudinal variation of about 25 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) which translates into approximately 36 Tg. Thus the estimated 0.6 Tg of ice‐induced methane dynamics in northern latitudes can hardly explain this seasonal signal. However, the effects of seasonal ice cover on pulsed release of methane appear strong enough to contribute, in concert with other seasonal sources, to characteristic short‐term wobbles in the atmospheric methane budget which are observed between 50°N and 60°N.</jats:p>",
