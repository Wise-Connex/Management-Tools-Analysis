This paper discusses the concept as a juncture of three forces: the virtual organization, Web-based communication and the application service provider (ASP). The virtual organization is a familiar concept in many industries, even without electronic connections. Web-based communication provides access and networks with new institutions. The ASP makes rapid change and flexible connections feasible. Together they establish focus, flexibility and rapid response to change in demand and customer requirements. Casting it in a strategic framework of structure, process and organization provides a basis for projecting its future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Some well known inorganic compounds have been subject to treatment for a century and to recent improvements and innovations. The occurrence, the environmental behaviour and the removal techniques of inorganic substances depend primarily on their aquatic chemistry, involving various reactions. The knowledge on speciation and its alteration is essential for process selection. Out of the more recent problems of some inorganic substances, natural, geogenic arsenic plays obviously a major role in a large number of countries. The relatively high chronic toxicity induced lower drinking water standards and activities on improved arsenic removal. Arsenic is a good example to demonstrate the chemistry principles and to derive new treatment techniques at affordable costs. A full-scale process comparison in Germany is presented, indicating the superior efficiency of a newly developed fixed-bed adsorption with a commercial granular ferric hydroxide, developed in the early 1990s. It is especially suitable for small-scale water supplies, for well-head treatment and even for decentralised removal of arsenic with low maintenance requirements.</jats:p>",

The simulation model represents plant production, inventory, and shipping operations as well as inter-plant shipments. When a combined simulation-optimization approach is used, the simulation periodically invokes a classical production planning optimization model to set production and shipping levels. These levels are retrieved by and used in the simulation model. Process industry supply chain operations include stochastic elements such as customer demands whose expected values may vary in time as well as transportation lead times. The complexity of individual plant operations and logistics must be considered. Simulation provides the methods needed to integrate these elements in a single model. Periodically during a simulation run, production planning decisions that require optimization models may be made. Simulation experimental results are used to determine service levels to end customers as well as to set rail fleet sizes, inventory capacities, and capital equipment requirements for logistics as well as to assess alternative shipping schedules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>About 50 years ago, Wilhelm Wiederhold wrote “Offene Fragen der Filtertechnik” (Open questions on filter technology) in the journal Gas und Wasserfach. His questions centred on 5 topics: the Boucher microstraining index and its application to sand filtration; the Michau pressure diagrams through the depth of a filter; the design and use of experimental filter columns; a multiple layer filter model comprising perforated bronze strainers; fluid flow regimes in porous media; backwashing with air scour followed by water fluidisation of a sand bed. This is reviewed in the light of the advances in the understanding of filter behaviour which have accrued over the past 50 years. Both theory and experimental techniques have enabled some of Wiederhold's questions to be answered, and for some of his ideas to be corrected. Nevertheless, our knowledge of filtration has raised more questions than have been answered. Wiederhold's ideas were a springboard for advances to be made, particularly experimentally. But new challenges face filtration technology, not least that granular bed filtration may disappear in favour of the progress of membrane technology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biofilms are ubiquitous in drinking water systems, either in the form of thin and patchy colonies or as surface-covering multiple layers. In biofilters they are used for the elimination of biologically degradable substances. However, they occur in other sites, e.g., on the walls of containers and pipes, on sediment and on suspended particles. They can rise problems by contamination of the water phase by detaching biofilm organisms. Biofilms provide a possible habitat for hygienically relevant microbes in which they can persist and even multiply. Here they are protected against disinfectants, in particular if located in corrosion products, sediments or ingested by protozoa which feed on biofilm cells. Biofilms are related to the occurrence of “black water” and malodours. They are involved in the corrosion of metals, mineral materials and synthetic polymers. The limiting factor for biofilm growth is usually the availability of nutrients, mainly provided either by biodegradable substances leaching from materials or from by the water phase. The extent of biofilm growth and of the occurrence of hygienically relevant organisms is still unknown and to be investigated. However, latest research indicates that such organisms do not multiply in large numbers in drinking water biofilms; it is possible that drinking water biofilms can inhibit the propagation of invading pathogens.</jats:p>",

The selection of the right strategy within a supply chain lends itself to a taxonomic approach. We find that three dimensions (leading to eight possible configurations) are adequate for this purpose.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the past few years, intensive interest in the problem of excessive fluorides in drinking water is a matter of serious concern around the world, as it causes fluorosis, a disease that affects teeth and bones. In India, the states of Rajasthan, Gujarath and Andhra Pradesh have a large number of villages where ground water contains excessive fluorides. India is among the 23 nations around the globe where health problems occur due to the consumption of fluoride contaminated water. Considerable research has been carried out to remove fluoride from the drinking water to overcome its toxic effect. This paper provides a review of the scientific literature on the varied aspects of fluorine chemistry, its occurrence, distribution and use of low cost adsorbents. Batch adsorption studies were carried out to determine the fluoride removal efficiency of fly ash, brick powder, wood charcoal, animal charcoal, fish bone charcoal, etc. Based on the efficiency, economy and usage of various low cost adsorbents specified above, the fish bone charcoal showed a comparatively higher fluoride removal than other adsorbents used. So that the problem of heavy fluoride in the drinking water in various states of India can be efficiently solved. Hence the dream of the WHO can be turned into reality and thus reduce hospital loads by 90%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The proliferation of new codes &amp; standards for power generation equipment procurement, and their increased frequency of revision, contributes to an atmosphere of increasingly rapid change in global trade considerations. This dynamic environment has amplified intensely with each year, to an extent that the life cycle of a given standard is in many instances appreciably less than the delivery cycles of heavy machinery. Other issues are created by the slower pace of harmonization of codes &amp; standards in the European Union (EU), US and elsewhere. These codes &amp; standards cover requirements that include emissions, acoustics, and safety that exert pronounced effects on the design, manufacture, and integration of power plant components. Conformity assessment partnering and the importance of other expert interpretation services are a key component to successfully meeting evolving compliance requirements. Delivering Customer Fulfillment for the Order to Remittance (OTR) phase of a project must be circled back to the Inquiry to Order (ITO) front end of the business cycle for new proposals. Another interesting arena is the relationship of advanced prime mover design balanced with the need for standardization to meet these regulatory challenges in the face of high production volume. The typical power generation project cycle, measured in terms of years, coupled with the present high demand worldwide results in orders for equipment that in many cases can’t foresee regulatory requirements 2 to 3 years into the future. Examples include projects in the EU where the Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) and Atmospheres Explosive (ATEX) Directive have mandatory compliance dates of May 2002 and June 2003 respectively. Electric power generation Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers must plan for and price into contracts compliance with these laws years before the equipment is built and shipped. This is further complicated by the interpretation of specific requirements and the definition of the OEM conformity assessment strategy. To rectify this situation, it is recommended that steps be initiated to accelerate the worldwide harmonization of technical standards. In addition, consideration for the delivery cycles and commissioning of new power plants must be included in the regulatory process and in setting the dates for mandatory compliance with regional law.</jats:p>",

PWN Water Supply Company North Holland (PWN) was compelled to implement multiple barriers against these contaminants at their surface water treatment plants at Heemskerk and Andijk. For degradation of pesticides advanced oxidation was pursued. After thorough studies O3/H2O2-treatment was rejected in view of bromate formation. Subsequently application of UV/H2O2-treatment was pursued.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>UV-photolysis shows a selective pesticide degradation. Conversion using an electric energy of 1 kWh/m3 varies from 18% for trichloroacetic acid to 70% for atrazine. UV/H2O2-treatment gives a much more aselective pesticide degradation. For a combination of an electric energy of 1 kWh/m3 and 15 g/m3 H2O2 most pesticides can be degraded by more than 80%. Formation of harmful by-products proved to be insignificant. In the range of 0.1-2.5 kWh/m3 electric energy and 0-25 g/m3 H2O2 bromate formation is absent, while metabolite formation is insignificant. AOC-formation is found up to 140 μg/l. Therefore AOC and residual H2O2 must be removed in a following treatment step. GAC-filtration showed very reliable results.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Application of UV/H2O2-treatment for pesticide control with an electric energy of 1 kWh/m3 goes together with an average UV-dose of 2,000 mJ/cm2. This dose is about 50 times as high as applied in conventional UV-disinfection. As expected E. coli and (after spiking) spores of sulphite reducing Clostridia are inactivated completely. In addition orientating experiments have been carried out with an UV-dose of 100 mJ/cm2. Inactivation of MS-2 phages amounted to 2.7 log, Bacillus spores inactivation to 3.4 log, while Cryptosporidium inactivation was complete (&amp;gt;3 log). Additional data are gathered together with the University of Alberta.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In view of the very promising results, application of UV/H2O2-treatment will be pursued for full scale application at both the Heemskerk plant for organic contaminant control and the Andijk plant for both organic contaminant control and disinfection.</jats:p>",

This paper outlines the development of a prototype system featuring real-time simulations, an alarm handling facility, an instrument analyser and “user” defined simulations. The system offers benefits through proactive WTW operation, de-manning, risk reduction, reduced maintenance and chemical costs and as a training tool. Also discussed are factors that may influence the implementation of such a system and also future development possibilities.</jats:p>",

The pesticide concentration increased with time after the pesticide application, and it reached a pseudo-steady-state plateau. Less than 8% of the adsorbed simazine desorbed back into the column effluent by 15 days after the influent was switched to simazine-free water. The simazine desorbed from the upper part of the bed was re-adsorbed in the lower part, keeping the effluent concentration at a low level. In the pseudo-steady-state, the removal rate was described by a first order kinetic reaction for the pesticide concentration. The evaluation of removal rate modulus value revealed the profile of loaded pesticide-competitive NOM with depth. The pesticide-competitive NOMs were different for each pesticide. The percentage of the simazine-competitive NOM to the whole NOM increased after UF membrane filtration (molecular weight cutoff 1K), but not for the asulum-competitive NOM.</jats:p>",

The present system at the company is analyzed for the three components viz. supply chain design, supply chain planning and supply chain operations. The characterization of the present system is based on high-implied demand uncertainties, high forecast errors, provisions for mixed order matching, seasonality of demands, end of month peak characterization and the irregular flow of information. The initial analysis is based on a simple queuing model that incorporates the theory of constraints to evaluate the criticality of the information flow in the system. This model is then extended to incorporate other parameters required in the strategic alignment of the system with the corporate objectives. The current initiatives in the company are then developed further into a strategic plan that incorporates considerations of new product launches, decreasing product life cycles, fragmentation of supply chain ownership, globalization and other difficulties in execution.</jats:p>",

The synergy between UV/PAA and UV/H2O2 in laboratory experiments and at a pilot plant fed by the secondary effluent of two civil wastewater treatment plant has been investigated. This experiment is part of a larger research project on advanced treatment for municipal wastewater reuse in agriculture. A very high level of disinfection is necessary because of Italy's strict limits on unrestricted wastewater reuse in agriculture (2 CFU Total Coliform/100 ml). We found out that a combined treatment is satisfactory and that it is more efficient when chemical products such as PAA or H2O2 are introduced before UV irradiation, taking advantage of the hydroxyl radicals formation due to photolysis. At a cost parity PAA/UV advanced oxidation process shows the same disinfectant action as H2O2/UV while at a dose (amount) and cost parity, PAA shows a significantly better disinfectant action than H2O2.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural organic matter (NOM) has been shown to be one of the major parameters that affects water quality and treatment processes. NOM reduces the effectiveness of water treatment by interfering with the flocculation process, makes treatment with activated carbon and membrane filtration less efficient and is a precursor to the formation of disinfectant by-products (DBP). Furthermore, NOM acts as a food source for micro-organisms resulting in bacterial regrowth in distribution systems. These concerns have resulted in the removal of NOM from raw water being of prime concern for water authorities. The elevated levels of NOM in Australian water supplies have resulted in priority being given to research into methods of removing NOM by the Australian Water Quality Centre (AWQC). Early work showed that some types of anion exchange resins were very effective for NOM removal and that while resin column systems were rapidly fouled by waters with high concentration of suspended matter, a stirred system had no such limitation. This lead to the development of a resin with a high adsorptive capacity for NOM by the Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in collaboration with the AWQC which will be manufactured under licence by Orica Australia Pty Ltd. This resin then formed the basis for a novel process for NOM removal developed by the AWQC in collaboration with Orica Australia Pty Ltd. Both the MIEX® resin and process have been patented internationally. This paper outlines the process, gives examples of some of the benefits and provides recent results from an operating pilot plant with a capacity 160 kL/day.</jats:p>",

Three approaches to public procurement are identified. Current UK government policy and European Union Directives emphasise the commercial and regulatory strands. However, there is a need to recognise the importance of the socio-economic strand of public procurement. A range of supply management strategies are then explored, which are distinguished by four criteria: map of the actors; information sharing; features of the relationship; and sharing of risks and rewards. The final section of the paper analyses a sample of contracts from Government Purchasing Agency (Northern Ireland) (GPA) and the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). Whilst the more commercially or regulatory oriented contracts are found to employ relatively simple, dyadic strategies involving open competitive tendering, more complex supply chain management or network strategies are found in relation to contracts where socio-economic goals are of primary importance. </jats:p>",

In this study, we focus on divergent differentiation supply chains (commonly associated with industries such as fashion apparel). We identify the impact of information sharing by simulating order fulfillment in this supply chain type and find inventory costs can be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfillment cycle times. This is true because information, which provides the basis for enhanced coordination and reduced uncertainty, can substitute for inventory.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since March 1995 Amsterdam Water Supply has applied biological activated carbon filtration (BACF) in the treatment process of the Leiduin plant. In this plant (capacity 70 × 106 m3/y) pretreated River Rhine water is infiltrated in the dune area, west of Amsterdam, for artificial recharge. Post treatment comprises rapid sand filtration, ozonation, hardness removal, biological activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. At the start the carbon reactivation frequency was set at 18 months, based on removal efficiencies for AOX (adsorbable organic halogens), DOC, pesticides and micropollutants. After four years of operation of a pilot plant (10 m3/hour) in parallel with the full-scale plant, the remaining removal capacity and the break-through profile of the carbon filters was investigated. In contrast to the full-scale plant, no carbon reactivation was applied in the pilot plant during the operation of 4 years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Spiking experiments were carried out after ozonation, in the influent of the biological activated carbon filtration with a cocktail of different pesticides after 1.5, 3 and 4 years. Influent concentrations varied between 2 to 10 μg/l. Without carbon reactivation the filter effluent still complies with the Dutch drinking water standards and guide lines, as well as with the Amsterdam Water Supply standards: DOC is less than 2 mg/l (actually 1.2 mg/l) and AOX remains below 5 μg/l.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After four years, with spiking concentrations of 2 μg/l still no pesticide break-through was observed in the two-stage biological activated carbon filtration process. It can be concluded that a running time of 3 years between two reactivations in the two stage biological active carbon filtration is achievable, without negatively affecting the finished water quality. Average DOC concentrations will increase up to 1.2 mg/l, from 1 mg/l with running times of 2 years. After four years or 100,000 bedvolumes the AOC content is equal to or lower than 10 μg/l after biological activated carbon filtration. With slow sand filtration at the end and as polishing step AOC will be less than 10-5 μg/l. With every extension of six months duration time a saving of Euro 305,000 on reactivation costs is possible. With every 6 month extension of the running time of the carbon filters a saving of €610,000 is realised on the reactivation costs of the Leiduin treatment plant.</jats:p>",

As the Internet and other proprietary networks expand, however, organizations have the opportunity to use this enabling infrastructure to exchange other, more varied types of information than traditional electronic data interchange (EDI) messages. This is especially true of companies with global operations and interests, which lead to a more diverse set of trading activities. This case presents the experiences of a large Australian paper products manufacturer in implementing an electronic document exchange strategy for supply chain management, including the drivers for change which spurred their actions, and describes the issues associated with trying to support existing and future requirements for document exchange across a wide variety of trading partners. The experiences of PaperCo will be relevant to organizations with diverse trading partners, especially small to medium enterprises (SMEs).</jats:p>"

This has proved to be a difficult task, however, as the operating framework and culture of the public sector have hindered the development of interorganizational relationships and trust. By focusing on the co–operative processes and interaction within central government departments and between departments and the private sector, this paper aims to analyse and identify the obstacles to, and opportunities for, implementing long–term supply relations and facilitating departmental co–ordination. While the paper argues that partnership relations can build social capital, it also shows that these resources can have both positive and negative effects for public procurement. To conclude, lessons for developing collaborative arrangements in public procurement are identified.</jats:p>",

Biofilms were sampled from household copper reticulation pipes and grown on R2A agar. Laboratory coupon experiments were used to determine the effect of single isolate biofilms on aqueous copper concentrations. The majority of biofilm bacteria did not affect copper concentrations in comparison to sterile controls. However, several bacteria including Acidovorax delafieldii, Cytophaga johnsonae and Micrococcus kristinae were shown to significantly elevate copper concentrations in drinking water. In contrast, the bacteria Rhodococcus sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia were shown to significantly decrease copper levels in comparison to controls. The significance of biofilm bacteria to increase copper concentrations in drinking water has implications for public health by increasing concentrations to levels toxic to humans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dispersed water contaminants with diameters less than 50 μm usually carry the greatest burden of contaminants that are of potential concern to the environment and human health in sewage. Microorganisms and viruses can be counted to this group of contaminants for instance. Furthermore, colloidal water contaminants possess a higher specific surface area per unit mass which can enable the accumulation of possibly problematic dissolved water contaminants onto this area. Therefore, efficient removal of contaminants from wastewater relies on the efficient removal of fine particles and colloidal material from water. The CSIRO Molecular Science has been developing the idea of using high rate deep bed filtration through porous plastic media to improve the separation of suspended and colloidal particles from sewage. Because the IWW was aspiring an analogous technology by developing and modelling deep bed filtration with permeable synthetic collectors (PSC), the possibility for collaboration in a research project was given. The project investigated the use of a dual stage filter media system with upwards directed flow. The aim of using this system was to achieve high total suspended solids (TSS) removals and high turbidity storage capacities at fast filtration rates (20-50 m/h) while simultaneous decreasing the dose of flocculation chemicals to its minimum.</jats:p>",

The character of the NOM and its involvement in water treatment processes requires greater understanding for determination of improved removal processes and interactions with other water contaminants. It is considered that a greater understanding of NOM reactions would lead to far better predictive capacity for water treatment designers and operators to minimise its impacts in treated water. Maximising the removal of NOM in the production of drinking water has many attractions such as minimising the formation of disinfection by-products and bacterial regrowth in the distribution system. By enhancing NOM removal, residual colour is also minimised.

This policy did not succeed in increasing wheat production in the Irbid Governorate of Jordan, our case study area. The agricultural sector in the study area was characterized by risk in production and prices. In our study, the supply response function based on the Nerlovian Model was estimated for wheat produced in Irbid Governorate. Wheat area, in the model, was the dependent variable in the supply response function. The independent variables were: wheat planted area in Dunums in the current and previous year respectively, the weighted price of wheat in the previous year deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the holding fragmentation coefficient in the previous year, the yield risk, and the amount of rain in millimeters during the early months of the season (October, November, and December). The study reached the following conclusions: Firstly, holdings fragmentation was the major factor that negatively affects wheat production. Since the heritage system is the main factor that affects holding fragmentation, the policy makers need to find a way that can decrease this effect. Secondly, lagged weighted prices were found more suitable than the current weighted prices from an economic and statical point of view. Thirdly, the partial adjustment coefficient was low (i.e. less than one), which means that the farmers need more than one year to change their producing habits. Finally, the farmers were found to be risk-neutral, because their decisions depend mainly on the level and distribution of rainfall during the rainy season.  </jats:p>"

Investigations with an endoscope allowed the consideration of the particle adhesion on the surface of the inner fibres. The resulting filter coefficients are compared with experimental data. The application of PSC filtration in a pilot scale unit for waste water treatment performs much better in contrast to conventional filter grains (sand, anthracite etc.), especially under high rate conditions.

IT offer huge potentials for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises to activate effective SCM mechanisms. Even though experts estimate the potential saving that can be achieved through the implementation of effective SCM strategies at 3-5 per cent of turnover, SMEs are experiencing a great deal of difficulty in coping with these strategies. Reasons for this, especially among small enterprises (50 employees and under), are to be found in the specific enterprise culture. The results presented in this paper are the outcome of an EU funded project named “Supply Chain Partnership”, a pilot project aimed at analysing the communication, social and technological obstacles to the implementation of effective SCM strategies in SMEs. The focus of this paper is on the Italian experience, and concerns an industrial district located in Sicily.</jats:p>"

It was found that the degree of conversion of pesticides is about the same with the Fenton process and UV/H2O2 within the margin of practical application, but slightly different with ozone/H2O2. Bentazone is readily degraded by the latter process, but more persistent during water treatment with the Fenton process and UV/H2O2, whilst atrazine is difficult to convert with all of these processes. Although bromate formation cannot be avoided completely with ozone/H2O2, it can be realized with the Fenton process and UV/H2O2. Upon degradation of pesticides with UV/H2O2 nitrite is produced, the amount depending on the water quality with respect to the nitrate concentration. Based on the a-selective nature of the hydroxyl radical AOC is formed out of DOC, which indicates that ozone/H2O2, the Fenton process as well as UV/H2O2 should be applicable for the development of biological GAC filtration.</jats:p>",

Granular activated carbon filtration (GAC) can be used to decrease the concentration of DOC, colour, taste, odour and pesticides. Columns filled with ion-exchange resins are used to remove colour, nitrate and DOC. The regeneration frequency of these types of filters depends strongly on the natural water quality. Especially the DOC-concentration and DOC-composition determines the efficiency of the processes. Because pilot-plant experiments with realistic contact-times will last for more than a year (for GAC) there is a need for a prediction of breakthrough based on shorter and less expensive laboratory experiments. The available models are not accurate enough because the exact parameters are not available. In batch experiments with natural water, with realistic (low) pesticide concentrations and the full grain size of the adsorbent the adsorption parameters are measured in an independent experiment. With the parameters obtained with these experiments an accurate prediction of the breakthrough curve is possible.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With the same parameters predictions of breakthrough curves are calculated under different process conditions.

For successful application of direct filtration for the removal of suspended solids and colloidal material careful consideration is needed with the coagulation conditions.

The deck under certain load and sea conditions can become partially or totally immersed. This study focuses on the roll motion that can be of large amplitude and therefore has implications and risks for the ship’s safety. The Glimm’s method is used to model the three-dimensional flow of shallow water on the deck. A parametric study is made in order to show the effect of the relevant parameters. It is shown that the water on deck has a significant influence on the ship’s dynamical response.</jats:p>",

Ion exchange treatment using iminodiacetic acid resin was studied under various conditions in a pilot scale plant. Breakthrough curves show that nickel, cadmium and lead concentrations of below 100 μg/L can easily be reduced to 1% of the feed concentration. Assuming a minimum removal rate of 95% the treated volumes ranged from 75,000 bed volumes up to 195,000 bed volumes depending on flow rate and calcium concentration. The process has no impact on other chemical and microbiological water quality parameters. Ideally the feed water should be free from turbidity, iron and manganese, otherwise head loss will grow very fast because of high filtration rates and the small diameter of resin beads used in this process. Nevertheless, the ion exchange resin can be backwashed without increasing the metal concentration in the effluent. Ion exchange using iminodiacetic resins is therefore a suitable treatment process for the removal of heavy metals from drinking water.</jats:p>",

The buyer is required to place orders for two periods. After observing initial demand, the buyer is then allowed to adjust the second order, paying a per unit order adjustment penalty. We describe the optimal behavior of the buyer under such a contract, both in determining the initial order quantities and in subsequently adjusting the order. We compare the solution to a contract where no adjustment is allowed and to the case where adjustment is allowed without penalty. We demonstrate that flexible contracts can reduce the potentially negative effect of correlation of demand between two periods. Further, we investigate how the duration of the first period vis‐à‐vis the second period affects the profitability of the buyer as a function of the degree of correlation. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Smith, a CAM bromeliad of major ecological importance to restinga (coastal sand ridge plains) environments. Plants showed a preference for ammonium over nitrate in a 24-h experiment where plants were exposed to 15NH4NO3 or NH415NO3. Mature individuals of N. cruenta were exposed to 95 and 20% full sunlight, and treated with 5 mm NH4NO3 or tap water only. After 4 months under the different treatments we found that nitrogen uptake and carotenoid content were independent of light exposure. Total chlorophyll decreased under nitrogen limitation and high light. Net titratable acid accumulation was not influenced by light or nitrogen regimes. Plants under low light showed consistently high photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) throughout the day. In contrast, plants under high light and nitrogen limitation showed a significant decline in Fv/Fm around midday, which recovered by the end of the light period. This decline in Fv/Fm was attributed to increased non-photochemical quenching. Our findings that plants under high light and with high nitrogen behave similarly to shade plants were unexpected. They suggest that the high light, high nitrogen leaves used a greater portion of the light absorbed in PSII antennae for photochemistry than the high light, low nitrogen plants. High nitrogen content in the leaves of N. cruenta appears to protect this CAM bromeliad against photoinhibition.</jats:p>"

As shown by investigations on a large-scale installation (bypass mode) over several years, this procedure reliably reduces particulate matter in the water by about 3 orders of magnitude in long-term use. However, the high efficacy of Fe(III)-assisted filtration cannot be explained on the basis of known coagulation mechanisms (adsorption-charge neutralization, co-precipitation). Instead, the essential step was found to be the conditioning of the filter medium by coating it with colloids containing Fe(OH)3, and this “Fe coating” process only occurs in the presence of alkaline earth cations (especially Ca2+). According to further experiments, the enhanced solid-liquid separation was ultimately traced to chemical interactions such as the formation of calcium-NOM bridges between the iron hydroxides and other solids.</jats:p>",

The use of well‐defined packaging‐related information that is available for all actors in the supply chain also facilitates an integrated and supply chain‐orientated packaging development. The objective of this paper is to describe and identify the packaging‐related information used in the grocery retail industry. The paper also describes and analyses how the information is used in the supply chain, with focus on the packaging evaluation process. Case and field studies involving six companies from the Swedish grocery industry were conducted to identify the parameters used and shared among them. The paper discusses what kind of information is required to properly evaluate a packaging concept, what parameters are missing and how the information should be used in the supply chain. Finally, the paper suggests a procedure for packaging logistics performance with required parameters. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>First, a continuous flow TiO2/UV reactor was designed and developed in order to examine E. coli disinfection effect using UV light. The optimum conditions for disinfection such as flow rate, light intensity, TiO2 concentration, initial E. coli concentration were examined. The results are as follow (i) The use of the quartz device and TiO2 (anatase) resulted in killing of E. coil within minutes. (ii) Photocatalytic disinfection with UV light in the presence of TiO2 more effectively killed E. coli than UV or TiO2 adsorption only. (iii) As flow rate increased, the survival ratio of E. coli decreased, but over 3 L/min of flow rate, the efficiency was limited. (iv) E. coli survival ratio decreased linearly with increasing UV light intensity. (v) The dosage of TiO2 affected the E. coli disinfection efficiency, and above 0.1 wt% TiO2 concentration, the disinfection was less effective because TiO2 particles may result in screening off the light. (ri) The disinfection reaction follows first-order kinetics.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Secondly, outdoor experiments with natural sunlight instead of artificial UV light in TiO2 reactors were also conducted to investigate alternative energy source applicability on E. coli disinfection. It is found that the presence of clouds in the sky markedly increased the time required for killing E. coli and the bacteria cells also disappeared with a first-order kinetics. On the basis of these experimental observations, the disinfection of E. coli using TiO2 under solar light irradiation can be a feasible application of the advanced oxidation process.</jats:p>",

The responsibility for design was devolved to the county level, and many different approaches have been applied. For this and other reasons, there has been no consensus on important matters such as the level of prepayment, the range of covered services, and whether township health centres or family planning stations should operate the schemes. We aimed to clarify some of the uncertainty by conducting combined analyses of cost, willingness to pay, and willingness to supply. We used structured survey instruments to interview 4271 households with children aged under one year, and 18 township health institutions. Our analyses suggest that the ideal prepayment should be higher and the range of covered services should be wider than the current average, and that health centres rather family planning stations should operate the schemes.</jats:p>"

Eucalyptus halophila was an exception,\nresponding positively to the alkaline treatment in having taller seedlings, a\ngreater leaf production, and maintaining a high leaf iron concentration.\nEucalyptus gracilis, E. loxophleba\nand E. platypus had the highest growth rates within the\nalkaline treatment, but the slow growth and sequestering of iron by\nE. halophila provided this species with the greatest\npotential for tolerance. The relative growth and tolerance rankings of the\nspecies in solution culture were similar to those obtained in previous field\ntrials on alkaline mine processing wastes. Field selection of species from\ncalcareous or sodic sites, and laboratory screening under high bicarbonate\nconditions can identify species with the greatest potential for the\nrehabilitation of alkaline mine wastes and other damaged lands with soils of\nhigh pH. </jats:p>"

Treatment performance was assessed principally in terms of changes in dissolved organic content (DOC) and system running cost. On average, the decrease in DOC, UV-254 and colour was 10-15% with ECF at pH ca. 7.8 and current densities of 2-5 A m-2 (equivalent dose range of 1-5 gAl(III) m-3). Acidification of the influent (pH 8.4 down to 7.5) decreased only DOC and increased apparent current efficiencies for Al dissolution above unity. Passivation of the aluminium electrodes by Al(III) (hydrous) oxides caused difficulties in maintaining a steady dissolved Al(III) concentration and also increased specific electrical energy consumptions. Treated water quality with ECF was as good as that with DAF at lower equivalent coagulant doses (&amp;lt; 5 gAl(III) m-3), but was less so at higher coagulant doses. The pilot-plant DAF system appeared to be more expensive in terms of its running cost for the conditions used; the cost ratios of DAF to ECF were between 3:1 and 5:1, respectively, for an equivalent treatment performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>The Pannonian Basin of Hungary is Europe’s largest inter-mountain basin, where an evolution in drainage development patterns during the Quaternary was caused by changes in sediment flux to the basin, the dynamics of basin morphology development and the uplift history of the Apuseni Mountains source area, all directly or indirectly related to the tectonic systems operating in the region. Micro-mineralogical data of detrital heavy minerals from modern rivers and two key boreholes covering a time span from the present back to 2.6 Ma have been grouped by statistical analysis into two main clusters and some sub-clusters. The samples within the same cluster have a similar composition, and originated from the same source area. Based on the similar palaeogeographical setting of the potential source areas during the Quaternary, it has been possible to extrapolate the present transport directions of the rivers with a well-known catchment area geology and the heavy mineral composition to Pleistocene borehole data. The changes in transport directions were clearly sharp and related to significant changes in the uplift history of the Apuseni Mountains catchment area. During the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene the compressional stress field operating in the East Carpathians region resulted in the thrust-driven uplift of the Apuseni Mountains and the formation of a syn-sedimentary trap at the western margin of the source area, which captured the sediments of short, transverse rivers. During this period the drainage of the study area was characterized by axial drainage parallel to this trap, and sediments were transported from the northeast, also shown by micro-mineralogical data of detrital heavy minerals. At about 1.95 Ma this trap stopped being active due to the release of the compressional stress field and the isostatic uplift of the Apuseni Mountains, together with the adjoining basin area. This resulted in the filling of the thrust-bounded trap, and the development of transverse drainage, which was shown by characteristic SE transport directions, based on micro-mineralogical data in the study area, and also by an increase of sediment flux. The axial capturing shifted further to the west, developing a configuration approaching to the present river course pattern. By analogy with the Himalayan foreland and retro-arc basins of the Cordilleran-Andean ranges, it was demonstrated that tectonic activity exerts a strong control on the drainage pattern through its influence on variations in sediment supply.</jats:p>",

In addition the inactivation of the natural occurring spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia (SSRC) in this water was monitored in one of the lab-scale systems as well as in a full-scale ozonation process. The survival ratio of C. parvum oocysts was determined using the CD-1 neonatal mouse infectivity test and for Cl. perfringens and SSRC the survival ratio was assessed with the standard anaerobic colony count on the iron-sulphite medium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results of the lab-scale experiments revealed an inactivation rate constant k (Chick-Watson modelling) at 10°C for C. parvum of 0.14 (SD=0.014; P&amp;lt;0.001) and for Cl. perfringens of 0.25 (SD=0.01; P&amp;lt;0.001). Moreover, first results of monitoring the SSRC inactivation in full-scale ozonation processes indicated that the inactivation rate constant for these wild strains was in the same order of magnitude as determined for Cl. perfringens. Further research is needed to compare inactivation ozone kinetics for Cl. perfringens D10 and SSRC at different temperatures and in other natural waters. Results of additional lab-scale experiments with Cl. perfringens strain D10 indicated that the CT of the gas-feed chamber should be incorporated in the design of a full-scale ozonation. Moreover, setting theCT with the contact time was not as effective for the inactivation capacity as setting the CT with the ozone dosage.</jats:p>",

Pilot studies have indicated that alfalfa (<jats:italic>Medicago sativa</jats:italic> L.) is a suitable feedstock for energy generation via the gasification process.

Soil pH increased with ash application on all soils. Ash application increased ammonium acetate‐exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg, and Olsen P in soil and decreased DTPA‐extractable soil Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb. Averaged across the three soils, slopes of the cations recovered in plant and soil vs. cations applied in the ash were 0.48, 0.21, and 0.22 of total ash K, Ca, and Mg, respectively (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> &gt; 0.97). Ash significantly increased plant K and Mo, and decreased Mg, Mn, and Zn concentration. Tissue P concentrations were not affected by ash, but increased with P fertilizer. Phosphorus fertilizer increased plant dry mass (DM), but K fertilizer did not, thus K did not limit yield. Alfalfa stem gasification ash is a potential liming agent, a source of K, and would not lead to excessive accumulation of trace elements in soil or plants when applied at rates based on lime or K need.</jats:p>",

In a representative group of 2,500 Germans (age &gt;13 years), using a specially designed food questionnaire, the iodine intake was calculated. In addition, iodine and creatinine concentrations in spot urine samples were determined in three groups with a possibly increased risk of iodine deficiency (769 conscripts, 886 pairs of mothers and newborns) or future hyperthyroidism (574 adults, age range 50–70 years) from 26 representative regions. In four groups of controls (young and older male and female adults; n = 91), 24-hour urine iodine and creatinine were measured in six diurnal fractions to calculate group- and period-specific factors for the estimation of the 24-hour iodine excretion from data of iodine/creatinine ratio and time of micturition in spot urine samples. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; The mean calculated iodine intake (excretion) was 119 µg/day for the group of Germans above 13 years; it was 119 µg/day (125 µg/day) for adults aged 50–70 years, 137 µg/day (125 µg/day) for conscripts, and 162 µg/day for breast-feeding mothers.

A three‐phase diode bridge rectifier with R‐L and R‐C loads is taken as the nonlinear load. It is observed that the AF systems suffer from the problems of switching ripples (in case of R‐L nonlinear load) and distortion (in case of R‐C nonlinear load). The switching ripples and distortion in the supply currents contribute considerably to its Total Harmonics Distortion (THD). This investigation proposes a new, cost free and simple approach for the elimination of switching ripples and distortion in the supply current. A pulse width modulation (PWM) current controlled voltage source inverter (CCVSI) is used as the AF. The AF system is tested with two types of PWM switching techniques, namely, carrier‐less (hysteresis) and carrier based techniques. Two types of current control techniques, namely, direct current control and indirect current control are designed to obtain PWM switching signals for the devices of the AF. The capability of the indirect current control technique towards the elimination of switching ripples and distortion is established. Simulated and experimental results for steady state and transient operating conditions of the AF for R‐L as well as R‐C nonlinear loads are given and discussed in detail.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rams of a 'Mediterranean breed' (Merino) and a 'temperate breed' (Suffolk) were compared to determine how much of the differences between their reproductive seasons is owing to variation in their responses to photoperiodic and nutritional cues. In a previous study, both nutritional and photoperiodic inputs were held constant, and it was found that the two breeds show similar endogenous rhythms and, when the animals are challenged with a Mediterranean photoperiodic cycle, these endogenous rhythms are similarly modified. The present study tested whether an annual cycle in the supply of forage might modify the patterns that are generated by the interaction between photoperiod and endogenous rhythms. Both breeds were subjected to a simulated `Mediterranean' annual cycle in photoperiod (10L : 14D to 14D : 10L) and provided with either constant food supply or a simulated `Mediterranean' annual cycle in food supply. In Merino rams, testicular growth responded to photoperiod, but nutrition dominated those responses. In Suffolk rams, changes in testicular size can be completely out of phase with changes in body mass because they are driven primarily by photoperiod, with only subtle responses to changes in diet. The cycle of testicular growth in the Suffolk was driven by changes in the secretion of gonadotrophins (follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations and luteinizing hormone pulse frequency). By contrast, in the Merino, the nutritionally driven seasonal cycle of testicular growth was associated primarily with changes in body mass and this relationship could not always be explained by changes in gonadotrophin secretion. Melatonin secretion was not affected by food supply. Thus, the `Mediterranean' and `temperate' genotypes have similar endogenous rhythms that are similarly modified by photoperiod but, with respect to seasonal changes in nutrition, they differ in both the nature of their reproductive response and the physiological mechanisms that mediate those responses.</jats:p>"
