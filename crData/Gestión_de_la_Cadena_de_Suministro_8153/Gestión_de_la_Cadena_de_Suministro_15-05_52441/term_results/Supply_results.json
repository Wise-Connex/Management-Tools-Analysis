There were 85,000 grey documents, mainly conference proceedings and reports, i.e. 5 per cent of the overall activity, a historically low level compared to 2004 (−72 per cent). At the same time, they continue to expand their open access strategies. Just as in 2004 and 2008, these strategies are specific, and they reflect institutional and national choices rather than global approaches, with two or three common or comparable projects (PubMed Central, national repositories, attribution of DOIs to datasets, dissertations and other objects). In spite of all differences, their development reveals some common features, like budget cuts, legal barriers (copyright), focus on domestic needs and open access policies to foster dissemination and impact of research results. Document supply for corporate customers tends to become a business-to-business service, while the delivery for the public sector relies more, than before, on resource sharing and networking with academic and public libraries. Except perhaps for the TIB Hannover, the declining importance of grey literature points towards their changing role – less intermediation, less acquisition and collection development and more high-value services, more dissemination and preservation capacities designed for the scientific community needs (research excellence, open access, data management, etc.). </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper is a follow-up study of two surveys published in 2006 and 2009.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The highest CF is found for the electronics and textiles products.

Using a different metric to measure emissions, offshoring the same volume of production appears as a reduction in European Union (EU)-wide CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. To reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, the authors propose a carbon tax on imports, increasing R&amp;D subsidies to industry and freight sectors and on-shoring a greater volume of production into the EU economies, among other measures. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper only measures CFs at the sectoral level.

Proven submarine technology represents a promising base for innovative and high-performance subsea solutions. Reliable and cost efficient electric power supply can be regarded as one of the most important factors for the successful development and operation of future subsea facilities. Long step outs, large water depths and remote locations without topside infrastructure pose challenges to cable based solutions. Submarine technologies can help to overcome these issues. Within the scope of the paper, an overview of conventional (non-nuclear) military submarine propulsion technology and its perspectives to be applied for civil subsea power supply systems is given. The outlined technologies include diesel-electric propulsion, lead and lithium ion batteries, and air independent propulsion (AIP) systems. For the latter, fuel cells and closed cycle diesel systems are described. The present work highlights the potential of such technologies to be applied as an energy supply for subsea systems. A modular concept is presented which is applicable for water depths up to 3000 m. It consists of battery components to satisfy large intermittent power demands as well as AIP modules which will be able to offer moderate base loads. This way, tailored hybrid battery/AIP solutions can be created which fit the needs of specific stationary and mobile subsea appliances.

While the importance of a well-functioning urban goods distribution system is widely acknowledged, city authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to minimise the negative impacts associated to the system. There are now countless examples of attempts to increase the eco-efficiency of urban freight deliveries; however, very few have made a notable impact. The success of such schemes often depends upon the response of a range of private sector freight stakeholders and their involvement during the planning process of these solutions is crucial.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– To engage local freight stakeholders within the planning process of a city logistics project, the logical framework approach, in the form of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) developed by the Asian Development Bank, has been applied.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The structured consultation process implied within the DMF approach allowed urban freight stakeholders to share their aspirations from the beginning of the city freight planning process, despite their differences in priorities in adopting eco-efficient logistics innovations.

Sustainability-mature organisations look to their value chains where the retailer-supplier collaboration becomes critical in embedding sustainability. With this in mind, it is important to monitor retailer-supplier collaboration to determine whether it is effective. To facilitate this monitoring, the UN Global Compact Supply Chain Sustainability: A Guide for Continuous Improvement was consulted. The research question aimed to determine the progress of a prominent South African retailer regarding their sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and collaboration with suppliers. Therefore, this study attempts to apply the Supplier Engagement Continuum, extracted from the UN Global Compact Supply Chain Sustainability: A Guide for Continuous Improvement, in order to determine how the retailer is progressing in sustainable supply chain management. The qualitative and exploratory nature of the study necessitated a case study research design, while the technique of purposive sampling was used to select the sample of three suppliers. Data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews facilitated by an interview guide, and data analysis was conducted with Atlas.ti software. It was found that the retailer’s sustainable supply chain management can only be located on level one of the continuum. Supply chain sustainability in organisations lack the theoretical foundation of what sustainability really is. Therefore, the model was amended and an additional level was added to incorporate the education of sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title />\n               <jats:p>New subsea power transmission technology is required in order to enable increased oil and gas recovery in deep waters and at long tieback distances. Such prospects may not be feasible to develop with today's electrical power solutions, as traditional AC power transmission methods for supplying the increased power demand to subsea compression and pumping stations are reaching their limits. HVDC is far from matured for subsea use, and may not even be necessary technology, as low frequency AC can cover the market.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Aker Solutions has developed a new patented invention, called a Rotary Converter, for low frequency (LF) AC power transmission. This unit allows an extension of the maximum power transfer of subsea cables to more than 3x the step-out and 3x the power level compared to existing technologies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Rotary Converter (RC) consists of a subsea motor with low input frequency (10 - 30Hz) that runs a generator on a common slowly rotating shaft in a subsea enclosure. The generator supplies high frequency power (50 - 200Hz) to subsea ESPs, pumps, compressors or other loads.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The RC is supplied from a topside VSD via a long cable, and the low frequency ensures that the capacitive power / current in the cable is significantly reduced compared to conventional transmission frequency (50/60Hz or more), allowing more power, smaller cable cross-section, lower transmission voltage and better system stability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Furthermore, by introducing a variable coupling (e.g., hydrodynamic) between the motor and generator, the Variable Rotary Converter (VRC) can replace power electronic based subsea VSDs. Input frequency can either be conventional for short to medium step-outs, and low frequency input for longer step-outs. This allows for simple and robust torque and speed control.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Key highlights from the Rotary Converter prototype development and tests are also shown in relation with relevant power system simulations. Various applications for this technology are presented, for instance within subsea control system supply, allowing increasing the power supply capability in brownfield scenarios where all-electric control systems are increasingly used.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This technology will be a new tool to enable the oil and gas industry to develop subsea fields that would normally require an additional offshore platform or FPSO, and rather use existing infrastructure with longer cables instead.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The main benefits of this new invention can be summarized in longer step-out distance, more power, better system stability, and lower CAPEX / OPEX for subsea control systems, pumping, and/or compression.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A single-stage DC uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is proposed in this paper. Basically, the proposed converter is an integration result of a power factor correction circuit with a dc-to-dc converter to achieve simple hardware circuit, high efficiency, and low cost for extra UPS function. Under normal operation, a novel two-switch SEPIC converter operates as an ac to dc converter with sinusoidal input current, unity power factor, and low ripple dc output voltage, and as a battery charger if a battery is added. Since both the input boost supply and the output supply can be controlled independently, a fast transient response can be maintained at both the input for active current wave shaping and at the output for good output regulation. When the ac source is in an outage condition, the proposed converter functions as a dc-to-dc buck-boost converter; therefore, the desired dc output voltage can be provided. Finally, some experimental results are presented for verification.</jats:p>"

Therefore, in such conditions, it is important to have an appropriate planning for the optimized allocation of machinery and labor for the agricultural lands. Determining the optimal times of opening and closing valves based on the factors directly influencing the volume of the water in paddy fields is also of great importance. To meet the above conditions and by using linear and non-linear programming, two different models are developed in this article, with the purpose of reducing the time period of plowing and transplanting operations and also lowering the water consumption, respectively. Comparing the outputs of these two models with the real irrigation situation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed models.</jats:p>",

Rainwater samples were collected from the rainwater harvesting systems in northern Taiwan between September 2010 and April 2013. There were five typhoons and one dust storm that hit Taiwan during this period. Harvested rainwater was analyzed, including pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, total organic carbon (TOC), acute biotoxicity test, and concentration of 13 metals and three anions. Results of harvested rainwater of the dust storm showed it had higher pH, turbidity, TOC, Na, Mg, Ca, Cl−, NO3− and SO42− than normal rainwater. Conversely, due to strong winds and dilution effect, most of the ion concentrations in harvested rainwater during typhoons were lower than in normal rainwater. In addition, biotoxicity in harvested rainwater during the dust storm and typhoons was not significantly different from that of normal rainwater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the role of accounting in the human rights management within the supply chain.Our interest for this issue arises from the recognition of significant changes occurred in the last decades. In today's global economy, “the competition has shifted more and more from an inter-firm to an inter-supply-chain level” (Gold et al., 2010) and many organizations are part of one or more supply chains (Samaranayake, 2005). As a result, “management processes now quite frequently transcend legal organizational boundaries” (Hopwood, 1996), as well as production processes. The financial crisis has emphasized the shift of power from nation states to transnational corporations at the centre of global value chains. These powerful actors are increasingly challenged by human rights violations occurring in the socio-political contexts in which they operate (Ruggie, 2007), especially where national law does not provide adequate protection. In these growing network systems, the main difficulty for a focal company is to exercise management control on suppliers over which it has no ownership, but for the behaviour of which it is held accountable (Andersen and Skjoett-Larsen, 2009). Indeed, in 2011, for the first time in the history, the UN Special Representative, John G. Ruggie, declared that corporations have direct human rights responsibilities, either through their own activities or as a result of their business relationships with other parties.</jats:p>"

Many operators have established a goal of 100 percent recycle for their development activities. Eureka Resources, LLC (Eureka) has developed a business model which gives oil and gas operators a sustainable choice for recycling oil and gas wastewaters when water is scarce or disposal options are limited. The business model is based on operation of centralized facilities that targets recovery of useable by-products. There are many challenges associated with operating a centralized oil and gas wastewater treatment system that includes pretreatment, crystallization, biological treatment, ion exchange and reverse osmosis unit processes. This paper summarizes the challenges and lessons learned during startup and shakedown of a thermal treatment (crystallization) based model. This paper also summarizes the results of sampling and characterization efforts focused on: Demonstrating that the treated water from a centralized oil and gas wastewater treatment facility can meet freshwater standardsDemonstrating that the salt quality generated by the crystallizer is equivalent to manufactured rock salt used for road deicing and other industrial applicationsEstablishing characteristics and market value for the concentrated high calcium chloride brine purge generated by the crystallizer</jats:p>",

Two commercial hunting camps on the Park's southern boundary were surveyed for 1 month each. Information on the catch of all professional hunters in these camps was documented. The results revealed a high diversity of species but significant and probably unsustainable bushmeat extraction rates. Eighty-two chimpanzees<jats:italic>Pan troglodytes verus</jats:italic>, including eight live infants, were recorded in the survey. Most of the bushmeat harvested was destined for Monrovia and other major towns. A concerted effort needs to be made to shut down these commercial camps but the potentially significant contribution that commercial trade makes to urban areas suggests that this can only be achieved if Liberia develops alternative sectors in domestic meat production to feed the growing urban population.</jats:p>",

This article raises the question of whether and under what circumstances those retailers may still incur tort law liability for incidents in their supply chains. First discussing concepts of liability for third parties and of organizational torts, this article shows that courts have cautiously moved away from the dogma of strict separation of responsibilities between parent companies and subsidiaries towards a tort law based focus on liability based on control. On that basis, it argues that under suitable circumstances, this approach can also be applied to supply chains, which would impose a duty on retailers to organize their supply chains so as to avoid harm caused by their suppliers.</jats:p> <jats:p>Résumé: De nombreuses catastrophes ont eu lieu ces dernières années dans des usines situées dans des pays comme le Bangladesh et le Pakistan et qui fabriquent des marchandises, en particulier des vêtements, pour des détaillants de pays industrialisés, sans faire toutefois partie de leurs structures de sociétés.

L'article traite d'abord des concepts de responsabilité pour autrui et des délits civils organisationnels, et indique ensuite que les tribunaux ont prudemment quitté le dogme de la stricte séparation des responsabilités entre les sociétés mères et les filiales pour s'orienter vers une responsabilité civile basée sur le contrôle. Sur cette base, il indique que dans des circonstances adéquates, cette approche peut aussi s'appliquer aux chaînes de production et imposerait une obligation de la part des détaillants d'organiser leurs chaîne de production de telle manière à éviter un préjudice causé par leurs fournisseurs.</jats:p> <jats:p> </jats:p>",

The technology of drones depends mainly on many branches of engineering, including but not limited to robotics, computer technology, avionics, air and space research, mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, energy and the environment. This work is also focused on the research and development of drones including AVs. In the area of mass transport systems (which needs to be encouraged and optimized with respect to energy consumed in this age of energy awareness), automation has been achieved but much still needs to be done. Sensors and computers needs to be developed to a high enough level where they can duplicate the senses of an experienced pilot or operator, backed up by a huge database storage of scenarios and follow-up actions that would avert accidents and damage. Some futuristic beneficial uses for drones have also been identified, indicating some directions for research and development. The other hugely important subfield for further work is energy supply for the drones. High power and high energy supply for a long duration is required.</jats:p>",

The increased knowledge is gained by identifying and examining drivers and barriers associated with collaborative efforts to funnel excess heat produced by industrial firms into district heating grids in Sweden. An increased recovery of excess heat has the potential to reduce the primary energy demands of district heating systems. This study examines both existing and potential developments of industrial collaborations of excess heat-based district heating systems. The focus of the study consists of two Swedish cases of existing collaboration between district heating companies and pulp and paper industries as well as 16 industrial firms that all produce unused excess heat as a by-product. Confirming earlier research results, this study shows that financial issues are both the main drivers and the main barriers behind the emergence and development of inter-organisational collaborations. In addition, this study confirms earlier research that found the trust, joint problem solving, and fine-grained information transfer are important elements of successful collaboration. This study complements and clarifies these three features by including honesty and shared visions on common goals as important qualities needed for well-functioning collaborations. Combining the IS and the business model perspective has made it possible to examine more factors related to collaboration. The business model perspective has contributed with knowledge about central components of the business agreement between the collaborating parties, and the IS-perspective has contributed knowledge of the important organisational factors behind the emergence and development of long-term sustainable business agreements between firms.</jats:p>",

We consider tree-like networks with a viscoelastic fluid with the rheological characteristics of blood. We analyze the network hemodynamic response, which is a function of the frequencies involved in the driving, and a measurement of the resistance to flow. This response function allows the study of the hemodynamics of the system, without the knowledge of a particular pressure gradient. We find analytical expressions for the network response, that explicitly show the roles played by the network structure, the degree of obstruction, and the geometrical place in which obstructions occur. Notably, we find that the sequence of resistances of the network without occlusions, strongly determines the tendencies that the response function has with the anatomical place where obstructions are located. We identify anatomical sites in a network that are critical for its overall capacity to supply blood to a tissue after obstructions. We demonstrate that relatively small obstructions in such critical sites are able to cause a much larger decrease on flow than larger obstructions placed in non-critical sites. Our results indicate that, to a large extent, the response of the network is determined locally. That is, it depends on the structure that the vasculature has around the place where occlusions are found. This result is manifest in a network that follows Murray’s law, which is in reasonable agreement with several mammalian vasculatures. For this one, occlusions in early generation vessels have a radically different effect than occlusions in late generation vessels occluding the same percentage of area available to flow. This locality implies that whenever there is a tissue irrigated by a tree-like in-vivo vasculature, our model is able to interpret how important obstructions are for the irrigation of such tissue.</jats:p>"

Goods moving between EU countries and third countries have been traditionally subject to a rather straightforward set of provisions, as the implementation of the destination principle mainly relies on the traditional border tax adjustments. However, when dealing with supplies of services or with intra-Community transactions, the complexity of the place of supply rules increases as the realization of the destination principle depends exclusively on these provisions. In the absence of any further mechanism, these rules must lead to taxation of the 'import' of goods and services in order to guarantee tax neutrality in the domestic market, while they must also ensure that relevant 'exports' are not subject to European VAT in order to remove a tax obstacle from domestic entrepreneurs carrying on their activity in the global markets.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is often speculated that offsite manufacturing can be an important part of creating a built environment sector that is ‘smarter’, safer, more efficient and innovative and environmentally ‘friendly’. The construction industry often faces various challenges and offsite manufacturing is not the only panacea for the industry ills. However offsite manufacturing can achieve various economic, social and environmental aspirations. The sector is composed of numerous diverse players and this is one of the greatest challenges when initiating transformative changes. This inertia exists with offsite manufacturing. The paper shall discuss the current emergence of a research agenda in Australia. The potential for offsite manufacturing to be an anchor to bring industry and academia together has merit and the 2014 Strategic Roadmap for Integrated Construction Supply Chains for Offsite Housing systems Research Capability in underpinned by this focus and articulates the priority areas for national and collaborative research over the next five years. The Roadmap was developed with the support of the Australian China Science Research Foundation. The Priority Areas are an important element in strengthening the integration potential and collaborative capacity in the Australian built environment supply chain industrial systems. This Roadmap is concerned with national research projects at a small to medium scale, likely to have a strategic impact on research and industry practice in Australia. It has been developed through an analysis of research that is conducted in other countries that have a maturity in this area, followed by a comparison with Australian research that is missing in our programs currently. This was then aligned with a reflection on the barriers and enablers in current and emerging practice. It is also informed through interviews with leaders in our sector who are grappling with entering the OSM market or who have been engaged in the market for some time. The Department of Industry funded a mission which included a visit to China to analyse a more mature off site manufacturing industry. Nine site visits and interviews with three research institutions and six industry organisations provided date for an international comparative analysis and the Roadmap.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a techno-economic investigation of a nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) process for treating brackish water. Optimization experiments of six commercially available small scale RO and NF membranes were carried out using formulated artificial groundwater. A predictive model was developed by using response surface methodology (RSM) for optimization of input process parameters of brackish water membrane processes to simultaneously maximize water recovery and salt rejection while minimizing energy demand. A predictive model using multiple response optimization revealed that CSM RO and NF250 membranes showed the optimal efficiency with 20.24% and 18.98% water recovery, 90.22% and 70.64% salt rejection and 17.87 kWh/m3 and 9.35 kWh/m3 of specific energy consumption (SEC), respectively. Furthermore, confirmation of RSM predictions was carried out by an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained by RSM experimental data. Predicted values by both RSM and ANN modeling methodologies were compared and found within the acceptable range. Finally, a membrane validation experiment was carried out successfully at proposed optimal conditions, which proved the accuracy of the employed RSM and ANN models. Detailed analyses of the economic assessment showed that the recovery rate can play a major role in reducing the cost of a membrane system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>In Germany, individuals in need of long‐term care receive support through benefits of the long‐term care insurance. A central goal of the insurance is to support informal care provided by family members. Care recipients can choose between benefits in kind (formal home care services) and benefits in cash. From a budgetary perspective, family care is often considered a cost‐saving alternative to formal home care and to stationary nursing care. However, the opportunity costs resulting from reduced labor supply of the carer are often overlooked. We focus on the labor supply decision of family carers and the incentives set by the long‐term care insurance. We estimate a structural model of labor supply and the choice of benefits of family carers. We find that benefits in kind have small positive effects on labor supply. Labor supply elasticities of cash benefits are larger and negative. If both types of benefits increase, negative labor supply effects are offset to a large extent. However, the average effect is significantly negative. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cryptosporidium is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases worldwide. Its oocysts possess a robust wall that is extremely resistant to the chlorine used for potable water disinfection. The current procedures of nucleic acid extraction and purification, such as the freeze–thaw (F/T) method and the commercial kits, are time consuming and expensive. To this end, a surfactant extraction treatment (SET) was developed as a method to extract nucleic acids from Cryptosporidium using only surfactants. The use of 18S rRNA improves the sensitivity of Cryptosporidium detection for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), because 18S rRNA molecules are constitutively present in high copy numbers. Therefore, we applied SET to the detection of Cryptosporidium 18S rRNA using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for the first time. RT-PCR was inhibited by 0.01% of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), whereas the inhibition did not occur with 5% of the nonionic surfactants Tween 20, Triton X-100, Tween 80, and Triton X-114. However, the nonionic surfactants could not completely suppress the inhibition induced by 0.1% SDS. We successfully extracted 18S rRNA genes from oocysts by SET without the F/T method and detected them by real-time RT-PCR.</jats:p>",

A complex water distribution network model of Copenhagen, Denmark, was simplified by topological clustering into recognizable water movement patterns to: (1) identify steady clusters for a part of the network where an actual contamination has occurred; (2) analyze this event by the use of mesh diagrams; and (3) analyze the use of mesh diagrams as a decision support tool for planning water quality monitoring. Initially, the network model was divided into strongly and weakly connected clusters for selected time periods and mesh diagrams were used for analysing cluster connections in the Nørrebro district. Here, areas of particular interest for water quality monitoring were identified by including user-information about consumption rates and consumers particular sensitive towards water quality deterioration. The analysis revealed sampling locations within steady clusters, which increased samples' comparability over time. Furthermore, the method provided a simplified overview of water movement in complex distribution networks, and could assist identification of potential contamination and affected consumers in contamination cases. Although still in development, the method shows potential for assisting utilities during planning of monitoring programs and as decision support tool during emergency contingency situations.</jats:p>",

We explore two supply chain design strategies: (i) the dispersion of supply chain partners to reduce supply chain disruption risk versus (ii) the co‐location of supply chain partners to reduce supply chain disruption risk. In addition, we assess supply chain disruption risk from three perspectives: the inbound material flow from the supplier (supply side), the internal production processes (internal), and the outbound material flow to the customer (customer side) as a disruption can occur at any of these locations. We measure disruption risk in terms of stoppages in flows, reductions in flow, close calls (disruptions that were prevented at the last minute), disruption duration (time until normal operation flow was restored), and the spread of disruptions all the way through the supply chain. We use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to analyze our data, finding that lead times, especially supply side lead times, are significantly associated with higher levels of supply chain disruption risk. We find co‐location with suppliers appears to have beneficial effects to the reduction of disruption duration, and, overall supply side factors have a higher impact when it comes to supply chain disruption risk than comparable customer side factors.</jats:p>",

This study estimated the costs associated with treating algae and algal by‐products in the Waco, Tex., drinking water supply during 2002–2012. During that period, the city incurred an estimated cost of $70.4 million in addressing tap water taste and odor problems and potentially lost between $6.9 million and $10.3 million in revenue, partly as a result of decreased water sales to neighboring communities. Waco's average cost for providing tap water to its residents exceeds the national average for similar‐size water treatment systems, and a higher proportion of its drinking water production costs are attributed to advanced treatment compared with the national average. This analysis is intended to help water utility managers understand the costs associated with dealing with elevated nutrient loading and algal blooms in drinking water supplies.</jats:p>",

Moreover, it aims to explore the benefits of ES to organizations and to relate these benefits to the ES adoption in future sustainable city settings. Future cities will have micro-industries requiring dynamic interactions and will be dependent on efficient supply chains. The recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT) such as cloud computing through its dynamic, on-demand and service-based delivery are making it possible to achieve those goals for supply chains. The ES in general and more specifically SCMS have integrated organizations into one seamless mesh. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper presents a framework for adoption of sustainable ES in a smart city setting. The framework, firstly, is presented at a macro-level, particularly incorporating the relative significance of motivational factors for sustainable ES adoption. Subsequently, The authors study the benefits of ES as perceived by large and small and medium enterprise (SME) organizations using 100 case studies and discuss how these benefits can be realized for smart cities by projecting the ES benefits onto the proposed framework. The benefits are estimated with the Shang and Seddon’s (2002) framework. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The adoption of ES initiated with environmental factors and mediated with business and technical factors will bring benefits in all the dimensions of triple bottom line in addition to the firm’s performance. ES will have pivotal role in future smart city settings and will be able to offer social, environmental and economic sustainability in addition to traditional organizational performance indicators. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The proposed framework for ES adoption will bring ES packages (particularly, the required relative significance of adoption reasons) into the perspective of sustainable development.

The assembly line has mainly manual activities, divided in 5 workstations. The line produces two types of similar products. Using dynamic simulation (Arena software) that mimics the lines functioning mode, different experimental conditions are created, determined by the variation of the above mentioned parameters, following the evolution of the performance indicators: average work in process, cost per unit, systems reactivity to client demand and throughput.

ANNs were also used to developed surface response plots to ease optimum selection of dosage. Trained ANNs were used to predict turbidity outcomes for a range of alum and carbon dioxide dosages and these were compared to historical data. Point-wise confidence intervals were obtained based on error and squared error values during the training process. The probability of the true value falling within the predicted interval ranged from 0.25 to 0.81 and the average interval width ranged from 0.15 to 0.62 NTU.

Strategies that balance economic and environmental performance are increasingly sought after as enterprises that increasingly focus on the sustainability of their operations. Green supply chain management (GSCM) in particular, enables the integration of environmentally friendly suppliers into the supply chain to be systematised to fit with specific environmental regulations and policies. More persuasively, GSCM allows enterprises to improve profits whilst lowering impacts on the global environment. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A two-phase survey approach was adopted for the research. For the first phase, semi-structured interviews with senior management representatives of the case company – a Chinese-based electronic machinery manufacturer – were used to determine green supplier selection criteria. For the second phase, a two-part questionnaire survey was undertaken, the first part providing the data for an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis of the first-phase criteria and the second with collecting data for an Entropy weight analysis. The resultant AHP and Entropy weights were then combined to form compromised weights – which, using technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodology, were translated into preferential rankings of suppliers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Senior managers were found to rank traditional criteria more highly than environmental alternatives – the implication being that for the company, concerned, it may take some time before environmental awareness is fully assimilated into GSCM practice. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper moves us a significant step closer to the application more widely, of innovative AHP-Entropy/TOPSIS methodology to real-world SCM problems.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the merits of hedging stochastic input costs (i.e., reducing the risk of adverse changes in costs) in a decentralized, risk-neutral supply chain. Specifically, we consider a generalized version of the well-known “selling-to-the-newsvendor” model in which both the upstream and the downstream firms face stochastic input costs. The firms’ operations are intertwined—i.e., the downstream buyer depends on the upstream supplier for delivery and the supplier depends on the buyer for purchase. We show that if left unmanaged, the stochastic costs that reverberate through the supply chain can lead to significant financial losses. The situation could deteriorate to the point of a supply disruption if at least one of the supply chain members cannot profitably make its product. To the extent that hedging can ensure continuation in supply, hedging can have value to at least some of the members of the supply chain. We identify conditions under which the risk of the supply chain breakdown will cause the supply chain members to hedge their input costs: (i) the downstream buyer’s market power exceeds a critical threshold; or (ii) the upstream firm operates on a large margin, there is a high baseline demand for downstream firm’s final product, and the downstream firm’s market power is below a critical threshold. In absence of these conditions there are equilibria in which neither firm hedges. To sustain hedging in equilibrium, both firms must hedge and supply chain breakdown must be costly. The equilibrium hedging policy will (in general) be a partial hedging policy. There are also situations when firms hedge in equilibrium although hedging reduces their expected payoff. </jats:p>",

When the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is completed, the water supply pattern of the Haihe River plain in North China will change significantly due to the replenishment of water sources and groundwater-exploitation control. The water-cycle-simulation model – MODCYCLE, has been used in simulating the groundwater dynamic balance for 2001–2010. Then different schemes of water supply in 2020 and 2030 were set up to quantitatively simulate the shallow-groundwater dynamic responses in the future. The results show that the total shallow-groundwater recharge is mainly raised by the increases in precipitation infiltration and surface-water irrigation infiltration. Meanwhile, the decrease of groundwater withdrawal contributes to reduce the total discharge. The recharge–discharge structure of local groundwater was still in a negative balance but improved gradually. The shallow-groundwater level in most parts was still falling before 2030, but more slowly. This study can benefit the rational exploitation of water resources in the Haihe River plain.\n                    </jats:p>"

The paper identifies labor reallocation and coping strategies of poor urban workers on a heat wave day compared to a normal summer day by surveying informal sector workers who work in the open. The workers are found to forgo 1.19 h of work time and 0.46 h of family time and use these extra 1.65 h to rest more on heat wave days to adapt to heat stress. They resort to other adaptations like eating appropriate food with high water content, keeping their house cool by repeated wiping of floor using cooling ingredients, covering the roof of their living space with paddy straw, putting thick grass curtains, using fans for longer hours etc. These adaptations including the work time loss costs around INR 195 per heat wave day to a household, which is, on average, 2.7% of their monthly income. The paper approximates the private adaptation costs of informal sector workers to heat waves. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a supply chain with one buyer and two suppliers who are subject to disruptions and whose likelihoods of disruption are their private information. In such a setting, does the buyer benefit from engaging the services of a better-informed procurement service provider (PSP) compared to procuring directly from the suppliers? Intuition might suggest that hiring a PSP is always the right choice because the PSP’s knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management. On the other hand, earlier studies prove that using a PSP purely for its superior knowledge about supply costs is always worse for a buyer than contracting with the suppliers directly. Our answer to this research question is more nuanced. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies, we find that the buyer may benefit from using a PSP. We identify, quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs of using a PSP, and describe conditions under which the benefits exceed the costs. The benefits of using a PSP are derived when one supplier is of high reliability and the other is of low reliability, from a reduction of informational costs due to implicit supplier collusion facilitated by the PSP and an improvement of supply availability. The costs of using a PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the loss of direct control over the supplier’s production actions, which leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs, and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion. Comparative statics analysis indicates that using the PSP is valuable only if the buyer diversifies with some supplier-type combinations but not others, and that hiring a PSP is not a solution to the problem of an unreliable supply base. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

Six urban logistic prototypes built on the themes of future cities, community resilience and urban supply chain management (SCM) are summarized, together with details of the data collection procedure and the methodological challenges encountered. Our investigation aimed to explore the potential of logistics prototyping to develop “user-driven” and “SME” approaches to future city design and urban supply chain decision-making.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– This Boston field experiment was a case study investigation conducted between May and August 2013. Qualitative data was collected using a “mixed-method” approach combining together focus groups (MIT faculty), scenarios, prototyping workshops, interviews and document analysis.

In basing our case study within one city then this might be seen as limiting the complexity of the empirical context – however, the situation within different cities is inherently complex. Case studies also attract criticism on the grounds of not being representative; in this situation, they might be criticized as imperfect indicators of what transpires in other situations.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of N deficiency and re-supply on growth, physiology, and amino acids in sweetpotato. Two leaf-vegetable sweetpotato cultivars, Pushu 53 and Tainong 71, were subjected to three treatments in hydro-culture: 1) N sufficiency, 2) N deficiency, and 3) N deficiency and subsequently with N re-supply. Compared with N sufficiency, N deficiency caused a decrease in vine growth, carotenoid and chlorophyll content (Chlt), root viability, photosynthesis, and nitrate reductase (NR) activity in both cultivars, but to a great extent in Tainong 71. Whereas N deficiency increased root growth and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in both cultivars, and the increase in ‘Tainong 71’ was more obvious. Re-supply of N recovered the vine growth, root viability, Chlt, photosynthesis, NR, and GS activity, to a greater extent for ‘Pushu 53’ than for ‘Tainong 71’. N deficiency significantly decreased essential amino acids, including lysine, phenylalanince, isoleucine, tryptophane, leucine, and valine contents and nonessential amino acids, consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glycine, argnine, and proline content in both cultivars. These results indicated that the light leaf color leafy sweetpotato ‘Tainong 71’ is sensitive to the N availability and the dark green leaf color ‘Pushu 53’ is more tolerant to low N, which appear to reflect the differential response of two cultivars to their different adaptability to N availability.</jats:p>",

In addition to the LSP, four fashion retailers were involved in the study. The case study was carried out using a review of existing RFID tracking implementations in the fashion industry, analysis of an RFID tracking pilot conducted by the case company, and interviews with representatives of the retailers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – By varying three design parameters (place of tagging, place of tracking start and place of tracking end) a tracking solution can be configured to fit the requirements and constraints of different fashion supply chains. In the fashion logistics context under investigation, such parameterization addresses retailer requirements, brings concrete and quantifiable benefits to both LSP and its customers, and enables incremental adoption of RFID tracking. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Although the typology is developed in the specific setting of a case company developing RFID tracking solutions for fashion logistics, the design parameters identified in the study can be used when considering configurable tracking solutions also in other domains and settings. However, further research is needed to evaluate the proposed typology in those settings. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The proposed typology enables fashion companies to consider which configuration of RFID tracking best fits the requirements and constraints imposed by their particular supply chain.

This paper analyzes the roles and benefits of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and market‐based water transfers in an integrated regional water system where agricultural and urban water users coordinate supply and demand management based on supply reliability and economic values of water. Agricultural users optimize land and water use for annual and perennial crops to maximize farm income, while urban users choose short‐term and long‐term water conservation actions to maintain reliability and minimize costs. The temporal order of these decisions is represented in a two‐stage optimization that maximizes the net expected benefits of crop production, urban conservation and water management including conjunctive use and water transfers. Long‐term decisions are in the first stage and short‐term decisions are in a second stage based on probabilities of water availability events. Analytical and numerical analyses are made. Results show that conjunctive use and water transfers can substantially stabilize farmer's income and reduce system costs by reducing expensive urban water conservation or construction. Water transfers can equalize marginal values of water across users, while conjunctive use minimizes water marginal value differences in time. Model results are useful for exploring the integration of different water demands and supplies through water transfers, conjunctive use, and conservation, providing valuable insights for improving system management.</jats:p>",

It is based on a system of phase-locked RF generators that output single frequency voltage waveforms corresponding to multiple consecutive harmonics of a fundamental frequency. These signals are matched individually and combined to drive a RF plasma. Electrical filters are used to prevent parasitic interactions between the matching branches. By adjusting the harmonics’ phases and voltage amplitudes individually, any voltage waveform can be approximated as a customized finite Fourier series. This RF supply system is easily adaptable to any technological plasma for industrial applications and allows the commercial utilization of process optimization based on voltage waveform tailoring for the first time. Here, this system is tested on a capacitive discharge based on three consecutive harmonics of 13.56 MHz. According to the Electrical Asymmetry Effect, tuning the phases between the applied harmonics results in an electrical control of the DC self-bias and the mean ion energy at almost constant ion flux. A comparison with the reference case of an electrically asymmetric dual-frequency discharge reveals that the control range of the mean ion energy can be significantly enlarged by using more than two consecutive harmonics.</jats:p>",

The retailer's type is unknown to the suppliers. The flexible supplier has a high variable cost and a low fixed cost, while the efficient supplier has a low variable cost and a high fixed cost. Each supplier offers the retailer a menu of contracts. The retailer chooses the contract that maximizes its expected profit. For this setting, we characterize the equilibrium contract menus offered by the suppliers to the retailer. We find that the equilibrium contract menus depend on which supplier–retailer match can generate the highest supply chain profit and on how much information rent the supplier may need to pay. An important feature of the equilibrium contract menus is that the contract assigned to the more profitable retailer will coordinate the supply chain, while the contract assigned to the less profitable retailer may not. In addition, in some circumstances, the flexible supplier may choose not to serve the high‐volume retailer, in order to avoid excessive information rent. </jats:p>",

In this paper, a control strategy is considered for dynamically managing power flows in portable HPSSs employing batteries and supercapacitors. Our dynamic power management strategy utilizes the concept of approximate dynamic programming (ADP). ADP methods are important tools in the fields of stochastic control and machine learning, and the utilization of these tools for practical engineering problems is now an active and promising research field. We propose an ADP-based procedure based on optimization under constraints including the iterated Bellman inequalities, which can be solved by convex optimization carried out offline, to find the optimal power management rules for portable HPSSs. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is tested through dynamic simulations for smartphone workload scenarios, and simulation results show that the proposed strategy can successfully cope with uncertain workload demands.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) is an open ocean region with little input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), suggesting that pelagic production has to be the main source of DOM. Inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) concentrations affect pelagic production, leading to DOM modifications. The quantitative and qualitative changes in DOM are often estimated by its optical properties. Colored DOM (CDOM) is often used to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations by applied techniques, e.g. through remote sensing, whereas DOM properties, such as molecular weight, can be estimated from the slopes of the CDOM absorption spectra (S). Fluorescence properties of CDOM (FDOM) allow discriminating between different structural CDOM properties. The investigation of distribution and cycling of CDOM and FDOM was recognized to be important for understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes, influencing DOM. However, little information is available about effects of nutrient variability on CDOM and FDOM dynamics. Here we present results from two mesocosm experiments conducted with a natural plankton community of the ETNA, where effects of DIP (\"Varied P\") and DIN (\"Varied N\") supply on optical properties of DOM were studied. CDOM accumulated proportionally to phytoplankton biomass during the experiments. S decreased over time indicating accumulation of high molecular weight DOM. In Varied N, an additional CDOM portion, as a result of bacterial DOM reworking, was determined. It increased the CDOM fraction in DOC proportionally to the supplied DIN. The humic-like FDOM component (Comp.1) was derived by bacteria proportionally to DIN supply. The bound-to-protein amino acid-like FDOM component (Comp.2) was released irrespectively to phytoplankton biomass, but depending on DIP and DIN concentrations, as a part of an overflow mechanism. Under high DIN supply, Comp.2 was removed by bacterial reworking processes, leading to an accumulation of humic-like Comp.1. No influence of nutrient availability on amino acid-like FDOM component in peptide form (Comp.3) was observed. Comp.3 potentially acted as an intermediate product during formation or degradation Comp.2. Our findings suggest that changes in nutrient concentrations may lead to substantial responses in the quantity and \"quality\" of optically active DOM and, therefore, might bias results of the applied techniques for an estimation of DOC concentrations in open ocean regions.\n                        </jats:p>"

The authors theoretically advance value chain theory by, firstly, considering the influence of community type and age on consumption and, secondly, exploring the role that consumers can play in value-adding activities. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in moving from a transactional approach towards consumer relationships in the value chain towards managing consumers as a source of relational value (e.g. co-creation and integrated perspectives). </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The conceptual framework is theoretically positioned in relation to community and digital community practices in the social era. A series of research questions are presented, then these questions are explored drawing on empirical data from the Pew database. The authors then advance the framework further to consider news firm strategy towards its consumers. Fifteen in-depth executive interviews were conducted with local news organizations in the Manchester area of the UK. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The authors illustrate that different types of communities (merging cohorts and locations) are influencing levels of technological and social connectivity within the value chain. The authors also found that the news industry is experimenting with reconfiguring its consumer relations from a purely transactional to a co-created and participatory value-added activity in the social era. In terms of its policy impact, the findings in this paper show that the whole strategic value chain ideology of the news industry needs to change radically; away from its largely transactional (and lack of trust) approach in the ability of consumers to create value in the supply chain (other than to buy a product) and, move towards much greater consumer involvement and participation in value chain processes (creation, production and distribution of news products and services). </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The change associated with social media and connectivity is changing the way that different community types and consumer groups are now consuming and participating in news content creation. Unlike previous studies, the authors show that there is variance and complexity in the levels of consumer participation by community type/age group. Using the Pew data, the authors contribute to knowledge on the value creation strategy of news firms in the social era, by identifying how communicative, social and communicative logics influence value and co-creation activities in the local news supply chain. Through interviews, the authors advance value co-creation theory from its strategic and marketing origins to operational and supply chain implementation.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Studies examining the influence of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have rarely considered water turnover, the quantitatively most important biogeochemical flux in ecosystems and a process with high sensitivity to climate warming. With a tree sapling experiment consisting of three diversity levels (1, 3, 5 species), 11 different species combinations and two soil moisture levels (moist and dry), we examined the influence of tree species diversity and species identity on stand transpiration (T) under ample and restricted water supply. We further asked whether growth in mixture leads to adaptive responses in the hydraulic system and water loss regulation in plants with heterospecific neighbors compared to plants in monoculture. In moist soil, T was on average ∼11% higher in the mixtures than in the monocultures (significant net diversity effect), which can mostly be attributed to a selection effect. Overyielding in T was highest in mixtures when <jats:italic>Tilia cordata</jats:italic> and/or <jats:italic>Fraxinus excelsior</jats:italic> were present. Both species developed larger leaf areas (LA) and sapwood areas (SA) in monocultures than the other species and furthermore increased LA and SA from the monocultures to the mixtures. Thus, inherent species differences in LA and hydraulics, but also neighbor effects on these traits determined T to a large extend. In dry soil, the diversity effect on T was not larger but slightly smaller, which is not in agreement with other published studies. We conclude that differences between pure and mixed sapling assemblages in stand water consumption and drought response are mainly caused by species identity effects, while species diversity seems to be less influential.</jats:p>",

In the experiments, electrolytic hydrogen and oxygen were injected upstream and downstream in a laboratory-scale aquifer, respectively, and measurements were made for nitrate, nitrite, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved hydrogen, total organic carbon (TOC), turbidity, and chromaticity. Experimental results demonstrated that steady-state denitrification and oxygenation of groundwater were achieved over 820 days. During the initial phase of the experiments, nitrite was accumulated at a level of several mg-N/L in a hydrogen-injected zone, but it was almost completely oxidized to nitrate in a downstream oxygen-injected zone. In subsequent experiments, nitrite accumulation was not observed in effluent, and satisfactory treatments were achieved. Effluent concentrations of total nitrate and nitrite, TOC, turbidity, and chromaticity were generally below World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water (11.3 mg-N/L). It should be mentioned that water quality parameters such as TOC, turbidity, and chromaticity were lower in effluent than influent, and no clogging problem was observed. From these results, we concluded that the present in situ process has superior properties in terms of long-term performance and stability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The critical point of performance and risk supply chain in a dairy product agro-industries was found in the product’s perishable characteristics. Bacterial and antibiotic contaminations have been identiﬁed as the major risks. This risks arise from a series of activities strarting from farms, cooperatives and Milk Processing Industry that will affect the entire supply chain performance. This paper aimed to design performance and risk supply chain model for agroindustrial dairy product supply chain risks by using Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAMS) approach. The approach isused to translate a quantity that is expressed using the language (linguistic). The fuzzy logic system provides fourbasic elements, namely :  (i) rule base; (ii) inference engine; (iii) fuzziﬁcation; (iv) defuzziﬁcation. There are three proposed components in the model, namely : (i) performance proﬁle; (ii) risk proﬁle and (iii) risk exposure, which were expressed in time, cost and quality. Theinitial stage began with the analysis of invetible exposure risk exposure,including analysis of environmental and conﬁguration characteristics, as well as dairy agro-industries supply chain. The second stage wasanalysis of evitable exposure risk, while the third stage was to change, risk exposure into time, cost and quality performance units. The second stage generateds risk magnitude of risk as a function of probability andseverity, the two value that were measured with Fuzzy AssociativeMemories (FAMS). The Model, therefore  showed the  impact of emerging risks damage to the agro-industry supply chain, which could be measured and be minimized in order to improve the robustnesss of the supply chain.Keywords: Performance, risk, fuzzy, supply chain, dairy agroindustry ABSTRAKTitik kritis dari performansi dan risiko rantai pasok agroindustri susu terletak pada karakteristik produknya yang mudah rusak. Risiko tertinggi yang teridentiﬁkasi pada rantai ini adalah risiko susu terkontaminasi bakteri dan antibiotik. Risiko ini muncul dari rangkaian aktivitas yang terjadi mulai dari peternakan, koperasi dan Industri Pengolahan Susu (IPS) yang akan mempengaruhi performasi rantai pasok keseluruhan. Paper ini bertujuan untuk merancang model performansi dan risiko rantai pasok agroindustri susu dengan menggunakan pendekatan Fuzzy Assosiated Memories (FAMs). Logika fuzzy digunakan untuk menerjemahkan suatu besaran yang diekspresikan menggunakan bahasa (linguistic). Secara umum dalam sistem logika fuzzy terdapat empat buah elemen dasar, yaitu: basis kaidah (rule base), mekanisme pengambilan keputusan (inference engine), proses fuzziﬁkasi (fuzziﬁcation) dan proses defuzziﬁkasi (defuzziﬁcation). Ada tiga komponen yang dipertimbangkan dalam rancangan model yaitu proﬁl performansi, proﬁl risiko dan eksposurrisiko dalam ukuran waktu, biaya dan kualitas. Tahap pertama dimulai dengan menganalisis eksposur risiko yang tidak terhindarkan yang meliputi analisis karakteristik lingkungan dan konﬁgurasi serta karakteristik rantai pasok agroindustri susu. Tahap kedua adalah menganalisis eksposure risiko yang dapat dihindari. Tahap ketiga adalah mengubah eksposur risiko ke dalam ukuran performansi waktu, biaya dan kualitas. Pada tahap kedua dihasilkan magnitude risiko, yang merupakan fungsi dari nilai probabilitas dan severity yang dilakukan dengan menggunakan Fuzzy Assosiated Memories (FAMs).Dengan model ini diharapkan dampak kerusakan dari risiko yang muncul pada rantai pasok agroindustri susu dapat terukur dan dapat diminimasi sehingga dapat meningkatkan ketangguhan (robustnes) dari rantai pasok.Kata kunci: Performansi, risiko, fuzzy, rantai pasok, agroindustri susu</jats:p>"

Focusing on the artifact and solution design in a case study, we contribute to the emerging theory of logistics innovations through articulating the generative mechanisms of the adoption of logistics innovation, that is, the mechanisms through which the design of the solution enables its adoption. We study On‐site Shop, a rare example from the construction industry of a logistics innovation that has successfully migrated from a limited number of pilots to common practice. The case study is based on insights from participation in the design of the solution, and on 55 interviews conducted in a relationship triad consisting of three groups: (1) construction site users, (2) the solution designers, and (3) the suppliers. We propose that standard and efficient solution set‐up is the key enabler of logistics innovation's adoption at temporary construction sites. Communication and operating rules facilitate adoption in the triad, whereas internal and external integration further advance adoption by creating links between the innovative logistics solution and other activities. Finally, trilateral collaboration and congruent technological frames in the relationship triad sustain adoption over time.</jats:p>",

To assist the achievement of the MDGs, it is essential to overcome the traditional approach to planning water supply and sanitation (WS&amp;S) systems. This study developed user and/or service provider cost functions for available WS&amp;S technologies in the vicinity of Bahir Dar and Arba Minch townships. The cost functions help to estimate the life cycle cost of WS&amp;S systems. Eight water supply and eleven sanitation technologies' design documents and cost data were collected and analysed. Results revealed that the maximum daily water demand and person equivalent were the responsive variables for the initial investment and/or recurrent costs of almost all WS&amp;S technologies, respectively. In addition, disinfectant types, pump head, pipe length and diameter, tower height, well depth, conveyance distance and composting volume were identified as important parameters for the corresponding WS&amp;S technologies. However, the cost of shallow well equipped with hand pump was influenced merely by the well depth. The obtained cost functions contribute to overcoming the common practice of WS&amp;S systems comparison in the study area, which largely focus on their initial investment costs.</jats:p>",

This has led to the development of a systematic analysis of risk incorporated with raw materials usage, often referred as criticality assessment. In principle, this concept is based on the material flow approach. The potential role of life cycle assessment (LCA) to integrate resource criticality through broadening its scope into the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework has been discussed within the LCA communities for some time. In this article, we aim at answering the question of how to proceed toward integration of the geopolitical aspect of resource criticality into the LCSA framework. The article focuses on the assessment of the geopolitical supply risk of 14 resources imported to the seven major advanced economies and the five most relevant emerging countries. Unlike a few previous studies, we propose a new method of calculation for the geopolitical supply risk, which is differentiated by countries based on the import patterns instead of a global production distribution. Our results suggest that rare earth elements, tungsten, antimony, and beryllium generally pose high geopolitical supply risk. Results from the Monte Carlo simulation allow consideration of data uncertainties for result interpretation. Issues concerning the consideration of the full supply chain are exemplarily discussed for cobalt. Our research broadens the scope of LCA from only environmental performance to a resource supply‐risk assessment tool that includes accessibility owing to political instability and market concentration under the LCSA framework.</jats:p>",

In order to address large uncertainties in customer demands at the different regional markets, a novel robust scenario formulation, which has been recently developed by the authors, is tailored and applied for strategic optimization. Case study results show that the robust scenario formulation works well for this real industrial supply chain system, and it outperforms the deterministic formulation and the classical scenario‐based stochastic programming formulation by generating better expected economic performance and solutions that are guaranteed to be feasible for all uncertainty realizations. The robust scenario problem exhibits a decomposable structure that can be taken advantage of by Benders decomposition for efficient solution, so the application of Benders decomposition to the solution of the strategic optimization is also discussed. The case study results show that Benders decomposition can reduce the solution time by almost an order of magnitude when the number of scenarios in the problem is large.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

These feedbacks are especially important where landscape features differ in their provision of ecosystem services. For example, the shape of coastal foredunes, a product of both physical and biological forces, determines their ability to protect communities from rising seas and changing patterns of storminess. Here we assessed how sand supply and changes in vegetation over interannual (3 year) and decadal (21 year) scales influenced foredune shape along 100 km of coastline in the US Pacific Northwest. Across 21 years, vegetation switched from one congeneric non-native beachgrass to another (\n            <jats:italic>Ammophila arenaria</jats:italic>\n            to\n            <jats:italic>A. breviligulata</jats:italic>\n            ) while sand supply rates were positive. At interannual timescales, sand supply rates explained the majority of change in foredune height (64–69%) and width (56–80%). However, at decadal scales, change in vegetation explained the majority of the change in foredune width (62–68%), whereas sand supply rates explained most of the change in foredune height (88–90%). In areas with lower shoreline change rates (±2 m yr\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            ), the change in vegetation explained the majority of decadal changes in foredune width (56–57%) and height (59–76%).

The optimal portfolio shares for an existing water supply system are derived and compared with the observed contributions to total water stock, revealing unexploited hedging opportunities between various naturally occurring water sources as well as a general over‐reliance on manufactured water. The optimal solution implies that future supply augmentations should target natural sources of water ahead of manufactured water.

In fairs and markets, every type of food and items necessary for daily life were sold in the bigger and smaller workshops of the cities. There were also countless small street vendors who kept bench on the street, as well as peasants who came to the city to offer the products of their gardens and chicken coop, as well as hunting or farming products, which they sold knocking from door to door. Street vendors also travelled the less frequented streets carrying their bales and chests, reaching scattered villages and hamlets. A great multiplicity of economic actors who competed together to reach every type of consumer, from the wealthiest to the most humble. The aim of the research project was to understand the economic organisation and evolution of these different forms of retail trade. In terms of results, the contributions collected in this volume constitute the most historiographically updated answer to some of the proposed questions, such as the analysis of the links between the various spatial scales (from the shop to the European networks of itinerant merchants), formal and informal trade between rule and practice, the displacement of goods between the city and the countryside, the tensions between the actors of these exchanges, their rivalries and their agreements, but also the expectations of consumers and the needs of the state, the effects on institutional organisation and on distribution trades organisation in the period between the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture sector becomes important sector in many developing countries including in Nigeria. The contribution of agricultural sector to the development of Nigeria is considerable. This important sector was the economic backbone upon which the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria relied for its foreign exchange and revenue. A country was once a net exporter of agricultural products. However, since the discovery of oil in the early 1960, agricultural productivity has continually decreased due to many problems, especially related to financial aspect. Several programmes and policies have been adopted by various administrations to find solution to the dwindling agricultural productivity but to no avail. These solutions have mainly focused on alleviating the financial problems the farmers face. Usually financial intermediaries including banks would provide micro-financing to the farmers but with high interest rates coupled with collateral requirements. Hence, this mode of financing has not produced any significant result. This study will therefore examine problems facing agricultural sector in Nigeria with special emphasis on its financial aspect and propose a Waqf-MuzaraahSupply Chain model (WMSCM). Under this model, Waqf fund will be used for providing financial facility of the farmers. The relationship between farmers and financial institutions is based on partnership where profit and loss will be shared by both parties. This will enhance commitment by and cooperation among both parties to ensure the success of the business. Furthermore, the issues of collateral and high interest rate that constrain the financial ability of the farmers and their agricultural output are inherently solved by the model. Moreover, the model has features of investment and risk diversification for both the financial institutions and the farmers that will lead to high agricultural productivity and employment generation in the economy.</jats:p>"

The soluble algal products (SAP) which inhibit the microalgae growth will accumulate in the recycled water. Therefore, the ozone oxidation treatment of SAP produced by Scenedesmus sp. LX1 was studied to reduce the inhibition of SAP. The experimental results showed that there was almost no change in the content of SAP (counted by dissolved organic carbon) after ozonation, but the inhibition of SAP on microalgae growth disappeared. The intrinsic growth rate (r) of Scenedesmus sp. LX1 in the cultivation solution containing untreated SAP was 0.52 d−1, and it rose to 0.95 d−1 after SAP was ozonized. The maximum population growth rate (Rmax) followed a similar trend, increasing from 9.19 × 105 to 13.0 × 105 cells mL−1 d−1. It was suggested that the changes of fluorescence and hydrophilic–hydrophobic/acid–base property of SAP after ozonation leads to the disappearance of SAP inhibition on microalgae growth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Biomass, for example, energy crops, forests, and agricultural residues, has emerged as a renewable energy option to alleviate the consumption of limited fossil fuel resources and the consequent environmental issues. Designing an effective and efficient biomass‐to‐biofuel supply chain involves sophisticated decision‐making processes, often requiring collaborative work on data integration, model specification, scenario analysis, and coordinated implementation and management. To establish an integrated system for such work, challenges exist in (1) the limited interoperability between bioenergy models and geographic information systems (GIS); (2) interactive scenario construction, evaluation, and sharing; and (3) complex optimization problem solving that requires advanced cyberinfrastructure resources to support interactive decision‐making. To resolve these challenges, this paper describes CyberGIS‐BioScope, an interactive and collaborative cyberGIS‐based spatial decision‐making environment for biomass‐to‐biofuel supply chain optimization. The CyberGIS‐BioScope takes advantage of cyberGIS capabilities to process and analyze spatial data and enhance visualization and sharing of optimization results. Meanwhile, the integrated environment makes the complex optimization model and advanced cyberinfrastructure resources easily accessible for agricultural scientists and decision‐makers and thus accelerates their scientific discovery and decision‐making processes.

When a broader host of environmental impacts are examined, environmental trade‐offs often exist when biofuels are compared to gasoline. Multivariate analysis methods examining a wide variety of weighting value systems and methodology assumptions were used to determine process design options with the lowest overall environmental impact. A multivariate environmental analysis was applied to the dilute acid pre‐treatment process followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and the fermentation process for converting loblolly pine, eucalyptus, natural hardwood, switchgrass, and sweet sorghum biomass to ethanol. The influence of co‐product treatment method choices, inclusion of direct land‐use change, and electrical grid assumptions were examined using 16 different weighting methods to create a single score result. Biofuel system rankings based on <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content> emissions following the Renewable Fuel Standards 2 (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RFS2</jats:styled-content>) methods were very sensitive to the co‐product treatment method, inclusion of land‐use change emissions, and energy grid assumptions. The multivariate analysis ranking was heavily influenced by other environmental impacts resulting from the production of process chemicals used in ethanol conversion. Weighting methods examined had no influence on the environmental preference ranking of the biofuel scenarios. Additionally, the biofuel ranking based on the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RFS2</jats:styled-content> methodology was different than the ranking following the multivariate approach examining additional impacts. These findings demonstrate a robust approach to biofuel life cycle assessment (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LCA</jats:styled-content>) scenario analysis and suggest that the limited scope of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RFS2</jats:styled-content> environmental analysis could result in burden shifting. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Qualitative interviews with industry insiders and analysis of data from rural food retail stores (n = 20) enabled a conceptual framework to be postulated. Adding value through Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) can deliver product differentiation, but also provides opportunities for food fraud/substitution if there is a large price differential between the niche and the standard product. Therefore value can be added to products by developing associated trust and social capital, but consumers must be safeguarded from making false assumptions on provenance or from potential food criminality and predatory, criminal entrepreneurs. </jats:p>",

To reflect the common satisfaction of load demands and maximize the utilization of renewable energy in a standalone microgrid, a new index named effective rate of energy storage system (ESS) is proposed. To reflect the true work state of supercapacitor ESS (SC-ESS), the second-level data of field measurements is used in calculation and analysis. To further enhance the operational performance of the HESS, a coordinated control strategy based on state cooperation is adopted. To get a more reasonable and more credible HESS optimization model, the comparison of existing models and proposed model with different considerations on cost and life is provided.

This paper proposes a new economic order quantity (EOQ) model for reuse and recycling by expanding the EOQ model proposed by Dobos and Richter, 2004. The proposed model introduces a sequentially accumulated marginal reuse rate as a parameter in considering the balance of product demand and supply. The marginal reuse rate is calculated by using data on production distribution and disposal distribution of products for every discretized period. This model considers the sequence among recovery options: reuse, recycle and disposal. Parts are reused after having been inspected to determine whether they are reusable or not. Remaining nonreusable parts are recycled and any remaining nonrecycled parts disposed of. The extended EOQ model is applied to a case study using different scenarios for length of use and multiple generations of products. Results of computer experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Some members of the public protest against HVHF due to fears that associated compounds could migrate into aquifers. We report a case where natural gas and other contaminants migrated laterally through kilometers of rock at shallow to intermediate depths, impacting an aquifer used as a potable water source. The incident was attributed to Marcellus Shale gas development. The organic contaminants—likely derived from drilling or HVHF fluids—were detected using instrumentation not available in most commercial laboratories. More such incidents must be analyzed and data released publicly so that similar problems can be avoided through use of better management practices.</jats:p>",

Abundant applications by DART‐MS have been reviewed in this paper. The DART‐MS strategy applied to food supply chain (FSC), including production, processing, and storage and transportation, provides a comprehensive solution to various food components, contaminants, authenticity, and traceability.
