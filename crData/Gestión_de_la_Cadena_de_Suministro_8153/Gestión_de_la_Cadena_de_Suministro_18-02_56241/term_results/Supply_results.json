This leads to a discussion of heart failure and drugs commonly used in cardiovascular disease. Infective endocarditis and rheumatic fever are discussed and the associations between oral bacteria and cardiovascular disease. The concluding section deals with stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA), transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and vascular dementia.</p>",

The South African (SA) government is planning to implement a carbon tax in the future, which will present financial challenges for organisations already facing social and environmental difficulties.Objectives: The main objective of this article was to investigate the current sustainability reporting practices in supply chains of SA organisations. The focus was specifically on the supply chain sustainability practices of organisations listed in selected sectors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). A secondary objective was to investigate preparation efforts by SA companies for the impending carbon tax.Method: Data collected from sustainability and integrated annual reports of organisations in the sample were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests to compare sectors on the JSE and to compare companies listed on the socially responsible investment (SRI) Index with those that are not.Results: The results showed that there is insufficient data for some of the sectors; however, there are differences in the supply chain and sustainability practices for the remaining sectors. There are also differences in these practices between SRI and non-SRI companies. The research also showed that companies are discussing important concepts relating to the implementation of the impending carbon tax.Research impact: SA organisations need to increase their focus on sustainable supply chain practices. Further investigation into the preparation efforts of companies to reduce their emissions and/or footprint and mitigate the impact of the impending carbon tax is necessary.</jats:p>"

The sample included 67 published scientific articles between 2006 and 2016. ATLAS.ti software was used to assist with the data analysis process.Findings: The findings showed a number of factors for disposition decision-making resulting in a number of value-adding benefits, which can improve organisational performance. From the findings, a conceptual framework was developed linking the disposition decision factors with the value-adding benefits and areas of organisational performance improvements.Conclusion: The framework developed in this article contributes to new insights and can help organisations to identify different performance improvement areas associated with certain disposition decision factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem description: We study the impact of credit ratings on operational and financial decisions of a supply chain with a supplier and a retailer interacting via an early payment discount contract. The retailer has a single opportunity to order a product from the supplier to satisfy future uncertain demand. Both the retailer and supplier are capital constrained, and the retailer can use both short-term bank loans and trade credits for his financing needs, while the supplier can use short-term bank loans and/or the retailers early payment. We analyze for all relevant operational decisions (wholesale price, trade credit rates, bank loans, and order quantity) for capital-constrained firms. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on who should finance inventories, and at what rates, in the presence of differential credit ratings of the supply chain parties. Methodology: Within a modified selling to the newsvendor Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader, we derive the equilibrium trade credit rates, wholesale price, bank loans, and order quantity. Results: We show there exists a threshold such that if the supplier’s credit rating is above it, then the supplier offers trade credits with zero interest rate and the retailer uses trade credits only. Otherwise, the supplier sets a positive rate, which motivates the retailer to combine trade credits and bank loans. The supplier always benefits from working with good rating retailers. A retailer prefers to work with suppliers outside the supplier’s credit rating hole (a finite set of ratings) over suppliers with ratings within the range. Managerial implications: We provide insights on who should finance supply chain inventories and at what rates when there are differential credit rating between the supplier and retailer. We provide a plausible explanation for the practice of large and good credit rating retailers maintaining a small cash ratio and working with small suppliers in developing countries. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0669 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Interface of Finance, Operations, and Risk Management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Many countries, like South Africa, Australia, India, China and the United States, are highly dependent on coal fired power stations for energy generation. These power stations require significant amounts of water, particularly when fitted with technology to reduce pollution and climate change impacts. As water resources come under stress it is important that spatial variability in water availability is taken into consideration for future energy planning particularly with regards to motivating for a switch from coal fired power stations to renewable technologies. This is particularly true in developing countries where there is a need for increased power production and associated increasing water demands for energy. Typically future energy supply options are modelled using a least cost optimization model such as TIMES that considers water supply as an input cost, but is generally constant for all technologies. Different energy technologies are located in different regions of the country with different levels of water availability and associated infrastructure development and supply costs. In this study we develop marginal cost curves for future water supply options in different regions of a country where different energy technologies are planned for development. These water supply cost curves are then used in an expanded version of the South Africa TIMES model called SATIM-W that explicitly models the water-energy nexus by taking into account the regional nature of water supply availability associated with different energy supply technologies. The results show a significant difference in the optimal future energy mix and in particular an increase in renewables and a demand for dry-cooling technologies that would not have been the case if the regional variability of water availability had not been taken into account. Choices in energy policy, such as the introduction of a carbon tax, will also significantly impact on future water resources, placing additional water demands in some regions and making water available for other users in other regions with a declining future energy demand. This study presents a methodology for modelling the water-energy nexus that could be used to inform the sustainable development planning process in the water and energy sectors for both developed and developing countries.\n                    </jats:p>"

In this study monetary base is determined by two explanatory variables (i.e. NFA and NDC) and are called the 'proximate' determinants of the base money. Among the explanatory variables, the net foreign asset (NFA) is found as better determinant than net domestic assets (NDA) in Nepalese economy. For the analysis of determinants of money multiplier (MM), the three explanatory variables i.e., reserve to total deposits ratio (r), time deposits to demand deposits ratio (t) and currency to demand deposits ratio (c) have been used. The model applied in this study shows that explanatory variable of time deposits to demand deposits ratio is the best determinant of money multiplier. The reserve money (RM) is analyzed as the best determinant of money supply, net foreign assets (NFA) is the major determinant of reserve money and time deposits to demand deposits ratio is the significant determinant of money multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic Literature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Vol. XIII August 2016, page 55-60&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The chapter then discusses disputes that typically arise in relation to those transactions, including transportation infrastructure disputes and storage disputes. It pays particular attention to disputes relating to long-term gas sale and purchase agreements (GSPAs), an important number of which have led to high-profile arbitration proceedings in recent years. The chapter, therefore, analyzes in detail the clauses typically contained in those agreements, and the issues that typically arise in arbitration — in particular, gas price reviews.</jats:p>",

This coordination model considers the policy of late payment and prosecution for delivery of goods. Previous, The author has described the supply chain system in detail. The experiments were conducted into different case scenarios, where each scenario would represent the actual system that occurred. Then also conducted sensitivity analysis on some predicted variables significantly influence the total cost of the supply chain. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that coordination with consideration of delay in payment and penalty contract for drop ship has successfully integrated the players in the supply chain system under study. This can be proved by the lower total cost of the supply chain when it is integrated with that consideration.</jats:p>"

However, to the best of our knowledge, the dynamic of photosynthesis establishment due to differential N supply in the bioenergy crop sugarcane has not been reported to date. To address this question, we evaluated physiological and metabolic alterations along the sugarcane leaf in two contrasting genotypes, responsive (R) and nonresponsive (NR), grown under high- and low-N conditions. We found that the N supply and the responsiveness of the genotype determined the degree of senescence, the carboxylation process mediated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPcase) and differential accumulation of soluble sugars. The metabolite profiles indicated that the NR genotype had a higher respiration rate in the youngest tissues after exposure to high N. We observed elevated levels of metabolites related to photosynthesis in almost all leaf segments from the R genotype under high-N conditions, suggesting that N supply and the ability to respond to N influenced photosynthesis. Therefore, we observed that N influence on photosynthesis and other pathways is dependent on the genotype and the leaf region.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase in the capacity of cleaning and construction vehicles for highcapacity and energy-intensive mines calls for an increase in the  supply voltage of cleaning and tunneling combines, as well as  transport systems: from a voltage of 660 V switched to 1140 V, and  now to 3300 V. This allows improving technical and economic  indicators for clearing and access areas, as well as improving the reliability of local Power Supply Systems (PSS). However, this  trend prevents the supply of underground electric networks with a  voltage of 6 kV, in connection with which the problem arises of  increasing the voltage of supply networks. To date, it has become  possible to apply the 10 kV voltage to the operation, which is most  acceptable for the use of electrical equipment for electrical networks  and protection devices. Leading educational, research and design  organizations were engaged in research on this issue. An analysis of the results of the research showed that switching to 10 kV voltage is  justified and timely. At the same time, 35 kV voltage is not removed  from the agenda, which is technically feasible and economically  justified, but there are problems with the safety of its operation in  underground workings, which requires appropriate refinement. This  level of voltage will improve the quality of electricity.Conclusions: 1. Application of 35 kV voltage in the underground power supply system of coal and ore mines is advisable at a depth of more than 1000 m with a maximum load of at least 1000 kVA at the  level of the stem cables.2. Application of 35 kV voltage in underground electrical networks will allow to significantly improve the quality indicators of voltage,  reliability, and economy of the system due to the current unloading  of the most important element of SES, such as stem cables.3. Analysis of the main parameters and characteristics of electrical mine electrical equipment gives reason to believe that it allows  implementing a trend of 35 kV deep input to deep horizons of mines  (mines) and placement of 35/6 kV substations on working horizons.</jats:p>"

Such specific advice is provided by reporting empirical DEA Malmquist index findings from seven large European forwarders regarding a TBL sustainability analysis from 2006 to 2016. A major obstacle in improving sustainability consists in the newly discovered fact that with the business cycle, the three TBL areas of economic, ecologic and social objectives for logistics are undergoing different up- and down-ward trends, making it very hard to improve all three simultaneously. Additional factors are identified in the characteristics of size and government influence regarding the sustainability efficiency of forwarders. This has important impacts on supply chain design like e.g., with selection criteria.</jats:p>"

Farmers are conducted as the object of the research because they are the decision maker on all of farming activities. This study is aimed to know the effect of harvest area response, productivity response, supply response paddy, and managerial implications in Kediri. The analysis method used the Nerlove approach through harvest area response and productivity response. Data were collected annually from 1992 to 2015. The result showed  that harvest area in previous year was the significant factor to the harvest area. Grain price, fertilizer price index, rainfall, harvest area in previous 2 years and 3 years had no significant effect. Factors which had significant impact for the productivity were grain price and productivity in the previous year, but fertilizer price index, harvest area, and rainfall had no significant effect. Paddy supply-elasticity in short term and long term was inelastic so that supply paddy was unresponsive on grain price changing. Managerial implication formulation consists of procedural implications and policy implications. Procedural implications included the use of a transplanter, jajar legowo system, use of fertilizer in 6 right-ways completed with a demonstration plot. The policy implication is was composed by price and non-price policies. Price policies were showed by costs of good sold which was supported by coopertaion between farmers and BULOG and the use of combine harvester. Non-price policies were embodied with the increasing of cropping index and wetland transformation into settlements.</jats:p>"

In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS).

Water management played a significant role in both civilizations and evidence demonstrates that many principles and technologies were generated by them, throughout both civilizations' long histories. As a result, they significantly influenced the ancient world broadly, some of which are still functioning up till this present time. This study comprises the following: methodology, hydrogeology, aqueducts and water impounds, water and wastewater mains, runoff management, agricultural irrigation, as well as the use of water for recreation purposes. Usually, urban hydro-technologies reflect a progressive situation in water management. Thus, both civilizations have also achieved urban water management. Therefore, for the purpose of understanding the role of water management in ancient civilizations and their similarities and differences beyond their geography, a comparison of urban hydro-technologies was selectively developed through the long history of the ancient Chinese and Greek civilizations, which also features the basic principle of water management in the human societies beyond these two civilizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lead and zinc are used extensively in the construction and automotive industries, and require sustainable supply. In order to understand the future availability of lead and zinc, we have projected global supplies on a country-by-country basis from a detailed global assessment of mineral resources for 2013. The model GeRS-DeMo was used to create projections of lead and zinc production from ores, as well as recycling for lead. Our modelling suggests that lead and zinc production from known resources is set to peak within 15 years (lead 2025, zinc 2031). For lead, the total supply declines relatively slowly post peak due to recycling. If additional resources are found, these peaks would shift further into the future. These results suggest that lead and zinc consumers will need to plan for the future, potentially by: seeking alternative supplies (e.g., mine tailings, smelter/refinery slags); obtaining additional value from critical metals contained in lead-zinc ore deposits to counter lower grade ores; identifying potential substitutes; redesigning their products; or by contributing to the development of recycling industries.</jats:p>"

Time series data was sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin and Stock Exchange Factbook. Nigerian Real Inflation Rate was proxy for dependent (INFR) variables while Currency in Circulation (CR), Demand Deposit (DD), Time Deposit (TD), Savings Deposit (SD) and Net Foreign Asset (NFA) were used as independent variables. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method of cointegration, Augmented Dickey Fuller Unit Root, Granger Causality was used as data analysis techniques. Regression result in the study shows that Currency in Circulation, Demand Deposit and Savings Deposit has negative relationship while Net Foreign Asset and Time Deposit have positive relationship with inflation. The Augmented Dickey Fuller Test proved non stationarity of the variables at level except Net Foreign Asset but stationary at first difference. The Granger Causality Test reveals no casual relationship running through the variables. The cointegration proved no long run relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The study conclude that Money Supply have significant relationship with Nigerian Inflation Rate. It therefore recommends effective management of money supply by the monetary authorities to achieve the monetary policy objectives of price stability.</jats:p>"

To study the water quality of around 100 open wells in Trichy district, Tamilnadu, India, the analytical tool ‘geographical information system’ (GIS) was applied and the outcome analyzed. The district, based on the soil type, is categorized into three regions viz: unconsolidated (Recent), semi consolidated (Cretaceous to Miocene) and consolidated (Archaean), and this technique was applied for the water samples collected in those regions. A spatial variation in well waters in the district was studied using GIS based on 15 physico-chemical parameters. For the three regions in the district, the water quality information maps of the entire district have been prepared using a spatial interpolation technique for these parameters. Statistical analyses carried out for the parameters and the character of water related to source of supply and changes in water qualities are discussed. Also the Piper tri-linear diagram is plotted, which shows the essential chemical character of the groundwater in these open wells. The condition of the groundwater has been categorized as good, moderate and poor in the respective maps for the pre and post-monsoon seasons, with the perspective of location of the site as well as in the nature of aquifer formation. Suggestion is given for the strategies for the development and preservation of the groundwater condition in this region.</jats:p>",

The cooperation between construction contractors, prefabricated parts suppliers and other materials and equipment suppliers in the supply chain of the industrial building can not be ignored. The evolutionary game theory can be used to explain the dynamic trend of the relationship until it is stable. The evolutionary game theory is applied to study the process and method of cooperative innovation between construction contractor and many subcontractors. Based on evolutionary game theory, the paper discusses the process and method of cooperative innovation between the construction contractors and numerous subcontractors. It focuses on the analysis of the influence of cooperative profit distribution, spillover effect, innovation subsidies and cooperation risk sharing for evolutionary stable strategy. The evolutionary game model of cooperation parties is constructed. The key indexes such as profit, risk loss, distribution of excess income and innovation cost are considered comprehensively. The results show that with the increasing of the spillover effect, innovation cooperation, suppliers’ innovation income and excess returns of cooperation innovation, the system will tend to the stability of cooperation. And with the increasing of the contractor's subsidy coefficient, the innovation cost, cooperation innovation risk cost, the system will tend to uncooperative. There exists an optimal distribution coefficient of excess income, which can strengthen the cooperation willingness of both sides. This study provides a guidance for the cooperative innovation of the supply chain participating parties.</jats:p>"

In this work, a three-dimensional Si-based metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor has been reported, which is fabricated by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. Area enlargement is achieved by forming deep trenches in a silicon substrate using the deep reactive ion etching method. The results indicate that an area of 2.45 × 103 mm2 can be realized in the deep trench structure with a high aspect ratio of 30:1. Subsequently, a dielectric Al2O3 layer and electrode W/TiN layers are deposited by atomic layer deposition. The obtained capacitor has superior performance, such as a high breakdown voltage (34.1 V), a moderate energy density (≥1.23 mJ/cm2) per unit planar area, a high breakdown electric field (6.1 ± 0.1 MV/cm), a low leakage current (10−7 A/cm2 at 22.5 V), and a low quadratic voltage coefficient of capacitance (VCC) (≤63.1 ppm/V2). In addition, the device’s performance has been theoretically examined. The results show that the high energy supply and small leakage current can be attributed to the Poole–Frenkel emission in the high-field region and the trap-assisted tunneling in the low-field region. The reported capacitor has potential application as a secondary power supply.</jats:p>"

We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications. </jats:p>",

To allow for analytical tractability, the existing literature often assumes almost surely linear supply and demand functions, which greatly limits the applicability of the models. The goal of this paper is to provide a unified approach to analyze general random supply and demand functions. By transforming the problem into one defined on a higher dimension, we show that many of the seemingly highly nonlinear supply and demand functions (in the almost sure sense) are linear in the stochastic sense. With this new notion of linearity, called stochastic linearity in midpoint, our ability to analyze supply chain problems is much enhanced. We are able to prove the concavity of the profit function in the transformed supply and demand decisions for a general class of supply and demand functions that include, but are not restricted to, the ones studied in the existing literature. Thus, many of the challenging problems now become tractable. Moreover, we characterize a set of easy-to-verify conditions for stochastic linearity in midpoint. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1648 . </jats:p>",

This paper reports an empirical investigation into the value of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Sustainable Consumption and Production (SDG12), when used as a framework for action by organisations to drive change towards sustainability in global supply networks. Through inductive research, two different and contrasting approaches to improving the sustainability of supply networks have been revealed. One approach focuses on the “bottom up” ethical approach typified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification of timber products, and the other on “top-down” regulations exemplified by the UK Modern Slavery Act. In an industry noted for complex supply networks and characterised by adversarial relationships, the findings suggest that, in the long term, promoting shared values aligned with transparent, third-party monitoring will be more effective than imposing standards through legislation and regulation in supporting sustainable consumption and production.</jats:p>"

To address the challenges of water scarcity and growing energy demand, the water–energy nexus of Shaanxi is investigated in this paper by input–output analysis (IOA). The findings indicate that water and energy resources are interdependent on each other. It is observed that agricultural water use intensity is 0.28 m³ per USD and industrial water use intensity is at the lowest level of 0.013 m³. Therefore, there is a huge water saving potential in the agricultural sector. Owing to the high energy consumption in agricultural irrigation, reducing irrigation water is of benefit both for water saving and energy conservation in the agricultural sector. Meanwhile, the industrial sector accounts for 63.8% of total energy consumption in Shaanxi, and it is urgent to change the economic structure to service-based rather than agricultural or industrial activities. It is believed that integrated strategies and planning are more favored in the future in Shaanxi. Water use limitation, energy mix adjustment and pricing mechanisms should be involved in water and energy policy formulation. Remarkably, because of being low carbon and water saving, the natural gas industry will become increasingly promising in the following decades.</jats:p>",

It is well known for its Ksours, its palm groves and the good quality of its fruit and vegetables, especially the dates and their varieties. This region contains important groundwater and surface water resources. For several centuries, domestic water supply and irrigation have been carried out using traditional techniques of water harvesting such as pendulum wells and foggaras. Currently, this hydraulic heritage is meeting technical and social problems, particularly with the contribution of drilling and motor-pumps. The main issues are water table drawdown, the drying-up of water sources and degradation and decay of traditional techniques. The objective of this study is to make an inventory of all water sources in the study area, to study the impact of the contribution of modern techniques on ancestral techniques and finally to propose recommendations for safeguarding the hydraulic heritage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The methods and tools for the performance measurement and evaluation of the green supply chain management are very important elements for the construction and function of this type of supply chain. The result is a presentation of the considerations underlying a very general model, which presents some selected tools, but no breakdown of individual industries. The considerations undertaken are important and have scientific added value as usually in practice, a very large number of tools are used to assess the supply chain, which are not always correlated or adapted to the specificity of the chain. It is worth pointing out which of the already used or completely new tools and methods will be most useful for assessing the green supply chain. The structure of the paper covers the theoretical and empirical. It includes an introduction, our goals and hypotheses, state of the art, methodology, empirical findings, and discussion. We present the definitional differences between green and sustainable supply chains and focus on the selection and identification of methods for the framework model for evaluating the green supply chain. In the next step, the theoretical and selected method and tools were compared to a survey of Poland. On the basis of the survey, we present the findings and discussions found in this area. The main methodology used includes a literature review, a survey analysis using a questionnaire and statistical tools. The survey was carried out in 2015 in sample organizations in Poland. The research results showed that organizations were aware of the environmental elements of measuring and assessing the supply chain from an environmental point of view, but their use depended on many factors: the area, size of the organization, or the industry. If certain boundary conditions are met and the organizations are aware of the essence of environmental aspects in the chain, then they are applying green measures to the supply chain. These findings provide a glimpse into the measurement system and show that organizations still have yet to understand the essence of green and sustainable performance measurement, the meaning of its application, and the benefits it brings. However, traditional measurement still plays a large role, so it is important to reflect on how to convince organizations to pay more attention to environmental aspects, while at the same time applying a green supply chain assessment model. These results are a framework in which to start building a green supply chain assessment model. The empirical research aimed to answer the question of whether theoretical and sustainable management tools have already played a role in perceiving and assessing the green supply chain.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to visualize the research to-date on green supply chain management according to the intellectual framework and hot topics. Using bibliometric analysis, our paper will present a comprehensive summary of previous research on the knowledge domain. Exploring 1145 papers mainly published from 2000 to May 2017 in international peer-reviewed journals from social sciences citation index (SSCI), the basic distribution of publications are analyzed, and nine prominent research clusters in green supply chain management are visualized by a co-citation network. Key issues are highlighted and analyzed. As for future inquiries, there are numerous opportunities for more advanced theoretically-grounded research and exploration of more multi-functional and systematic approaches. In order to gain broader views of research, a triple bottom line approach can be widely applied to evaluation, impact mechanisms, decision making, drivers, risks and carrier analysis, as well as system contributions. This also provides an integrated point of view to understand the landscape of green supply chain management both for researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>"

Exactly how does productivity spill over across this type of relationship (i.e., through which mechanisms)? Additionally, how does the relative importance of these mechanisms depend on the structure of the supply chain? To answer these questions, we decompose the channels of upstream productivity spillovers—from customers to suppliers—by developing a structural econometric model on a sample of approximately 22,500 supply chain dyads. We find that the “endogenous channel” (i.e., the effect of the customer’s own productivity on the supplier’s productivity) is by far the most important source of spillovers. This is especially true if (i) the supplier has a concentrated customer base, (ii) the supplier and the customer have similar operational characteristics, and (iii) the relationship has medium maturity. In the converse scenarios, we find, it is more important to have a partner with a portfolio of favorable “contextual” characteristics (high inventory turnover, financial liquidity, and asset turnover) than to have a productive partner.</jats:p><jats:p>The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2632 .</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</jats:p>",

Attenuation of growth metabolism when NSC content is low could explain why some NSC is conserved through the night. A dynamic model, incorporating diurnal variation in NSC, is developed to simulate growth of seedlings hour-by-hour. I compare predictions of this model to published growth and NSC data for seedlings that varied according to temperature, light, day length, or CO2. Prolonged-darkness experiments show a temperature dependent upper limit on the respiration capacity. Respiration is attenuated as NSC is depleted. Furthermore, when NSC is high at dawn, inhibition of photosynthesis could attenuate the accumulation of NSC under low temperature, high light, or high CO2. These concepts are used to simulate plant metabolism and growth rates and diurnal variation of NSC in tomato seedlings under two light levels and various temperatures. Comparison of other results using the same model parameters show the dynamic model could predict results for starch and starch-less plants, and when growth was affected by CO2 enrichment and day length.</jats:p>"

Supply chain needs to be responsive and agile to changing market conditions. The objective of the supply chain is to have the right products and services in the right quantities, at the right place, at the right moment, produced with minimal cost with the required quality level. To facilitate that, communication is considered one of the key levers to its success. While traditional communication approaches improved supply chain performance, in this dynamic environment there are still significant gaps and few opportunities to innovate the communication process within the whole supply chain. The purpose of this article is to explore how organizations can improve the performance of the communication process within the whole supply chain through the application of hybrid strategies and tools. The research methodology was qualitative exploratory in nature to confirm the relevance of the research question, and to explore through extensive literature review different strategies and tools to be applied to improve communication in supply chain.Supply chain managers can potentially benefit from this research, this study contributes to communication process in the supply chain by going beyond the benefits and problems of communication process that occur in day-to-day operational communications.

The model is intended to enable water resource management practitioners to assess the likely impact of potential interventions in particular catchment areas. It has been designed to be driven by seasonal catchment level forecasts of potential hydrological droughts based on innovative climate and groundwater models. The current version of the model is driven by reconstructed historical drought data for the Colne catchment in the east of England from 1995 to 2014. This provides a framework of five drought phases (Normal, Developing, Drought, Severe Drought and Recovering) which are mapped to policy driven interventions such as increased provision of water efficiency technologies and temporary water-use bans. The model uses UK Census 2011 data to develop a synthetic household population that matches the socio-demographics of the catchment and it microsimulates (at the household level) the consequences of water efficiency interventions retrospectively (1995–2014). Demand estimates for reconstructed drought histories demonstrate that the model is able to adequately estimate end-use water consumption. Also, the potential value of the model in supporting cost-benefit analysis of specific interventions is illustrated. We conclude by discussing future directions for the work.</jats:p>",

Therefore, there are currently no anti-hypoxia treatments in widespread clinical use.

One of the main concerns for utility managers is quickly locating and repairing a leak after detection, during regular network water balance. This paper presents a two-stage methodology for locating a leak that is based on the hydraulic model of the network, and, particularly, on the conservation equations that govern network behaviour. In the first stage, the sensitivity of each element (nodes and pipes) is obtained for a given demand increase in any node. In the second stage, that sensitivity is combined with additional real data provided by the (possibly) existing pressure sensors and flowmeters installed throughout the network. As a final result, the system of equations thus obtained produces the theoretical leak flow at each network node that matches the network conditions. A subsequent analysis of the leak flows obtained highlights the node or nodes in which the leak is occurring. The presented methodology is applied and assessed in a case study.</jats:p>",

A case study was selected, and AHU operational data from December 2015 to November 2016 was collected. A data-driven predictive model was generated through an evolving process that consisted of an initial model, an optimal model, and an adaptive model. In order to develop the optimal model, input variables, the number of neurons and hidden layers, and the period of the training data set were considered. Since AHU data changes over time, an adaptive model, which has the ability to actively cope with constantly changing data, was developed. This adaptive model determined the model with the lowest mean square error (MSE) of the 91 models, which had two hidden layers and sets up a 12-hour test set at every prediction. The adaptive model used recently collected data as training data and utilized the sliding window technique rather than the accumulative data method. Furthermore, additional testing was performed to validate the adaptive model using AHU data from another building. The final adaptive model predicts SAT to a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.6 °C.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates optimal pricing and product carbon footprint decisions of the supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under cap-and-trade regulation by applying optimization and game theory. By comparing the optimal results between the centralized and decentralized decision-making models, we find that the optimal product carbon footprint and selling price not only depend on the carbon trading price and carbon cap allocated by the government, but also relate to the initial carbon footprint of the product and the decision-making methods in the supply chain. It is found that there is also a “double marginalization” in the decentralized situation, thus we coordinate the supply chain using a two-part tariff contract. Specifically, only the manufacturer adjusts dynamically the wholesale price and fixed fee within the coordinating contract according to different initial carbon footprint and the range of the carbon cap reduction by the government. Finally, we obtain several interesting conclusions from the numerical examples and provide managerial insights and policy implications from the analytical results.</jats:p>"

Pressure management is becoming an important technique for reducing leakages in the water networks. This paper presents a pressure management technique for leakage reduction in north central WDS of Nagpur City, India, using variable speed pump and pressure reducing valves (PRVs). Variable speed pump is utilized for eliminating pressure deficiency during high demand and for reducing excess pressure causing leakage reduction during lower demand, by controlling the pump speed. PRVs have been used for further leakage reduction. This paper proposes a modified reference pressure algorithm for determining the location of valves in WDS. A multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to determine the optimized control value of pressure reducing valve with respect to change in demand pattern and to minimize the leakage rate in the WDS. Proposed pressure management technique leads to leakage reduction of 16.57% to 26.30% with respect to changes in demand pattern, causing daily average saving of 5.066 Ml. Minimum required pressure is maintained on every demand nodes to avoid pressure deficiency in WDS.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reducing carbon emissions, including emission abatement outsourcing at the supply-chain level, is becoming a significant but challenging problem in practice. Confronting this challenge, we therefore break down the practice to focus on a low-carbon supply chain consisting of one supplier, one manufacturer and one third-party emission-reducing contractor. The contractor offers a carbon reduction service to the manufacturer. In view of the increasing proportion of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and absence of carbon reduction policies in developing countries, we adopt the prospect of consumers’ low-carbon preferences to capture the demand sensitivity on carbon emission. By exploiting the Mean-Variance (MV) model, we develop a supply chain game model considering risk aversion. Comparing the supply chain performances of the cases under risk neutrality and risk aversion, we investigate the impact of the risk aversion of the supplier and the manufacturer on the low-carbon supply chain performances, respectively. We show that the risk aversion of chain members will not influence the relationship underlain by the profit-sharing contract between the manufacturer and contractor, whereas they may extend the supplier’s concerning range. Although the manufacturer’s risk aversion has a positive impact on the wholesale price, interestingly, the supplier’s impact on the wholesale price is negative. Furthermore, we propose a contract to coordinate the risk-averse low-carbon supply chain by tuning the aversion levels of the supplier and the manufacturer, respectively. Through numerical study, we draw on managerial insights for industrial practitioners to adopt a low carbon strategy potentially by managing the risk attitudes along the supply chain channel.</jats:p>"

Without water, it would be impossible to have many processes in the body such as digestion, regulation of body temperature, proper mobility of joints or intrabody transport of nutrients and metabolic products. Water supplied to the body comes mainly from two distribution channels, as bottled water or water from the water conduit.

This study evaluated the C- and N-DBP precursor removal capacity of two conventional ion exchange (IEX) resins and one magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) resin with a raw water at normal conditions and impacted by a heavy rain event. The rain event introduced 3 mg C/L total organic carbon (TOC) comprised mainly of low to medium molecular weight organics. All three resins were able to remove TOC and DBP precursors (&amp;gt;66%) but being less efficient in reducing turbidity (3–48%) and colour (9–24%). The resin with the smallest bead size was affected the most by the increased medium MW DOM loading resulting in DOM and C-DBP precursor removal performance losses of 10% and 22%. When applied as a pre-treatment for coagulation, MIEX was more efficient in DBP precursor control than coagulation in addressing the additional organic and DBP precursor loading after a heavy rain event.</jats:p>",

However, these achievements are generally used for a single reservoir and have rarely been applied to cascade reservoirs. Considering the requirements of flood control and water supply, this paper studied the extraction and application of energy storage operation chart (ESOC) for cascade reservoirs. Steps in the methodology mainly include: (1) model building of cascade reservoirs operation optimization (CROO), (2) extracting ESOC based on discriminant coefficient method (DCM) and CROO model, (3) simulation operation of ESOC based on DCM, (4) choosing the optimal ESOC and verifying its efficiency through the results. Cascade reservoirs in the Yangtze River of China were selected for a case study. Compared with the conventional operation method, the simulation results show that the ESOC presents better performance in terms of power generation, guaranteed output and assurance rate. In detail, the annual power generation of ESOC can be increased by 0.9%, the total guaranteed output can be increased by 3.4% and the assurance rate can be increased by 9.6%, which indicates that the proposed ESOC method can greatly improve the hydropower energy efficiency and reliability of cascade reservoirs’ power supply.</jats:p>",

As a farmed animal product, chicken meat is responsible for significant freshwater appropriation volumes during its production cycle. In this context, this research aims at exploring freshwater dynamics in the UK processed poultry industry. Specifically, we develop a System Dynamics model to capture the blue water footprint, as a key sustainability performance indicator of a poultry supply chain, in the case that relevant environmental and regulatory constraints are applied. The model contributes towards investigating the impact of two potential policy-making scenarios, namely, the “water penalty” and the “water tax”, on the nexus between profitability and water usage across the poultry supply chain. Responding to the regulatory constraints, the food processor either reconfigures the supply chain through rethinking desired inventory levels or implements a water management intervention. The results indicate that investing in water-friendly production technologies could offer a greater advantage to sustainable supply chains in terms of blue water efficiency and profitability, compared to employing inventory management strategies. Overall, our analysis highlights that effective policy-making and technology-driven interventions could provide potential towards ensuring economic growth and environmental sustainability of the UK poultry sector.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the AC was modified with phosphoric acid (ACP) and the surface structure of AC and ACP were analyzed. The results showed that the specific surface area of AC increased by 10.71% after the modification. The mesopore ratio and micropore ratio increased by 14.69% and 24.06%, respectively. The optimal conditions of AC electrode was a voltage of 1.4 V and flow rate of 20 mL/min while the ACP electrode was a voltage of 1.4 V and flow rate of 10 mL/min. The electrosorption capacity of ACP electrode was improved and the unit of electrosorption load was high to 19.28 mg/L. For the AC or ACP electrode, the nitrate removal efficiency decreases with the increase in the initial feed solutions, but the unit electrosorption load gradually increased with the improvement of initial feed solutions' concentration and the ACP electrode was superior to the AC electrode. Therefore, the ACP electrode would be suitable for the application of CDI on the nitrate removal.</jats:p>",

The global scope of this sector, along with the complex and uncertain health and environmental risks associated with textile production, create extensive challenges for companies striving for sustainability. This paper explores the possibilities for responsible management of high‐risk chemicals in textiles and focuses on a case study of a Swedish outdoor company.

While the subnational scale is growing in importance for policy planning, current energy assessments still only consider individual entities without taking into account resource flows. Ignoring flows of biomass cooking fuels in supply–demand assessments is a system boundary problem that can lead to misleading policy recommendations. In this paper, we tackle the boundary problem in subnational supply–demand assessments and provide a tool to support knowledge-based decision-making on the management of biomass cooking fuels in sub-Saharan Africa. Using Kitui County as a case study, we developed and tested an approach consisting of a supply model, local demand model, balance model, availability model, and adjusted balance model. The balance model only considers local fuel supplies and demand, whereas the adjusted balance model also considers external demand, which reduces the locally available supply of fuel. The results show that fuel demand and supply are spatially heterogeneous and vary between wood-based and non-woody fuels, and that the transport distance of fuels strongly affects local fuel availability and determines whether the supply–demand balance is positive or negative. We conclude that subnational energy policies should consider geographical distribution of supply and demand, aim to increase the fuel mix, consider external demand in supply–demand assessments, and differentiate between fuels for self-consumption and the market.</jats:p>"

The grain was heated on the laboratory equipment with quartz halogen linear infrared emitters. The irradiance on the working surface in the treatment zone was determined by calculation using a specially developed program. The ambient temperature was determined by a thermocouple thermometer placed in a ceramic tube. The grain temperature was estimated as average by weight by a thermocouple thermometer after its transfer into a thermally insulated container. The following dependencies have been obtained: 1 - Temperature dependence of the heating time for different heating modes and initial moisture content. 2 - Dependence of moisture content on the heating time under different conditions and initial moisture content. 3 - Dependence of moisture content on a temperature under different conditions and constant initial humidity. The models of the heat-moisture exchange and dehydration processes have been created, and the model parameters K0 and KT of the temperature dependence of some grains have been identified, as well as their dependence on moisture content and treatment modes has been evaluated. It has been established that this model describes adequately the process of dehydration to an extent limited by the upper temperature value of grain not much more than 100 ºÐ¡. Within not limited to the upper temperature value of grain not much more than 100 ºÐ¡. From the presented graphs and earlier obtained results for barley and millet, it can be assumed that the model describes adequately experimental data on the small-sized (3 - 5 mm) objects.</jats:p>"

The lack of reliable, real-time specific microbial and chemical contamination monitoring raises major public concerns as delayed detection accelerates the fast growth of the public health risk. In this context, the proposed research aims to develop, adapt and demonstrate the technical feasibility of smart Bio-Sensing and Information Management (Bio-SIM) that will effectively enable water operators to ensure smart water monitoring and quasi real-time quality control for early contamination detection and preemptive warning. Facing a lack of labeled data, numerical simulations with engineering models (EPANET-MSX) have been adopted to produce synthetic data for pattern recognition of the effect of bio-contamination on chemical and physical water parameters (e.g. pH, total organic carbon, turbidity and free chlorine). Statistical and stochastic models enabled non-specific bio-anomaly detection, based on pattern recognition of Chlorscan data and selected parameters that can be monitored simultaneously online using multi-parameter sensors (e.g. s::can). The results were compared with laboratory model tests and numerical simulations. This paper outlines the main results of the feasibility assessment of the Bio-SIM prototype system for early bio-contamination detection, which is expected to significantly contribute to alleviating consumers’ bio/chemical contamination risks.</jats:p>",

Using data from two retail supply chains, we illustrate our approach. To demonstrate the impact of consistency and recovery on supply chain performance, we model a retailer purchasing from competing suppliers with different levels of consistency and recovery. The model incorporates the retailer's uncertainty about demand and the retailer's uncertainty about its suppliers' service levels. We characterize how the retailer's orders and profitability change with a supplier's delivery performance through numerical experiments calibrated with field data. We find notable differences in market share across suppliers with similar traditional inventory service level metrics but differences in consistency and recovery. Further, we observe that a retailer can increase its profitability by determining orders via consistency and recovery in lieu of common metrics like in‐stock.

The qualitative data analysis pertains to fifteen such barriers, identified in the literature review and through our collaboration with other academic researchers and industrial specialists. Notably, the study’s qualitative data analysis, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), unconceals the mutual impact among the most prominent SSCM barriers.

This research conducts a series of experiments involving various approach-flow conditions and geometric parameters of an aerator. An improved solution of the cavity length for the bottom and lateral cavities is established. The proposed equation was validated through the data of experiments and predecessor formulas, and exhibited a higher precision than other methods. Both the transverse turbulence and the axial dynamic pressure are found to be related to the formation of a lateral cavity. The present method involving the lateral cavity length was developed based on dimensional analysis and experimental test. The geometric morphology of a lateral cavity exhibits a parabolic shape, which is similar to that of the bottom cavity.</jats:p>",

In the other, more innovative system, one part of the wastewater is used decentrally to extract the contained heat, substitute one part of the drinking water and, after being passed into a park-like constructed wetland, improve the microclimate and biodiversity. The assessment method employed is utility analysis using a set of 21 criteria and 33 indicators. The comparative assessment of both infrastructure alternatives shows the superiority of the innovative system for most criteria.</jats:p>",

The main  problem of fuel and energy complexes is the progressive aging of  fixed production assets in conditions of increasing energy  consumption requirements, which is a source of increased risk of  major accidents.

To consider the reliability of power supply systems in isolation from the operation of other systems (technological, relay protection, automation, ventilation, dewatering, etc.) means not to use the whole range of measures  aimed at improving the reliability of electricity supply, as a result it is impossible to ensure the optimum level of reliability of electricity  supply. Reliability of the power supply system must be evaluated taking into account the interaction of electrical equipment with the  equipment of all production systems.

Ten water samples were collected from the Karst river in Kaiyang, Southwest China. Thirty-five antibiotics, including nine sulfonamides, four tetracyclines, five macrolides, sixteen quinolones and chloramphenicol, were analyzed. The results suggest that antibiotics are widely prevalent in the Karst river, with macrolides and quinolones being the most dominant and occupying 47% and 43% of total antibiotic concentration, respectively. The maximum total concentrations of sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones were 30.4, 421, 884, and 1,807 ng/L, respectively. Lincomycin, roxithromycin, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin were detected in all samples with a detection frequency of 100%. The main sources of antibiotics were wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and rural dumps that did not contain sanitary treatment, which accounted for 33% and 40% of the total antibiotics present in the Karst river. Due to an increase in river flow quantity, the presence of WWTPs and rural dumps did not affect the concentration and distribution of antibiotics in the Karst river; however, the mass flux of antibiotics were significantly affected by the contamination source and the poor natural attenuation.</jats:p>",

Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from climate‐related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a substantial—and growing—body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward implementing adaptation strategies.

It is important to underline that a few multinational firms are responsible for a major share of world trade and for the rise of global supply chains. On the one hand, these firms should support regulatory harmonization across different Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) in order to lower trade costs. On the other hand, they might also resist harmonization—and encourage certain non-tariff measures—in order to prevent new competitors from entering markets. This may partly explain the persistence of regulatory divergence, and suggests that the political economy of regulatory convergence, especially in the conditions of the rise global supply chains, may be more important and more complex than is sometimes suggested. </jats:p>"

A model of the credit market is explored which disentangles demand and supply. A Bayesian estimation methodology with data augmentation for the latent variables is proposed. The analysis is carried out separately for each type of loan (short- and long-term business loans, consumer loans and mortgages) enabling the comparative study of the credit rationing and supply constraint effects across loan categories. The results indicate that, for all loan categories, excess demand characterized the boom period. After the intensification of the debt crisis, long-term business loans, consumer loans and mortgages were constrained from the supply side, however, demand for short-term business loans has slowed down more than supply, reflecting businesses’ need for stable funding. Finally, the structural effects of the crisis are investigated. The present paper aims to contribute to the strand of literature investigating the tools to analyse credit developments by formulating an enhanced and flexible version of a model which disentangles credit demand and supply and enables the monitoring of the evolution of financial imbalances.</jats:p>",

During the treatment of different aqueous salt solutions, the permeation flux and salt rejection of the membrane were investigated. The results show the permeation flux of the membrane is about 1.254 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1 and the salt rejection of the membrane reaches 28.66%, 39.24% and 43.52% for 0.01 mol·L−1 NaCl, Cu(NO3)2 and MgSO4, respectively. The mechanism of the salt rejection of the membrane has been explained in this work. All these results indicate the GO/Al2O3 membrane shows great potential in the desalination field.</jats:p>",

This article examines whether the US federal government’s New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) has affected the entry of retail food establishments, and in turn food shopping and purchasing patterns, in low-income communities. To identify the impacts of the programme, we take advantage of a discontinuity in NMTC funding generated by the formula used to determine the eligibility of census tracts for investment under the programme. We find that the NMTC Program has had modest, but positive impacts on supermarket entry in low-income communities. Based on household-level scanner data, there are no detectable effects on households’ food purchasing patterns in affected neighbourhoods, at least in the short run. </jats:p>",

It was found that the Mekong river delta experiences severe impacts from climate change with more than 75% of provinces affected by seawater intrusion, of which Kien Giang, Ca Mau and Ben Tre provinces are the most influenced with 70% affected areas. The salinity of river water was observed in the range of 15–30 g/L in 2015; meanwhile, the strongest tolerated rice species reached ceiling values of 3–4 g/L. Emerging challenges were identified due to the uncertain upstream hydrological regime coupled with high levels of tide, field evaporation and water withdrawal. The development strategies of affected provinces are given on the modification of rice tolerant capacity, and modification to aquaculture in areas with high salinity, in which water purification is in urgent demand. Desalination technologies have been proposed with various innovations which are still not practical on a large scale. The desalination of seawater and brackish water by reverse osmosis, nano-filtration, electro-dialysis, ion-exchange resins, electrochemical processes and thermal distillation has been applied to agriculture. The advance reverse osmosis shows most potential because of its advances in treating performance, cost effectiveness and effective rejection of brine.</jats:p>",

ILCA effectively controlled membrane fouling allowing the ceramic membranes to be operated at high flux (200 l/m2h) with low membrane fouling (0.9–1.9 kPa/day). A process comprising ILCA and direct ceramic microfiltration was shown to provide very stable treated water quality under a range of challenging conditions.

We apply methods of mathematical optimization aiming to find a network describing the optimal supply infrastructure. Hereby, we choose between different decentral and central approaches combining supply by motorized vehicles with supply by pipe systems. For the purposes of illustration, we apply the approach to two small slum clusters in Dhaka and Dar es Salaam. We show our optimization results, which represent the lowest cost water supply systems possible.

The specific aims of our analysis were to (1) project the number of pediatric anesthesiologists in the future workforce; (2) project pediatric anesthesiologist-to-pediatric population ratios (0–17 years); (3) project the mean number of inpatient pediatric procedures per pediatric anesthesiologist; and (4) evaluate the effect of alternative projections of individual variables on the model projections through 2035.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>METHODS:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The future number of pediatric anesthesiologists is determined by the current supply, additions to the workforce, and departures from the workforce. We previously compiled a database of US pediatric anesthesiologists in the base year of 2015. The historical linear growth rate for pediatric anesthesiology fellowship positions was determined using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books from 2002 to 2016. The future number of pediatric anesthesiologists in the workforce was projected given growth of pediatric anesthesiology fellowship positions at the historical linear growth rate, modeling that 75% of graduating fellows remain in the pediatric anesthesiology workforce, and anesthesiologists retire at the current mean retirement age of 64 years old. The baseline model projections were accompanied by age- and gender-adjusted anesthesiologist supply, and sensitivity analyses of potential variations in fellowship position growth, retirement, pediatric population, inpatient surgery, and market share to evaluate the effect of each model variable on the baseline model. The projected ratio of pediatric anesthesiologists to pediatric population was determined using the 2012 US Census pediatric population projections. The projected number of inpatient pediatric procedures per pediatric anesthesiologist was determined using the Kids’ Inpatient Database historical data to project the future number of inpatient procedures (including out of operating room procedures).</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>RESULTS:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>In 2015, there were 5.4 pediatric anesthesiologists per 100,000 pediatric population and a mean (±standard deviation [SD]) of 262 ±8 inpatient procedures per pediatric anesthesiologist. If historical trends continue, there will be an estimated 7.4 pediatric anesthesiologists per 100,000 pediatric population and a mean (±SD) 193 ±6 inpatient procedures per pediatric anesthesiologist in 2035. If pediatric anesthesiology fellowship positions plateau at 2015 levels, there will be an estimated 5.7 pediatric anesthesiologists per 100,000 pediatric population and a mean (±SD) 248 ±7 inpatient procedures per pediatric anesthesiologist in 2035.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>If historical trends continue, the growth in pediatric anesthesiologist supply may exceed the growth in both the pediatric population and inpatient procedures in the 20-year period from 2015 to 2035.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Significant variations can lead to supply chain disruption. What are the best contracts to be used in supply chains exposed to fluctuating raw material costs? We ask this question in two contexts—in the presence and the absence of working capital constraint. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on how to optimally contract in the presence of stochastic costs and working capital constraints and help managers understand how they can increase profitability. Methodology: We present a game-theoretic study of a bilateral monopoly supply chain with stochastic demand, stochastic input costs, production lead times, and working capital constraints. The upstream firm announces a supply contract to which the downstream firm responds with an order quantity. The contract is a single-price, multi-instrument contract with optional default penalties. Many previously studied coordinating contracts, as well as some noncoordinating ones, are special cases of our general contract. Results: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that the instruments of the general contract must satisfy for the contract to induce a coordinated outcome—both with and without working capital constraints. Then we translate these requirements into implementable contracts. Indexing (I) on raw material prices and using default penalties (Ps) is necessary, and an I&amp;P revenue-sharing contract turns out to be the most versatile contract for these environments. Managerial implications: We provide clear guidelines on how to contract in situations where production costs of every supply chain member fluctuate significantly, possibly in the presence of working capital constraints. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0660 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Interface of Finance, Operations, and Risk Management. </jats:p>",

The development of a sensitive and selective chromium detection method is an important issue. In this paper, cation recognition properties of two benzyl-functionalized benzimidazolylidene ligands towards metal ions were investigated by UV–vis spectrophotometry. The results showed that the receptors had a higher selection of Cr3+. The important analytical parameters, such as pH, quantity of the reagents, and their effects on the studied system were investigated. Under the optimum conditions the absorbance of the Cr3+-L complex obeys Beer's law in the Cr3+ concentration range of 0.05–2.60 μg/mL with the limit of detection of 0.026 and 0.034 μg/mL for L1 and L2, respectively. Infrared (IR) spectrum and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to explore the coordinating sites and the complex strength of two ligands towards Cr3+. The thermodynamic parameters showed that complex formation is a spontaneous exothermic process. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of Cr3+ content in water and alloy samples. The proposed method is seen as a simple and effective way of determining Cr3+ concentration.</jats:p>",

Early warning systems (EWS) are a potential solution. The EWS consist of multiple conventional sensors that provide the real-time measurements and algorithms that allow the recognizing of contamination events from normal operating conditions. In most cases, these algorithms have been established with artificial data, while data from real and biological contamination events are limited. The goal of the study was the event detection performance of the Mahalanobis distance method in combination with on-line DW quality monitoring sensors and manual measurements of grab samples for potential DW biological contamination scenarios. In this study three contamination scenarios were simulated in a pilot-scale DW distribution system: untreated river water, groundwater and wastewater intrusion, which represent realistic contamination scenarios and imply biological contamination. Temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), chlorine ion (Cl-), oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), pH sensors and turbidity measurements were used as on-line sensors and for manual measurements. Novel adenosine-triphosphate and flow cytometric measurements were used for biological water quality evaluation. The results showed contamination detection probability from 56% to 89%, where the best performance was obtained with manual measurements. The probability of false alarm was 5–6% both for on-line and manual measurements. The Mahalanobis distance method with DW quality sensors has a good potential to be applied in EWS. However, the sustainability of the on-line measurement system and/or the detection algorithm should be improved.</jats:p>",

Thus, Manning's roughness coefficient, in different directions on the slope, has different values. This causes different effects on the resistance to flow in the downstream direction of each grid cell, affecting the flow distribution among the grid cells of a distributed hydrological model. To show that the spatial variation of the overland vegetation had the effect of directional difference resistance to the overland flow, this study used an indoor fixed-bed test. We used a cylinder to simulate the stems of the vegetation used in the study. We modeled the relationship between Manning's roughness coefficient and flow depth and studied this relationship for three types of vegetation distributed at three different slopes of 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%. The slopes were based on three angles of 30°, 45°, and 90° between the vegetation rows and flow. The results showed that the resistance of overland flow had directional differences caused by the spatial variability of the vegetation distribution. At the same slope and flow depth, Manning's roughness coefficient decreased as the angle between flow and vegetation rows increased. At the same slope, the angle between flow and vegetation rows and Manning's roughness coefficient increased as flow depth increased. The slope did not affect the law of Manning's roughness coefficient with changes in the angle between flow and vegetation rows.</jats:p>",

Inadequate training courses were given in store related work. The majority of warehouses did not have practical guidelines and written procedures for dealing with storage procedure; also, there is inadequate safety and security system. About 37% of them kept controlled drugs in a separate storage space designated for this purpose. More than half of warehouses always quarantined medical supplies until the quality is checked. 60% of warehouses used first expire first out dispensing policy for medical supplies. 56% of the warehouses measure temperature, while not all warehouses measured humidity.Conclusion: Warehouses need to pay attention to the commodity management cycle and to ensure the availability of safety measurements.

Supplier is the source of chain, thus selecting excellent low-carbon supplier is the foundation of establishing efficient low-carbon supply chain. This paper presents a novel hybrid model for supplier selection integrated factor analysis (FA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), with analytic hierarchy process (AHP), namely FA-DEA-AHP. First, an evaluation index system is built, incorporating product level, qualification, cooperation ability, and environmental competitiveness. FA is utilized to extract common factors from the 18 pre-selected indicators. Then, DEA is applied to establish the pairwise comparison matrix and AHP is employed to rank these low-carbon suppliers comprehensively and calculate the validity of the decision-making units. Finally, an experiment study with seven cement suppliers in a large industrial enterprise is carried out in this paper. The results reveal that the proposed technique can not only select effective suppliers, but also realize a comprehensive ranking. This research has enriched the methodology of low-carbon supplier evaluation and selection, as well as owns theoretical value in exploring the coordinated development of low-carbon supply chain to some extent.</jats:p>"

We use administrative records of the <jats:italic>Oportunidades</jats:italic> programme in both rural and urban areas to follow the schooling trajectory of a cohort of students from sixth grade to high school. Under half of rural beneficiaries attending sixth grade make it to the tenth grade. Our regression analysis indicates that the absence of a junior high school in a locality increases the probability of dropping out after sixth grade by 6.8 percentage points; the absence of a high school increases the probability of dropping out after ninth grade by 12.2 percentage points. This means that 16% of all rural sixth‐grade students would enter tenth grade if they had junior high and high schools in their localities. Attending a low‐quality junior high school increases the probability of dropping out after ninth grade by 13 percentage points in rural areas and 7.6 percentage points in urban areas.</jats:p>",

We use supply chain analysis to evaluate how stakeholder actions and relationships influence the dynamics of complementary food markets in SSA. We argue that effective signalling of credence attributes via credible quality assurance can contribute to the sustainability of local complementary food supply chains and once established, may contribute to the long-term affordability, accessibility and availability of these foods in SSA. The article concludes by stressing that allocating resources for establishing or further implementing regional and/or state-level quality assurance mechanisms for food safety and quality requires the coordination of stakeholder actions to address food insecurity across SSA. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The level of uncertainty, unpredictability and complexity is magnified in a food supply chain as compared to the conventional supply chains such as automobile and FMCG. This is mainly because of the short product shelf life and the need of high variety. This necessitates the food industry to adopt various quick response systems to achieve effective supply chain management. The situation becomes even more critical when dealing with humanitarian relief operations where time window is very short (usually 24 hours). One of the solutions which are adopted in modern food supply chains is to locate cross-docking centre (CDC). Cross-docking is used to reduce the turnaround time of the food products. The practical situation is complex as it caters to multiple customers. The number of suppliers, in such cases, plays a significant role. Selection of a right CDC is, therefore, a crucial task. It is a strategic decision and needs to be taken by considering the relationships between each stakeholder present in the supply chain. In this article, we present an approach to select one (or few) CDC/s facilities among n CDCs. The method is based on the relationship between each actor (actors are the stakeholders in the supply chain). The relationship is in terms of the physical flow of materials or information flow or another kind of flows or relationships that connects them to form a network. These network characteristics are required to find out key stakeholders. The present article proposes the application of social network analysis (SNA) to analyse the characteristics of the network, thus helping supply chain managers to locate strategic CDCs considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to locate temporary warehouse site in the context of humanitarian relief operations. </jats:p>",

The results showed that antibiotics were more easily deposited on the surface of porous media with a diameter of 0.22 mm than 0.45 mm. As the pH increased from 6 to 8, adding colloidal HA increased the maximum breakthrough concentration from 0.94 to 1 for SM. Adding colloidal HA at different NaCl concentrations decreased the maximum C/C0 ratio from 0.97 to 0.92. However, adding colloidal HA changed the C/C0 ratio more when the divalent cation (Ca2+) was present. Overall, increasing the colloidal HA concentration clearly caused the effluent sulfamerazine concentration to increase.</jats:p>",

In many jurisdictions, this modelling assumption is a poor fit for actual fibre consumption, which is typically a subset of total fibre allocation. Failure of the model to anticipate this bias in industrial wood fibre consumption has been linked to increased risk of wood supply failure. In particular, we examine the distributed wood supply planning problem where the roles of forest owner and fibre consumer are played by independent agents. We use game theory to frame interactions between public forest land managers and industrial fibre consumers. We show that the distributed wood supply planning problem can be modelled more accurately using a bi-level formulation and present an extension of the classic wood supply optimisation model that explicitly anticipates industrial fibre consumption behaviour. We present a solution methodology that can solve a convex special case of the problem to global optimality and compare output and solution times of classic and bi-level model formulations using a computational experiment on a realistic dataset. Experimental results show that the bi-level formulation can mitigate risk of wood supply failure. </jats:p>",

Under the low-carbon environment, we also discuss the pricing strategies and the profits for the supply chain members using the Stackelberg game model in two cases. In the first (second) case where the initial proportion of consumers who prefer the online direct channel (traditional retail channel) is “larger”, the direct sale price of low-carbon products could be set higher than (equal to) the wholesale price. And it is shown that in both cases, tighter cap-and-trade regulation and higher low-carbon preference stimulate the manufacturer to cut carbon emissions in its production process. However, improving consumers’ low-carbon preference is more acceptable to the supply chain members. It always benefits the manufacturer and the retailer. In comparison, the firm’s profit increases with carbon price only when the clean production level is relatively high. Our findings can provide useful managerial insights for policy-makers and firms in the development of low-carbon sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Internet of Things (IoT), an emerging global network of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure, is transforming how we live and work by increasing the connectedness of people and things on a scale that was once unimaginable. In addition to facilitated information and service exchange between connected objects, enhanced computing power and analytic capabilities of individual objects, and increased interaction between objects and their environments, the IoT also raises new security and privacy challenges. Hardware trust across the IoT supply chain is the foundation of IoT security and privacy. Two major supply chain issues—disappearance/theft of authentic IoT devices and appearance of inauthentic ones—have to be addressed to secure the IoT supply chain and lay the foundation for further security and privacy-defensive measures. Comprehensive solutions that enable IoT device authentication and traceability across the entire supply chain (i.e., during distribution and after being provisioned) need to be established. Existing hardware, software, and network protection methods, however, do not address IoT supply chain issues. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose an RFID-enabled solution called ReSC that aims at defending the IoT supply chain. By incorporating three techniques—one-to-one mapping between RFID tag identity and control chip identity; unique tag trace, which records tag provenance and history information; and neighborhood attestation of IoT devices—ReSC is resistant to split attacks (i.e., separating tag from product, swapping tags), counterfeit injection, product theft throughout the entire supply chain, device recycling, and illegal network service access (e.g., Internet, cable TV, online games, remote firmware updates). Simulations, theoretical analysis, and experimental results based on a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSC. Finally, we evaluate the security of our proposed scheme against various attacks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using a dyadic panel data set that links U.S. suppliers with their major buyers, we study how trade credit responds to various types of competition in supply chains, as well as the impact of trade credit on firm performance. We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more trade credit, confirming that suppliers with weak market power use trade credit as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more trade credit, whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by differentiating competition in buyers’ markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have different impacts on trade credit. In studying the impact of trade credit on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average trade credit and an individual supply chain’s deviation from such an industry average. When suppliers offer trade credit at their industry-average level, this action facilitates trade and, thus, is positively associated with both parties’ performance; conversely, when suppliers are more aggressive in their trade credit strategy than the industry average, then the excess trade credit is negatively associated with buyer performance. One managerial message from our research is that buyers should be cautious about trade credit far exceeding the industry-average level. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0640 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Interface of Finance, Operations, and Risk Management. </jats:p>",

Fairphone represents such a case in the electronics industry, which is openly communicating its sustainability efforts and shortcomings. This communication is content-analyzed in this study by applying the theoretical lenses of paradox sustainability tensions and sustainable supply chain management. Findings of this analysis reveal the limitation of sustainability efforts by supply side characteristics, while Fairphone is innovatively using the demand side of its supply chain to drive sustainability. The resulting tensions among both sides are addressed via pro-active and direct supplier and stakeholder engagement by Fairphone at their suppliers’ mines and factories.

This paper studies an EV battery closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a battery manufacturer and a remanufacturer. The manufacturer produces new batteries by using natural resources, while the remanufacturer collects returned batteries and makes decisions based on the return quality, that is, to reuse or recycle.

Third, the manufacturer’s profit is normally higher than the remanufacturer’s. This suggests the need to design incentives to promote the remanufacturing sector.

The study involved collecting and analysing data from two sites in an operational water reticulation system in South Africa. Pressures and flow rates were monitored at a few strategic locations and at 44 individual homes during a series of controlled pressure adjustments. A total of 25 weeks' data, recorded at 15-minute intervals, were analysed. The two systems were subjected to 11 pressure adjustments, lasting 2 weeks each. Results showed a positive relationship between the average pressure change and median consumer demand, where reduced pressure led to reduced consumer demand. The linear model suggested a relationship of ΔQ ≈ 0.5ΔP between the change in average pressure and the change in median consumer demand, at a consumer connection. However, notable variation from one consumer to the next was apparent. Based on night flow analysis, the on-site leakage on consumer properties (downstream of the consumer meter) represented about 25% of the total metered demand of the study sample. The field tests also confirmed that there are practical limits to the level of pressure reduction that can be attained, beyond which the consumers become unsatisfied with the pressure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays, pricing and remanufacturing problems under uncertain markets have gained increasing attention from both industrial and academic fields. In the literature, it is generally assumed that all the channel members are risk-neutral, ignoring the influences of channel members’ risk attitudes in the face of dynamic market. This paper focuses on a pricing problem in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two competitive risk-sensitive retailers under uncertain environment. The uncertainty is associated with the recycling costs, consumer demands and remanufacturing costs. Due to the dynamic market, supply chain managers may be unable to collect enough historical data to estimate these demands and costs when making pricing and remanufacturing decisions. In such cases, experts’ estimations are usually employed to describe these uncertain parameters. To deal with these human estimations, an uncertainty theory-based model is proposed. Based on the equilibrium results, how the retailers’ risk sensitivity and human estimations (uncertain degrees) affect the prices and profits is analyzed. It is found that both the retailers will get lower profits while the manufacturer will gain more profit when either of the two retailers becomes more risk-averse. We also find that a higher level of uncertainty in the supply chain will induce a higher collecting rate. </jats:p>",

However, due to the photostability and high water solubility, chloroacetic acids (CAAs) decomposition using routine UV photolysis is very slow. The present study employed a high photon flux UV (3.13 × 104 μmol m−2 s−1) system to investigate its feasibility and suitability for enhancing CAAs (MCAA, DCAA and TCAA) decomposition. The results showed that increasing UV photon flux accelerated the photolysis remarkably. Under the condition of high UV photon flux 3.13 × 104 μmol m−2 s−1, almost complete degradation of 20 mg L−1 MCAA, 20 mg L−1 DCAA, and 20 mg L−1 TCAA in a mixed solution can be achieved within 50, 30 and 25 min, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, efficient photolytic degradation of CAAs in such short time has not been reported. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (kobs) steadily increases with the increasing of UV intensity, indicating that the utilization of light energy is efficient. In addition, the variation of pH from 3.2 to 9.0 showed minor effect on CAAs decomposition in this present studied system. The outcome of this study would be helpful for future employment of high photon flux UV systems for those photolytic resistant pollutants' decomposition.</jats:p>",

In order to promote affordable, equitable, and sustainable water supply, this paper proposed a method to set the piped water price inside Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) is currently under construction inside the valley to tide over the water deficit. Domestic water use and expenditure data were obtained from a household survey of 1500 households. Post-MWSP were developed based upon per capita water use and water price. Equity and affordability were evaluated by comparing the ratio of water expenditure to total expenditure of households (expenditure ratio: ER) in each service area. The expenditure for piped water service and alternate water sources was taken into account to calculate the total water expenditure. Sustainability was measured as the ratio of operation and maintenance cost to the total revenue of the utility (Working ratio: WR). The results show that an increase in water price by approximately 54% over the current price is necessary to meet operation and maintenance costs, assuming the WR to be 0.7. Approximately 30% increase in water use (a minimum of 80 LPCD) can be maintained post MWSP. However, water use of 135 LPCD increased the ER by more than 1%, which was the threshold of water affordability and may cause ground water stress.</jats:p>"

The data collected from these satellites (2003–2007) were then compared with precipitation gauge observations at six stations, namely, Tamar, Ramiyan, Bahlakeh-Dashli, Sadegorgan, Fazel-Abad, and Ghaffar-Haji. To compare these two groups, mean absolute error (MAE), bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation coefficient criteria were calculated on daily, monthly, and seasonal basis. Furthermore, probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) were calculated for these datasets. Results indicate that, on a monthly scale, the highest correlation between observed and satellite-gathered data calculated is 0.404 for TRMM-3B42 at Bahlakeh-Dashli station. At a seasonal scale, the highest correlation is calculated for winter data and using PERSIANN data, while for the other seasons, TRMM-3B42 data showed the best correlation with observed data. The high values of RMSE and MAE for winter data showed that the satellites provided poor estimations at this season. The best and the worst values of RMSE for studied satellites belonged to Sadegorgan and Ramiyan stations, respectively. Furthermore, the PERSIANN gains a better CSI and POD while TRMM-3B42V7 showed a better FAR.</jats:p>",

Responding to calls from the global community, companies are adopting a variety of voluntary practices to improve the environmental and/or social management of their suppliers’ activities. We develop a global survey of 449 publicly listed companies in the food, textile, and wood-products sectors with annual reports in English to provide insight into how the private sector contributes to advancing the SDGs via such sustainable-sourcing practices. We find that while 52% of companies use at least one sustainable-sourcing practice, these practices are limited in scope; 71% relates to only one or a few input materials and 60.5% apply to only first-tier suppliers. We also find that sustainable-sourcing practices typically address a small subset of the sustainability challenges laid out by the SDGs, primarily focusing on labor rights and compliance with national laws. Consistent with existing hypotheses, companies that face consumer and civil society pressure are associated with a significantly higher probability of adopting sustainable-sourcing practices. Our findings highlight the opportunities and limitations of corporate sustainable-sourcing practices in addressing the myriad sustainability challenges facing our world today.</jats:p>",

Based on a Finnish national logistics survey and financial reporting data from 266 LSPs, this article examines their competitive strategies and green supply chain management (GSCM), and tests their respective relationships with environmental and financial performance. Financial data are used to measure financial performance in a novel way. The findings indicate that leading LSPs with operational excellence and strong brands are more advanced in terms of GSCM than LSPs that do not excel in any competitive priority. GSCM practices are positively related to environmental performance, but not to financial performance. However, managers should not be discouraged by the apparent absence of short‐term financial benefits of GSCM practices, which in any case could enhance future differentiation opportunities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a power source redundancy-optimization approach for aircraft electrical brake electromechanical actuation system was proposed. The PWM plus phase-shift (PPS) control method was introduced in Dual active half bridge, which limited the amplitude of transform's leakage inductance current, thus expanding the fluctuation range of input voltage. Then, the voltage gain formula was deduced. By analyzing the leakage current under different phase shift in one period, the average power and root-mean-square (RMS) value of leakage current can be compared. Then, the optimum modulation range of phase shift can be obtained. By analyzing the soft-switching operation in this range, all switches can realize zero-voltage-switching (ZVS). To ensure the output voltage stability and voltage balance across the leakage inductance, a closed loop control method is designed. Finally, a prototype of 28V/270V-1kW was built to verify the theoretical analysis and calculation.</jats:p>",

To explore the effects of the big data technology, we build an analytical model to study the sustainable investment in a supply chain, consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, by using Bayesian information updating approach. We derive the optimal sustainable investment level for the manufacturer and the optimal order quantity for the retailer. Comparing the results with and without the big data technology, we find that whether the manufacturer should make more sustainable investment when the retailer adopts the big data technology depends on the service level at the retailer side. Interestingly, it is not always optimal for the retailer to adopt the big data technology. We identify the conditions under which the manufacturer and retailer are better off with the big data technology. In addition, we investigate the impact of the number of observations regarding the market information and find that the optimal decisions and profits increase in the number of the observations, if and only if the service level is low.</jats:p>"

We adopt the conditional value‐at‐risk (CVaR) criterion to model risk aversion of the manufacturer, and derive the optimal strategy for each member with a Stackelberg game in which the retailer acts as the leader. It is verified that the combined contract can coordinate the supply chain and achieve Pareto‐improvement. Moreover, the dominant retailer can allocate the system‐wide profit arbitrarily only by option price in the premise of coordination. It is worth mentioning that coordination of the supply chain is reachable only when the manufacturer is low in risk aversion, and the manufacturer's risk aversion is a significant element for contract design and profit allocation.</jats:p>",

The ideal model was calculated by using the analytical solution. Analysis of the production data indicated a clear boundary between the high- and low-permeability regions of the lenticular reservoir, and the boundary will supply gas to the low-permeability region. The reliability of this finding was validated by real production data. The development mode of the lenticular reservoir was obtained, that is the high-permeability area was first used during the initial production; when the pressure wave reached the boundary in the high-permeability region, the production showed a pseudo-steady state; further increase of the production pressure exceeding the threshold of the surrounding low-permeability region triggered the utilization of the low-porosity and low-permeability regions. The established model can provide useful guidance for the development of similar tight gas reservoirs. </jats:p>",

The calcium (Ca) concentration stayed unaltered and led to a Ca/P ratio above the recommended range of 1.3/1 to 2/1. The apparent digestibility (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">aD</jats:styled-content>) of phosphorus was reduced in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LP</jats:styled-content> Beagle; otherwise, the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">aD</jats:styled-content> of both minerals was not affected by the P concentration of the diet. The renal excretion of P was reduced to zero in both <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LP</jats:styled-content> groups while the renal calcium excretion increased significantly. Several of the puppies from both breeds showed impaired appetite, growth, skin and fur quality, and a few also clinically showed relevant signs of a disturbed musculoskeletal system after the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LP</jats:styled-content> feeding. A rapid loss of muscle strength and posture within hours led to severe deviation of the limb axis with hyperflexion of the joints but no radiological aberrations or signs of pain. Immediate transition of affected puppies to a balanced diet with sufficient phosphorus resulted in a complete recovery of the puppies in less than one month. The results demonstrate the importance of an adequate P supply on the healthy development of growing dogs.</jats:p>",

Both approaches require assumptions based on previous experience and anticipated trends. For each of the models, we assign plausible ranges for the key assumptions and then compare the resulting PV deployment over time. Each model was applied to 2 different future scenarios: one in which PV market penetration is ultimately constrained by the uncontrolled variability of solar power and one in which low‐cost energy storage or some equivalent measure largely alleviates this constraint. The supply‐focused and demand‐focused models are in substantial agreement, not just in the long term, where deployment is largely determined by the assumed market penetration constraints, but also in the interim years. For the future scenario without low‐cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the 2 models give an average plausible range of PV generation capacity in the USA of 150 to 530 GW<jats:sub>dc</jats:sub> in 2030 and 260 to 810 GW<jats:sub>dc</jats:sub> in 2040.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The permanent magnet brushless motors (PMBLM) are utilised extensively in many high‐performance applications where smoothness of output torque is necessary. When driven with conventional square‐wave current, the PMBLM is hard to make full use of inverter capacity because of short current supply time. Besides, it is hard to produce smooth output torque because the phase inductances slow down the desired step response of the phase current seriously. Although the sinusoidal‐wave current changes continuously, there exists a fixed‐frequency torque ripple for trapezoid back‐electromotive force motor. To solve the problems, two novel current supply methods, called as staircase waveform and parabola‐trapezoid waveform, are proposed in this study. With the same phase current magnitude as square waveform, the staircase waveform can output two times torque with low‐resolution position sensors. The parabola‐trapezoid supply method can further improve the smoothness of doubled output torque by unique parabolic rising and falling edge waveform design, while a high‐resolution position sensor is needed. Simulation and experimental tests of four different current supply methods are given to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method in inverter utility and torque ripple reduction.</jats:p>",

We use 12 years of modeled data from a coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model and an Eulerian‐Lagrangian approach to quantify nitrate supply to the GAB and the region between the GAB and the Subantarctic Australian Front (GAB‐SAFn), identify phytoplankton growth within the GAB, and ascertain the source of nitrate that fuels it. We find that nitrate concentrations have a decorrelation timescale of ∼60 days; since most of the water from surrounding oceans takes longer than 60 days to reach the GAB, 23% and 75% of nitrate used by phytoplankton to grow are sourced within the GAB and from the GAB‐SAFn, respectively. Thus, most of the nitrate is recycled locally. Although nitrate concentrations and fluxes into the GAB are greater below 100 m than above, 79% of the nitrate fueling phytoplankton growth is sourced from above 100 m. Our findings suggest that topographical uplift and stratification erosion are key mechanisms delivering nutrients from below the nutricline into the euphotic zone and triggering large phytoplankton growth. We find annual and semiannual periodicities in phytoplankton growth, peaking in the austral spring and autumn when the mixed layer deepens leading to a subsurface maximum of phytoplankton growth. This study highlights the importance of examining phytoplankton growth at depth and the utility of Lagrangian approaches.</jats:p>",

However, there is an absence of a generally accepted method to evaluate corporate sustainability performance (CSP), and the models and frameworks proposed by the literature present various important challenges to be addressed. A systematic literature review on the supply chain at the corporate level has been conducted, analyzing the main strengths and gaps in the sustainability assessment literature. Therefore, this paper aims to contribute to the development of this field by proposing an assessment framework a leading company can adopt to expand sustainability principles to the rest of the members of the supply chain. This proposal is based on best practices and integrates and shares efforts with key initiatives (for instance, the Organizational Environmental Footprint from the European Commission and United Nations Environment Programme and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry UNEP/SETAC); moreover, it overcomes important limitations of the current sustainability tools in a supply chain context consistent with the circular economy, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), planetary boundaries, and social foundation requirements. The results obtained create, on the one hand, new opportunities for academics; and, on the other hand, in further research, the use of this framework could be a means of actively engaging companies in their supply chains and of achieving the implementation of practical and comprehensive CSP assessment.</jats:p>"

The scheme of experience included control (without fertilizers) and 6 options with diff erent doses of mineral fertilizers and manure. Conclusions are drawn on increase in supply at increase in doses of fertilizers: radioactive elements – up to 8.92 times, toxic – up to 365 times, minerals – 149 times, sulfur – 6.7 times. It is proved that with the cultures of a crop rotation the carrying out of Cr increased by 40.8–84.7%, As – for 18.3–37.5%, Sr-90 – on 19.1–35.3, Cs-137 – on 18.5–37.5, B – on 19.3–28.0, Mo – on 12.6–31.2, S – by 4.10–38.5%. It is revealed that introduction of mineral fertilizers in combination with 25 t/ hectare of manure in fallow assisted formation of negative balance in a crop rotation of As, Cs-137 and Sr-90 and partly Hg and positive – sulfur and molybdenum, and against the background of 50 t/hectare of manure – positive balance of Cs-137, Sr-90, Hg, a pine forest, molybdenum, sulfur.</jats:p>",

This paper reports a new method for achieving a super anticorrosion function in Al-Si alloys through Mg nano-metallurgy, which was characterized by real-time synchrotron measurements. The unique function is based on the formation of an amorphous and self-charge-compensated MgAl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> phase between the grain boundaries to help prevent the penetration of oxygen species through the grain boundaries. Through this, the corrosion resistance of pristine aluminized steel could be improved almost 20 fold. An analysis of the phases, microstructures of the Mg-coated aluminized layer and corrosion products consistently supported the proposed mechanism. This charge-compensated corrosion resistance mechanism provides novel insight into corrosion resistance.</jats:p>"

Using CT perfusion, we studied 67 consecutive patients who had a small subcortical infarct at a follow-up MRI study to investigate the correlation between the perfusion pattern and the clinical and radiological course. On CT perfusion map analysis, 51 patients (76%) had focal hypoperfusion, 4 patients (6%) had hyperperfusion and the remaining 12 patients (18%) showed no abnormalities. On dynamic sequential imaging analysis obtained from the source perfusion images, 32 patients (48%) had a sustained hypoperfusion pattern, 11 patients (16%) had a reperfusion pattern, and 18 patients (27%) had a delayed compensation pattern. Systolic blood pressure was higher in patients with sustained hypoperfusion although the perfusion pattern was independent of the final volume of infarction. These results reinforce the notion that mechanisms other than hypoperfusion are at play in patients with small subcortical infarcts including the intervention of compensatory sources of blood flow. The ultimate clinical significance of these perfusion patterns remains to be determined in larger series of patients assessed longitudinally. </jats:p>",

The current study utilized branded food composition databases from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and the US to determine the percentage of processed food and beverage products for which there are nutrition data containing NNS and to compare total sugar density (g per 100 mL for beverages and g per 100 g for foods) between products with and without NNS. Ordinary least squares regression at the country-product level was performed to examine associations between presence of NNS and total sugar. Across all countries, 5% of products contained at least one NNS, with the highest prevalence among beverages (22%). Mexico had the highest percentage of products with NNS (11%), as compared to the United States (US) (4%), New Zealand (1%), and Australia (&lt;1%). The presence of NNS was associated with lower mean total sugar density among beverages (range across countries: 7.5 to 8.7 g per 100 mL) and among foods (23.2 to 25.5 g per 100 g). Products with both added sugar ingredients and NNS had a lower overall mean total sugar density when compared to products containing only added sugar ingredients. Due to paucity of data on sales and market shares across these countries, our results do not reflect the extent to which consumers purchase NNS containing products. Continued monitoring of NNS in the food supply, extension of work from these data, and inclusion of market shares of products will be important as more countries introduce policies to reduce sugar.</jats:p>"

We used the corrosion casting (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CC</jats:styled-content>) technique to isolate blood vessels from 30 nude mouse brains.

We identified three different topographical regions: (i) the cortical region, characterized by a superficial wide sheet of vessels giving rise to terminal perforant vessels that penetrate the grey matter; (ii) the inner part of the grey matter, in which dense capillary nets form many flake‐like structures extending towards the grey–white matter boundary, where perforant vessels finally change direction and form a well‐defined vascular sheet; and (iii) the white matter layer, characterized by a more disorganized vascular architecture.

The latter is especially highlighted in the materials criticality discourse. Critical raw materials (CRMs), being exposed to supply disruptions, create an uncertain operational environment for many industries, particularly for green energy technologies that employ multiple CRMs. However, recycling rates of CRMs are very low and engagement of companies in CLSC for CRM is limited. This study examines factors influencing CLSC for CRM development in photovoltaic panels and wind turbine technologies. The aim is to analyze how the factors manifest themselves in different companies along the supply chain and to identify enabling and bottleneck conditions for implementation of CLSC for CRM. The novelty of the study is twofold: the focus on material rather than product flows, and examination of factors from a multiactor perspective. The evidence obtained suggests that the manufacturing companies and reverse supply‐chain operators engaged in the study take different perspectives (product vs. material) regarding development of CLSC for CRM and thus emphasize different factors. The findings underline the need for interactions between supply‐chain actors, a sound competitive environment for recycling processes, and investment in technologies and infrastructure development if CLSC for CRM is to be developed. The paper provides implications for practitioners and policy makers for implementation of CLSC for CRM, and suggests prospects for further research.</jats:p>",

The population in this study consists of 86 firms representing the center of the hijab fashion industry in BALTOS, Bandung. The data was obtained through observation and in-depth interviews with selected micro and small enterprises in the Islamic fashion industry, as well as the distribution of questionnaires from the hijab fashion industry in BALTOS.\n\nFindings - The results of this study raise concerns relating to SC Risk and the SCRM among micro and small enterprises in the Islamic fashion industry in BALTOS. The findings demonstrate that most Muslims consider that certain market conditions involve high levels of risks, which act as a threat to their businesses.\n\nNovelty - The global and dynamic evolution of the global market has contributed to increased levels of intense competition in various markets. The analysis of Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) strategies, to minimize the frequency of Supply Chain (SC) risk, is therefore important.\n\nType of Paper: Empirical.\n\nKeywords: Supply Chain Risk Management; Supply Chain Risk; Supply Management; Islamic Fashion Industry; Micro-Small Enterprises.\n\nJEL Classification: M30, M39.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The volumes, rates and grain size distributions of sediment supplied from hillslopes represent the initial input of sediment delivered from upland areas and propagated through sediment routing systems. Moreover, hillslope sediment supply has a significant impact on landscape response time to tectonic and climatic perturbations. However, there are very few detailed field studies characterizing hillslope sediment supply as a function of lithology and delivery process. Here, we present new empirical data from tectonically‐active areas in southern Italy that quantifies how lithology and rock strength control the landslide fluxes and grain size distributions supplied from hillslopes. Landslides are the major source of hillslope sediment supply in this area, and our inventory of ~2800 landslides reveals that landslide sediment flux is dominated by small, shallow landslides. We find that lithology and rock strength modulate the abundance of steep slopes and landslides, and the distribution of landslide sizes. Outcrop‐scale rock strength also controls the grain sizes supplied by bedrock weathering, and influences the degree of coarsening of landslide supply with respect to weathering supply. Finally, we show that hillslope sediment supply largely determines the grain sizes of fluvial export, from catchments and that catchments with greater long‐term landslide rates deliver coarser material. Therefore, our results demonstrate a dual control of lithology on hillslope sediment supply, by modulating both the sediment fluxes from landslides and the grain sizes supplied by hillslopes to the fluvial system.

Although this technique is faster and technically less demanding than the previously used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing, reproducibility remains a concern. In the period from 2004 to 2015, 8,532 isolates were subjected to VNTR typing in The Netherlands, with 186 (2.2%) of these exhibiting double alleles at one locus. Double alleles were most common in loci 4052 and 2163b. The variables significantly associated with double alleles were urban living (odds ratio [OR], 1.503; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.084 to 2.084;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            = 0.014) and pulmonary TB (OR, 1.703; 95% CI, 1.216 to 2.386;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            = 0.002). Single-colony cultures of double-allele strains were produced and revealed single-allele profiles; a maximum of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was observed between the single- and double-allele isolates from the same patient when whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied. This indicates the presence of two bacterial populations with slightly different VNTR profiles in the parental population, related to genetic drift. This observation is confirmed by the fact that secondary cases from TB source cases with double-allele isolates sometimes display only one of the two alleles present in the source case. Double alleles occur at a frequency of 2.2% in VNTR patterns in The Netherlands. They are caused by biological variation rather than by technical aberrations and can be transmitted either as single- or double-allele variants.\n          </jats:p>",

From the physical perspective, this paper examines the impact of climate change on sea ice and marine weather and considers the resultant consequences for Arctic shipping accessibility. From an economic perspective, it reviews the major research investigating the economic feasibility of diverting ships from conventional shipping routes to Arctic routes, the attitudes of shipping stakeholders, and other major factors affecting the prospect of Arctic shipping. This review also identifies important research gaps. Ultimately, we find that the complex environmental and economic dynamics of the Arctic suggest that an appropriate understanding of Arctic shipping will require close collaboration between natural and social scientists.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Assessing Impacts of Climate Change &gt; Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

This paper reports that such high oxygen supply is not an essential requirement for a representative amorphous oxide semiconductor, amorphous In‐Ga‐Zn‐O (a‐IGZO). That is, the optimum oxygen flow rate ratio (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub>) is ≈3% for standard (STD) sputtering with the base pressure of ≈10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> Pa, while it is reduced dramatically to 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup>% for ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) sputtering with the base pressure of ≈10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup> Pa.

This comparison also suggests that the inclusion of impurity hydrogen widens the optical bandgap by ≈0.1 eV, which causes a bandgap minimum by post annealing at ≈500 °C for the STD a‐IGZO films accompanying the removal of incorporated hydrogen as H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. Furthermore, crystallization onset temperature is reduced remarkably by ≈100 K for the UHV a‐IGZO films.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research parameterizes an inventory-based business-as-usual wood supply scenario, with a focus on southwest Germany and the period 2002–2012 with a stratified prediction. First, the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm groups the inventory plots into strata with corresponding harvest probabilities. Second, Random Forest algorithms generate individual harvest probabilities for the plots of each stratum. Third, the plots with the highest individual probabilities are selected as harvested until the harvest probability of the stratum is fulfilled. Fourth, the harvested volume of these plots is predicted with a linear regression model trained on harvested plots only. To illustrate the pros and cons of this method, it is compared to a direct harvested volume prediction with linear regression, and a combination of logistic regression and linear regression. Direct harvested volume regression predicts comparable volume figures, but generates these volumes in a way that differs from business-as-usual. The logistic model achieves higher overall classification accuracies, but results in underestimations or overestimations of harvest shares for several subsets of the data. The stratified prediction method balances this shortcoming, and can be of general use for forest growth and timber supply projections from large-scale forest inventories.</jats:p>"

These programs have evolved over several decades, expanding from relatively simple two‐party transactions to multiobjective deals that simultaneously benefit the environment and multiple water‐using sectors. Such programs now represent an important water management tool and provide an impetus for collaboration among stakeholders; yet, most evaluations of their effectiveness focus exclusively on environmental outcomes, without adequate attention to impacts on other water users or local economies. To understand how these programs affect stakeholders, a systematic, multiobjective evaluation framework is needed. To meet this need, we developed a suite of environmental and socioeconomic indicators that can guide the design and track the implementation of water transaction portfolios, and we applied them to existing EWTPs in Oregon and Nevada. Application of the indicators quantifies impacts and helps practitioners design water transaction portfolios that avoid unintended consequences and generate mutually beneficial outcomes among environmental, agricultural, and municipal interests.</jats:p>",
