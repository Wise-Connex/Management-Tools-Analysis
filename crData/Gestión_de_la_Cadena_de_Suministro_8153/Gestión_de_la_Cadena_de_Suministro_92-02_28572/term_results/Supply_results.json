A model of the existing system was analysed at current and increased demands to identify weaknesses in the system. The model was altered by the addition of pumping mains, two storage reservoirs at new locations, and the strengthening of distribution mains to provide a solution to meet the client's requirements.</jats:p><jats:p>The location and size of the proposed reservoirs were optimized with respect to the construction costs of the reservoirs, pumping and distribution pipelines, and pump running costs.</jats:p><jats:p>Areas were zoned to provide better strategic storage, whilst also reducing retention times, thus eliminating the problems of low chlorine residuals.</jats:p>",

The prolonged steep treatment accelerated emergence and increased establishment (3% on average) in the field, compared with the brief steep. Advanced seed consistently gave the quickest emergence, produced as many plants as the prolonged steep, and was less affected by depth of sowing so its introduction should improve the establishment phase of the sugar‐beet crop.</jats:p>",

The model develops important linkages between farm program instruments and commodity market equilibrium and allows evaluation of supply response decisions under conditions of major policy shifts. The econometric procedure developed here is applied to the U.S. rice sector to determine program compliance/noncompliance decisions under three alternative rice program periods. A change in farm prices was found to affect significantly producers' net returns and participation rate. Results indicate price impacts on acreage planted are inelastic for program participants but elastic for nonparticipants.</jats:p>",

Possible mechanisms were examined by measuring skeletal muscle glycogen synthase activity and muscle glycogen content before and during hyperinsulinaemia while fasting plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels were maintained.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Fasting plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels were maintained in seven healthy male subjects by infusion of 20% (w/v) Intralipid (1 ml/min) for 120 min before and during a 240 min hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (100 m-units h−1 kg−1) combined with indirect calorimetry. On the control day, 0.154 mol/l NaCl was infused. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was performed before and at the end of the insulin infusion.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>3. On the Intralipid study day serum triacylglycerol (2.24 ± 0.20 versus 0.67 ± 0.10 mmol/l), plasma non-esterified fatty acid (395 ± 13 versus 51 ± 1 μmol/l), blood glycerol (152 ± 2 versus 11 ± 1 μmol/l) and blood 3-hydroxybutyrate clamp levels [mean (95% confidence interval)] [81 (64–104) versus 4 (3–5) μmol/l] were all significantly higher (all P &amp;lt; 0.001) than on the control study day. Lipid oxidation rates were also elevated (1.07 ± 0.07 versus 0.27 ± 0.08 mg min−1 kg−1, P &amp;lt; 0.001). During the clamp with Intralipid infusion, insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal decreased by 28% (from 8.53 ± 0.77 to 6.17 ± 0.71 mg min−1 kg−1, P &amp;lt; 0.005). This was the result of a 48% decrease in glucose oxidation (3.77 ± 0.32 to 1.95 ± 0.21 mg min−1 kg−1, P&amp;lt;0.001), with no significant change in nonoxidative glucose disposal (4.76 ± 0.49 to 4.22 ± 0.57 mg min−1 kg−1, not significant).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>4. Basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activities (13.1 ± 1.9 versus 11.4 ± 2.3% and 30.8 ± 2.3 versus 27.6 ± 4.5%, respectively) were unaffected by the increased plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels. Similarly, basal (36.1 ± 2.7 versus 37.2 ± 1.4 μmol/g) and stimulated (40.0 ± 0.6 versus 37.6 ± 4.4 μmol/g) muscle glycogen levels were unaltered. Insulin-stimulated hexokinase activity was also not affected (0.52 ± 0.08 versus 0.60 ± 0.08 units/g wet weight).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>5. Maintenance of plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels at fasting values resulted in an increase in lipid oxidation and was associated with a decrease in insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose uptake and glucose oxidation rates, but no change in non-oxidative glucose disposal. Increased plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels did not appear to have a direct inhibitory effect on glycogen synthase activity or storage of glucose as glycogen at these insulin levels.</jats:p>",

The programming stage is an intermediate one between planning and designing water supply facilities, and can be decomposed into two problems: (a) setting up a priority order of water users, taking into account socio‐economic criteria; and (b) choosing the best technical variant of the WSS. Among the criteria considered for the latter problem, there is a criterion of distance between the socio‐economic priorities of users and the precedence orders of users according to the technical programming, which plays a coordinating role between problems (a) and (b). All steps of the presented methodology are illustrated by a real case study.</jats:p>",

In some systems, the inhibition of growth of an intracellular parasite by rIFN-gamma has been related to nutritional constraints induced in the host cells by the lymphokine. Such an explanation might apply to H. capsulatum because the fungus is a functional methionine-cysteine (Met-Cys) auxotroph at 37 degrees C; its sulfite reductase is repressed at that temperature. For this reason, we set about to examine whether or not the antihistoplasma state induced in rMuIFN-gamma is due to a restriction in the availability of Met-Cys. Omission of Met-Cys from the medium in which macrophages were cultivated prevented H. capsulatum from growing within them. Addition of Met or Cys to the macrophage cultures did not antagonize the inhibitory effect induced in the cells by rMuIFN-gamma. Thus, there was no evidence from our work that rMuIFN-gamma evokes the antihistoplasma effect in mouse peritoneal macrophages by limiting the supply of Met-Cys to the fungus.</jats:p>",
