The question could best be resolved, he suggested, if redress and supply were thought of ‘as twins, asJacob and Esau’ which ‘should go hand in hand, for though grievances go first, yet the blessing may be upon subsidies’. The biblical analogy was quite clear. Although grievances like Esau had precedence as the elder of the twins, the two should in fact ‘go hand in hand’ through the House; at the closing, the order would be reversed and the subsidy would first receive the blessing just as the younger of Isaac's twins eventually did.</jats:p>",

Such techniques combine sample information with nonsample information and produce estimates with smaller variances than those based only on sample data. Conventional econometric estimation was compared with a quadratic programming technique with regression coefficients constrained to their a priori correct signs. A goal programming technique that minimized the sum of the absolute deviations was rejected because of its substantially different results and lack of information on the statistical properties of its estimates. The quadratic programming technique had the advantages of statistical efficiency, objectivity, and speed. The conventional estimation technique excluded fewer variables from the system and thus was less susceptible to omission of variables bias. Elasticity estimates for most key variables were similar. Quadratic programming versus conventional estimates of demand elasticity were, respectively, −0.95 and −0.88 for Douglas-fir clears, −2.83 and −2.91 for Douglas-fir commons, and −2.13 and −2.27 for all Douglas-fir; whereas supply elasticities for hemlock–fir commons were 1.35 and 1.37, and for all hemlock–fir, −1.76 and −1.42. </jats:p>",

It is shown that because of a combination of public ownership and the use of historical cost accounts, the real return on capital tends to fall with the onset of rapid inflation such as occurred in the mid 1970s In NSW in particular the rapid growth in demand for electricity in the 1970s due to falling real electricity prices and considerable increases in other energy prices has given rise to a major investment program and rapidly developing excess capacity. Higher real electricity prices in the 1980s, combined with the economic slump of 1982, resulted in low or negative growth rates in demand Much of the boom I bust mentality evident in all three States may have been avoided or ameliorated had the electrical supply authorities been required to earn even a very modest real rate of return of (say) 4 or more per cent p.a. which is considerably below the (pre‐tax) return earned in the corporate sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pod retention and pod filling of V. faba was studied under different patterns of water supply. Mild water shortage during flowering, followed by plenty of water after flowering (d-i), resulted in high seed yields at lower stem nodes (defined as the first podding node to node number 11) in cv. Alfred. The inverse treatment (i-d: plenty of water during flowering, followed by increasing water shortage after flowering), but also i-i (plenty of water during and after flowering), showed 20-60% lower seed yields at those nodes. This effect was mainly due to a lower number of pods per node. In i-i, but not in i-d, the low pod retention at lower nodes was compensated for at higher nodes (defined as from node 12 to the last podding node). These results helped to explain the mechanism of the interaction between water supply pattern and the development of reproductive sinks. The quantitative consequences of these effects on the relation between total water use and seed yield are discussed. Without taking into account different water supply patterns, a linear relation between total water use (represented by total DM production) and seed yield already explained 75-85% of the variation in seed yield. If different water supply patterns were included in the regression analysis, &gt;90% of the variation in seed yield could be explained. The i-i patterns, compared with d-i, resulted in suboptimum DM partitioning to reproductive organs, but showed a smaller seed yield variability. This indicated that defining and maintaining the optimum level of (mild) water shortage under varying climatological conditions needed further attention.

A positive correlation between the value of a country's currency and its nominal interest rate need not indicate real interest rate movements.

The copper sulfate test and the microhematocrit usually are performed on blood samples taken from the same finger (or earlobe) puncture. We studied 201 male and female volunteer blood donors who failed the copper sulfate test to determine if more donors would be accepted for donation if blood from a second fingerpuncture, Instead of the original fingerstick, was used for the microhematocrit determination. Venous blood samples were obtained to evaluate complete blood count and measures of iron status. The results indicated that the deferral rate was reduced by 46% using a fresh fingerpuncture for the microhematocrit determination. The iron status of the additional donors accepted on the basis of the second puncture was not significantly different from that of the donors accepted by the original fingerstick. We conclude that using a second fresh fingerpuncture for the microhematocrit determination after failing the copper sulfate test decreases the number of hematocrit deferrals and does not compromise the iron status of the additional donors.</jats:p>",

The anatomical basis for the blood supply to the skin of the posterior calf has been examined by dissection and selective arterial injection of cadavers. The results showed that the skin used to construct the posterior flap for below-knee amputation derives its blood supply from both axial vessels, running with the peripheral nerves, and perforating vessels arising through the gastrocnemius muscle. There is no contribution by blood vessels that pass through the soleus muscle. When a posterior flap for below-knee amputation is constructed the soleus muscle should be completely excised.</jats:p>",

Hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flows were measured while hepatic oxygen delivery was progressively decreased without venous congestion in the preportal area. With decreases in hepatic blood and oxygen supply, oxygen extraction gradually increased from 50 to 90% in the normothermic group and from 25 to 70 and 84% in the hypothermic (30. and 34 degrees C, respectively) groups. The values of critical hepatic oxygen delivery were between 7.3 and 11.9 ml O2.min-1.100 g-1 without significant differences among the groups. During reperfusion after ischemic insult, hepatic oxygen uptake returned to base-line values in both hypothermic groups but remained substantially below base-line values in normothermic groups of animals. Hepatic enzyme concentrations (lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alcohol dehydrogenase) were substantially increased (up to 30-fold) in normothermic animals, but the concentrations did not increase in either of the hypothermic groups. These results demonstrated that hypothermia per se does not affect hepatic oxygen delivery but decreases hepatic oxygen demand and uptake, provides an effective protection from hepatic oxygen deprivation, and lessens reperfusion injury. </jats:p>",
