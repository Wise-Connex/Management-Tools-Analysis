      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyses the general equilibrium and disequilibrium effects of fiscal policy when fiscal instruments have direct impacts on both aggregate supply and demand. A model is specified which incorporates the direct impacts of expenditure and tax instruments on the behavioural function for individuals and firms and which explicitly recognises the role of public production and supply. In contrast to simple Keynesian and neoclassical models, this model involves direct supply‐side crowding out and budget composition effects that operate on both aggregate demand and supply. It also reveals the relative efficiency of various “balanced instruments” under Keynesian and neoclassical conditions.</jats:p>",

The Iranian cutbacks in 1979 resulted in price increases of 120 percent in 1 year and gasoline lines across the country. Creation and use of ample public and private stocks could moderate price increases after another interruption and prevent disruption of supplies. Use of the marketplace to allocate shortages, coupled with rebates to cushion blows to the economy and hardship to individuals, would be eminently more efficient than government allocation programs. International cooperation, through coordination of stock buildup and withdrawal, could mitigate the damage from oil disruptions among all the Western nations.</jats:p>",

The large growth of supply has been in temperate areas of North and South America, where increases will continue but at much slower rates than in the past. Production will increase in tropical and subtropical areas and soybeans will truly become a worldwide commercial crop. The rate of increase in supply will depend largely on the magnitude and effectiveness of research, education and developmental programs designed to exploit the full potential of the soybean to upgrade diets and alleviate the growing world malnutrition problem.</jats:p>",

Five systems were selected for investigation throughout their distribution systems. Contrary to the expected result of increasing levels throughout the system, these findings indicated that the concentrations of chloroform were often highest at the treatment plant.
