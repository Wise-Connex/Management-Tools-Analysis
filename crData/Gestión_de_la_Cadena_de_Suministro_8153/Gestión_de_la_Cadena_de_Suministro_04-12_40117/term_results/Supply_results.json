      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the discussion of fees for water supply services, companies are increasingly searching for effective measures to improve their economic management. Benchmarking is a management tool to identify room for improvement in undertakings. Focussing the processes in a water supply service can show measures to enhance the company's activities. A pilot project at the University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich was started in 2001 to test the method of Process-Benchmarking with two German water supply services. Therefore a system methodology was designed for water supply services with drinking water dams. Afterwards the systematic was successfully tested by implementing the companies' data. The administration of these undertakings was especially focussed in this project because it is a very large part of a company in respect to the employees and the amount of the expenses and its work has effects on all other parts. Room for improvements could be found for both water supply services and measures were designed to be implemented. The analysis of the administration in the described project was beneficial to raise the companies' efficiency. It showed that this method can be useful and is important for any other field of activity, too.</jats:p>",

Figures quantifying the demand for these services are examined at the outset by means of a short survey that was circulated to ten HE institutions. The impact of electronic journals on ILL and DS services is scrutinised and proven to be a significant factor. The bibliographic searching behaviour of university researchers is investigated by means of a short questionnaire, and the results of the survey are evaluated. The recent rise in the number of postgraduate students in UK universities is confirmed. The topics of library budgets and the impact of end‐user services are also examined. The article concludes that it is the increase in the number of electronic journal subscriptions that has had the most significant impact on the recent decrease in demand for ILL and DS services in UK academic libraries.</jats:p>",

The paper describes the major players in the chain and where and how value flows commercially between the major protagonists in the network. The paper shows that although the Premiership football clubs have received an enormous increase in revenue over the last ten years this has not been translated into higher (or in some cases any profits). This is because the club's ability to leverage their customers is not capable of being used against their key suppliers – the players. It is the players (or at least those perceived to be the most talented and saleable) who have been appropriating the major share of value in this supply chain network.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current paper reports the investigation of two transient-based techniques for leak detection in water pipe systems using physical data collected in the laboratory and in quasi-field conditions. The first is the analysis of the leak reflected wave during a transient event and the second is inverse transient analysis (ITA). This was approached through the development of an inverse transient analysis tool and the collection of transient data for the testing and validation of this model. Two experimental programmes were carried out at Imperial College and in cooperation with Thames Water for the validation and testing of these techniques. Evaluation of the presence, location and size of leaks was carried out using the collected data. Transient-based techniques have been shown to be successful in the detection and location of leaks and leak location uncertainties depended on the leak size and location, flow regime and location where the transient event was generated. These leak detection methods are very promising for identifying the general area of the trunk main with leakage, and can be combined with other leak location techniques (e.g. acoustic equipment) to more precisely pinpoint the leak position. Transient-based techniques are particularly important for the diagnosis, monitoring and control of existing water supply systems, not only to detect leaks, but also to better understand the causes of pipe bursts and accidents, particularly when these are due to natural transient events.</jats:p>",

The parameters influencing the performance of the water treatment process will be incorporated in an overall model evaluating the goal factors quality (good, constant and reliable), quantity, costs, environmental impact (low residuals level), redundancy and flexibility. For several individual processes at AWS models have already been developed during the last few years, like models for the ozone process, biological activated carbon filtration and pellet softening. For the final calibration and validation pilot reactors are automated and on-line data are collected. Criteria for evaluation are developed to realise an optimal control of the individual processes in interaction with the goal factors of the total treatment process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider stock positioning in a pure assembly system controlled using installation base-stock policies. When component suppliers have random capacity and end-product demand is uncertain, we characterize the system's inventory dynamics. We show that components and the end product play convex complementary roles in providing customer service. We propose a decomposition approach that uses an internal service level to independently determine near-optimal stock levels for each component. Compared with the optimal, the average error of the decomposition approach is 0.66% across the tested instances. Compared with current practice, this approach has the potential to reduce the safety-stock cost by as much as 30%. Our computational analysis on two-echelon systems also illustrates several managerial insights: We observe that the cost reduction from improving supply performance is high when demand variability or the number of components or target customer service is high, or when the end product is more expensive relative to components. On average, (i) reducing the lead time of the more expensive component yielded higher benefit than reducing the lead time for the less expensive component, and (ii) the benefit of improving one of the supply parameters (service level or lead time) was higher when the value of the other parameter was already more favorable (lower lead time or higher service level, respectively). Finally, we analytically show how a multi-echelon pure assembly system may be converted into an equivalent two-echelon assembly system to which all our results apply. </jats:p>",

Yet, very little research has examined managerial activities that might influence the performance of these logistics outsourcing relationships. Over the past several years, the management approach that views relationships as key assets of the organization has gained increased prominence in the priorities and practices of many companies (Gruen, Summers and Acito 2000). The current study utilizes this relationship marketing perspective as the basis for evaluating the perceived performance of third‐party logistics arrangements. In particular, the current study examines the influence of six key relationship marketing dimensions on a customer's perceptions of their 3PL provider's performance. In so doing, the article builds on research (e.g., Goldsby and Stank 2000) that focuses on potential linkages between logistical performance metrics and managerial activities. The results suggest linkages between relationship marketing activities and the perceived performance of the 3PL arrangement.</jats:p>",

A mail survey of members of the Institute for Supply Management™ was conducted and the data were analyzed using moderated regression. The results suggest that company size, buyer experience, relationship duration and relationship importance affect the association between a buyer's search effort and the communication elements. Interestingly, the buying context affects the relationship between search effort and the communication elements in different ways and to a different extent in each stage of the relationship development process.</jats:p>",

At the same time, TCE research has been criticized for focusing solely on firm‐level economic determinants of decision outcomes without considering other factors that may impact decision making in organizations. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of variables associated with TCE and compensation systems on the outcomes of make‐or‐buy decisions to compare the predictive ability of these variables in the current business environment. Findings indicate that functional group reward systems are associated with the outcomes of make‐or‐buy decisions. Surprisingly, no support is found for the association between the TCE variables and decision outcomes.</jats:p>",

The biofilters were exposed to a synthetic feedwater with influent TOC concentrations ranging from 1.6–4.5 mg L‒1 and a composition of 65% humic acid, 15% formate, 10% acetate and 10% formaldehyde on a carbon mass basis. TOC removals improved from 19 ± 13% (n = 15) to 49 ± 10% (n = 20) in one biofilter and from −11 ± 25% (15) to 51 ± 7% (n = 20) in another biofilter. These increases were found to be statistically significant at the 5% level. The increase in removal was due to an increase in removal of both the readily biodegradable carbons and humics in the biofilters. The humic removal increased from 10 to 36% in biofilter #1 and from 0 to 35% in biofilter #2. At the end of the experiments, formate removals were between 91–94%, acetate removals ranged from 83–87%, and formaldehyde was completely removed in the biofilters. SUVA was not found to be a good indicator of humic removal in the biofilters.</jats:p>",

Consequently they often leak as much water as they deliver and provide an unacceptable quality of service to the customer. In certain parts of the world, water is available only for a few hours of the day. The solution is to build a mathematical model to simulate the operation of the real network in all of its key elements and apply it to optimise its operation. To be of value, the results of the model must be compared with field data. This process is known as calibration and is an essential element in the construction of an accurate model. This paper outlines the optimum approach to building and calibrating a mathematical model and how it can be applied to automatic calibration systems.</jats:p>",

The results show that flocs changed seasonally with different growth rates, size, response to shear and settling rate. Autumn and summer flocs were shown to be larger and less resistant to floc breakage when compared to the other seasons, suggesting reduced floc strength. Floc strength was observed to increase with smaller median floc size. The results of the settling tests indicated that the autumnal flocs were of a more open structure which helped to explain why they settled faster. In summary, the autumnal flocs had significantly different floc characteristics although it was difficult to relate the floc structure with the incoming water characteristics.</jats:p>",

The harmonic nutrient supply of quality products that are required by market demands can be produced by the optimal combination of a compound system of requirements. These requirements are partly preparatory (soil investigations, yield measurements, preparation of digital field maps) and are partly based on the knowledge of the most significant characteristics of the applied nutrients. Most artificial fertilizers are applied by spinning disc fertilizer spreaders all over the world, therefore, it is advisable to use them in Hungary as well. Importantly, these machines should be well adjustable, capable of the exact measurement and control of the spread quantity, as well as of even spreading.

These were analyzed for DOC, TOC and DBP precursors in an effort to characterize the changes in precursor levels and natural organic matter (NOM) character in this watershed. Based on these data, it was proposed that freshly leached NOM is relatively poor in DBP precursors due to the abundance of non-reactive carbohydrates. As these compounds undergo biodegradation within the watershed, the measured specific DBP precursor level rises, because the more reactive materials (e.g. lignins, phenolics) are also more persistent.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes distributed supply chain scheduling in the agent architecture instead of centralised supply chain scheduling. The companies communicate through their agents that share only the information relevant to the supply chain scheduling. This scheduling relies on distributed parallel forward simulation in which simple messages are exchanged between the agents periodically. According to these messages, each agent simulates the production orders of its company and receives and sends messages about the purchase and sale orders. This synchronises the simulation of the agent with the simulations of the other agents. Distributed simulation reduces the competitor's opportunities to manipulate the company's performance through the schedules of its suppliers and customers. Although distributed simulation does not optimise the schedules, it is capable of finding feasible schedules.</jats:p>",

Suppliers of immediacy stand ready to trade at the prices they post, and demanders of immediacy place market orders and require immediate execution at posted prices. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), immediacy is supplied by specialists, who post bid and/or ask quotes for their own accounts, by securities firms that place quotes for their own accounts, and by public traders, who place limit orders. The bid–ask spread is often used as a measure of the cost of immediacy to investors, but it is rare that the supplier of immediacy earns the entire spread. A supplier of immediacy earns the difference between the bid (ask) at which he buys (sells) and the subsequent price at which he sells (buys). Because prices tend to move against suppliers of immediacy, revenues on a round-trip trade are less than the spread. Consequently, revenues of suppliers of immediacy are typically less than the spread.</jats:p>",

A policy-specific but demand-independent upper bound for the order variance amplification factor of any decentralized policy is shown to exist, and its formula is presented. The bound is always tight for the suppliers at the end of a long chain so that a policy exhibits the “bullwhip effect” if and only if its bound is greater than 1. </jats:p><jats:p> A simple necessary condition for bullwhip avoidance is also identified in terms of a policy's “gain.” Gain is the marginal change in average inventory induced by a policy when there is a small but sustained change in the demand rate. It is shown that all policies with positive gain produce the bullwhip effect if they do not use future order commitments. Because manufacturers can reduce costs by operating with positive gain, this explains the prevalence of the bullwhip effect. </jats:p><jats:p> A family of commitment-based policies that can dynamically maintain any desired inventory level for any demand rate (e.g., achieve positive gain) without the bullwhip effect is also presented.

Because fouling strongly depends on the feed water quality, especially the ionic composition, chemical cleaning solutions should be chosen to target the solution chemistry that is most responsible for the formation of a compact, high resistance fouling layer. In this study, the effect of solution chemistry on natural organic matter (NOM) fouling of two NF membranes with different surface properties was investigated. Compared to monovalent cations, divalent cations were found to greatly enhance NOM fouling by complexation. Moreover, calcium ions caused a much greater fouling rate than magnesium ions, presumably due to the intermolecular bridging formed among NOM molecules through the calcium ions. Various chemical cleaning solutions were evaluated for water flux recovery efficiency. Although both deionized water and dilute NaOH solution were found effective in cleaning membranes fouled in the absence of calcium ions, efficient chemical cleaning in presence of calcium was achieved only when the calcium ion bridging was eliminated. The cleaning efficiency was shown to be highly dependent on solution pH and the concentration of the chemical cleaning agent.</jats:p>",

Iron removal is usually relatively easy by oxidizing dissolved iron into an undissolved form either by aeration or chemical oxidization and removing the formed precipitate by sand filtration, for example. If the raw water contains high amounts of organic matter, problems may arise when using the traditional methods for iron removal. In Finland it is quite common that groundwater contains both high levels of iron and humus. The groundwater of Kukkala intake plant in Liminka has been found problematic due to the high level of organic matter and therefore this research studied the removal of iron from this water by means of oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and filtration. Iron was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and when the dosage reached 3 mg l−1, all iron was in trivalent form, which means that nearly all of it was in undissolved form, i.e. in fractions greater than 0.45 μm. Oxidized iron particles were, however, very fine and they could not be removed by sand/anthracite filtration. However sand/anthracite filtration was able to remove iron well without the feed of oxidation chemicals, and the iron was then led to the filter in bivalent dissolved form, thus the filter operated as an adsorption filter.</jats:p>",

Under optimum reaction conditions all three remove over 80% dissolved organic carbon and 0% UV254 absorbance. In addition the enhanced removal of natural organic matter leads to a corresponding reduction in the formation of disinfection by-products following chlorination of the treated water. Advanced oxidation processes give enhanced removal of organic species ranging from low to high molecular weight while coagulation/flocculation is inefficient at removing low molecular weight species. One additional benefit is all three processes produce less residuals compared to conventional coagulation, which is advantageous as the disposal of such residuals normally contributes a large proportion of the costs at water treatment works.</jats:p>",

The experiments were carried out with a flat channel cross flow unit and with a pilot unit equipped with two parallel spiral wound modules. NOM rejection was characterized using 13CMAS-NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and size exclusion chromatography with online DOC detection (LC-OCD). Additionally measurements, such as DOC, UVA (254nm and 436nm), AOX- and THM-precursors, ion concentration, turbidity, etc. were made on raw waters, permeates and concentrates. The results indicate that NOM removal by nanofiltration for all water sources is almost complete (&amp;gt;90%), while NOM removal by ultrafiltration depends on raw water chemistry, especially ionic strength. Solid state 13C-NMR spectra of freeze-dried NOM deposits on membrane surfaces suggest the presence of structural polysaccharides (such as chitin and cellulose). SEM images confirm the NMR-results: after filtration, inorganic deposits and algae like structures were found on membrane surfaces.</jats:p>",

One granular activated carbon (GAC) F400 and two activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were considered. Anoxic (absence of molecular oxygen) and oxic (presence of molecular oxygen) conditions were evaluated. For the single solute system, the three adsorbents studied have shown higher adsorptive capacities under oxic conditions as compared to anoxic conditions. The degree of adsorption enhancement was related to the pore size of the adsorbent. For binary adsorption on ACC-10, which has the least average pore size (1.76 nm), the oxic and anoxic adsorption isotherms overlapped, indicating no impact of the presence of molecular oxygen on the adsorptive capacity. Significant differences on adsorptive capacities were noticed for the binary solute adsorption on ACC-15 (2.10 nm) and F400 (2.48 nm). The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) predicted well all binary systems for ACC-10 and anoxic isotherms on ACC-15 and F400. Poor model predictions for GAC and ACC-15 under oxic conditions were attributed to the oligomerization of the adsorbates on the surface of activated carbon. The unique pore size of ACFs has been shown to be a limiting factor in hampering the oligomerization under oxic conditions.</jats:p>",

The plant has been operating since 2001. In conjunction with this has been an extensive laboratory investigation into the factors impacting on the effectiveness of the process for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal and water quality improvement, particularly for MIEX® treatment combined with coagulation. Both plant monitoring and laboratory studies indicate that changes in the character of the NOM and water quality have had a significant impact on DOC removal by the MIEX® resin. MIEX® and coagulation have been very effective in combination and consistently reduced turbidity to &amp;lt;0.5 NTU from an average of 60 NTU. The target is now to achieve higher DOC removal rates.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The utilization of membrane processes for drinking water treatment has become more popular. However, fouling by source water probably is the major factor prohibits its widespread application. In this research, the fouling phenomena of a microfiltration (MF) membrane were studied. The interactions among colloidal particles, calcium ion, and dissolved organics, such as salicylic acid, humic acid, and alginic acid, on MF fouling were focused. A lab-scale single hollow fiber MF membrane, made of polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF), module was used. The results show that, for single organic compound, the extent of fouling caused by humic acid was higher that of alginic acid. For the latter, the permeate flux decrease at lower pH was more significant than those at higher pH. For low MW salicylic acid, both rejection and flux decrease were minor. It seems that solubility have strong correlation with fouling rate. The higher the solubility is, the lower the fouling rate. For sole colloidal particle system, latex beads with diameter close to the pore size of MF membrane showed severe fouling. Adding Ca can aggregate the latex beads, and alleviate fouling. However, calcium ion also found to increase fouling of alginic acid on membrane under neutral or alkali pH condition, probably via charge neutralization and/or bridging. In conclusion, MF fouling seems to be strongly related to the type of organics, size of colloidal particles, and the existence of divalent ions, in the feed water.</jats:p>",

Because ground water treatment is simple, usually consisting of aeration/stripping and sand-filtration, it is of significant interest to know the ability of the conventional treatment to remove the chemical contaminants. The removal of gasoline compounds was investigated in a two-stage pilot scale sand filter, each with a filter depth of 0.8–1 m and with a filtration rate of 7.6 m/h. The concentrations of aromatic compounds were in the range 7–15 μg/L, which are realistically low concentrations. The experiments demonstrated a surprisingly high removal efficiency of the filter system. Most of the hydrocarbons were removed already in the primary filter (3 mm sand grains) and the concentrations were in the range 0.05–0.1 μg/L at the outlet from the secondary filter (1 mm sand grains). Influent iron concentrations in the range 0–4 mg/L and backwashing did not adversely affect the biodegradation of hydrocarbons. This study has shown that a conventional biological active sand filter can act as an efficient barrier against gasoline compounds, thereby saving the consumer capital costs and operational costs from installation of supplementary treatment.</jats:p>",

Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives global objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The mediator agent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those objectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to negotiator agent at the tier level (NAT). This architecture allows supply chains management which is completely transparent seen from simple enterprise of the supply chain. The use of multi‐agent system allows physical distribution of the decisional system. Moreover, the hierarchical organizational structure with a decentralized control guarantees, at the same time, the autonomy of each entity and the whole flexibility.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rural areas in Morocco are characterized by specific particulars dispersal, remoteness and importance. Considering this particular context, it is necessary to adjust the analysis and treatment methods, the monitoring and sanitary inspection systems. Within this framework, a new methodology was developed with the purpose of supervising and monitoring drinking water quality in rural areas. This methodology consists basically in applying common norms for rural localities bordering existing adductions, and in the adoption of a simplified approach for non-accessible rural localities supplied by autonomous drinking water systems. The simplified approach relies essentially on sanitary inspection data and on the control of parameters that constitute a sanitary risk in the short term (bacteriological parameters). The control of residual chlorine content is so important, for it ensures a high bacteriological quality of water and can offer the opportunity for a quick reaction of the manager. These two approaches are based mainly on resource protection, water disinfection and population awareness about the good use and preservation of water quality. Indeed, in order to ensure the continuity of rural autonomous drinking water systems in terms of quantity and quality of distributed water, various management models were developed: management by means of water user associations, and by a private operator. For these different modes of management, the methodology to adopt for supervising and monitoring drinking water quality in rural areas together with the attribution of tasks and responsibilities was already established. The right of citizens to sustainable and safe water is a stimulating challenge which requires the collaboration and involvement of all acting agents in the sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seasonal periods of high rainfall have been shown to cause elevated natural organic matter (NOM) loadings at treatment works. These high levels lead to difficulties in removing sufficient NOM to meet trihalomethane (THM) standards, and hence better alternative treatments are required. Here three options for the removal of NOM either by optimising current coagulation and pre- or post-coagulation have been studied. NOM can be isolated into fractions distinguished by their hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics. Previous studies have shown that certain fractions are more recalcitrant to treatment during the times of high loadings. By optimising coagulation for these fractions a staged coagulation is proposed, the results of which found that although no significant dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) was observed filter run times were significantly increased. Secondly a novel magnetic ion exchange process (MIEX®) developed specifically for the removal of NOM was trialled and the results of a combination of ferric coagulation and MIEX® showed that although the final DOC of the water was not significantly reduced the THM formation potential (THMFP) was reduced by more than 50% for the lower molecular weight (MW) compounds that are known to be untreated by conventional coagulation. Finally the addition of a range of adsorbents including carbons, hydroxides and clays to both the raw water and the isolated low MW fraction showed that an increase in DOC and UV254 removal was achievable. The findings of the three trials showed that at the difficult to treat times of the year, optimised removal for the low MW fractions could prove to be vital if legislation is changed.</jats:p>",

The mass balance over a network or parts of the network may be used to analyse the different sources and accumulation processes; this article focuses on the contribution of the “mass in” from the pumping station as particles. Three analysis methods have been developed within the joint research program of the Dutch water companies (BTO-program): the continuous monitoring of turbidity, the Mass Settling Potential Method and the Resuspension Potential Method. The continuous monitoring of turbidity and particle counting enable an analysis of the relative contribution of sources for particles, e.g. corrosion of cast iron. The Mass Settling Potential and Resuspension Potential methods add insight into actual sediment load and actual discolouration risk. Further development of these methods will enhance knowledge of the origin and fate of particles in a network, enabling the formulation of effective measures against discolouration and associated water quality problems.</jats:p>",

The conditions of UV and VUV pre-treatment required to achieve maximum biological removal were determined. Positive correlations were observed between the production of smaller molecular weight molecules as shown by HPSEC and the decrease in dissolved organic carbon with increasing radiation dose. Similarly, the reduction of UV absorbance at 254 nm was found to correlate well with the observed increase in biodegradability of the UV-treated samples. UV pre-treatment resulted in the accumulation of biodegradable compounds from the breakdown of chromophoric material, although significant concentrations of refractory DOC remained even after the largest dose (140 J.cm−2). VUV pretreatment resulted in a rapid rate of mineralisation and fast formation of biodegradable compounds. VUV doses larger than 96 J.cm−2 were observed to reduce the apparent effectiveness of biological treatment. After the experimentally determined optimal VUV dose, approximately 80% of remaining DOC was biodegradable demonstrating that greater total DOC removal was achieved utilising VUV irradiation followed by biological treatment. The smaller doses of radiation required and greater bioavailability make VUV more effective than UV pre-treatment.</jats:p>",

A major issue affecting SA Water's ability to manage water quality effectively has been the difficulty accessing water quality information which has been stored in separate, generally inaccessible databases with poor reporting and decision support capability. To improve SA Water's ability to make timely and effective decisions regarding water quality, an integrated business system has been developed which provides water managers with direct access to comprehensive water quality information. The system includes improved field data collection units which incorporate a barcode system; sample point images and workflow support tools; an integrated water quality data warehouse with automated standard and ad hoc reporting capabilities; a geographical information system containing comprehensive coverages of natural resources and system infrastructure information; and water incident exception reporting and incident management support through a corporate incident management system. Major benefits of the system will include improved management of public health risk through quicker and more accurate reporting of incidents; improved customer confidence in SA Water; improved knowledge capture and visibility of water quality information; increased efficiency of capital utilisation and better understanding of system performance through spatial representation of data and trending of results. WaterScope can also be used and shared by data partners and regulators, making optimal use of the State's limited water quality data sets. It can also be made available commercially to other water management organisations. Future challenges include the integration of wastewater and recycled water data, linking of continuous (on-line) water quality data and links to water demand management systems.</jats:p>",

The effect of various parameters such as carbon and nitrogen content, pH, ionic strength, NOM concentration and addition of Mn2+ on the colour removal process was investigated. The rapid decolorisation was related to fungal growth and biosorption rather than biodegradation as neither carbon nor nitrogen limitation, nor Mn2+ addition, triggered the decolorisation process. Low pH (pH 3) and increased ionic strength (up to 50 g L‒1 added NaCl) led to greater specific removal (NOM/unit biomass), probably due to increased electrostatic bonding between the humic material and the biomass. Adsorption of NOM with viable and inactivated (autoclaved or by sodium azide) fungal pellets occurred within 24 hours and the colour removal depended on the viability, method of inactivation and pH. Colour removal by viable pellets was higher under the same conditions, and this, combined with desorption data, confirmed that fungal metabolic activity was important in the decolorisation process. Overall, removals of up to 40–50% NOM from solution were obtained. Of this, removal by adsorption was estimated as 60–70%, half of which was physicochemical, the other half metabolically-dependent biosorption and bioaccumulation. The remainder was considered to be removed by biodegradation, although some of this may be ascribed to bioaccumulation and metabolically-dependent biosorption.</jats:p>",

The impact of such a change on the drinking water quality was almost unknown. A research project was carried out at several drinking water reservoirs and water works concerning the change in the NOM quality and the nutrient situation. The results indicate that the NOM increase in the reservoir is predominately caused by an increasing input of high and intermediate molecular weight humic substances from the catchment area into the reservoir. The fractions of the polysaccharides and the high molecular weight humic substances are significantly reduced in the treatment process. In contrast, the elimination rate for the substances with an intermediate and low molecular weight was low. Due to the low elimination rate particularly of the intermediate humic fraction, the NOM content of the treated water increased with the change in the raw water. Furthermore, the BDOC of the treated water increased with the NOM content. For the AOC of the treated water no relationship was found with the NOM content. However, the change of this parameter was affected by the snowmelt and the circulation in the reservoir.</jats:p>",

This drinking water is generally distributed without a disinfectant residual. The Dutch consumers appreciate this concept and have a high confidence in the quality of tap water. The new research programme aims at providing the scientific foundation for future decisions on quality goals and the advantages and limitations of modern water treatment technology, such as membrane filtration and UV/AOP. The goals are to achieve a robust and reliable drinking water infrastructure that will guarantee an impeccable water quality at the tap at all times, also in the future when new threats may emerge. The programme includes studies on water quality goals and total system approach, and experimental research into water treatment, biological stability and (the prevention of) quality deterioration in the distribution network. Important focal points in the research will be the prevention of microbiological problems (including Legionella) in the network and in building installations, the prevention of problems with organic micropollutants such as NDMA, EDCs and pharmaceuticals and the advantages of reducing particles and sediment in the distribution network. The programme will be coordinated by Kiwa Water Research and will be carried out with the water supply companies and in cooperation with universities and other research institutes including the partners of the Global Water Research Coalition.</jats:p>",

Results showed that the most significant flux decline was due to the organic colloid fraction, a hydrophilic fraction consisting mostly of bacterial cell wall residues. This research demonstrated that these colloids which incorporate 2/3 of dissolved organic structures (&amp;lt;0.45 μm) and 1/3 of particulate organics exert strong fouling properties due to both rejection phenomena and the adsorption mechanism. The fouling contribution by humic-like materials depends on their origin and nature. Aromaticity appears to be a secondary parameter which influences membrane fouling. Polysaccharides, proteins and amino sugars also largely present in humic-like structures (supramolecular structure) play an important role in UF membrane fouling. The perspective of NOM as a biopolymer mixture can contribute to an understanding of membrane fouling.</jats:p>",

In this study, standard jar tests and a pilot study were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of ferrate pre-oxidation in enhancing the coagulation of NOM-rich lake water. A substantial reduction of residual turbidity after sedimentation and filtration was obtained by ferrate pre-oxidation at low dosage (1–5 mg L‒1 as K2FeO4). It was suggested that in order to maintain an acceptable residual turbidity, ferrate pre-oxidation can substantially reduce the dosage of coagulant. The improvement of water quality, as indicated by the reduction of color, DOC, iron, manganese, total bacteria, was observed to be similar in nature to the enhancement of residual turbidity. Formation of additional coagulant (Fe (III)) after decomposition was believed to be an important role of ferrate in enhancing coagulation. Ferrate could be employed in drinking water treatment by simple addition of ferrate solution just before coagulation.</jats:p>",

The effective particle sizes and MWt distributions of the NOM, with and without ions, were analyzed by light scattering and HPSEC, respectively. The effective size of the NOM was significantly reduced by increasing the Na+ concentration. This was robably due to coil-to-globule conversion and polyelectrolyte interaction, changing the NOM conformation from linear to spherical. However, increasing the concentration of Ca2+ showed competing effects. At relatively low concentrations of Ca2+, the size of the NOM was reduced, presumably by the mechanism attributed to Na+. As the concentration of Ca2+ was further increased the NOM size increased, due to aggregation or chelation between humic acid in the NOM and Ca2+ becoming the dominant factor. Ion interactions with NOM also had a significant impact on removal by ultrafiltration. With addition of Na+, the Singapore NOM retention decreased from 52% to 29%.

However, which of these practices have the most influence on supply chain performance? This exploratory study investigates the relationship between supply‐chain management planning practices and supply chain performance based on the four decision areas provided in SCOR Model Version 4.0 (PLAN, SOURCE, MAKE, DELIVER) and nine key supply‐chain management planning practices derived from supply‐chain management experts and practitioners. The results show that planning processes are important in all SCOR supply chain planning decision areas. Collaboration was found to be most important in the Plan, Source and Make planning decision areas, while teaming was most important in supporting the Plan and Source planning decision areas. Process measures, process credibility, process integration, and information technology were found to be most critical in supporting the Deliver planning decision area. Using these results, the study discusses the implications of the findings and suggests several avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

These compounds are low molecular weight volatile tertiary alcohols whose presence in treated water even at low ng L‒1 levels can result in consumer complaints. Adsorption onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) is often used to remove these compounds during the treatment process. PAC is very efficient at removing these compounds but the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) reduces the efficiency of the PAC. For effective application of PAC the impact of NOM must be taken into account when determining the required dose. In this study the adsorption of MIB and geosmin from several waters was related to water quality parameters of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm and colour to determine if these could be used to predict adsorption. Results obtained showed that the water quality parameters of DOC and UV absorbance at 254 nm could be useful indicators for MIB and geosmin adsorption, although the relationship appears to be specific to the water source in question.</jats:p>",

Results show that NOM fraction make-up changes throughout the year, with the fulvic acid fraction (FAF) showing the greatest increase during the autumn and winter period. The charge density of the FAF fraction also increases. The coagulation conditions for traditional coagulants, such as iron, are more affected by increased levels of organics than the novel coagulant also investigated, and the zeta potential range for optimum removal is narrower.

These conversions apparently result in cross-linking of NOM moieties to form stable species of greater molecular size, thus rendering them more readily removable by ultrafiltration.

Single-solute isotherms tend to confirm the decisive role of the adsorbent's microporosity in the adsorption capacity of the AC. These adsorption capacities are high and range between 63 and 509 mg/g. The adsorption of the three pesticides is also studied in a dynamic reactor. The influence of operating conditions (initial concentration Co, flow velocity Uo) and adsorbent's characteristics is investigated. All dynamic experimental results are modelled by a neural network to establish the link between the characteristics of activated carbon materials and the adsorption's results. Parameters related to the adsorbate–adsorbent affinity in a batch reactor are consequently introduced in the input layer of the neural network added to operating conditions whose influence was shown (Co and Uo) and time t.

The IOP coating layer formed on the membrane surface played a major role in preventing membrane fouling by residual NOM in water. Pre-mixing of IOP with raw water followed by continuous injection into the MF system controlled membrane fouling better than pre- and intermittent loadings of IOP. This could be in close association with the distribution of IOPs across the hollow fiber MF surfaces and the effectiveness of contact of IOP with feedwater. The turbidity of water influenced the MF system with intermittent IOP loads more greatly than that with IOP in suspension.

Chlorination also caused significant changes in the intensity of NOM fluorescence and the position of the emission band. To quantify the latter, the wavelength that corresponds to the position of the emission band at its half-intensity (λ0.5) was employed. Chlorination caused the λ0.5 values to decrease, while the THMs and HAAs concentrations were linearly correlated with the corresponding λ0.5 values.

The evaluation process typically consists of identifying the attributes and factors relevant to the decision, and measuring the performance of a supplier by considering the relevant factors. Linguistic assessment of suppliers may be carried out based on several criteria. In this paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate the suppliers' performance by adopting an evolutionary fuzzy system. One of the key considerations in designing the proposed system is the generation of fuzzy rules. A genetic algorithm‐based methodology is developed to evolve the optimal set of fuzzy rule base, and a fuzzy inference system of the MATLAB fuzzy logic toolbox is used to assess the suppliers' performance. The proposed methodology, illustrated with the data collected in a process plant, provides acceptable results in determining the suppliers' performance score.</jats:p>",

Our objective was thus to estimate if algal organic matter (AOM) could be used as a substrate by E. coli and explain its resuscitation in drinking water. For this purpose, E. coli was inoculated in sterile dechlorinated drinking water supplemented with organic matter of various origins in order to reach +0.2 (±0.1) mg BDOC L−1 (AOM, glucose or acetate). The results showed that the addition of AOM (naturally secreted by algae or released after a chlorine or ozone stress) in drinking water can represent a risk for water biological stability: indeed, AOM allowed either a higher cellular production, or a better maintenance of cultivability of E. coli than those observed in non-supplemented sterile drinking water, glucose or acetate solutions (in spite of equivalent additions of BDOC). Growth of E. coli was even up to 10 times higher in the presence of AOM coming from ozonated algae.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mass propagation of algae in drinking water source affects the coagulation process in water treatment systems. Many researchers indicated that some kinds of algal organic matters (AOMs) interacted with coagulants by coordinate bonds and brought about several disorders due to the increase in both the coagulant demand and the residual coagulant in treated water. However, the inhibitory mechanism on the coagulation by AOMs has not been fully elucidated. In this study, AOMs able to form complex with aluminium coagulant were isolated and analyzed. The results of the gel chromatography showed that extracellular organic matters (EOMs) from Microcystis aeruginosa (NIES-91) have molecular weight of between 10 and 20 kDa, around 40 kDa and more than 600 kDa. The amount and diversity of EOMs increased as the algal growth. AOMs able to form complex with aluminium coagulant were successfully isolated with the affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that these AOMs included proteins that have molecular weight between 43 and 67 kDa. Since several kinds of proteins such as metallothionein are known for strongly adsorbing multivalent cations, the isolated algal proteins able to form complex with aluminium might have a high capacity of capturing coagulants and inhibit the coagulation in the drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

The coagulant – PAC dosing sequence did not affect the extent of NOM removal, suggesting that the reduction of PAC-pore-blocking macromolecules by coagulation before PAC adsorption was not a key factor in improving the final extent of NOM removal.

The raw water of the Blue reservoir (Paimpont, France) was fed to a pilot system consisting of a constant pre-treatment (coagulation–flocculation and sand filtration) but with different polishing processes (adsorption alone or combined with a pre-ozonation stage). Chlorine demand, at 2, 6 and 24 hours of reaction time, was determined for the effluent collected from the sand filter, according to the break-point method. The clarified and sand-filtered effluent was subsequently treated either by ozonation (15 min, 3 mg O3/L) coupled with adsorption (EBCT=8 min) or by adsorption alone. Two types of activated carbon were evaluated (NC35, coconut shell and PICABIOL, wood). The final effluents of these two treatment trains were collected to determine their chlorine demand. The adsorption process with PICABIOL halved the chlorine dose (2 mg Cl/L), compared with 4 mg Cl/L for the sand filtered effluent, required to obtain a residual concentration of free chlorine of 0.5 mg/L. Pre-ozonation coupled to adsorption also reduced significantly (by a factor of two and four depending on the type of GAC used) this chlorine dose, after 2, 6 and 24 hours of reaction time. Moreover, the residual chlorine content was the same for these three reaction times because ozone and activated carbon efficiently removed most of the reducing inorganic nitrogenous pollutants. The removal of aromatic organic compounds, quantified as Abs254 nm, by these processes decreased also significantly the calculated THM FP (trihalomethane formation potential) to the extent that this value for the ozonated and or adsorbed effluents has always been lower than the guideline proposed by the EPA (100 μg/L) for total THMs (yearly average).</jats:p>",

By adding small amounts of Fe3+ together with a reduced dose of chitosan, it was possible to significantly improve the removal of the medium molecular weight humic substances. The highest charged (low Fa) chitosans were the most efficient coagulants, indicating that charge neutralisation was the triggering mechanism for the coagulation. Surface charge measurements of coagulated raw water gave strong indications in the same direction. However, net positive surface potentials of flocs after neutralisation indicated that excess chitosan participated in the build-up of flocs, suggesting that bridging or electrostatic patch flocculation could be important mechanisms during flocculation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of stochastic (i.e. robust) water distribution system (WDS) design is formulated and solved here as an optimisation problem under uncertainty. The objective is to minimise total design costs subject to a target level of system robustness. System robustness is defined as the probability of simultaneously satisfying minimum pressure head constraints at all nodes in the network. The decision variables are the alternative design options available for each pipe in the WDS. The only source of uncertainty analysed is the future water consumption uncertainty. Uncertain nodal demands are assumed to be independent random variables following some pre-specified probability density function (PDF). Two new methods are developed to solve the aforementioned problem. In the Integration method, the stochastic problem formulation is replaced with a deterministic one. After some simplifications, a fast numerical integration method is used to quantify the uncertainties. The optimisation problem is solved using the standard genetic algorithm (GA). The Sampling method solves the stochastic optimisation problem directly by using the newly developed robust chance constrained GA. In this approach, a small number of Latin Hypercube (LH) samples are used to evaluate each solution's fitness. The fitness values obtained this way are then averaged over the chromosome age. Both robust design methods are applied to a New York Tunnels rehabilitation case study. The optimal solutions are identified for different levels of robustness. The best solutions obtained are also compared to the previously identified optimal deterministic solution. The results obtained lead to the following conclusions: (1) Neglecting demand uncertainty in WDS design may lead to serious under-design of such systems; (2) Both methods shown here are capable of identifying (near) optimal robust least cost designs achieving significant computational savings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A significant increase in the content of natural organic matter (NOM) has been observed in several surface water sources in Norway during the past 10–12 years. Similar observations are reported also from est sites in Europe and North America. Water works in the southern part of Norway have experienced a doubling and in some cases even a tripling of source water color levels during the last decade. Other important characteristics of NOM, e.g. the specific UV absorption (SUVA), have changed as well. The change in raw water quality increases the required NOM removal capacity in water treatment, and significantly affects treatment process selection, design and operation. However, the operational impacts on water treatment processes are poorly quantified. This paper addresses the observed NOM increase in parts of Europe and North America. Although the reasons are not fully understood or identified, possible causes are presented and discussed. Factors like climate change or variability, especially alteration in precipitation patterns and land-use, as well as reductions in anthropogenic sulfur loadings seem relevant. From pilot testing on relevant raw waters, major operational impacts of increasing NOM and SUVA levels on coagulation-contact filtration processes are identified and quantified. As an illustration, an increase in raw water color from 20 to 35 mg Pt L−1 increased the required coagulant dose, sludge production, number of backwashes per day and residual TOC by 64%, 64%, 87%, and 26%, respectively. In addition, hydraulic capacity and filter run time decreased by 10% and 47%, respectively.</jats:p>",

The objective of this programme was to ensure the drinking water quality regarding the waterborne disease organisms Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterovirus and cyanobacteria, and the potentially harmful chemicals aluminium, cyanotoxins, and disinfection by-products (THM) and their precursors (TOC, DOC, UV254 nm, SUVA). Most of these parameters are new and still not regulated by the Portuguese and the European legislation. Data presented in this study refer to the period of August 2002 to October 2003. Results show that, despite the seasonal variations of the raw water quality, concentrations of the hazardous substances in the supplied drinking water were far below the legal standards and the WHO's and EPA guideline values, demonstrating the high removal efficiencies of this treatment plant.</jats:p>",

We mathematically model and develop simulation‐based rolling schedule procedures for analyzing the manufacturer's ordering policies, transportation activities, and the vendor's manufacturing and order fulfillment processes under five alternative integration strategies. Our objective is to measure the value of information sharing and system coordination across the strategies, identify whether the source of the benefits come from information sharing or coordination, study the allocation of system benefits among channel members, and analyze the impact of environmental factors on system cost performance. The experimental results indicate a 47.58% cost reduction moving from a traditional supply chain to a fully integrated system. While information sharing reduces costs, the main economic benefit comes from coordinated decision‐making. The savings associated with system integration are not equally allocated among channel members, and vary by strategy. The procedures developed in the research provide economic insight that fosters the sharing of technological and strategic efforts.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Specific objectives were the identification of the by-products formed and the evaluation of the toxicity of the irradiated solution compared to that of carbofuran. The experimental results, obtained treating an aqueous carbofuran solution (50 mg/L) by high pressure UV lamp (125 W), show that the insecticide is completely removed within 120 min. Several intermediate by-products have been identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as a result of hydroxylation process of the 2,3-dihydro benzofurane ring and other reactions such as the cleavage of the carbamate group, the hydrolysis of ethereal moiety, radical coupling and decarboxylation processes. After 270 min of reaction the identified by-products were completely degraded and COD and TOC removals of 35 and 20% were measured, respectively. Toxicological analyses performed using the comparison procedure of the MicrotoxTM assay provided interesting clues concerning toxic effects of the photodegradation by-products. The results revealed a substantial increase of the toxicity during the first 15 min proving that photodegradation of organic contaminant could even lead to an increase of the toxicity of treated solution.</jats:p>",

In our research, we first seek to differentiate the traditional Made to Stock (MTS) environment from the emerging Build to Order (BTO) one. In addition, given the global nature of supply chains today, we also compare BTO operations in developed countries with those in the developing world. The results from this study can be useful to practicing managers because we provide specific directions on aligning supply chains for the BTO environment across the globe. In addition, this research adds to the theoretical development of postponement strategies in manufacturing, and establishes empirical links between the international operations, build to order environment, and supply chain literatures.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The higher velocities of water were observed in the second and third chambers than that in the first one. The flow of the opposite direction to the main flow was observed near the water surface. Based on the results of CFD simulation, each chamber was divided into small compartments, and hydrodynamic behavior and effective volume were discussed. Mass balance equations were also established in each compartment with reaction terms associated with DOC, odor compounds, bacteria, bromide ion and bromate ion. This reaction model was intended to predict dissolved ozone concentration, especially. We concluded that the model could predict favourably the mass balance of ozone, namely absorption efficiency of gaseous ozone, dissolved ozone concentration and ozone consumption.

The results indicated that (i) UF is an effective barrier against microorganisms, including virus larger than 80 nm; (ii) for surface waters with low to moderate SUVA values, direct UF performance is equivalent or better than the conventional treatment in terms of residual turbidity, while UV254 nm and TOC residuals require the use of O/C/F/S/UF; (iii) the permeate quality improves with the membrane apparent MWCO decrease, especially for the direct UF, although the conventional treatment performance is never reached using UF; (iv) membrane fouling and adsorption phenomena are more severe in direct UF than in O/C/F/S/UF sequence (pre-ozonation decreases the membrane foulants by decreasing their hydrophobicity) and these phenomena increase with the membrane hydraulic permeability and, particularly, with the membrane apparent MWCO.</jats:p>",

We examine the relationship and supply chain processes between a notebook computer manufacturer and five component suppliers. Two distinct reaction strategies emerge from these five buyer–supplier dyads. The “reduce uncertainty” strategy emphasizes supply contracts with a high degree of restrictiveness, relatively infrequent schedule revisions, and a high level of form postponement. The “cope with uncertainty” strategy emphasizes flexible supply contracts, relatively frequent schedule revisions, and low levels of form postponement. Eight propositions are formulated to understand the linkage between a supplier's power, its short‐term process flexibility, and the elements of its reaction strategy. The paper concludes by proposing future research directions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This paper focuses on the practical experience carried out in one of these facilities, the Bisbal wastewater treatment plant, aimed at enhancing the biological nitrogen removal using simple, low-cost, easy-to-operate measurement and control. The control strategy, which is based on air supply regulation, was previously designed using simulation studies. A dissolved oxygen monitoring system was installed into the facility, while nitrogen concentrations were analysed every day. Optimal dissolved oxygen profiles in the oxidation ditch were identified, while the air supply strategy was modified according to the variations in the influent.</jats:p>",

Bromate is formed from bromide during ozonation under conventional conditions and needs to be reduced at least below a regulated concentration because of its considerable carcinogenicity. The ozonation of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), a model Taste and Odor (T&amp;O) chemical, has been studied in our process. It was known that 2-MIB is adsorbed onto high silica zeolite and oxidized with ozone rapidly in micropores. An adsorbent, named US-Y, in which the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 70, was the best candidate in this study in terms of adsorption of 2-MIB, decomposition of 2-MIB and prevention of bromate formation. Actually, bromate formation was not detected, while about seventy five percent of 2-MIB was decomposed with extremely low ozone concentration of 0.07 ppm and short retention time of 0.2 min in the presence of US-Y. Its applicability for the treatment of natural water containing natural organic matters (NOMs) was also demonstrated.</jats:p>",

In batch adsorption kinetics, As(V) adsorption onto ICS was completed within 20 minutes, while adsorption of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II) onto ICS was slower than that of As(V) and strongly depended on initial pH. At pH 3.5, ICS showed a selective adsorption of Pb(II) compared to Cd( II) and Cu(II) . However, above pH 4.5, near complete removal of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II) was observed through adsorption or precipitation depending on pH. As(V) adsorption onto ICS occurred through an anionic-type and followed a Langmuir-type adsorption behaviour. In column experiments, pH was identified as an important parameter in the breakthrough of As(V). As(V) breakthrough at pH 4.5 was much slower than at pH 9 due to a strong chemical bonding between As(V) and ICS as similar with batch adsorption behaviour. With variation of ICS amounts, the optimum amount of ICS at pH 4.5 was identified as 5.0 grams in this research. At this condition, ICS could be used to treat 200 mg of As(V) with 1 kg of ICS until 50 ppb of As(V) appeared in the effluent. In this research, as a new treatment system, ICS can be potentially used to treat As(V) and cationic heavy metals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ease of removal of iron in water treatment is determined principally by the form of iron present. If iron is complexed to natural organic matter (NOM) and present in dissolved form, it is quite difficult to remove by conventional deep-bed filtration methods while if present as particulate iron oxyhydroxides it is readily removed. A major source of iron in reservoirs is the benthic sediments which, on becoming anoxic, release ferrous iron (Fe(II)) to the water column. This Fe(II) may either bind to NOM and be retained in dissolved form or may form inorganic hydroxyl complexes which oxidize to Fe(III) species which typically precipitate rapidly. In this paper, we report on studies of the kinetics of Fe(II) removal from solution in the presence and absence of the IHSS standard Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA). Oxidation of inorganic Fe(II) by oxygen is negligible at low pH but addition of organics changes the kinetics of removal of Fe(II) remarkably, reducing the half life of Fe(II) from hours to minutes. Increasing the concentration of SRFA also enhances the degree of Fe(II) removal. Experimental results obtained over a wide range of conditions are successfully described using a kinetic model which accounts for the transformations between Fe(II) and Fe(III) species.</jats:p>",

In other words this tool shows which alarms are directly connected to primary faults and which alarms are consequential effects of the primary ones. The core of the software is an algorithm which uses a knowledge ontology and a set of alarm propagation rules, which are both based on a Multilevel Flow Modelling (MFM) paradigm. The algorithm has been tested implementing a rule based expert system (RBES) referred to an existing water plant. The main features of the water plant have been identified and all the main components and their possible alarm states have been analyzed to carry out the knowledge base.</jats:p>",

The micrometre-sized PAC (median particle diameter, 0.8 and 3.8 μm) removed NOM much better than did asreceived PAC (33 μm). Only one-tenth the dose of micrometre-sized PAC had the same effect as a full dose of the as-received PAC. The micro-grinding of PAC to micrometre sizes was effective at increasing its adsorption kinetics: adsorption of NOM to the micrometre-sized PAC reached 80% of equilibrium within only 1 min of contact time. The micro-grinding of PAC was also effective at increasing its adsorption capacity for NOM and polystyrene sulfonate-MW1800, but not for the small molecule phenol. This appeared to be due to an increase in mesopore surface area probably by fracture of ink-bottle pore structures during the micro-grinding. The micro-grinding enhanced the adsorption affinity of PAC for NOM that was strongly UV260-absorbent but not for NOM with low UV260 absorbance.</jats:p>",

One WTW was investigated to determine a link between raw water characteristics and reactivity with chlorine. Bulk water parameters were measured but the information obtained was limited. To further characterise the water, samples of reservoir water were fractionated using XAD resins and UF membranes. The resulting fractions were subjected to analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), specific UV absorbance (SUVA) defined as the ratio of UV254 to DOC and trihalomethane formation potential (THM-FP). The samples were also characterised using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Both methods of fractionation described here have limitations in explaining the bulk water behaviour. The relationship between SUVA and THM-FP was discussed. HPSEC showed that the size distribution of the resin separated and membrane separated fractions was similar indicating that the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membranes is not sharp.</jats:p>",

The OH radical was trapped with a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a stable adduct, DMPO-OH. The relationship between the ozone concentration, 3-chlorophenol content, and the initial velocity (ν0) of DMPO-OH generation was analyzed mathematically, and the following equation was obtained: ν0 (10−6 M/s)=(1.58×10−5)×[3-chlorophenol (10−6 M)]×[ozone (10−6 M)]2.40+(3.09×10−5)×[ozone (10−6 M)]1.72. The equation fitted very well with the experimental results, and square of the correlation coefficient was larger than 0.9.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many water treatment plants are currently facing the challenge of removing both turbidity and organic matter at a reasonable cost. This double objective often requires high coagulant doses, resulting in high operating costs due to the increase in both reagents use and sludge production. An attractive approach to reducing operating costs while maintaining the finished water quality is to add the coagulant in a double step sequence, which is referred to as double step coagulation. In this article, bench-scale experiments were conducted to assess the impact of a double step addition of coagulant on both turbidity and organic matter removal in clarification processes. The results showed that coagulant dose required for a given turbidity target can be significantly reduced. For example, for a final turbidity of 1 NTU, the coagulant dose can be reduced by 20% with respect to the Coagulant Reference Dose (CRD), which represents 200,000 Euros per year without any additional investment on infrastructure. Following these bench scale demonstrative tests, the double step coagulation strategy was adopted at full scale by the Sidi Said Maachou Water Treatment Plant in Morocco. Operated by the Société des Eaux de l'Oum Er-rbia, this plant treats 200,000 m3/day to supply the city of Casablanca. The double step coagulation was implemented to achieve a double objective: turbidity and organic matter removal at the lowest chemical cost.</jats:p>",

Such effects have recently been observed at Ribeira de Iguape basin, located on the south coast of São Paulo State, due to the growth of unconformities in the environmental water quality tests control. Much of this area constitutes an environmental preservation system, with just a reasonable sanitation support. All the water treatment plants (WTPs) in this basin usually discharge large quantities of water treatment sludge to nearby rivers and streams. Few studies have reported the impact of these residues. However, some cities in the basin continue to use river waters for provisioning. On the other hand, high rainfall and wide flow variation of streams due to the tropical weather may minimize potential sludge deposition effects. This work discusses a monitoring study of a WTP on Ribeira de Iguape River, to evaluate the possibility of this continuous discharge, and search for new alternatives of disposal and treatment of water works residuals, according to environmental patterns.</jats:p>",

It is also now becoming necessary to reduce DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) so that less chlorine is lost in a distribution system and less THMs (trihalomethanes) are formed. Enhanced coagulation (exceeding other requirements) at pH of about 5-6 is known to significantly reduce DOC so that acceptable water quality can be achieved at the tap. In this paper, models are integrated to project the impact of water treatment on water quality through the entire distribution system. A DOC removal model, which predicts DOC resulting from a given coagulant, its dose and the coagulation pH, is used to simulate the treatment. By linking this model of DOC removal with models of chlorine decay and THM formation, the impact of treatment on chlorine and THM concentrations in a distribution system can be simulated. This method was applied in a case study with relatively high initial DOC. It was shown that more DOC can be removed by using ferric coagulant than the current practice achieves. This would result in an improved chlorine profile and a substantial reduction in THM concentrations.</jats:p>",

The study zones were selected mainly because they lack formal water supply systems and the population is forced to consume untreated water directly from rivers and shallow or artesian wells. The efficiency of the water disinfection process based on solar energy was determined in the dry and rainy seasons with water from the most contaminated sources in the study zones. The performed tests consisted of studying the effect of disinfecting water by direct exposure to sunlight during the whole day, with and without solar concentrators, in plastic bottles of commercial beverages. The three types of bottles used were transparent, partially painted black (one half of the bottle, along the longitudinal axis), and totally black. The study shows that, in these geographic zones, the available water must be disinfected before consumption, and disinfection efficiency can reach 100% through the use of solar radiation.</jats:p>",

The growing number of articles on BOSC in the literature is an indication of the importance of the strategy and of its role in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective of a BOSC strategy is to meet the requirements of individual customers by leveraging the advantages of outsourcing and information technology. There are not many research articles that provide an overview of BOSC, despite the fact that this strategy is being promoted as the operations paradigm of the future. The main objective of this research is to (i) review the concepts of BOSC, (ii) develop definitions of BOSC, (iii) classify the literature based on a suitable classification scheme, leading to some useful insights into BOSC and some future research directions, (iv) review the selected articles on BOSC for their contribution to the development and operations of BOSC, (v) develop a framework for BOSC, and (vi) suggest some future research directions. The literature has been reviewed based on the following four major areas of decision‐making: organizational competitiveness, the development and implementation of BOSC, the operations of BOSC, and information technology in BOSC. Some of the important observations are: (a) there is a lack of adequate research on the design and control of BOSC, (b) there is a need for further research on the implementation of BOSC, (c) human resource issues in BOSC have been ignored, (d) issues of product commonality and modularity from the perspective of partnership or supplier development require further attention and (e) the trade‐off between responsiveness and the cost of logistics needs further study.

During this period, the motor neurons are responsive to specific trophic factors for their survival. Several neurotrophic factors, including the neurotrophins BDNF and NT‐3, have survival effects although no single factor has been shown to support the survival of all motor neurons. It is unclear whether this is due to factor deprivation during the study or whether there are distinct neuronal subpopulations dependent on different factor requirements. In this study, we have used an expression system to supply a continuous source of BDNF and/or NT‐3 to the developing motor neurons in the chick. Continuous supply of BDNF resulted in the survival of 40% of the motor neurons normally lost between embryonic day 6 and embryonic day 10, whereas NT‐3 supported 36% of the motor neurons normally lost. In combination, BDNF and NT‐3 supported 62% of the motor neurons normally lost indicating that there is some redundancy in neurotrophin requirements. Our results show that a continuous supply of neurotrophins is more effective in promoting motor neuron survival than intermittent administration, particularly for NT‐3. However, even with continuous administration of both factors in combination we are unable to support all motor neurons that would normally undergo neuronal degeneration.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The following two questions serve as the motivation for the study: Do customer expectations of order fulfillment processes vary across product types? Should the product type matter in configuring order fulfillment processes? From the studies in the marketing literature, we infer that customer satisfaction assessments are based on customer expectations of order fulfillment processes, and that these expectations systematically vary across the three product types: convenience goods (e.g., groceries, home and office supplies), shopping goods (e.g., ready‐to‐wear men, women, and kids’ apparel), and specialty goods (e.g., desktop and notebook computers, and wedding dresses). In particular, we posit that <jats:italic>ceteris paribus</jats:italic>, customer satisfaction with order fulfillment will decrease moving along a continuum of product types, from convenience goods to specialty goods. The empirical analysis for this study is based on data collected on dimensions of customer satisfaction with order fulfillment from a sample of 256 firms engaged in electronic B2C transactions. Firms included in our study sample are such that their products can be classified into only one of three product types: convenience, shopping, or specialty goods. In essence, each firm in the study sample is a proxy for one of three product types. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that, on average, customers tend to have higher satisfaction levels with the order fulfillment process of convenience and shopping goods than with the order fulfillment process of specialty goods. We discuss the managerial implications of our results, contributions of the paper to the literature, limitations, and directions for future research.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Derived from successes in other industries, the benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead‐times have been pointed out. While the theoretical discussion of such ‘build‐to‐order’ (BTO) strategies is well advanced, the dynamic feasibility of implementing these concepts is far from understood. Using a simulation of a multi‐tier supply chain‐system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities with the objective of determining the scope for potential improvements in responsiveness of the supply chain. The simulation results show that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand, as well as due to the strong reliance on forecasting in the scheduling process. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how to improve current scheduling systems towards increasing the content of vehicles built to customer order.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Specifically, this paper considers the specific scenario of optimizing the configuration of the supply chain system given commonality among platform products. The paper uses and extends the concept of Generic Bills of Materials (GBOM) of a product family as a unified framework for qualitatively capturing and representing the structure of its supply chain. This qualitative model is then enhanced by a mathematical model developed to quantify the relationships among various design decisions. Endeavoring to solve the mathematical model more efficiently, we propose an effective heuristic method using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Although GA generally does not guarantee the optimal solution, the best heuristic solutions obtained in this study are consistent with the optimal solutions obtained using Dynamic Programming. The resulting mathematical model and solution algorithm are then used to investigate the mutual impact between the design decisions of platform products and of processes in the supply chain through sensitivity analyses. Several useful managerial insights are generated and discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This involvement may range from simple consultation with suppliers on design ideas to making suppliers fully responsible for the design of components or systems they will supply. Moreover, suppliers may be involved at different stages of the new product development process. Early supplier involvement is a key coordinating process in supply chain design, product design and process design.</jats:p><jats:p>Several important questions regarding supplier involvement in new product development remain unanswered.

The SPE cartridges used in this study include a wide range of polarity from non-polar C-18 materials to anion exchangers. Each individual cartridge run takes 10 minutes and requires about 15 ml of sample. The collected water sample matrix is not changed, i.e. all PRAM analyses were done under ambient conditions on the original sample. Polarity evaluation is completed without the sample being exposed to changes in sample conditions, such as pH, solvent extraction, sequential evaporations or freeze-drying.

The objective of this research was to evaluate yield and physiological attributes in this forage grass when grown in nutrient solutions containing N rates. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with plastic pots containing ground quartz as substrate, during the Spring season. Six N rates in the solution (14, 112, 210, 294, 378, and 462 mg L-1), with 70% N-NO3- and 30% N-NH4+ were tested. Experimental units were set up in a completely randomized block design, with four replications. Plants were harvested at 35 days after the seedlings were transplanted to the pots and again at 28 days after the first harvest. After the second harvest, the roots were taken from the substrate. In both growing periods, dry matter yield for plant tops and roots, leaf area, number of expanded green leaves, number of tillers, leaf appearance rate, and phyllochron were significantly affected by the N rates, and the data were adjusted to a second-order model. Aruana grass required high rates of N to show maximum response in those variables.</jats:p>",

Calcite comprises ∼10 wt% of Chinese loess and contains ∼1 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> nmol of Sr/g with an <jats:sup>87</jats:sup>Sr/<jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Sr ratio of ∼0.711.

The factor of 5 difference between the estimates reflects discrepancies inherent to methods for determining dust fluxes to seawater. At present, these discrepancies remain unresolved. Calcite dust is completely dissolved during transport in the atmosphere and ocean. Thus the marine Sr input from eolian calcite dissolution has averaged either 2 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> or 1 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> mol/yr. A mass balance model demonstrates that the lower estimate has very little influence on seawater <jats:sup>87</jats:sup>Sr/<jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Sr ratios, whereas the higher estimate has possibly elevated seawater <jats:sup>87</jats:sup>Sr/<jats:sup>86</jats:sup>Sr ratios by ∼18% since 2.5 Ma. When combined with previously reported effects of Northern Hemisphere glaciation on the riverine Sr flux, this shift is sufficient to reproduce the entire Plio‐Pleistocene marine Sr record. While more research is required to constrain dust flux estimates, these findings suggest that the atmospheric supply of eolian calcite to seawater may represent a previously overlooked process linking climate change to the marine Sr cycle.</jats:p>",

The supply of K to grass/clover from a range of mineral and organically based K fertilizers and its interaction with N supply were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Sequential plant cuts were taken for yield and nutrient content determinations in crop and soil. Crop yields were limited by N: where N supply was increased either through the mineralization of N from organic materials (rapemeal, farmyard manure) or inorganic fertilizer, plant yields increased significantly. Grass/clover responded better to additional K where sufficient N was available. However, yield responses to K were generally small, even in the presence of adequate N. Of the different fertilizers, kali and MSL‐K increased yields above those of the control by less than 5%, sylvinite, DKSI and farmyard manure by 10–20%, and rapemeal and potassium sulphate by more than 25%. In all treatments, K offtakes in the grass/clover were considerably greater than fertilizer K inputs. The grass/clover showed an increased uptake of Na where insufficient K was available. However, the Mg content of the grass/clover was not adversely affected by K fertilizer application. Organic farmers need to consider the soil K status, the rotational nutrient budget, the supply of all nutrients in fertilizing materials and nutrient interactions to achieve effective K management in organic farming systems.</jats:p>",

In the present study, 10 individual colonies of each<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>isolate (primary isolate) from 97 tuberculosis patients in a primarily human immunodeficiency virus-negative population were screened for heterogeneity and detectable mixed infections by spoligotyping, IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeat typing. The MICs of antituberculosis drugs for colonies with divergent fingerprints were determined. Infections with different bacterial subpopulations were detected in the samples from eight patients (8.2%), and the frequency of detectable mixed infections in the study population was estimated to be 2.1%. Genotypic variations were found to be independent of the drug susceptibilities, and the various molecular markers evolved independently in most cases. The predominant strains and the primary isolates always had concordant drug susceptibility and MIC testing results. These findings have implications on the interpretation of molecular epidemiology results for patient follow-up and in transmission studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Knowledge of the clonal expansion of<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>and accurate identification of predominant evolutionary lineages in this species remain limited, especially with regard to low-IS<jats:italic>6110-</jats:italic>copy-number strains. In this study, 170<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>isolates with ≤6 IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>insertions identified in Cape Town, South Africa, were characterized by principal genetic grouping, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, spoligotyping, IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>insertion site mapping, and variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing. These analyses indicated that all but one of the isolates analyzed were members of principal genetic group 2 and of the same low-IS<jats:italic>6110-</jats:italic>copy-number lineage. The remaining isolate was a member of principal genetic group 1 and a different low-IS<jats:italic>6110-</jats:italic>copy-number lineage. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests clonal expansion through sequential acquisition of additional IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>copies, expansion and contraction of VNTR sequences, and the deletion of specific direct-variable-repeat sequences. Furthermore, comparison of the genotypic data of 91 representative low-IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-copy-number isolates from Cape Town, other southern African regions, Europe, and the United States suggests that certain low-IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>-copy-number strain spoligotypes and IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>fingerprints were acquired in the distant past. These clones have subsequently become widely disseminated and now play an important role in the global tuberculosis epidemic.</jats:p>",

A soft-systems framework was used to structure and analyze the problem and identify relevant systems. Issues addressed are the extent of efficiency along the supply chain (including input supply (issues), output marketing, quality control and transport) and the relationships between the various participants in the supply chain. Qualitative and quantitative data collection methods have been used.</jats:p>",
