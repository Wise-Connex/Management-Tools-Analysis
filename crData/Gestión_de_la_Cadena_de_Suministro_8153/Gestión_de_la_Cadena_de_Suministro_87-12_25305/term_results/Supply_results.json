While many authors have addressed the economic implications of the existing dairy price support program, few have explicitly considered the relationship between risk aversion, capital investment, milk production, and support price policy in this process. This paper considers the role of uncertainty and risk-averse behavior and suggests that these elements are crucial to an economic analysis of the current program and future dairy policy issues.</jats:p>",

The effects of combined N were studied in faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.), using the same Rhizobium leguminosarum isolates for both hosts.

Using an expectancy theory framework, a sample of 272 job applicants evaluated a set of job outcomes and rated the instrumentalities and expectancies for each of eight jobs that varied in terms of sex dominance, pay, and worth. Preferences for each job also were obtained using a paired comparison procedure. The results suggested that much of the wage gap between men and women can be explained by (1) evaluations of multiple outcomes other than pay and (2) gender‐related differences in expectancies, instrumentalities, and valences with respect to these outcomes. Both the theoretical and practical utility of approaching the issue of comparable worth from a supply as well as a demand side are discussed.</jats:p>",

Total dry matter intakes were increased (P &lt; 0.05) from 780 g d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to 1143 g d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> by the supplements with a corresponding improvement in liveweight gain, but there was no difference between supplements. Apparent digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter and cell wall were decreased (P &lt; 0.05) by alfalfa supplementation but not by soy protein infusion; however, intakes of digestible energy were identical for both supplements. Relative to the basal diet, alfalfa increased digesta passage but not rumen fill whereas infusion of soy protein increased digesta fill in the rumen but not digesta passage. In trial 2, addition of soy protein directly to the basal diet resulted in an intake similar to alfalfa supplementation (1154 vs. 1262 g dry matter d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> respectively). Fecal output, estimated using a single compartment model to describe digesta passage through the tract, yielded results similar to those obtained by total collection.

These nuclides were also determined in stream drainage area soils and bedrock. From these measurements and hydrological data, an estimate of the annual supply of these nuclides to Lake 239 at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) was made. Because of low concentrations of major ions, suspended sediments, and low pH, many common stream transport mechanisms for these nuclides are not available, and we propose that dissolved organic carbon is important in this respect. The annual flux (per unit stream drainage area) of these nuclides to the lake is similar to fluxes calculated for larger rivers of the world. Uranium-234 is transported preferentially to <jats:sup>238</jats:sup>U at activity ratios of 1–1.3. Radium-226 is carried in solution in proportion to Ca<jats:sup>++</jats:sup>. The major supply of <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb to the lake is from atmospheric fallout on the lake surface area. There are insufficient <jats:sup>222</jats:sup>Rn or <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb deficits in the soil profiles to balance the measured excess <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb in surface soils and lake sediments. Partition coefficients for these nuclides were calculated from data on stream suspended sediments and stream water; U and Ra coefficients were ≈ 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>, and Th, <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb, and <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Po coefficients were 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> to 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup>. </jats:p>",
