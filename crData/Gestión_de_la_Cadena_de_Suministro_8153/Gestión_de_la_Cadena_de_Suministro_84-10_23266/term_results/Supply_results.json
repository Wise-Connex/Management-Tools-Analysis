The first part of this paper discusses certain properties of a general autonomous control model that appears promising for the analysis of general dynamic supply response models in agricultural economics, resource economics, and related fields. The second part of the paper, which can be read somewhat independently of the first, emphasizes the potential empirical applications of special cases of the general model discussed in the first part. In what follows, we always deal with continuous time and infinite horizon models because of their analytical tractability. Extension and modification of our results for discrete-time, finite-horizon problems should be fairly obvious and are left to the interested reader.</jats:p>",

Norland, kept in darkness at 15 °C, was significantly increased either by increasing the relative humidity (RH) from approximately 40 to 100% or by supplying water to the basal cut end of the tubers. These two treatments showed a significant interaction, the response to the external water supply being considerably greater at the higher RH. The growth response was closely correlated with increases in the dry weight and the water content of the sprouts, expressed on either a sprout or dry weight basis. The high RH plus water treatment also eliminated the inhibition of sprout growth by light, the length of the sprouts in this treatment being almost 160% greater than in the light at low RH and 60% greater than in the dark. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that when the tuber has no external supply of water, the growth of the sprouts is determined primarily by their water content, and thus by the effect and interaction of factors affecting the supply of water from the tuber and its rate of loss from the sprouts by transpiration. </jats:p>",

The blood supply to the infrahyoid muscles was found to be segmented in nature with the dividing line at the level of the cricoid ring. No axial pattern of vascularization could be demonstrated within the strap muscles. The skin overlying these muscles is supplied by tributaries arising from the above‐described arteries.

Both outer and inner stripes of the outer medulla were supplied through different arterial capillary networks arising from efferent arterioles and arterial (descending) vasa recta. In contrast to previous studies using silicone rubber and light microscopy, a rich arterial capillary network supplying the outer stripe was demonstrated. Capillaries in the outer stripe and outer part of the inner stripe drained into venous vasa recta between vascular the bundles, while capillaries in the inner part of the inner stripe drained into venous vasa recta within the bundles. The results indicate that each zone in the outer medulla is supplied through separate capillary networks. The demonstration of a rich capillary network in the outer stripe of the outer medulla suggests that the predilection of this zone for tubular necrosis with ischemic or toxic injury is not related to a sparse capillary blood supply.</jats:p>",

Nor does their care in attaching explicit caveats to their conclusions overcome the fact that the limitations of their approach are serious. The question of oil supply disruptions and their potential economic impact is indeed important, and it remains so despite slack oil markets. Policymakers may yet be faced with situations that require them to decide quickly on the advisability of emergency tariffs and other such measures; and they will need reasonable assurances that the caveats analysts attach to policy recommendations do not overwhelm the recommendations themselves. Just such a danger is inherent in the inappropriate application of models and the application of inappropriate models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Perennial ryegrass (<jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic> L.) was grown in pots on 21 UK soils, both with and without fertiliser N. The fertiliser N was applied in six equal applications of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N‐labelled ammonium nitrate, each at the rate of 120 mg N per pot. The first application was mixed thoroughly with the soil, while subsequent applications were made in solution to the soil surface, after each of the first five of the six harvests of herbage. In the absence of fertiliser N, the proportion of the total soil N taken up by the plants, including stubble and roots at the sixth harvest, varied between 1.5 and 4.0%. In the presence of fertiliser N, the proportion varied between 2.1 and 4.7%. The apparent recovery of the fertiliser N was calculated from the difference between the amounts of N in the plants that received fertiliser N and in those that did not, expressed as a percentage of the amount applied. The actual recovery of the applied fertiliser N was determined by analysis of the plant material for <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N. With all soils at the first harvest, the apparent recovery was greater than the actual recovery. When calculated over all six harvests, apparent recovery of the total amount of fertiliser N was generally close to the actual recovery. This difference from the first harvest probably reflected (i) a reduction in the extent of turnover between fertiliser N and soil N when the fertiliser N was applied to the surface and (ii) a virtually complete uptake of available soil N by the end of the experiment, in both the absence and presence of fertiliser N. Differences between the 21 soils in actual recovery were not closely related, either positively or negatively, to a range of measured soil properties. A mean of 17.2% of the labelled fertiliser N was retained in the soil (excluding visible roots) at the end of the experiment. The lowest retention (6.2%) occurred with the soil which had the lowest contents of organic matter and silt plus clay but, with the other soils, the extent of retention varied only between 14.7 and 22.0% of that applied, and was not closely related to contents of total organic matter or macro‐organic matter, or to the C:N ratio of the whole soil or the macro‐organic matter.</jats:p>",

A discussion of lithological influences leads to the prediction that migration in granular porosity is likely to end in trapping or dispersal, whereas migration in brittle, compact formations, which are little fractured, can allow the petroleum to reach distant structures.</jats:p><jats:p>The source of supply for the “giant” tar accumulations of Alberta is then investigated. Chromatographic analyses strongly support a predominantly Triassic, basinal origin for the Pre‐Mesozoic Unconformity oils and, consequently, of the tars accumulated in the basal Cretaceous sands and Grosmont Paleozoic carbonates. A study of the spatial distribution of the thickness of oil‐stained rocks in the respective formations suggests that migration to the tar accumulations cannot have occured without interruption in the basal, transgressive Cretaceous sandstones, whereas continous migration (from the basin to the shelf) appears to have taken place in the weathered, carbonate Paleozoic sub‐crops.</jats:p>",
