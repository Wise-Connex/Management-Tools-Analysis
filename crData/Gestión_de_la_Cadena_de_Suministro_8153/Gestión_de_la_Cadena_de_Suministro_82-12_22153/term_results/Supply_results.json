There was no significant difference between the intake of Desmodium–grass silage and lupin green forage. Milk and FCM production were not significantly different on the four treatments although lupin green forage gave appreciably less than the silages. The expected milk production from the energy and protein consumed suggested that the milk produced was mainly from the concentrate. It is concluded that low energy concentration in all the forages, and low crude protein content in the silages, were the main limiting factors for high milk production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem of measuring the economic dimensions of a timber resource is discussed. It is suggested that for rational timber-supply analysis, a means of estimating economically recoverable timber stocks on a regional basis is required, plus an ability to forecast how these stocks will change over time in response to changes in technology, input costs, and timber prices. As a first step towards achieving these goals, a study is described which demonstrates that statistically significant relationships can be developed for predicting logging operability, using only those resource characteristics which are, or could be, included in inventory records. Using data collected for 48 logging operations in coastal British Columbia for the period 1977–1979, equations are estimated for predicting the length of roads required for harvesting an area, falling and bucking productivity, yarding productivity, scaled volume of logs harvested, and the probability of choosing a specific harvesting system. The use of these, or similar equations, for timber stock supply modelling is briefly described. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To investigate the relative contributions of alterations in blood flow, capillary density, and tissue PO2 to elevated oxygen delivery in working muscle, we conducted experiments on the suffused hamster cremaster muscle, using in vivo microscopic techniques. Muscle PO2 was measured during striated muscle twitch contraction at 1 Hz. Tissue oxygenation was changed by using suffusion solutions equilibrated with 0%, 5%, 10%, 21%, or 50% oxygen. Contraction caused an increase in capillary density (capillary recruitment), whose magnitude was related to the equilibration gas and, thus, to the suffusate PO2. Capillary recruitment first increased as the oxygen content was raised, peaked with 10% oxygen, and then diminished with higher oxygen content. Arteriolar functional dilation was also observed; when oxygen was raised above 21%, dilation was decreased. The data suggest that oxygen supply is increased primarily by arteriolar conductance changes with low suffusion solution oxygen (0% to 5%), and by capillary recruitment and increased PO2 gradients above 10% oxygen. When vasomotor tone was increased by addition of norepinephrine to the suffusion medium, the changes observed were similar to those observed when oxygen was increased. Therefore, we propose that the altered microvascular responses during vasoconstriction are a function of vascular tone rather than the levels of tissue PO2. A model is proposed which may partially explain the relations among vascular tone, functional dilation, and capillary recruitment. Our data also suggest that tissue PO2 may not be precisely regulated about a narrowly defined set point in this striated muscle but that, instead, tissue PO2 is a dependent variable controlled by the integrated effects of capillary recruitment, functional vasodilation, and altered metabolism.</jats:p>",
