Supply base reduction is one option useful in managing the supply base. The current paper reports the results of case studies in 10 organizations that recently implemented supply base reduction activities. Specifically, the paper identifies the key success factors in supply base reduction efforts and prescribes processes to capture the benefits of supply base reduction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>As the economy evolves from manufacturing to services, it is important to understand whether the lessons learned in the manufacturing sector can be directly extrapolated to service supply chains. Unfortunately, the majority of existing supply chain research focuses exclusively on the manufacturing sector. To address this deficiency, this article compares the effect of traditional manufacturing‐oriented supply chain strategies on the operational and financial performance of firms in both service and manufacturing sectors. The results highlight similarities and differences between the two sectors — demonstrating that effective supply chain strategies in one sector may not be appropriate in the other sector. This suggests that practicing managers should identify appropriate benchmarks and competitive priorities before pursuing specific supply chain strategies. The insights provided by this research should help guide companies toward strategies that may positively affect their specific organization's operational and financial performance.</jats:p>",

Particle suspensions (Min-U-Sil 5) with 1.7 μm mean particle size were filtered at pH values of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, all above the isoelectric point (near pH 2.0). Zeta potential distribution (ZPD) and particle size distribution (PSD) of influent and effluent particles were measured. More favorable particles, i.e. particles with smaller surface charge, were well attached to the collectors during the early stage of filtration. This selective attachment of the lower charged particles caused the ZPD of the effluent to move to a more negative range. However, the ZPD did not keep moving to a more negative range during later stages of filtration, and this result was thought to be caused by two reasons: ripening effects and detachment of flocs. In the early stages of filtration, particles were captured better at pH 3.0 than at the higher pH values (as expected), but this trend reversed at a cumulative hydraulic loading (CHL) of only 5–10 m3/m2. Particle breakoff apparently occurs as flocs of particles that are initially captured individually, as indicated by the trends for different particle sizes. At pH 3.0, particles in the 3–5 μm range had worse removal after a CHL of 5 m3/m2, whereas removal improved through the entire CHL of 20 m3/m2 for all size particles at pH 4.0. Chemical parameters such as zeta potential can be important during the initial stage of filtration, but their importance can decrease over time depending on the specific chemical conditions. The influent particle size distribution and the removal of certain size particles during the initial stage can significantly influence ripening which, in turn, can influence the overall particle removal efficiency. Better initial particle removal does not necessarily mean better overall particle removal.</jats:p>",

It enables explicit risk reduction of systematic risks due to the hydrologic cycle such as drought, and non-systematic risks such as water quality, climate, and energy.

With this objective, a compact and portable dc to dc Converter has been developed which has an output rating of 100kV, 0.4mA. The high voltage generation scheme uses a hybrid approach. The overall idea behind implementation of hybrid concept is to optimize voltage upliftment with suitable techniques for maximizing power delivered per unit volume. The proposed converter provides this feature and uses flyback converter in association with Cockcroft-Walton Multiplier [M. Jullian, Cockcroft-Walton Multiplier Optimum Design Guide V2.0, August 2005 (http//www.blazelabes.com)] for the generation of 100kV dc from 12V dc source, i.e., normal battery. In the first stage 12V dc is modulated/chopped into series of high frequency pulses by pulse width modulator and then increased in level up to 16kVpp by step up flyback transformer. Further by using n stage half wave series Cockcroft-Walton multiplier the voltage is stepped up to the level of 100kV. As switching device, state of the art metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor has been used. The obtained voltage multiplier cascade efficiency is 82.64%, whereas overall power conversion efficiency of the charging power supply is 85.47%. The control unit has been fiber optically isolated from high voltage unit due to safety consideration. The presented article explores complete design and development approach of compact and portable 100kV dc power supply which can be used for a variety of applications such as x-ray generation, ion implantation, charge particle acceleration, radio isotope production, etc.</jats:p>",

It is increasingly recognized as a fundamentally social and political process as it affects the stakeholders, their environment, and their livelihoods. The challenge is to identify responses that will be adopted rather than something that works. Involving stakeholders in the design and evaluation of new management options, technologies, and policies seems to be a promising approach to ensure their success in terms of acceptance and deployment by end-users. In order to come up with feasible, effective, and accepted environmental management solutions, environmental planning and decision-making processes have to be interactive and iterative. This paper identifies key issues in participatory test and evaluation (PTE) and offers a cursory overview of approaches, methods, and tools for participatory evaluation.

Another strategy is to provide advantages for small‐sized college and university libraries to participate in a collaborative digital repository without any additional expenditure. Small‐sized college and university libraries should be able to upload metadata and full texts to the KERIS server without the purchase of hardware and software and they can create and access a collaborative digital repository for free.

Population and industrial growth leading to an immense increase in the number and intricacy of sources of water pollution, climate change, and shifts in weather patterns towards extremes are just some of the factors that are making the option to reuse water more attractive throughout the world, and necessary for some regions. While there are numerous obstacles to be overcome in planning water reuse schemes, the costs of treatment and distribution are two of the most important factors that need to be considered at the planning level. An additional factor, the selection of end users, also can have significant impact. New decision support software for integrated water reuse, called WTRNet, has been developed, which incorporates these three factors in determining the least-cost design alternatives. A brief overview of existing tools relevant to water reuse is presented, followed by a thorough description of key software features. An application of the WTRNet software on a case study involving a small number of potential industrial users of reclaimed water is presented, which demonstrates the importance of utilizing formal optimisation in determining the most promising design alternatives.</jats:p>",

More specifically, each customer order entails a due date specifying when the customer wants the item delivered. The information is perfect in the sense that a placed order cannot be revised. With the intent of using the advance-order information fully throughout the supply chain, each installation replenishes its stock using order base-stock policies (see Hariharan and Zipkin 1995). As for stock allocation, the presence of advance-order information at the central warehouse raises important questions regarding when reservations should be made for different retailers, i.e., how to make best use of the available temporal information to allocate items to retailers. Exact and approximate cost evaluation techniques are presented for the general case, the general reservation policy, as well as for the two special cases of reserving as early as possible, the complete reservation policy, and as late as possible, the last-minute allocation policy. A numerical study illustrates the performance of the proposed heuristics and provides insights on the value of using advance-order information in supply chain inventory control. </jats:p>",

Resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxylbenzene) and 2,4-pentadiol were used to represent the aromatic and aliphatic precursors. Laboratory prepared hydrophilic organic acids was used to simulate the mixtures of the aqueous natural organic matter. The results showed that about 60% of the bromide was transformed into HOBr and OBr− by chlorine when the chlorine dosages was high (5–20 mg/L of free chlorine). However, only 20% of bromide was transformed into HOBr and OBr− at low chlorine dosage (1 mg/L). Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) measurements showed that higher THMs formation was obtained at higher pH for 2,4-pentadiol, mainly due to the presence of the bromo-THMs. For resorcinol, however, no bromo-THMs are formed at either pH 7 or 9. For THMFP from hydrophilic organic acids, no apparent pH effect was observed. It is concluded that the higher THM formation at higher pH was mainly due to the formation of bromo-THMs from the aliphatic precursors. Similar trends are obtained in THMFP measurements for haloacetic acids formation potential (HAAFP).</jats:p>",

The process usually consists of the rapid dispersal of a coagulant into the raw water followed by an intense agitation commonly defined as rapid mixing. Mixing is influenced by chemical and physical parameters, and the result of the whole treatment depends on these steps. It is concluded that the proper process of mixing is able to not only improve outlet water quality, but also helps reduce energy dissipation, coagulant dosage and operating cost. It is evidenced, however, that the traditional theory of mixing should be modified. Based on hydrodynamics analysis and experimental results, a mixing model for turbulent flow is presented for the first time. The speed of macroscopic mixing is governed by turbulent diffusion, and the speed of microcosmic mixing is governed by molecule diffusion. The mixing process is dominated by macroscopic mixing. The Euler number Eu can be used as the design parameter that determines the mixing efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A decade ago the ‘Dublin Principles’ shifted global thinking towards treating water as an economic good. The concern was that overly supply-driven approaches had been financially unsustainable, and therefore failed to reduce the service gap. Accompanying this conceptual shift has been a wider move towards focusing on the customer's needs and preferences and their willingness to pay, and applying marketing techniques to meet those needs in a financially sustainable manner. Although regarded as a positive move, its success is heavily dependent on how well water utilities understand their customers. This paper examines existing literature on the determinants of customer willingness to use and pay for improved water services in developing countries. The contribution of past research to our understanding of the behaviour of customers, with regard to service level choice and payment for services, is critically analysed. Basing on this analysis, we develop and discuss a generic model of a water consumer's decision-making process. The model serves two purposes. First, it consolidates past research into a coherent framework to facilitate implementation of the marketing approach. Secondly, we use the model to identify critical customer information that water utility managers need to know in order to be customer-focused.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A brackish water source containing high magnesium concentration (333 mg/L as CaCO3) for reverse osmosis (RO) was studied for silica scaling. Threshold limit for RO recovery and required silica removal were firstly determined by a removal–saturation–recovery curve. Three different ratios of lime/soda ash combination were used to test the efficiency of silica removal as well as the impact of calcium and magnesium. Higher pH was more effective for silica removal due to electrostatic attraction since H3SiO−4 and H2SiO−24 were dominant when pH &amp;gt;9.9. The precipitation of Mg(OH)2(s) has assisted more for silica removal than that of CaCO3(s) and the ratio of 0.044 mg SiO2/mg Mg(OH)2(s) and 0.027 mg SiO2/mg CaCO3(s) were statistically determined. Moreover, the presence of high magnesium causes Mg(OH)2(s) to precipitate at lower pH (9.41) instead of formation of forsterite (Mg2SiO4(s)), which typically occurs at pH &amp;gt;12.3. Therefore, no forsterite was observed and was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Consequently, adsorption is more dominant than chemical reaction in this study. Silica removal was also enhanced by coagulation. With the addition of coagulant (PACl), highest silica removal was achieved at pH of 10, but was decreased when the pH was over 10, due to the amphoteric properties of aluminum hydroxide to reduce the electrostatic attraction to silica at higher pH. Since both softening and coagulation were effective for silica removal, seven decision-making criteria were developed to compare the pros and cons of these two processes.</jats:p>",

The principal component analysis/factor analysis indicated that the parameters responsible for water quality variations are mainly related to discharge and temperature (natural), organic pollution (point sources) in LP areas; organic pollution (point sources) and nutrients (non point sources) in MP areas; and organic pollution and nutrients (point sources) in HP areas. The discriminant analysis showed that six water quality parameters (discharge, temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity and nitrate nitrogen) account for most of the expected temporal variations whereas seven water quality parameters (discharge, temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrate nitrogen and ammonical nitrogen) account for most of the expected spatial variations in surface water quality of Fuji river basin.</jats:p>",

The state is emphasizing tariff reform of the water sector, which is a necessary step in the transition to a market economy, and also an important step for China's wastewater management. With the gradual increase of wastewater service charges, more private investment is attracted to participate, which leads to a decrease in the proportion of direct public investment. This paper develops a model to quantitatively analyse the dependence of private investment on the scale of public investment at different rate levels of wastewater treatment charge. In the meantime, the impacts caused by tax policies on rate level and private sector participation are analysed. In terms of the survey regarding the marketization reform process of the wastewater sector, a summary of the current major public–private partnership (PPP) approaches in China is given in this paper, which reveals that the strategy option also depends on the rate level of the wastewater treatment charge. As a consequence, the government has to keep a greater investment ratio to initiate the market and induct private investment, particularly because the current WWTC rate is at a low level. Furthermore, the BOT-type option is, and still, could be a major form of PPP in China for a while due to the constraint of the current low rate level of the wastewater treatment charge.</jats:p>",

Consequently, the corrosion induced is likely to deteriorate water quality at the consumer's tap. Two different types of treatment methods are commonly used to control the corrosion effects of soft waters: (i) the addition of phosphate corrosion inhibitors, and (ii) the remineralisation process. In order to facilitate the decision making of network operator to use suitable treatment methods, a comparative pilot-scale experiment was performed. The above two treatment strategies were tested using pipes representing both drinking water distribution systems (used materials: cast iron and steel) and household plumbing systems (used material: copper). The impact of the two techniques was assessed by means of water quality monitoring (pH, metal leaching, etc) and of corrosion measurements using electrochemical probes as well as weight-loss coupons. The results obtained after a 15 month long experiment showed that remineralisation method was clearly the most effective way to control soft water corrosion. The implementation of this method resulted in a 50% reduction in metals leaching and about 40% decrease in iron corrosion rates.</jats:p>",

In order to overcome the numerical difficulties associated with the resulting large‐scale stochastic mixed‐integer‐linear‐programming (MILP) problem, an approximation strategy comprising two steps, and based on the resolution of a set of deterministic and two‐stage stochastic models is presented. The performance of the proposed strategy regarding computation time and optimality gap is studied through comparison with other traditional approaches that address optimization under uncertainty. Results indicate that the proposed strategy provides better solutions than stand‐alone two‐stage stochastic programming and two‐stage shrinking‐horizon algorithms for similar computational efforts and incurs much lower computation times than the rigorous multistage stochastic model. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The ISO 9000 series of quality management systems standards is widely diffused, with more than 560,000 sites certified in 152 countries as of December 2003. Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement “supply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000” into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country’s management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000. </jats:p>",

The cost equivalency point is essentially the ‘breakeven’ allowable cost for implementing DOT-Net strategy as an alternative to upgrading a central treatment facility to ‘pretreat’ water sufficiently to manage quality degradation within a potable water distribution network. For the purposes of the analysis presented, water quality is assumed to degrade linearly with time as it flows through the distribution network. Disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, selected as a representative water quality degradation parameter, was modeled to predict service population DBP exposure and resulting cost of centralized treatment plant upgrades to meet water quality goals. The equivalency point was determined by apportioning the anticipated cost for upgrading the centralized treatment facilities over the fraction of service connections receiving deficient quality water. Both concentration of DBP precursor material and service population size are found to have limited impact on the equivalency point of a distributed treatment unit. The advantages and disadvantages of various treatment methods available for in-network water treatment are outlined and the ancillary functional requirements of the distributed treatment unit are delineated.</jats:p>",

The result indicated that the water solubility of aluminium increases as water temperature or pH increases. In addition, it was calculated from this solubility curve of aluminium in water, that the level of residual aluminium in purified water can be controlled at approx. 0.04–0.05 mg/L by adjusting pH of coagulated water to approx. 7.1–7.4 depending on water temperature. Furthermore, as a result of pH control according to actual coagulated water temperatures based on this assumption, it was demonstrated that the target value for aluminium control in purified water, (0.05 mg/L) is achievable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application of nanofiltration is growing rapidly in drinking water and wastewater treatment. The main problem during the operation of nanofiltration membranes is membrane fouling, part of which is due to the presence of Natural Organic Matter (NOM) in sources for drinking water. In this work the effect of calcium was investigated on the nanofiltration fouling behavior in relation to NOM. From Li and Elimelech (2004) it is known that calcium enhanced membrane fouling significantly due to the formation of calcium-NOM complexes. Two techniques were used in our research to determine the part of calcium which is complexated by NOM and the free calcium ion in solution. Results showed that a minimum calcium concentration and a minimum NOM concentration were required for calcium-NOM complex formation. Furthermore, the influence of the calcium concentration on the flux decline during nanofiltration experiments was investigated for different types of feed water. The observed flux decline was proven to be only caused by NOM fouling rather than other membrane fouling types, such as biofouling, scaling or particulate fouling. Fouling of nanofiltration membranes was related to the calcium content in the feed water, and more specifically to the calcium-NOM complex concentration. Membrane cleaning with SDS was found to be very effective.</jats:p>",

It is difficult to optimize a water treatment system in winter in north China, since the characteristics of raw water are very complicated and change widely by seasons. In this paper, a systematic study of optimizing operating rules of water treatment plants in north China is presented, with the method of analysing a large number of plant data from one northern waterworks. The plant data collected from this water plant is studied with statistic methods, divided into 10 groups and statistical probability of the plant data calculated to determine the influence of optimum operating conditions. From this study, it was found that two direction figures of coagulant dosage and optimum settled water turbidity were determined. According to these two figures, the practice aim of optimum settled water turbidity, which will lead to qualified finished water and low operating costs can be ensured through the direction figure of the optimum settled water turbidity, and then the dosage of coagulation chemicals and coagulant aids will be decided by the direction figure of the coagulant dosage. The results demonstrate that the method can be applied for an estimate quantitative analyses of optimum conditions of a water treatment system.</jats:p>",

We developed a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and supporting heuristics for optimizing IBM’s semiconductor supply chain. We designed three heuristics, driven by practical applications, for capturing the discrete aspects of the MIP. We leverage the model structure to overcome computational hurdles resulting from the large-scale problem.

The one and a half year pilot MF operation had two objectives: stable production of the flow rate of 5 m3/h and acceptable water quality (SDI less than 3). The pilot plant operation revealed that the MF system successfully produced the target flow rate despite red-tide contamination of the seawater. The average flow rate of 5.2 m3/h was obtained at the average operating pressure of 0.53 bar. However, the MF system failed to achieve the target flow rate at red-tide bloom. When red-tide bloom occurred the chlorophyll-a concentration became 136 mg/m3, the flow rate decreased to half of the target, and energy consumption became extremely high. Subsequently, the operation was stopped. According to the relationship between the flow rate of the MF system and chlorophyll-a concentration developed in this study, it would be desirable to stop the MF operation at chlorophyll-a concentration of 57 mg/m3. The MF system produced acceptable quality water for RO feeding. The SDI of the MF treated was consistently less than 3. The MF system consumed 0.5 KWh of energy to produce 1 m3/h of MF treated, if the data during the red-tide bloom were excluded. Extra equipment (intake pump, control system, monitoring system, air conditioner) caused higher energy consumption than expected.</jats:p>",

It was suggested that organic matter in the molecular weight ranges 300–2,000 and 20,000–40,000 Daltons were mainly responsible for the fouling. The fouling was greater for hydrophobic than hydrophilic membranes. ATR-FTIR analysis of the fouled hydrophobic membranes indicated that aliphatic amide and alcoholic compounds as well as polysaccharides contributed to significant membrane fouling. These adsorptive foulants are considered as neutral fractions present in hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM components. In the case of similar hydrophilic fractions, water precoagulated with a high hydrophobic content resulted in greater flux decline, which was presumed to be due to the organic matter with neutral properties contained within the hydrophobic fraction. The relative concentrations of each NOM fraction in coagulated water are important.

We confine ourselves to two-echelon supply chains with a single supplier servicing a network of retailers who compete with each other by selecting sales quantities. We identify a key sufficient condition, in terms of interdependencies between chain members' operational decisions, under which perfect coordination via simple schemes is feasible, under general cost and demand functions. This condition, which we refer to as echelon operational autonomy (EOA), states that the costs incurred by the supplier for a given vector of sales volumes depends only on operational decisions she controls herself. At the same time, the costs incurred by the retailers may depend on operational decisions controlled by the supplier, in which case, the supplier's operational decisions are made to minimize chainwide costs. We show how vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships create EOA and compare the resulting coordinating pricing schemes with those required in a traditional decentralized setting (without EOA). We also discuss compliance issues with the coordinating schemes in view of the Robinson-Patman act and provide remedies to overcome these issues. </jats:p>",

The supply chain is modeled as a single-input, single-output control system driven by arbitrary customer demands. The authors derive robust analytical conditions to predict the presence of the bullwhip effect and bound its magnitude, based only on the way inventories are managed. These results hold independently of the customer demand. The authors also characterize the stream of orders placed at any stage of the chain when the customer demand process is known and ergodic and give an exact formula for the variance of the orders placed. This formula generalizes existing results by broadening the class of inventory replenishment policies and customer demand processes to which it applies. The authors also show that the bullwhip effect can be mitigated by introducing commitments for future orders into the ordering policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> False failure returns are products that are returned by consumers to retailers with no functional or cosmetic defect. The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial. </jats:p>",

The effects of pH value, H2O2 dose and the inhibitor or accelerant of •OH on the removal rate of NB were studied. H2O2 could obviously improve the ozonation decay rate of NB below pH 7. When H2O2 dose increased from 1.0 mg/L to 4.0 mg/L, the removal rate of NB was remarkably enhanced. However, as H2O2 dose increased from 4.0 mg/L to 20 mg/L, the removal efficiency of NB decreased. Different masses of H2O2 were yielded in different reaction phases of the single ozonation system. Both single ozonation systems and H2O2-catalysed ozonation could not observably reduce the TOC. During the process of NB degradation, organonitrogen was almost completely converted to nitrate and the pH value reduced significantly. Results of HPLC-MS and GC-MS showed that the main intermediate products were phenolic compounds and carbonyl compounds. Finally, a possible reaction pathway of the catalytic ozonation of NB is proposed. It had been found that the catalytic ozonation of NB could be divided into two steps. First, hydroxyl radical attacked phenyl ring, and then the ring opened, forming into various aliphatic compounds or being mineralized to inorganic compounds.</jats:p>",

In view of our results so far achieved, a significant difference was observed between MAP and MAP-P (potential MAP), while little difference was observed between AOC and AOC-P (potential AOC) for raw and pre-chlorinated waters, suggesting that organic carbon limits microbial growth instead of phosphorus. Conventional treatment processes poorly removed AOC-P (42.8%), since the AOC, which was mainly related to the small-molecular DOC, was hardly removed by conventional processes. Oxidants such as chlorine and ozone increased both of the AOC (AOC-P) and MAP (MAP-P), particularly ozone having the stronger oxidation power resulted in a larger increase.

The aim of this study was to investigate flux, recovery, and DOC retention performance and to determine optimum operating conditions of NGK's ceramic membrane filtration system with special regards to economical aspects. Temporarily, the performance of the ceramic membrane was challenged under adverse conditions. During pilot plant operation river water with turbidities between 3 and 100 FNU was treated. Membrane flux was increased stepwise from 80–300 l/m2h resulting in recoveries between 95.9 and 98.9%. A DOC removal between about 20–35% was achieved. The pilot study and the subsequent economical evaluation showed the potential to provide a reliable and cost competitive process option for water treatment. The robustness of the ceramic membrane filtration process makes it attractive for a broad range of water treatment applications and, due to low maintenance requirements, also suitable for drinking water treatment in developing countries.</jats:p>",

The latter are becoming marine attractions in their own right, which has implications for the Department of Conservation drive to protect 10% of New Zealand waters as marine parks by 2010.

In instances where EMSs enhance an organization's environmental performance, critics argue that improvements are likely to occur within the organization's operational boundaries rather than being extended throughout the supply chain. However, previous research suggests that the organizational capabilities required to adopt an EMS may facilitate GSCM implementation and the institutional pressures to adopt both management practices are similar. Consequently, EMS adopters may have a greater propensity to expand their focus beyond their organizational boundaries and utilize GSCM practices to minimize system‐wide environmental impacts.

In the dead-end mode, without having any  discharged gas, the impurities could remain inside the cell.  Moreover, the externally supplied water and diffused water from  the cathode can be accumulated in the channel, which blocks the  flow path. The flow-through mode can prevent the problem by  letting the excess hydrogen flow through the anode free into  the atmosphere, but the waste of fuel is inevitable. The anodic  recirculation may help the removal of the accumulated water  with additional power consumption for the recirculation pump. In this study, the performance characteristics of a PEFC were  investigated according to the anodic supply mode. The anodic  supply mode tested in this study included the dead-end, the  flow-through, and the recirculation mode. The efficiency of the  system in accordance with the anodic supplied mode was also  estimated.</jats:p>",

Discolouration problems can occur, especially in distribution systems with a low flow rate. Until now, particulate water quality in the distribution network has been mainly monitored by measuring the turbidity. However, as turbidity is an indirect measurement method, it does not give quantitative and qualitative information about the water quality, and therefore a more advanced approach was used in this research. Several particle counters have been used simultaneously to measure the particulate water quality at different locations in a transportation system. It was found that larger particles were present further away from the treatment location, although these sized particles were not present directly after treatment. The particulate water quality in the transportation system was also assessed by filtering time integrated large volume water samples. Both organic and inorganic measurements were used to characterise the particle composition. The results of the analysis show that the particulate water quality changed in the transportation system.</jats:p>",

To test the generality of these results we used a DNA marker technique to determine the sex ratio in broods of Tawny Owls in Danish deciduous woodland during two years of ample food supply (rodent population outbreak) and two years of poor food supply. Of 268 nestlings, 59% were males (95% CI: 53–65%). This proportion was higher than previously reported for the species (49% in Northumberland, UK, and 52% in Hungary), but consistent with Fisherian sex allocation, which predicts a male bias of <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 57% based on inferred differences in energy requirements of male and female chicks. Contrary to previous results, brood sex ratios were not correlated with the resource abundance during the breeding seasons, despite considerable variation in breeding frequency, brood size or hatching date across years. Brood sex ratios were unaffected by brood reduction prior to DNA sampling, and nestling mortality rates after DNA sampling were not related to gender. The inconsistency between the sex ratio allocation patterns in our study and previous investigations suggests that adaptive sex allocation strategies differ across populations. These differences may relate to reproductive constraints in our population, where reproductive decisions seem primarily to concern whether to lay eggs at all, rather than adjust the sex ratio to differences in starvation risk of nestlings.</jats:p>",

This strategic shift in the locus of corporate power has arisen out of two conjoined phenomena: first, the logistical integration made possible and necessary by the revolution in information/transportation technology (bar codes, data storage, containerization, global communications), and second, the neoliberal transformation of the worldwide political economy, which in the US has facilitated the massive expansion of a low-wage, import dependent retail sector, while in coastal China it has generated a huge export-manufacturing boom. But the global supply chain linking Guangdong Province to Bentonville, Arkansas may well be an increasingly fragile one, because the proletarianization of tens of millions of Chinese peasants is unlikely to go smoothly, especially under conditions of authoritarian governance.</jats:p>",

Algae cells and AOM were analyzed by photomicrography, particle size distribution, UV absorbance scanning, HPSEC-UV and batch ultrafiltration (UF). Micrographs and particle size distribution of algae cells with or without ozonation showed that ozonation could oxidize chlorophyll in algae cells, damage algae cells to varying degrees and increase the settling property of algae cells. UV absorbance scanning showed there were more protein-like substances in AOM. Molecular weight (MW) distribution revealed that IOM and EOM had almost the same species of organic matter: the major species of IOM was organic matter with high MW and EOM was organic matter with lower MW. Overall, preozonation can enhance the coagulation process by greatly increasing the removal efficiency of algae cells and particles. At the same time, preozonation is not very effective on enhancing AOM removal, for it is limited in improving the removal rate of EOM, and it can cause the release of IOM.</jats:p>",

The influence of molecular size distribution on the mean pore size and pore density of membrane was then evaluated with the model of membrane structure parameter. The results showed: (1) after different pretreatments, the AMWD of raw water changed, coagulation could effectively remove high molecular weight organics, PAC adsorption was effective in removing low molecular weight organics, due to ozonization and PAC adsorption and O3-PAC pretreatment could remove both high molecular weight and low molecular weight organics; (2) the AMWD had great influence on membrane permeation, after different pretreatments, the AMWD of raw water changed and the variation of membrane permeation was also different; (3) the influence factors a1and a2 of the mean pore size and the membrane pore density of different pretreatment water samples were used as indexes which calculated through experiment and the model of membrane structure parameter. The influence of AMWD in water samples on the membrane mean pore size and pore density were then evaluated, which showed that low molecular weight organics could easily cause interior adsorption, and high molecular weight organics could easily cause membrane surface blocking.</jats:p>",

We conducted a microcosm experiment to evaluate the effect of simultaneous changes in [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>], nutrient heterogeneity (NH), nutrient availability (NA) and species evenness on the biomass and nutrient uptake patterns of assemblages formed by<jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Plantago lanceolata</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Holcus lanatus</jats:italic>. When the nutrients were heterogeneously supplied, assemblages exhibited precise root foraging patterns, and had higher above‐ and belowground biomass (average increases of 32% and 29% for above‐ and belowground biomass, respectively). Nutrient heterogeneity also modulated the effects of NA on biomass production, complementarity in nitrogen uptake and below: aboveground ratio, as well as those of [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] on the nutrient use efficiency at the assemblage level.

In this context, information has emerged as the most important asset to create competitive advantage. Thus availability of correct and timely information to all the partners of supply chain is an imperative achieved through the adoption of the latest IT tools. But along with the advantages of IT enablement, there are also risks which, if not tackled properly, can bring the whole supply chain to a halt. The purpose of this paper is to understand various information risks from a supply chain perspective. Case study method is applied to three small and medium enterprises (SMEs) clusters in India to understand how these information risks could impact the supply chain. Further using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM,) a hierarchy of enablers for information risks mitigation is developed. This helps focus on those areas that are most effective for minimizing information risks in a supply chain. </jats:p>",

Using xCT overexpression and underexpression, we present evidence that xCT-dependent glutathione production modulates both neuroprotection from oxidative stress and cell proliferation. In embryonic and adult rat brain, xCT protein was enriched at the CSF–brain barrier (i.e., meninges) and also expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. To examine the neuroprotective role of xCT, various non-neuronal cell types (astrocytes, meningeal cells, and peripheral fibroblasts) were cocultured with immature cortical neurons and exposed to oxidative glutamate toxicity, a model involving glutathione depletion. Cultured meningeal cells, which naturally maintain high xCT expression, were more neuroprotective than astrocytes. Selective xCT overexpression in astrocytes was sufficient to enhance glutathione synthesis/release and confer potent glutathione-dependent neuroprotection from oxidative stress. Moreover, normally nonprotective fibroblasts could be re-engineered to be neuroprotective with ectopic xCT overexpression indicating that xCT is a key step in the pathway to glutathione synthesis. Conversely, astrocytes and meningeal cells derived from sut/sut mice (xCT loss-of-function mutants) showed greatly reduced proliferation in culture attributable to increased oxidative stress and thiol deficiency, because growth could be rescued by the thiol-donor β-mercaptoethanol. Strikingly, sut/sut mice developed brain atrophy by early adulthood, exhibiting ventricular enlargement, thinning of the cortex, and shrinkage of the striatum. Our results indicate that xCT can provide neuroprotection by enhancing glutathione export from non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes and meningeal cells.

Like all vestimentiferans, L. luymesi obtains its nutrition from sulfide-oxidizing endosymbiotic bacteria, which it houses in an internal organ called the trophosome. This tubeworm has a lifespan of over 170 years and its survival is contingent upon the availability of sulfide during this long period. In sediments underlying L. luymesi aggregations, microbes produce sulfide by coupling sulfate reduction with hydrocarbon oxidation. L. luymesi acquires sulfide from the sediment using a root-like posterior extension of its body that is buried in the sediment. Its symbionts then oxidize the sulfide to produce energy for carbon fixation, and release sulfate and hydrogen ions as byproducts. It is critical for the tubeworm to eliminate these waste ions, and it could do so either across its vascular plume or across its root. In this study, we measured sulfate and proton elimination rates from live L. luymesi and found that they eliminated approximately 85% of the sulfate produced by sulfide oxidation, and approximately 67% of the protons produced by various metabolic processes, across their roots. On the basis of experiments using membrane transport inhibitors, we suggest that L. luymesi has anion exchangers that mediate sulfate elimination coupled with bicarbonate uptake. Roots could be the ideal exchange surface for eliminating sulfate and hydrogen ions for two reasons. First, these ions might be eliminated across the root epithelium using facilitated diffusion, which is energetically economical. Second, sulfate and hydrogen ions are substrates for bacterial sulfate reduction, and supplying these ions into the sediment might help ensure a sustained sulfide supply for L. luymesi over its entire lifespan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The goal of this study is to develop a theoretical framework for the study of decision makers within supply chains. Decision makers may compensate inappropriately by overstocking or overestimating lead times resulting in greater inventory costs. By leveraging the knowledge associated with risk compensation, better accountability of logistics and inventory holding costs can be achieved. Although there are conflicting views on risk compensation, the theory does provide insights into the complexities facing the decision maker in supply chain environments. More specifically, there has been relatively little research examining how human factors issues impact the supply chains' effectiveness. The risk compensation framework is tailored to represent and model the inventory management portion of the supply chain and can be validated through experimentation by evaluating the operator's perceived risks. In developing this model, the foundations for extending our knowledge of the human decision making in supply chain management can be established. </jats:p>",

The pilot plant had a capacity of 500 m3/day with a five membrane module and was operated for 1 year to carry out the experiments for the variation of filtration flux, physical cleaning conditions and pre-treatment conditions. Also, an experiment was performed when raw water with high turbidity flowed into the system as well as that pretreated with powdered activated carbon (PAC). When the MF system was operated with filtration flux of 2 m3/m2 day, it could not be operated more than 500 h due to the continuous TMP (Trans-membrane pressure) increase. In case of filtration flux of 1 m3/m2 day, the system could be operated continuously for more than 1300 hours without the increase in the TMP. During this experimentation period, raw water with high turbidity (above 400NTU) was fed into the membrane system. Therefore, the TMP increased by approximately 4.90 kPa compared to the TMP for the previous raw water with lower turbidity. In the case of the PAC pretreated membrane filtration process, the TMP tended to increase slightly. However, the TMP was reduced by performing coagulation and mixing after injecting PAC.</jats:p>",
