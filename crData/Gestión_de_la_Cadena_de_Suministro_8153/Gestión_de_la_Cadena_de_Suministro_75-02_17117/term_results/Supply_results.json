      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper seeks to explain various aspects of labour market activity under oligopsonistic conditions by means of a kinked labour supply curve, the development of which appears to have been neglected in the literature. The ideas for this approach arose out of an ongoing empirical study of a large local labour market during which it became apparent that an extension of the case stated by Bronfenbrenner (1940) could be used to account for a wide range of observed behaviour. It is apparent that dominant employers can dictate conditions in the market even in situations where their concentration of employment is as low as 15–30% of total employment, and at this level one would expect the incidence and effect of oligopsony to be significant within the economy as a whole. Major labour market studies in the U.K. (MacKay et al 1971) and the U.S.A. (Rees and Shultz, 1970) have tended to ignore the consequences of employer interdependence, basically because they were centred on large conurbations. This is an area that may fruitfully be more extensively explored.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective in this paper is to review several theoretical issues associated with fiscal policy and to test these theories via a reduced form real GNP equation using quarterly U.S. data from 1958 through 1966. Theoretical work by Friedman, Holmes and Smith, and others suggest (for different reasons) that fiscal policy may be ineffective. Holmes and Smith point out that increases in taxes may conceivably increase aggregate demand if the demand for money depends on disposable income. Higher taxes shift the IS curve to the left as usual. However, higher taxes reduce disposable income and decrease the demand for money. With a constant money supply, the LM curve shifts to the right and the lower equilibrium interest rate increases aggregate demand. The net effect of the opposite shifts in IS &amp; LM could <jats:italic>conceivably</jats:italic> be an increase in income. Similarly, <jats:italic>lower</jats:italic> taxes may conceivably lower equilibrium income. The argument of Friedman and others runs along different lines. They emphasize that any change in government expenditure or change in taxes may temporarily alter real income, but any “pure” fiscal policy must be accompanied by a change in government debt. The larger debt that accompanies a fiscal expansion raises interest rates and eventually reduces private demand. The fiscal expansion can allegedly “crowd out” private expenditure completely so that the net long run effect on real income is zero.</jats:p>",

It was in this region where 90% of the organochlorine insecticides purchased in the province were applied. In 1969–70 restrictions were placed on DDT and the cyclodiene insecticides. Disappearance of these organochlorine insecticides from milk were studied in surveys conducted in 1970–71 and 1973. The mean ∑DDT levels declined from 0.20 ppm in 1967 to 0.05 ppm in 1973, whereas the mean dieldrin residues declined from 0.044 ppm to 0.015 ppm in the same period. These data include counties where there had been only small reductions in the use of DDT and where milk residues remained unchanged until further restrictions were effected in 1971. Residues of lindane and heptachlor epoxide were virtually absent from milk fat. Chlordane, endosulfan, methoxychlor and endrin were absent from all samples in spite of increasing quantities being used of the first two insecticides. Residues of polychlorinated biphenyls appeared slightly higher in the 1973 survey than in the 1970–71 survey. Hexachlorobenzene was present at very low levels in the 1973 survey.</jats:p>",

The general diffusion field equation presented in this paper takes into account that substrate consumption decreases in the unsaturated region of cancer cell glycolysis and respiration so that - compared to former computations - the critical supply radii needed for maintained proliferation increase by a factor of almost 1.8. With the aid of its general solution and the discussed parameters, the laws governing substrate supply, cell kinetics and therapy mechanisms in the intercapillary region of intact and treated tumour tissue are presented and discussed. The essential results there are as follows: - Even in case of hyperglycemia it is glucose supply (and not the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply) which determines proliferation and proliferation rate. - Under the conditions of longtime-hyperglycemia (400 mg%), the tumour volume being accessible to the attack of cancerostatica or radiation, is almost three times as high as under standard conditions. - For glucose (and cancerostatica) the time constant for interactions between circulation and tumour tissue near the necrotic region is equal to or greater than 400 min. This is why stimulation of cancer cell glycolysis in the most therapy-resistant cancer cell portions (i. e., increased proliferation rate and tumour hyperacidifica­ tion) can only be achieved if hyperglycemia is maintained for 24 hours or more. - Therapeuti­ cally treated cancer tissue is characterized by the discussed changes in the diffusion field of glucose and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as well as a drop in the interaction time constant for glucose.</jats:p>",
