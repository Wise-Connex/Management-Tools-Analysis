This dual program, otherwise known as the “Thailand Decade Plan,” will be initiated in 1985 and will continue until the end of 1991.

Considering the attitudes and economic status of the Thai rural people, the proposed strategies for the implementation of the sanitation program will be the provision of material subsidies and/or “revolving funds,” with strong support from such activities as health education, especially for women and children, and the necessary training of personnel. Implementation of the plan will require an investment of approximately Baht 1,792.6 million (roughly U.S.$ 66.4 million).</jats:p>",

The computer model, called MODSIMR, is capable of simulating complex river basin morphology while incorporating a relational data base management system for efficiently accessing prioritized water rights. Program MODSIMR is a generalized model designed to be applicable to a wide variety of river basins operating under an appropriative water rights system. As a demonstration of its usage, MODSIMR was applied to the Rio Grande Basin of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas for predicting allocation and use of increased runoff from simulated silvicultural activities on the Rio Grande National Forest. Results indicate that under the current institutional framework, increased runoff would primarily be allocated to agricultural users in Colorado. Computer results also showed the potential value to Colorado of the Closed Basin Project in the San Luis Valley and the possibility of determining optimal pumping schemes for the Project using MODSIMR. Program MODSIMR will be useful in future economic studies to determine the benefits of the augmented water supply under various water use scenarios.</jats:p>",

The CDP-choline: 1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase in permeabilized cells showed a K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> of 88 μM for CDP-choline. A similar K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> value of 104 μM was found for cholinephosphotransferase in microsomes isolated from HeLa cells when assayed in the presence of 2.4 mM dioleoylglycerol. In the absence of added diacylglycerol, the K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> for CDP-choline for the microsomal cholinephosphotransferase was only 38 μM. The incorporation of [methyl-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]CDP-choline into phosphatidylcholine was stimulated by the supply of diacylglycerol in both HeLa cells and isolated microsomes. A 2.4 mM dioleoylglycerol suspension increased cholinephosphotransferase activity fourfold in microsomes. The digitonin-treated cells were impermeable to the dioleoylglycerol suspension. Incubation of permeabilized cells with 150 μM acyl-CoA and 0.8 mM glycero-3-phosphate tripled cellular diacylglycerol levels, causing a doubling in the rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. A similar incubation of microsomes with acyl-CoA stimulated phosphatidylcholine synthesis twofold. Furthermore, incubation of microsomes with [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]diacylglycerol and [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]CDP-choline showed that both of the substrates were incorporated into phosphatidylcholine at the same rate. This result suggests that the stimulatory effects on cholinephosphotransferase arise from increases in the availability of substrates rather than activation of the enzyme. These results suggest that both in the permeabilized cells and in isolated membranes, the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine can be limited by both CDP-choline and diacylglycerol. </jats:p>",

Blanca) from May to late August to examine the effect of forage species and season on nutrient digestion and supply. Within each forage species, two daily allowances of forage (i.e. 30 and 60 g dry matter (DM)/kg live weight) were given, and nutrient flow into the small intestine was measured on thirteen separate occasions (viz. seven grasses and six clovers).</jats:p><jats:p>2. Total nitrogen content of the grasses varied between 28 (early season), 19 (mid-) and 33 (late) g/kg DM, whilst the clovers showed a much narrower range and all values were higher (39–45 g/kg DM). In vitro organic matter (OM) digestibilities of plucked samples ranged from 742 to 809 g/kg OM (grass) and 712 to 790 g/kg OM (clover), the lowest values being noted in late June (grass) and mid-July (clover).</jats:p><jats:p>3. OM intakes calculated from estimated faecal OM output (using unlabelled ruthenium) and predicted OM digestibility of the consumed forage indicated mean values of 20.9 (grass) and 26.0 (clover) g/kg live weight ( P &lt;0.001), whilst the higher forage allowances increased OM intake by approximately 8% on both grass and clover (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the low allowance. OM intake was significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) lower on the two primary growths of grass examined in May (mean 16.8g/kg live weight) than the other five grass diets.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Rumen molar propionate levels declined with season but were at all times higher on the grass than on the clover diets, whilst acetate levels were unaffected by forage species. Apart from the late-season grass, mean rumen ammonia concentration was less than 100 mg NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N/I on all grass diets, whilst values on the clover diets ranged from 200–350 mg/l.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Daily duodenal OM flows in relation to animal live weight were approximately 20% higher on the clover than on the grass diets (grass 9.2, clover 11.2 g/kg live weight, P &lt; 0.001), but estimates of the proportion of digestible OM apparently digested in the rumen were not significantly influenced by forage species (grass 0.69, clover 0.71).</jats:p><jats:p>6. Non-NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N (NAN) flow to the small intestine varied from 0.41 to 0.76 g/kg live weight on the grass diets in response to season and forage allowance compared with values of 0.6W.94 g/kg on the clover diets, with the overall forage species effect being statistically (P &lt; 0.001) significant (grass 0.60, clover 0.76 g/kg live weight). In relation to estimated N intakes, however, these findings revealed a considerable loss of N between mouth and duodenum on the clover diets equivalent to approximately 35% of N intake.</jats:p><jats:p>7. A significant regression of NAN flow/unit N intake (NI) (g/g) on N content in the forage OM (g/kg) was obtained for all forages examined: NAN/NI = 1.507–0.0185 [N/OM], residual SD 0.007, r 0.929, indicating that efficiency of utilization of the N in fresh forages in the rumen was more closely related to forage N content than forage species per se.</jats:p>",
