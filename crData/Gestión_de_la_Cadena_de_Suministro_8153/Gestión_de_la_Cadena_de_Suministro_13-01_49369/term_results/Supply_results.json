      "abstract": "<jats:p>Successful implementation of food supply chains in improving the productivity and operational efficiency by some companies made many other firms and researchers courteous about this fast developing field. For successful strategies, organizations in agri-food business are aiming to bring all its stakeholders in close cooperation. The agri-food supply chain aims at optimal warehousing and location design, supply-demand synchronization, checking price variations and ultimately minimizing waste and improving productivity at every stage leveraging Information Technology (IT). This research reviews the supply chain status in agri-food sector, categorizes available literature, assesses the influential articles, and proposes the holistic framework in agri-food supply chain. From the literature review, it is observed that the research articles have addressed agri-food supply chain up to a certain point and confined to the apt ideas of supply projections, demand projections, supply-demand disparity, traceability, collaborations etc. There is a need for extensive research to reconsider warehouse and location design, supply-demand projections and gap analysis, transshipment strategies and traceability in an integrated manner. The present study proposes holistic framework addressing the issues of supply-demand synchronization, warehouse design, transportation optimization, traceability, vertical integration and farmer’s credit facility.</jats:p>"

In examining the connections, which are different from transaction-based connections, this study measures the effects of face-to-face communication, trust, involvement, job title, and sales volume on performance. The hypothesized relationships are mostly supported and provide nuanced insights into relational attributes that affect supply-chain relationships and performance. These attributes are the basis for creating relationship intensity, magnitude, and history, described as collaborative facilitators that can enhance performance. All levels of management have a role to play in how the relational attributes are applied and managed. Senior leadership such as CEOs may need to play a larger role in trust development and involvement maintenance, while mid-level and line managers may need to engage in more face-to-face communication in maintaining trust and collaboration intensity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A wide range of definitions of supply chain management (SCM) have been developed over the last three decades. The philosophy of SCM is based firmly on a recognition that it is only by working in a more integrated manner that competitive advantage can be maximised. However, for this to become a reality the development of common definitions and understandings between supply chain partners is a critical success factor. The corollary of this is that a lack of definitional consistency and a common understanding is an inhibitor to the successful adoption of SCM thinking in practice. This paper reviews a number of definitions of SCM, as well as discussions and analyses of such definitions. This leads to the central point posited in the paper – the need for a ‘unified definition’. Such a definitional construct, labelled the Four Fundamentals of SCM, is proposed with the core of the paper providing a narrative description of this construct based on a wide range of literature.</jats:p>"

This is achieved by standardization of the gathered data and typification of the messages that enable storing and communication of the data. This chapter presents a Web-platform that will be able to support efficiently food traceability by monitoring and administering the data gathered and recorded in a central database.

The chapter reviews 368 articles on empirical research in e-collaboration and supply chain management. It finds the majority of authors are using a combination of the entity of analysis, while still focusing on the firm level rather than the network level. In this, another encouraging fact is that most of the authors prefer to consider a combination of various elements of exchange in their analysis. The potential limitation of the study is that it does not attempt to trace out trends using regression techniques.

Considering supply chain management, the authors believe that it is important to distinguish between a quality of product (also service) offered by producers and service providers and a quality of service which is achieved between any supplier and customer, not only a consumer, along a supply chain. Quality of product represents producer’s/service provider’s commitment and is subject of various quality certificates issued by inspection authorities. This research examines the quality of service, which is provided by a supplier to its customer along the supply chain, between any pair of chain elements fulfilling this relation, including the common retailer-consumer relation. The authors introduce measurement points into a consumer-centric supply chain model for the defined criteria and defined the method of their monitoring and overall supply chain quality of service evaluation. Finally, the authors assess the envisaged impact of the results of their measurements on supply chain excellence, providing management with an opportunity to identify weak spots.</jats:p>"

Other benefits include better visibility resulting from proactive task and process management, and improved risk assessment associated with better data accuracy/quality. In addition, the optimisation of planning and control functions is enhanced through the introduction of key RFID technologies and their integration into logistics systems and operations. Finally, the use of RFID technologies is reviewed in a variety of diverse sectors and areas, from assisting humanitarian efforts through solutions aimed at recovering from the effects of natural disasters to providing accurate and effective methods of recording race times for the Los Angeles marathon.</jats:p>"

Closed loop supply chain model aims at reduction of waste and generating profit for enterprises through integrating forward and reverse logistics. Unfortunately, there is limited research on general models for closed loop supply chains in literature. In this paper, extending and enhancing previous models, a general model is proposed for closed loop supply chains using linear programming. The goal of this study is to minimize the leakage of a closed loop supply chain to avoid waste and reduce SCM costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply network issues recently have attracted a lot of attention from industrial practitioners and academics worldwide. Supply networks are highly complex systems. The oscillations in demand and inventory as orders pass through the system have been widely studied in literature. Studies have shown that supply networks can display some of the key characteristics of chaotic systems. Chaos theory is the study of complex, nonlinear, dynamic systems; therefore it can be useful for studying the dynamics of supply networks. In this paper the authors implemented a system dynamic approach and simulated a chaotic multi-level supply network. The authors analyzed the effects of decision parameters, delivery lead time and shipping lot-size on chaotic behavior of the whole supply network. The simulation revealed that an increment in lead times or shipping lot-size has a similar impact on chaotic behavior of the system and reduces the chance of chaotic behavior occurrence.</jats:p>"

The utilization of cloud-based services in supply chain management leads to financial and operational benefits, while at the same time potential risks and limitations should be taken into account by all supply chain stakeholders. In this chapter, an overview of cloud-based supply chain management is addressed. At first, a brief introduction to cloud technology is provided. Then, the application of cloud computing on supply chain activities is presented, while positive and negative aspects of adapting this technology in modern supply chains are discussed. The case for Third-Party Logistics (3PL) service providers is specially addressed. Finally, conclusions and future research steps are presented.</jats:p>"

This paper develops the compound supply chain efficiency model using variables expressly identified as problem areas encountered by Gabonese supply chains. The compound supply chain efficiency model evaluates the supply chain global efficiency based on the efficiency of reliability, velocity, and cost. It identifies barriers along the supply chain and determines key focus areas for corporations if they want to ameliorate their global efficiency and become more competitive. The compound supply chain efficiency model can either be used to compare various supply chains or it can be used to compare the same supply chain over time to determine if any improvements have been made. The composite supply chain efficiency model can also identify areas of deficiencies along the supply chain. The composite supply chain efficiency model is an efficient and inexpensive model that can be applied to determine if Gabonese supply chains are operating efficiently or not. The results obtained from the compound supply chain efficiency model can help companies and entire supply chains identify areas to focus on to ameliorate their efficiency levels and in so doing make them competitive.</p>",

The chapter’s research starts with a literature review that presents the modern technological solutions for an educational system that can alter the book market’s supply chain. The electronic teaching and reading facilities can reduce costs of production and distribution, but they can also become an ecologically friendly solution to the environmental problems that the world faces today. The statistical analysis of questionnaires has resulted in the Greek ELT market not being willing to change the existing supply chain operations of the ELT sector. Even though the market does not believe that the use of new technologies can result in the replacement of printed books, there is a trend of using them because they provide marketing benefits to their users. This trend can become the reason of a new era within the ELT book market’s supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

Conversely, marketing theorists and practitioners have called for strategies by industry that aims to reduce risk perceptions for successful relationships. However, it is not clear in the literature which perception is more significant; trust or risk and from which perspective. Identification of such factors plays an important role in supply chain design and operation to decide whether the supply chain members should strive to develop trust perceptions or reduce risk perceptions in relationship. This paper has identified the common perspectives of trust and risk perception to address the issue of which perception is more significant from each perspective. Results of a survey of supply chain member’s trust and risk perceptions of the printing and packaging industry in the United Arab Emirates are presented.</jats:p>"

Evidence exists that superior logistics customer service leads to better overall firm performance. Yet mixed findings were observed, and this relationship has been tested across multiple operationalizations and diverse industry settings, which may contribute to these mixed findings. There is thus a need for a systematic analysis that examines all of the prior evidence in an aggregate inquiry of logistics customer service. Meta‐analysis, which is a relatively under‐utilized methodology in supply chain management research, is applied to provide a quantitative examination of 37 sample studies and an assessment of overall population effects. The main contribution of this research is that we statistically aggregate and summarize existing research on logistics customer service. In addition, moderators that affect the relationship between logistics customer service and firm performance are examined. The results provide evidence that logistics customer service has a significant positive relationship with firm performance; however, significant heterogeneity was detected. This points to areas in need of additional research in order to obtain generalizable evidence.</jats:p>",

This has led to the importance of the interorganizational information system (IOS) which has been increasingly recognized by organizations. There are several IOS types, including B2B electronic commerce (EC), customer-oriented strategic systems, EDI and electronic markets. The factors influencing the adoption of these systems are presented in the literature, but the IOS adoption in supply chains with supply chain context specific antecedents is very limited. To fill the gap in the literature, in this study a comprehensive model is built on the foundations of technology adoption at the organizational levels and by examining the supply chain context specific antecedents behind the motivations of adoption of technology in supply chains. The developed TOESCM research framework considers the TOE (technological-organizational-environmental) framework and SCM context specific antecedents such as information sharing, interorganizational relationships, and collaboration among trading partners to determine the adoption of IOS in supply chains.</p>",

Organizations resort to outsourcing, in order to balance the infinite requirements with organisational assets. Supply chains that are relying upon sourced Information Systems (or/and IT) are vulnerable from Information Security (IS) specific types of risks to supply chains. These systems and their components are at increasing risk of supply chain.

In the current research, the ISM has been developed for a leading Indian telecom service provider. The inhibitors in the service supply chain have been identified. Initial reachability matrix and final reachability matrix have been made. In this paper, in addition to the traditional methodology, an attempt to quantify the fuzzy interrelationships has been made. This gave a better representation of the situation than the traditional endeavours, which were based on binary elements. The hierarchy of various inhibitors has been established based on the outcomes of the final reachability matrix. The digraph has been constructed. In order to have a better analysis, the relationships were quantified and plotted. Finally MICMAC analysis has been carried out. The inhibitors have been categorized into four clusters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the domestic businesses expand, many are making the choice to use foreign products, labor, and services to aid in their production. Global supply chains are minimizing the costs of the production process but are also creating vulnerabilities to home countries. As the global economy changes, the competitiveness between countries grows. Competitiveness can affect everything from a country’s economy to how a firm conducts international business. Addressing the need to find a method to increase the United States competitiveness in the world economy by improving the use of global supply chains would help to make domestic firms more successful in the global economy. Studying how companies position themselves abroad is important to providing insight into how to become more competitive. Worldwide companies are diversifying by moving more of their supply chain to international locations. This is providing them with many benefits such as better markets for products, lower costs, and more advanced technologies. As a result, the competitive strategy of companies is to increase production and decrease costs through the most efficient global supply chain. Maximizing the potential of domestic firms’ global supply chains is one of the most effective ways to increase U.S. competitiveness. If more big businesses in the United States are willing to participate on the global level, then the US will be able to improve their competitiveness.</jats:p>"

To do so, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BO</jats:styled-content>ps imports knowledge from a number of fields such as economics, psychology and other social and behavioral sciences. We point out a blind spot in this knowledge: In <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BO</jats:styled-content>ps, the heuristics that people use are typically, although not always, viewed as a liability. The issue with this view is that it does not explain when and in what way heuristics can be an asset. We propose, as a research program for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BO</jats:styled-content>ps, uncovering the conditions under which the heuristics that supply chain managers use are an asset, as well as the conditions under which they are a liability. We briefly discuss some research on heuristics in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BO</jats:styled-content>ps and show how the study of quantitative models of heuristics can complement it.</jats:p>",

The biomass supply system presents unique features that highly impact the bioenergy production. Network functionality, raw material availability (influenced by seasonality, weather/climate conditions, land suitability, and other parameters), and procurement costs constitute important parameters for the viability of bioenergy production plants. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of biomass supply chains, focusing on the special issues of raw material cost fluctuations, biomass seasonality, and the dynamics of biomass demand. It also suggests the effectiveness of a multi-criteria decision making approach for adequately assessing imprecise and uncertain biomass supplier profiles based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFS) in conjunction with a multi-period optimization framework for selecting the best biomass supply mix at a maximum total purchasing value.</jats:p>"

For this study, a complete GDSN supply chain framework was developed as a model for the industry to achieve Global Standard (GS1) standards. Each supply chain member must have a strong enterprise resource planning (ERP) information system to accommodate the initial electronic product code information services (EPCIS). A web-based Datapool—which connects the manufacturer, distributor, and retailer—will assist in reaching the data synchronization stage. The most important step is to have an open standard of GS1 global registry to enable the Epedigree to be traced through the supply chain system. When combined with EPCIS, as well as electronic product code global (EPCglobal) standardization and GS1 Global Registry, the supply chain can achieve global data synchronization and traceability. The comprehensive GDSN framework provided in this study provides the pharmaceutical industry an estimate of the total costs of attaining a global data synchronization network.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our intent with this research is to articulate propositions for coalition building behaviors involving the weaker player in a buyer–supplier relationship. The context of our study begins in dyads, but grows into triads as coalitions are formed. We consider coalition formation arising from power asymmetry in dyadic buyer–supplier relationships. However, when a weaker player pairs up with another player, the context of our study becomes triads (i.e., buyer–supplier–supplier or buyer–buyer–supplier). On the basis of coalition theory, we identify three archetypes and then formulate four coalition conditions under each archetype. Each coalition condition, framed in a supply network triad, constitutes a finding. For instance, we propose that a supplier in a weaker power position in a buyer–supplier–supplier triad would try to create a coalition with another supplier to gain leverage against a common buyer. According to coalition theory, it does not matter whether this new supplier has more or less power compared with the old supplier as long as their coalition collectively yields more power than the buyer. By the same token, two buyers would create a coalition to gain leverage against a common supplier if their coalition collectively yields more power than the supplier. Furthermore, the buyer would create a coalition with a second‐tier supplier if the buyer is in a weaker power position compared with the first‐tier supplier and their coalition would yield more power against the first‐tier supplier. This study marks one of the first attempts at formally theorizing the weaker player in the buyer–supplier relationship. It also marks the first attempt at applying coalition theory to supply chain dynamics and it extends emerging work in supply network triads.</jats:p>",

The research uses i3lab (a Singapore home grown R&amp;D firm) as the case for study and employs interviews of 5 employees at i3lab. The interviews of the employees of i3lab revealed that there were concerns about security and integrity of the information that is being shared with the outsourcing partners, and this leads to an inherent reluctance in sharing sensitive information. The research also includes interviews of employees from three 3 outsourcing partners of i3lab, and it was found that lack of communications and lack of protocols for facilitating the information sharing between the partners were causes of low standardization, loss of quality, and increased costs, due to delays and re-works. There appeared to be a lack of strategic approach and planning to information sharing at different stages of outsourcing supply chain, which led to ad hoc and inadequate communications.</jats:p>"

Much of the development of the water supply system was many decades ahead of its time and helped buffer the city of Melbourne from major diseases, droughts and water shortages.\r\n\r\nThe authors present a chronology of the evolution of the catchment and water supply system pre-1900 to today. They discuss major developments, policies, and construction and management activities. Each chapter is illustrated with historical black and white images as well as newly taken photos that contrast present scenes with those from the past. Chapters also include many fascinating stories of life within the water catchments and working for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.\r\n \r\nFinally, the book includes many extraordinary insights into current and future issues with Melbourne’s water supply, including issues associated with the highly controversial North-South Pipeline and the desalination plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We have developed a linear programming formulation to describe Qatar steel manufacturing supply chain from suppliers to consumers. The purpose of the model is to provide answers regarding the optimal amount of raw materials to be requested from suppliers, the optimal amount of finished products to be delivered to each customer and the optimal inventory level of raw materials. The model is validated and solved using GAMS software. Sensitivity analysis on the proposed model is conducted in order to draw useful conclusions regarding the factors that play the most important role in the efficiency of the supply chain. In the second part of the project, we have set a simulation model to produce a specific set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are developed to characterize the supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness, efficiency, and productivity/utilization. The model is programmed using WITNESS simulation software. The developed QS WITNESS simulation model aims to assess and validate the current status of the supply chain performance in terms of a set of KPIs, taking into consideration the key deterministic and stochastic factors, from suppliers and production plant processes, to distributors and consumers. Finally, a simulated annealing algorithm has been developed that will be used to set model variables to achieve a multi-criteria tradeoff of the defined supply chain KPIs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An increasing number of firms are integrating carbon emission concerns into their operational decision-making. Some of these actions are motivated by individual initiatives towards corporate environmentalism. While some other are driven by environmental regulation pressures. Policies such as carbon caps under the Kyoto Protocol and carbon tax have been introduced in many countries as mechanisms to induce firms to adopt the low carbon society. In this setting, we present a model for analyzing the impact of carbon emission considerations on the coordination between two/or more different business entities. In the absence of carbon emission considerations, channel coordination has been widely studied in the supply chain management literature. It has been shown that both entities are often better off under the coordinated channel. Several mechanisms and contracts have been then studied to settle down such coordination under different scenarios. The purpose of this research is to investigate these traditional (cost driven) results under carbon emissions considerations. In other terms our objective is to illustrate how the incentives for the coordination are affected by the presence of carbon emission firms&amp;#39; concerns. In our initial analysis we consider traditional buyer-vendor coordination by associating carbon emission parameters with ordering and holding decision variables. We examine how the values of these parameters as well as the considered regulatory emission control policies affect cost and emissions. The corresponding carbon emissions are incorporated into the model through the consideration of various regulatory policies that include : (1) strict emission caps: both of the supplier and the buyer are subject to mandatory caps on the amount of carbon they emit, (2) carbon tax policy: the supplier and the buyer are taxed on the amount of emissions they emit and (3) cap and trade system: the supplier and the buyer are subject to carbon caps but are rewarded /penalized for emitting less/more than their caps. Under carbon emission considerations, the centralized solution remains profit-optimal but not necessarily emission-optimal. This means that the joint profit is often increased when the channel is coordinated. However, the amount of total carbon emissions may be higher than what could be emitted by the retailer and the supplier when they work individually. We identify conditions on cost and emission parameters under which the joint policy is both profit and emission optimal. We also show that the outcome of the coordination is very sensitive to the type of the regulatory policy, for instance some policies are providing greater incentives than others for coordination.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to the propositions in the information processing theory, this study tests the relationship between task uncertainty and three organizational design strategies, i.e., creation of lateral relationships, investment in information systems, and creation of self-contained tasks. Data from 125 North American manufacturing firms are used and business environment uncertainty is employed to measure task uncertainty. Sourcing practice and delivery practice measure the creation of lateral relationships, while Information quality measures the investment in information systems. Also, just-in-time production and human resource management measure the creation of self-contained tasks. Regression analysis shows that business environment uncertainty has significant positive influence on sourcing practice, delivery practice, information quality, just-in-time production, and human resource management. While the information processing theory was proposed more than thirty years ago, this study empirically extends the relevance of information processing theory to today’s supply chain environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The strategic importance of supply chain management has been increasing during the past two decades. Companies utilise the supply chain in order to become more competitive as a whole. Recently, it has been observed that environmental and social pressures and standards have a direct and indirect impact on supply chain management and the competitiveness of corporations. Integrating environmental criteria into supply chain management has become an important strategic issue for many companies. This study explores the subject area of the greening of supply chain management. In particular, the supply chain environmental management (SCEM) programme is explored in the Korean context. The SCEM programme is based upon the relationship between buyers and suppliers. By utilising this relationship, general improvement in the environmental performance of suppliers can be achieved. A case study of Hyundai Motors Co. (HMC) empirically supports this. Green supply chain management led to new ways of collaboration with suppliers, in terms of developing environmental solutions and capacity buildings with key suppliers. The key implication for suppliers, in particular SMEs, is to develop suppliers’ capabilities and increasing supplier criticality in order to achieve win-win outcomes in environmental and financial performance.</jats:p>"

One type of push-pull production control can be implemented by controlling only the last stage during part withdrawals to trigger the production at the first stage. While the final stage is operated according to a pull mechanism, intermediate stages are operated according to a push system of control in order to keep the work-in-process (WIP) at a constant level. Since the WIP levels are limited in hybrid systems, production output rate is very susceptible to equipment failures. In order to establish suitable WIP capacities between the stages of production, it is essential to analyze the production line using appropriate models and tools. This paper develops a discrete iterative model to study and analyze behavior of a push-pull system with unreliable equipment at any stage. The model is utilized to optimize WIP capacities at intermediate stages and number of kanbans at the last stage. Furthermore, an experimental design is set up to analyze effects of various maintenance policies, line design parameters, and operational factors on line performance measures by using simulation results from the model.</jats:p>"

In the following article the bullwhip effect is quantified for each part of the supply chain which is presupposed to consist of a producer, a wholesaler, a retailer, and a consumer. After considering the causes of the bullwhip effect, it will be shown with the help of a nonlinear optimization model to what extent the bullwhip effect can be reduced using vendor-managed inventory (VMI) as one concept of Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR). In contrast to other studies in this field the reduction of the bullwhip effect will be accurately quantified for each part of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The current ratio of the parallel circuits can be set arbitrarily. Precise adjustment of output current and improvement of efficiency are realized by width modulation and synchronous buck-topology switching power supply, the output current error is smaller than 20mA and DC-DC conversion efficiency is up to 90%; to make output voltage error smaller than 30 mV and the current-sharing error smaller than 0.5%, digital calibration technology and PID control algorithm are used. In addition, this system is equipped with the function of overload protection, double-source redundant heat standby and turn-off, etc.</jats:p>"

The “demand and supply” metaphor is borrowed from economics. Demand refers to the potential in a society for protest; supply refers to the opportunities staged by organizers to protest. Mobilization brings a demand for political protest that exists in a society together with a supply of opportunities to take part in such protest. The demand side of participation requires studies of such phenomena as socialization, grievance formation, causal attribution, and the formation of collective identity. The study of the supply side of participation concerns such matters as action repertoires, the effectiveness of social movements, the frames and ideologies movements stand for, and the constituents of identification they offer. Mobilization is the process that brings demand and supply together. Mobilization is the marketing mechanism of the social movement domain, and thus, the study of mobilization concerns such matters as the effectiveness of (persuasive) communication, the influence of social networks, and the perceived costs and benefits of participation.</jats:p>"

The TTVRP uses solutions of preceding optimization problems as input that are obtained with standard solver software. The presented methods differ with respect to the considered neighborhood and the static or dynamic setting of their parameters. They are verified with real life data in extensive numerical studies and compared to the results obtained with the solver software Xpress. It is shown that the methods are capable to generate good solutions in reasonable computing time.</jats:p>"

Based on the traditional logistics model for academic knowledge, knowledge creation and delivery are discussed. A new framework of an optimized supply chain for ‘knowledge products’ is developed. A semi-structured interview was undertaken to capture and analyze the knowledge logistics in a traditional publishing setup. Findings include the illustration of a new optimized supply chain for the manufacturing and distribution of ‘knowledge products’. Realised benefits are discussed showing a significant reduction in total supply chain processing. Research in this domain involves the actual knowledge creators (publishing companies). Connecting knowledge delivery systems to the supplier presents challenges including information sharing and openness to accessing their systems. More challenges are discussed with implications, primarily related to commitment, partnership and re-engineering of present systems. Publishing companies still follow the same traditional supply chain for knowledge creation. They have moved towards custom publishing, but their processes remain practically the same. Publishing companies have to change their mindsets and re-engineer their processes.</jats:p>"

It is based on the findings of a survey that examined the Web presence of 3PL companies in Greece. Thus, the websites of these companies were contacted and evaluated against a specific questionnaire that consists of two main categories of questions: the scope of logistics services which 3PLs provide, and the Internet practices and technologies that the examined companies use in order to support the identified logistics services. The findings of the survey reveal the effort that 3PL companies in Greece have applied in order to effectively and efficiently support their provided services via the Internet. Furthermore, they support the belief that adaptation and application of the Internet best practices and innovative technologies turns out to be beneficial for all the parties involved in the examined business sector.</jats:p>"

Seamless data communication in all phases of the product development process is a prerequisite for cost-optimal and successful collaboration processes. Automotive suppliers that develop system components for a number of different OEMs or tier-1 suppliers face the challenge of ensuring that they make the CAD data available in the format required by their customers and with a high level of reliability and, if data translation is involved, that they take the system configuration of the respective customer into consideration. The main obstacle in this process chain is the insufficient data quality.

We determine the retailer’s optimal ordering policy and the main supplier’s production quantity that maximize expected profit of the centralized supply chain. We also analyze the decentralized scenario, and a combination of overproduction risk sharing and buy-back contracts with a side payment from/to the backup supplier is provided to coordinate the supply chain. Numerical examples are given to gain some qualitative insights.</jats:p>"

Vajda and Buttyan (VB) proposed a lightweight RFID authentication protocol, called XOR. Defend, Fu, and Juels (DFJ) analyzed it and proposed repeated keys and nibble attacks to the protocol. In this paper, we identify the source of vulnerability within VB’s original successive session key permutation algorithm. We propose three improvements, namely removing bad shuffles, hopping the runs, and authenticating mutually, to prevent DFJ’s attacks, thereby significantly strengthening the security of the protocol without introducing extra resource cost.</jats:p>"

The second part empirically examines the vertical integration level of 144 sustainability-focused companies in 9 different industries. The results demonstrate that sustainability-focused companies in the Health Care Industry and the Industrials Industry tend to have more vertically integrated organizational structures than their industry competitors that are not pursuing such a strategy since these two industries are production oriented and they have closer relationships with their suppliers. There was no significant difference in the vertical integration level of sustainability-focused versus non-sustainability-focused companies for the other seven industries studied. Research shows the linkage between environmental strategies and vertical integration has not been thoroughly examined. This study’s results are useful to researchers and managers who are interested in corporate sustainability behavior.</jats:p>"

Many organisations are beginning to consider the merits of moving to a tax-efficient supply chain and procurement model, both through sourcing from a low-cost country and also centralising purchasing and supply operations in a tax-efficient location.\nTax-efficient sourcing integrates supply chain and procurement-operating model design with tax planning to deliver significant cost reductions and profit increases through centrally controlling procurement operations. The consideration of the most efficient tax structures to support sourcing and distribution of equipment also delivers.\nCentrally controlled strategic and tactical supply chain and procurement operations in a tax-efficient location support an organisation in:\n\nrealising benefits through leveraging scale in operations and procurement;\ndesigning a flexible framework that can be used to decide which categories of spending are managed globally, regionally, and locally;and,\nthe acceleration and sustainability of significant procurement savings delivery from low-cost locations.\nPlanning and management of the tax implications of physical supply-chain operations to reduce the actual taxes paid on profits and operations happen through:\n\nthe potential to reduce corporate taxes on company profits;\nreducing absolute value-added tax (VAT) payable or cash-flow cost of VAT;\nreducing duty payable;\noptimising the indirect taxes paid on physical flows; and,\nchange of transfer pricing driving reduction in effective corporate tax rates.\n</jats:p>"

This\n   study is aimed at presenting an equilibrium-oriented housing supply\n   management model that integrates housing supply and demand with time lag and\n   reasonable vacancy area. For validity test of the model, Chengdu City was\n   selected as a sample. The study establishes the feasibility of this model by\n   demonstrating that optimized housing supply can narrow the gap between\n   housing supply and demand. The implication of this finding is that planning\n   of housing supply is an important management tool and that in applying this\n   tool, local government should intervene in housing market to ensure\n   scientific consideration of city's development position, economic growth and\n   housing demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The advanced technologies presented in this paper are based on a low-environmental-impact, energy-saving,and health-fostering approach, able to fit to the extreme climate and environmental conditions of Qatar. They are addressing 3 of the 12 Cross-cutting Grand Challenges within the Energy and Environment thematic pillar. 3. Sustainable food supply: c (Explore the feasibility of hydroponic, aeroponic and new greenhouse technologies). The advanced technology proposed is applied to a greenhouse which is able to grow hydroponically fresh vegetables in the desert under extremely controlled conditions taking care of water, air, waste management and energy production. Based on previous aerospace experience, the greenhouse proposed is something that surpasses the current state of the art: the energy production for all the hydroponic greenhouse facility is ensured by the use of flexible and transparent solar panels which allows for solar light to illuminate the hydroponic cultures; simultaneously electricity is produced by an integrated PV system made of high-tech conductive polymers embedded inside the plastics of the external walls of the greenhouse. 1. Water reuse: f (Develop and adopt safe and efficient methods of wastewater reclamation and reuse). The water for the alimentation of the hydroponic cultures will be used in closed circuit avoiding losses through a constant monitoring of its key parameters. A series of ion-selective electrodes connected with microelectronic hardware, follows through metering pumps the concentration of nutrients in the water to integrate those depleted during the circulation. Water circulation in the hydroponic culture implies also its enrichment by metabolites such as oxalic acid coming from plants, and the water can accumulate and grow undesired micro-organisms which can build up undesired and noxious biofilm or which could be dangerous for the plants. To eliminate these risks, a patented in-house technology permits to destroy selectively the undesired metabolites released by the plants using the photo-ozonolysis treatment, which not only destroys metabolites like oxalic acid converting them into CO2 and water, but destroys completely all noxious micro-organisms which may grow in the hydroponic water, preventing the undesired bio-film to build-up. 5. Sustainable Urbanisation - Doha as a smart city: d (Develop state-of.the-art technologies in infrastructure systems and materials unique to Qatar but adaptable to global industry) and i (Design and build environments that foster healthy behaviours). A technological transfer from the above-described systems to the thermal mitigation of urban confined spaces is envisioned in this third part of the presented proposal. The greenhouse selective solar ETFE envelop can be applied to outdoor confined spaces in order to realise thermal comfort conditions inside through solar radiation control. The close circuit water pump system is used to sprinkle water from the ceiling of the envelop inducing passive down-draft evaporative cooling. The aeroponic technique allow for vertical vegetation growing on the facades of buildings which become the inner walls of the outdoor confined spaces, thus increasing the cooling effect by transpiration and low-emissivity irradiation. In addition, ground cooling is applied to inlet naturally cooled air from floor vents connected to serpentines of buried pipes under the urban space pavement.</jats:p>"

The related literature is analysed from five perspectives. First, by examining supply chain issues relating to integration of core processes across organizational boundaries, through improved communication, partnerships, and cooperation. Second, from a strategy and planning perspective, by examining supply chain management as an IT platform dependent business practice. Third, by considering implementation issues using agent, as well as Web service technologies. Fourth, by considering the impact of new trends in service computing built around technologies, such as Semantic Web services and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), on transport logistics. Finally, the chapter proposes a Cloud-based SOA software platform as an enabler for lowering transaction costs and enhancing business opportunities through service virtualization in shipping transport logistics. The operational aspects of shipping transport logistics management are illustrated using a business case that shows the opportunities for increased collaboration through Cloud-based virtualized services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural hazards, such as estern Japan earthquake in 2011 and human-induced crises, such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, is harmful to global supply chain management. Therefore, a need exists to rethink the methodology for responding to crises. It is well known that the bullwhip effect due to order forecasting and demand fluctuations decrease supply chain efficiency. Compared to the conventional bullwhip effects, short-lived demand changes caused by unexpected natural disasters or a financial crisis can adversely affect supply chain performance. This work discusses the effects of four ramp-type demands using a novel supply chain cost model. Ramp-type demand increases within a short period can lead to profit loss; and consequently, an appropriate pricing strategy should be adopted. Based on price elasticity, demand types and their lifetimes, and supply chain parameters, the price premium can be determined to obtain the highest profit. Simulation results provide guidelines for supply chain managers dealing with demand fluctuations due to natural or human-induced crises.</jats:p>"

The proposed forecast process is consist of the weekly forecast netting and the daily forecast consumption, which is flexible to handle the new sales orders that come into the production system, and operates with multiple forecasts as the inputs and the forecasts can be netted across by different types of sales orders. The proposed forecasting process can be utilized in cases when the sales order is done at the model level and the forecast is done at the component level for the MTO, MTS and CTO products.</jats:p>"

Data on the transaction volumes and other material information are collected over a period of two years to understand the behaviour and trends of reverse logistics in this company. Statistical tools such as serial correlation, seasonality and trend analysis are performed on the data to understand their behaviour and its managerial implication. The study has shown that there is an upward trend for the return volume and how financial closing has an impact to the return volumes.</jats:p>"

In external supply system, three aspects of cost, quality and time are used to evaluate the coordination of supply logistics in JIT environment. From the internal aspect, reliability, flexibility, responsiveness, customer service and system suitability are selected for the performance evaluation. The eight indexes construct an index system and each performance index is described and analyzed.

Information was gathered from numerous sources to create a comprehensive analysis of benefits and shortcomings of online reverse auctions. The argument presented shows a strong temptation for buyers to participate in online reverse auctions: price reductions. However, buyers should approach online reverse auctions with caution as total cost savings can be misleading and participation may result in damaged relationships with suppliers. Buyers' determination to use online reverse auctions relies on product specifications, supplier relationships, the current supply and demand environment, indirect costs, and several other factors that will vary for each product and for each buyer. Therefore, an all-encompassing decision model cannot be presented to accommodate each scenario. However, a generic framework is proposed for managers determining if participation in online reverse auctions is appropriate for their business. In practice, additional company specific information can be applied to the decision making model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It may be noted, the research reported in professional literature on online reverse auctions does not offer a process for managers to follow when evaluating whether to implement online reverse auctions. This note includes a generic decision framework specifically for buyers as well as an abbreviated decision model for suppliers.</jats:p>",

New forms of inter-firm dependence and governance mechanisms may arise, due to the explicit investments made in technology and systems for collaboration purposes. There is an important distinction between general and customized investments in inter-organizational information systems (IOS), because the specificity level in IT exhibits certain characteristics that accentuate both the risk and value of inter-firm trade. Several research calls were made to validate governance theories on IOS. Based on a literature review, this paper provides a synthesis and integration of transaction cost economics (TCE) and IOS literature regarding governance forms. The paper discusses why the specificity level of IOS plays a central role in modern collaboration between firms, and how vertical electronic coordination (VEC) represents a mechanism for electronic governance forms and presents an agenda for future research.</jats:p>"

This chapter introduces some applications of MHAs in supply chain management (SCM) problems. For example, consider a multi-product multi-constraint SCM problem in which demands for each product are not deterministic, the lead-time varies linearly with regard to the lot-size and partial backordering of shortages are assumed. Thus, since the main goal is to determine the re-order point, the order quantity and number of shipments under the total cost of the whole chain is minimized. In this chapter, the authors concentrate on MHAs such as harmony search (HS), particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), firefly algorithm (FA), and simulated annealing (SA) for solving the following four supply chain models: single-vendor single-buyer (SBSV), multi-buyers single-vendor (MBSV), multi-buyers multi-vendors (MBMV) and multi-objective multi-buyers multi-vendors (MOMBMV). These models typically are in any supply chain. For illustrative purposes, a numerical example is solved in each model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Social Media Networks (SMNs) are collaborative tools used in an increasing rate in many business and industrial environments. These are often used in parallel with dedicated Collaborative Technologies (CTs) which are specifically designed to handle dedicated tasks. Within this research project the specific area of supply chain management is the focus of investigation. Two case studies where CTs are already extensively employed have been conducted to evaluate the scope of SMN usage and to confirm the particular benefits provided and to identify limitations. The overall purpose being to provide guidelines on joint CT/SMN deployment in developing supply chains. The application of SMNs to supply chain operations is fundamental to addressing the emerging need for increased P2P (peer-to-peer) type communication. This type of communication is between individuals and is typified by increased relationship type interaction. This is in contrast to traditional B2B (business-to-business) communication which is typically conducted on a transactional basis especially where it is confined by the characteristics of dedicated CTs. SMNs can be applied in supply chain networks to deal with unexpected circumstances or problem solving, capture market demands and customer feedback, and in general provide a medium to react to unplanned events. Crucially, they provide a platform where the issues can be addressed on a P2P basis in the absence of confrontational, transactional type interactions. The case studies reported in this paper concern EU based companies, one being a major national aluminium profile extruder, the second being a bottling plant for a global soft drinks manufacturer. In both cases the application of CTs to their supply chains is well established. However whilst both companies could readily identify the strengths of their CT systems (information and data sharing, data storage and retrieval) they could also identify limitations. These limitations included the lack of real time interaction at a P2P level and, interestingly, the lack of a common language used between different CT systems in B2B communication. Overall, the comments of the case study companies was that the SMN provided valuable adjuncts to existing CT systems, but that the SMNs were not integrated with the CT systems. There was a strongly perceived need for a better understanding of the contrasting and complementary capabilities of CTs and SMNs so that in future fully integrated systems could be implemented. Future work in this area will focus on the development of guidelines and procedures for achieving such complementarity in international collaborative supply chains.</jats:p>"

Case study data will be presented to demonstrate the inadequacies of traditional reservoir appraisal approaches. Instead, creative and innovative methods are required to understand the degree of intra and inter reservoir connectivity and structural/stratigraphic compartmentalisation. Operators must now accept increased development cost and risk, in order for these projects to be sanctioned for development. It is clear that the era of easy gas supply from Australian giant gas fields is over.</jats:p>",

ICT can be an enabler of business performance but also an obstacle if these technologies are not managed carefully. Enterprises are implementing integrated CRM and SRM software in order to remain competitive, but high rates of failure indicate that the implementation of these solutions is not straightforward. In this chapter, organizational issues concerning the integration of CRM, SRM, and ERP software in supply chains are discussed. This chapter aims at informing managers, scholars, students, and researchers of the issues involved, and identifying critical factors of success for enterprises adopting and implementing integrated CRM/SRM solutions.</jats:p>"

It identifies areas of strength in the supply chain, particularly in fields such as geotechnical services, software, instrumentation, electrical engineering, project management, consultancy, and so on. It argues for a consistent policy approach across the many policy- and service-provision actors involved to maximise industry-development chances in the medium and long term.\nThe economic benefits of the price, investment, and volume impacts of the present phase of mineral and resource development are well documented. They are expected to generate a continuing step increase in Australia's GDP, with benefits that will last for many years.\nMany actors are involved in shaping policy and providing research and other services across the commonwealth and state spheres. Relevant actors extend beyond government to agencies such as the CSIRO, the CRCs, industry associations, and research capabilities of universities and other institutions pertinent to the sector.\nThe policy setting is complex, but there is an opportunity to build on and expand the industry and services base underpinning the resources-sector supply chain. In this regard, Australia can learn lessons from Norway where a deliberate policy strategy has helped established a vibrant offshore sector, admittedly in a considerably different institutional context. This extended abstract reviews the Norwegian experience against Australian developments and seeks to understand the role policy has played in this case. This experience is then transposed to the Australian situation.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many strategies have been developed to manage supply chain operations effectively. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system is one of the prevalent strategic tools of the supply side logistics based on the electronic data exchange and business process automation among the suppliers and customers to enhance the competitive advantage. VMI is widely used in different industries including automotive sector. The VMI concept is a continuous replenishment program where suppliers are given access to demand and inventory level of customers and they are fully responsible for managing and replenishing the customer’s stock. VMI’s extension on customer satisfaction cannot be perceived sufficiently by decision-makers who are responsible to develop and invest in the customer-supplier relationship. This paper presents a path model using the method of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to give insight to decision-makers to understand effect of the VMI adoption on customer satisfaction. This paper investigates both determinants of relative factors of successful VMI adoption and the relationship in the supply chain with an empirical automotive industry case. The results show that the collaboration and coordination between customer and supplier and infrastructure of the information-sharing are the important dimensions to add value to the supply chain and to enhance customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

The problem is modelled as a flexible flowshop with two stages. The objectives are the maximisation of system productivity (or minimisation of makespan) and the minimisation of the number of production orders with late delivery. This paper proposes a scheduling procedure based on a bi-objective genetic algorithm. An experimental study was performed using real data from the enterprise. Since validation results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed procedure, a decision-aid tool is designed. The algorithm is implemented at the enterprise and allows improved key performance metrics.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Eston Sugar Mill is the newest in the South African KwaZulu-Natal sugar belt. Like most other mills, it can be argued that there are inefficiencies in the supply chain due to systematic issues, which reduce optimum performance. It was alleged that mill processes are slowed, or stopped, on Sundays, Mondays, as well as some Tuesdays and Wednesdays, due to pay-weekends, because of the associated cutter absenteeism. This increases the length of the milling season (LOMS), increases milling costs and reduces the average cane quality for the season. Data on cane deliveries to the Eston Mill, over a period of five seasons, were analysed to study the magnitude of the problem. It was statistically verified that cane shortages occur immediately after payweekends and it was conservatively estimated that cutter absenteeism occurs between 25–29 days per season, which increases the LOMS by six to ten days. The associated cost of this problem equated to an average of US$159,500 (approximately EUR120,000) per milling season. In this paper, an alternative harvesting system scenario is suggested, assuming that mechanical harvesters be used after a pay-weekend, to mitigate the impacts of cutter shortages. However, the solution is calculated to be risky. When the cost of new equipment was considered, only two of the five seasons were able to justify the associated costs.</jats:p>"

Up to heading of the control plants, copper-deficient plants showed low intensity of dark respiration as compared with the copper-sufficient plants. After heading, a strong increase in the rate of respiration in the former was noted. The high intensity of dark respiration in copper-deficient plants after heading was probably the result of ineffective utilization of assimilates in the absence of the panicle - the main acceptor of the photosynthesis products.</jats:p>"

So it is important to fully understand the technology’s impact on the supply chain performances and take advantage of its potential benefits. For this purpose, this article analyzes and categorizes RFID’s benefits and the influence factors, and then setup a connection with supply chain performance. Subsequently, we propose a framework for evaluating the performance of RFID-enabled supply chain.

Using the innovation-friendly regulatory principles adapted from Porter and van der Linde (1995a, 1995b), this paper demonstrates how properly designed and implemented environmental regulation (TEI promoting regulation) has played a critical role in promoting TEI in the transport industry in California and Hong Kong. In both cases, it has shown that stringent environmental regulations that send clear and strong signals for future environmental performance requirements are critical in promoting TEIs in the public transport industries. Unlike traditional command-and-control regulations, TEI promoting regulations are strongly supported by incentive and capability-enhancing measures.</jats:p>"

Some parameters of the yield structure and nitrate reductase activity were taken into consideration. It was found that there exist some differences in the yield between the compared varieties and some differences in their reaction to a high N level in the soil. The grain yield increase of the plants treated with high nitrogen doses was above all the result of the increase in dry matter of the lateral shoots and in leaf area. Distinct increase in the number of grains per ear and 1000-grains weight was also observed. The amount of reduced nitrogen collected during the growth season depended, in part, on the nitrate reductase activity and in part on the amount of the enzyme present in the plant. A rise of the nitrogen level caused an increase in nitrate reductase activity, in all varieties. The different influence of nitrogen on the growth of green organs in the compared varieties caused differences in the amount of the enzyme present in the plants and in protein yields.</jats:p>"

Although conventional wisdom perceives that IT systems facilitate supply chain collaboration, this research provides an alternative perspective. Drawing on resource-based view and contingency ‘fit’ theory, the study investigates a model of relationships that specify how environmental uncertainty factors influence the nature of the association of two critical but distinctive IT capabilities with collaboration. Findings corroborate the positive association between collaboration and B2B e-commerce and IT analytic capability. However, demand unpredictability enhances the IT analytic capability-collaboration relationship while detracting from the B2B e-commerce-collaboration association. Notably, the study did not find any moderating influence of another critical uncertainty factor, technological turbulence. The findings reveal the complex nature of IT-collaboration relationships and provide managers a framework for understanding the uncertainty contexts under which specific information technologies with various functionalities may be more appropriately leveraged to derive benefits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of lean thinking is—despite its prominence as waste reducer and value creator—still mainly applied to the manufacturing environment. Whilst investigations on applicability to the service industry are advancing fast, little has been distributed for the area of procurement. This development is opposed by trends of increasing degree of outsourcing and related high portions of procurement of up to 60% of a company’s total value creation. The mismatch in terms of lack of strategic attention on lean procurement on the one hand and the responsibility of this function for the majority of a company’s value creation on the other, combined with the simultaneous trend of establishing “miracle cures” in the form of e-procurement gave rise to the interest in determining the stake of buy-side systems in the leanness of procurement processes. For this purpose, a case study approach was adopted focusing on the central questions of what lean means for procurement, which measures could portray leanness in this instance, how the stake of buy-side systems can be reflected in the performance indicators with separate consideration of repetitive processes in operational and strategic purchasing, in order to finally attribute a clear enabler role to IT for achieving leanness in operational procurement. This finding has been reached by the means of an objective research approach, relying on quantitative methods such as KPI measurement for data collection and regression analysis for the interpretation of correlation between the variables. As such, this chapter has not only a high value for practitioners by providing a baseline for benchmarking lean performance of e-procurement, by supporting system investment decisions, or by simply facilitating decisions on adapting existing IT solutions. It also proves as enrichment to the existing theoretical body of knowledge filling into the aforesaid gaps of lean procurement and putting—at least for procurement processes—an end to the discussion as to whether ERP systems and lean thinking are reconcilable or not.</jats:p>"

More than 60% of irrigated agriculture, 85% of drinking water supplies, and 50% of urban and industrial water needs are dependent on sustainable groundwater management. Regardless, groundwater overextraction is a growing problem in many regions. Predictions of groundwater resource availability in India are problematic in part because of a limited number of monitoring sites and insufficient data quality and quantity. Regional groundwater assessments are further complicated because of sporadic and low-frequency data. To help overcome these issues and more accurately quantify groundwater resource availability, scientists have begun using satellite-derived remote sensing data. In this study, the authors used seasonal and annual hydrologic signals obtained by NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and simulated soil moisture variations from land data assimilation systems to show groundwater depletion trends in the northwest state of Gujarat (surface area of 196 030 km2), India. Results were evaluated using direct measurement data from 935 wells. Remote sensing generated results compared favorably with well data (e.g., r2 = 0.89 for Gandhinagar, a representative highly urbanized district in Gujarat: confidence interval (CI) = 0.05 and P = 0.002). Results show that remote sensing is an effective tool to compliment and interpolate observed regional groundwater well data and improve groundwater storage estimations in Gujarat, India. Properly implemented, the method will supply reliable science-based information to enhance management of groundwater resources in India and other geographic locations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The total logistics cost (TLC) is the traditional expenditure-approach method of calculating the logistics cost of a supply chain as the goods are moved from the source to the end destination. This method uses the sum of all expenditure associated with the movement of goods (i.e. transport and handling), in-transit storage of goods and the generation of information to enable these movements to occur. As logistics chains become more complex and longer, calculating the TLC becomes increasingly difficult. The question that this paper answers is how to define and calculate the four logistics supply chain economic, or opportunity, cost factors of (1) physical movement (i.e. transport and handling); (2) in-transit cost of holding the stock while not available to the end customer; (3) the cost of the information needed to enable the movement; and (4) the effect of the reliability of the logistics chain on the safety stock. A practical method is developed whereby the TLC, incorporating these four aspects, is shown for a hypothetical movement. The costs highlight the total logistics opportunity cost (TLOC) for a multiple-leg voyage and the costs associated with all four aspects of the movement. The most attractive logistics supply chain would be the one with the lowest TLOC, and the choice can be made with confidence, as it incorporates the full economic logistics cost of the chain.

Results from the lag model indicates that an increase in previous year maize price and previous growing season temperature positively affect current year maize supply. However, an increase in previous growing season rainfall negatively affects current year maize supply. The quantile regression results show that maize supply responds differently to previous maize price and climatic variables across the different quantiles of crop area distribution.</jats:p>"

To be competitive, companies had to make changes to their product lines, distribution channels, marketing, and overall business strategies. This study was conducted to describe and analyze the log supply component of the hardwood forest products distribution chain and to investigate changes over the past 5 years. State forestry utilization and marketing specialists were interviewed to gain a regional overview of log distributions systems, followed by a survey that resulted in 57 responses from log distributors/brokers/wholesalers from 24 states. Results indicated that, on average, respondents received the majority of their logs from gatewood purchases, and the majority of logs purchased went directly into the sawmill market. From 2007 to 2011, logs sold to sawmill and veneer markets decreased by 6 and 7 percent, respectively, and logs sold to export markets increased by 30 percent. Respondents indicated that increasing fuel and trucking costs, followed by logger shortages, had the greatest negative impact on business operations. In contrast, increasing log exports had the greatest positive impact. Most respondents indicated that although current economic conditions have affected the way they conduct business, they have been able to find ways to adapt. Services such as providing log delivery, bucking logs to desired lengths, and procuring hard-to-obtain species helped companies in the log business remain competitive.</jats:p>"

The medical application requirement for such a disaster management system includes effective, reliable, and coordinated responses to disease and injury, accurate surveillance of area hospitals, and efficient management of clinical and research information. Based on the application requirements, this case study describes a grid-based system in a health information supply chain that monitors and detects national infectious events using geographical information system (GIS), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and grid computing technology. This system is fault-tolerant, highly secure, flexible, and extensible, thus making it capable of operation in case of a national catastrophe. It has a low cost of deployment and is designed for large-scale and quick responses. Owing to the grid-based nature of the network, no central server or data centre needs to be built. To reinforce the responsiveness of the national health information supply chain, this case study proposes a practical, tracking-based, spatially-aware, steady, and flexible architecture, based on GIS and RFID, for developing successful infectious disaster management plans to tackle technical issues. The architecture achieves a common understanding of spatial data and processes. Therefore, the system can efficiently and effectively share, compare, and federate—yet integrate—most local health information providers and results in more informed planning and better outcome.</jats:p>"

One of these relationships is between employment growth (or labour demand) and the associated reduction in the unemployment rate. This relationship is often determined by other labour market indicators, such as participation rates (or labour supply), and the working age population (amongst other factors). This paper reports on an integrated macro labour market forecasting framework developed by the Labour Group of MBIE, disaggregated into 11 five-yearly age cohorts across the working age population.\n        \n        The labour market dynamics during business cycles are affected by the ageing of the work force in New Zealand. This has varied consequences on labour market outcomes for different age cohorts, especially those at each end of the age spectrum. Forecasting likely future unemployment rates by age cohort level is of considerable interest, and will provide further insights into labour market dynamics. In addition to those in the prime age cohorts, other cohorts of interest include new entrants into the working age population; those age cohorts potentially involved in training; and those in the pre-retirement age cohorts.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on analyzing product-related characteristics: what the characteristics mentioned in the literature are, and the impact they have on the structure and design of supply chains. The authors look at how product characteristics in general influence the design of supply chains, and their effect on different stages of supply chains. In the literature analysis, the focus is on examining the impact of product characteristics on supply chain strategy and structures, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and logistics services. Finally, they draw conclusions on the above. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, based on supply chain management literature, the authors propose a framework for analyzing the impact of product characteristics on supply chains. Secondly, at the end of the paper, they extend the framework by summarizing the key results pertaining to each supply chain management area under analysis. These include the characteristics of the main frameworks used in previous studies and the generic product characteristics used.</p>",

Market research says that larger the numbers of economic agents involved in marketing and lesser their incomesâ€™ share in consumer priceâ€™. The prospective solution to this problem may be consolidation of supply chain. The main motive of this paper is to explore the ways or super markets models that will integrate the small and marginal farmers with supply chain system in India. Information on marketing models and marketing institutions which deal fruits and vegetables in the country were analyzed. The fruits and vegetable commodities reach the final consumer through various channels. Among all the channels the direct market models are the best because the producer share in consumer rupee is 100 per cent and will eliminate middlemen completely. India opened up post â€“ 1990, a number of new liberalized public markets operating direct marketing model with forward linkages for fruits and vegetables. The economic reforms also lead to the emergence a number of new private retail markets for fruits and vegetable with direct marketing models with backward linkages. The results reveal that private super markets will save farmers from transport, marketing cost and other charges and complete eliminate middlemen. Farmers who supply to private super markets have many advantages it includes technical guidance, market information on prices, perfect weights and spot payments etc. The opportunities include development of high value commodities market supply chain. The farmers are suggested for effective and efficient marketing of fruits and vegetables, the super markets have to purchase entire quantity brought by the farmer irrespective of grading, Export linkage is suggested, Government has to regulate prices, Government has to open and operate retail outlets, Government should assess the production and consumption level and announce the MSP accordingly. Even the farmers of the most of the states are adopting traditional marketing channels. The study suggests that modern direct marketing models to adopt.</jats:p>"

The analysis focuses on the economic effects resulting from the combination of these two approaches compared to their potential effects in terms of the reduction of sanitary risks faced by consumers. Starting from a critical review of the literature and from an analysis based on the new industrial economics tools, the authors show how, under certain conditions, the objective of safety in agrifood supply chains may be only partially achieved because of economic distortions arising from the combined effect of public policies and private standards.</jats:p>",

The variation of two voltage unbalance factors viz. complex voltage unbalance factor (CVUF) and impedance unbalance factor (IUF) with positive sequence voltage component, reveals that degree and manner of unbalance in supply voltage is exactly reflected in CVUF and IUF, respectively. On this basis, it is shown that for the precise assessment of IM performance, knowledge of both, manner (IUF) and degree (CVUF) of unbalance is important. Further, effect of angle of unbalance, on the performance of the IM and voltage pattern is analyzed. Results depict high sensitivity of derating factor and peak copper losses to this angle. Thus, it should be included along with unbalance factors for the precise and complete performance assessment of IM.</jats:p>",

A network with five echelons of supply chains including suppliers, plants, distribution centers, cross-docks, and customer zones is addressed in this paper. The problem has been mathematically formulated as a biobjective optimization model that aims to minimize the cost (fixed and variable) and maximize the plant flexibility and volume flexibility. A novel multiobjective parallel simulating annealing algorithm (MOPSA) is proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The performance of the proposed solution algorithm is compared with two well-known metaheuristics, namely, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and Pareto archive evolution strategy (PAES). Computational results show that MOPSA outperforms the other metaheuristics.</jats:p>"

The chapter is based on a conceptual analysis of the significance of the two concepts in improving business efficiency and maximizing returns on stakeholders’ investments. S-D logic has been tagged by proponents as a credible concept that when applied appropriately to business endeavours could revolutionalize modern business practices. Similar to S-D logic is the concept of supply network management, which seeks an integration of resources by a network of partners and various actors of a business relationship in order to attain cost minimization, whilst maximizing resource deployment. In supply network management, the focus is on shared access to resources among members of a network acknowledging that firms possess varied and sometimes unique resources that others need to tap. In the process of networking, organizations therefore learn from each other and benefit from new knowledge developed by other organizations (Christopher, 2009). The chapter, therefore, assesses the impact of the application of S-D logic and supply network management on business performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management (GSCM) has become a practical approach to develop environmental performance. Under strict regulations and stakeholder pressures, enterprises need to enhance and improve GSCM practices, which are influenced by both traditional and green factors. This study developed a causal evaluation model to guide selection of qualified suppliers by prioritizing various criteria and mapping causal relationships to find effective criteria to improve green supply chain. The aim of the case study was to model and examine the influential and important main GSCM practices, namely, green logistics, organizational performance, green organizational activities, environmental protection, and green supplier evaluation. In the case study, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique is applied to test the developed model. The result of the case study shows only “green supplier evaluation” and “green organizational activities” criteria of the model are in the cause group and the other criteria are in the effect group.</jats:p>"

This knowledge is not taught in special and integrated approach. The Logistics market is in need of a sector responsible for recording all pricing methods as regards the provision of pricing services. This sector has to be fully functional, efficient, and rational. This chapter aims at the development of an integrated record for the identification and classification of the advantages – disadvantages and key criteria as regards the selection of pricing methods in the third party logistics (3PLs) market sector. The key finding of this chapter contribute to the identification and classification of pricing methods, possibly applied in future 3PL projects.</jats:p>"

The work draws on Fisher's model to match supply strategy to product nature. However, Fisher's model was criticised very recently by Lo and Power in this journal because it is unclear how the “leagile” option should fit into it. This paper addresses this issue.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The new portfolio model is based on the literature, particularly Fisher's seminal work. It is then applied to two case studies; an electric boiler manufacturer and an elevator manufacturer, both in South Korea.

A pair of the Hexagon Models are used to review Cloud projects against success criteria; one Hexagon Model focuses on Business Model and the other on IT Services. The UoG case study demonstrates the added value offered by Supply Chain software deployed by private Cloud, where an Oracle suite and SAP supply chain can demonstrate supply chain distribution and is useful for teaching.

We use a cointegration approach and error correction mechanism\napplied to data for the period 1970–2005. Mango exports are regressed against the\nindex of relative prices of mango exports (2000 = 100), the quantity of domestic\nmango production, real agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), the length of\nall-weather roads, and international standardization, i.e., the impact of the World\nTrade Organization agreement. The results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller test\nreveal that all the data series are I(1). Applying Johansen’s test shows that the\nhighest elasticity coefficients are found for mango production in the short and long\nrun, followed by real agricultural GDP. The Granger causality test points to the\nbi-directional causality of mango exports with the relative price index and allweather\nroads, and unidirectional causality with real agricultural GDP and mango\nproduction. The study recommends promoting proper orchard management,\ndeveloping the appropriate infrastructure, and stabilizing export prices to increase\nmango exports from Pakistan.</jats:p>",

The global and competitive business environment of 3PLs has recognized the significance of a speedy and proficient service towards the customers in the past few decades. Particularly in warehousing, distribution, and transportation services, a number of customers anticipate 3PLs to improve lead times, fill rates, inventory levels, etc. Therefore, the 3PLs are under demands to convene a range of service necessities of customers in an active and uncertain business environment. As a consequence of the dynamic environment in which supply chain must operate, 3PLs should sustain an effective distribution system of high performance and must make a sequence of inter-related decisions over time for their distribution networks. Warehouses play an important role in sustaining the continual flow of goods and materials between the manufacturer and customers. The performance of the 3PL supply chain network can be effortlessly enhanced by a balanced allocation of customers to warehouses. In this paper, the authors develop a genetic algorithm and a particle-swarm-optimisation algorithm for solving the balanced allocation problem and the results are encouraging.</jats:p>"

Any optimizations in the energy efficiency of the pumps result in a considerable reduction of the total operational cost. The Fátima water supply system in Portugal was analyzed in order to minimize its operational energy costs. Different pump characteristic curves were analyzed and modeled in order to achieve the most efficient operation point. To determine the best daily pumping operational scheduling pattern, genetic algorithm (GA) optimization embedded in the modeling software was considered in contrast with a manual override (MO) approach. The main goal was to determine which pumps and what daily scheduling allowed the best economical solution. At the end of the analysis it was possible to reduce the original daily energy costs by 43.7%. This was achieved by introducing more appropriate pumps and by intelligent programming of their operation. Given the heuristic nature of GAs, different approaches were employed and the most common errors were pinpointed, whereby this investigation can be used as a reference for similar future developments.</jats:p>"

One of the main aspects of such an analysis is the optimisation of vehicle routes to deliver final products to customers. There are many algorithms to optimise the related vehicle routing problem. The objective function of that problem usually involves distance, cost, number of vehicles, or profits. This study also takes safety and environmental costs into account. Thus, the authors develop variants to traditional heuristic algorithms, in which they include the traditional costs along with safety and environmental cost estimates for real scenarios in Spain. This methodology is called ASEC (Algorithms with Safety and Environmental Criteria). These considerations raise the value of the global objective function, but permit a more realistic cost estimate that includes not only the internal costs involved in the problem but also the related externalities. Finally, real cases are discussed, and solutions are offered using the new ASEC methodology.</jats:p>"

Greater authenticity allows students to experience different roles and exposes them to multiple business cases over supply chains that, in reality, span the globe. The project addresses the inauthentic pedagogical approaches in current classroom and distance-learning environments, and will propose a methodology that utilises existing technologies. The simulation will combine emerging technologies to represent multiple problem dimensions into one space; enabling students to observe, engage, interact, and participate in self-guided or group-based learning scenarios; receiving instant, multi-perspective, media-rich feedback to support their learning; and enabling further iterative scenario-based training.</jats:p>"

Thus, companies are forced to take into consideration all the aspects that might impact on such an indicator. This paper focuses on the European machinery and equipment industry, an important instance of the non-hierarchical network concept, to investigate the relationships existing among supply-side uncertainty, delivery reliability to the final market and the adoption of possible leverages to mitigate problems, namely buffers and incentives. The authors formulate the research hypotheses and test them against a set of collected data in 3 European countries. The final discussion about the results provides insights about the real effectiveness of buffer and incentive based approaches, as well as some directions for future research.</jats:p>"

The tools for model fitting, model validation, and prediction are presented, while emphasis is given on understanding the types of data that can be analyzed via regression. More specifically, the method of least squares is discussed. Regression analysis is proposed due to its simplicity and wide applicability. Modeling outsourcing or demand forecasting can both be achieved by regression analysis, providing useful information for logistics service providers or 3PL companies. Hauling freight data collected from a logistics company based in Ohio were utilized to demonstrate the applicability of regression analysis and its usefulness for logistics service providers, 3PL companies, and transportation companies. Finally, limitations, solutions, and alternative strategies are discussed.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the author presents a maturity model that links metrics for both ‘worlds’ to prescribe the evolution of key practices, IT-services, and people skills. The proposed model can be used to examine the maturity of supplier relationship management of a particular hospital, identifying performance gaps and systematizing improvement initiatives. When used across a health system, it can be applied to benchmark the performance of the participating members, facilitating new ways for collaborative learning.</jats:p>"

Harvest-to-crush logistics affect sugarcane quality and present a significant impact on milling efficiency.\n\nThis research studied commercial sugarcane quality parameters over six years at a large commercial sugar mill in South Africa. f (sucrose content expressed as a percentage of fiber content) was derived as a new parameter that consistently flagged poor quality deliveries during the early part of the week. This is a strong indicator of increased cane deterioration over weekends as a result of logistics inefficiencies. Shewhart quality control charts (X– charts) and a non-parametric statistic confirmed significantly inferior cane qualities after weekends. Statistical techniques were also able, with 95% significance, to identify growers with systemic deterioration of delivered cane. A large number of growers who were exposed to weekend logistics problems were also experiencing significant systemic deterioration problems. These results may enable the generation of a grower performance index that will allow stakeholders to improve operations. The study shows that, although notorious for its variability, commercial cane quality data can be used to drive efficiency improvements in the supply chain, if used appropriately.</jats:p>"

Water stress during heading stage reduced nearly by one half the grain yield per plant, mostly by decreasing the number of completely filled grains. The quicker leaf senescence and grain number reduction as well as the total grain yield due to water stress differed between the nutritional levels. The relations between leaf surface area and grain yields were nearly linear in treatments with optimal water supply, but were markedly changed by water stress.</jats:p>"

In the current time-based competition context, securing transportation operations should not be sought at the expense of time effectiveness in physical and informational flow processing. In this paper, the authors describe a project for the design of an expert-system dedicated to maritime container security risk management, present a literature review on decision-support systems dedicated to transportation risk management, and discuss the various steps of expertise modeling in a transportation risk management context.</jats:p>"

The presented approach uses Constraint Programming and Lagrangean Relaxation methods in order to improve algorithm’s efficiency. The complete problem is decomposed into two separated subproblems, to which the mentioned techniques are applied to obtain a complete solution. With this decomposition, the methodology provides a quick initial feasible solution which is rapidly improved by metaheuristics’ iterative process. Constraint Programming and Lagrangean Relaxation are also embedded within this structure to ensure constraints satisfaction and to reduce the calculation burden. By means of the proposed methodology, promising results have been obtained. Remarkable results presented in this paper include a new best-known solution for a rarely solved 200-customers test instance, as well as a better alternative solution for another benchmark problem.</jats:p>"

A theoretical clarification of outsourcing, however, must essentially be grounded in an answer to the question of what is within the firm and what is outside? This chapter presents extensive literature review of definitions on logistics, outsourcing, and logistics outsourcing, as well as empirical evidence on outsourcing decisions.

Various critical aspects affect the strategic design and development of healthcare logistic networks in practice. The conceptual discussion is empirically derived on the basis of the challenge created by the development of centralized healthcare supply networks supported by the implementation of new IT/IS investments and advanced logistic hubs for hospital material inventory management. The study moves towards the development of a newer “Healthcare Supply Network Causal Loop Diagram”, to analyse and predict the growth pattern of a healthcare logistic network in its complexity, and understand how well the supply network will fit with the benefit provided by new logistic economies of scale and the risk of failures under uncertainty.</p>",

Typical quick response (QR) systems have been broadly used in the fashion industry to enable agile supply chain management (SCM). However, the original functions of QR systems cannot completely address the challenge of issuing early warnings to prevent customer loss. This article merges the typical MIS system development procedure with that of an e-SCM multiple-agent decision support system to confront this problem. The system has three levels: data mining, ontology, and decision support. These levels are interlinked in handling different databases. Different agents execute different tasks at each level to achieve integration and communication in a supply chain with less human intervention. The proposed framework emphasizes transparent connections among businesses and assists in information sharing, thereby preventing customer loss.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Since the beginning of 1990s, there has been an increasing emphasis on supply chain collaboration in the UK construction industry through learning from manufacturing. The adoption of supply chain collaboration is now widely recognised as an effective way of addressing various traditional construction problems. This paper presents the findings of a research project that examines the practitioners’ perspectives on supply chain collaboration in construction projects. The critical success factors (CSFs) of supply chain collaboration are identified from an online focus group discussion and ten expert interviews, whose results are analysed by using the NVivo software package. Unlike existing studies, this study develops an input-process-output model based on the categorisation of the identified CSFs. In addition, supply chain collaboration is compared between public and private sectors, between short-term and long-term programmes, between upstream and downstream supply chains, and between different areas of relationships. The comparative analysis describes the balanced and the unbalanced natures of supply chain collaboration. The findings in this study provide a better understanding of supply chain collaboration in today’s construction practice. Although this study is based on the UK construction industry, its findings may also be useful for construction organisations in other countries to pursue supply chain collaboration.</p>",

Insofar as securitization inhibits loan modification, it serves as a credible threat to the borrower that default will provoke foreclosure. This enhances the value of the lender’s claim on the loan collateral, the home, and she is willing to lend more per dollar of collateral value. An important implication of the analysis is that the higher loan to value ratio for the securitized mortgage does not imply that the securitized mortgage is characterized by looser underwriting standards than the mortgage held on balance sheet. Higher loan to value ratios for securitized mortgages do not necessarily constitute evidence that securitization encourages risky lending.</jats:p>"

The optimal solutions in the centralized and decentralized supply chains are studied. It is found that the retailer’s optimal order quantity and the maximum total supply chain profit in the decentralized supply chain with wholesale price contract are less than that in the centralized supply chain. A two-part tariff contract is proposed to coordinate the decentralized supply chain with which the maximum profit can be achieved. It is found that the optimal wholesale price should be a decreasing piecewise function of the final output. To ensure that the supplier and the retailer both have incentives to accept the coordination contract, a lump-sum fee is offered. The interval of lump-sum fee is given leaving both the supplier and the retailer better off with the two-part tariff contract.</jats:p>"

However, when outsourcing is not performed in the right way, as there are several examples in the marketplace, it can also decrease performance and hurt customer service, reducing company competitiveness. Therefore, it is critical to establish a robust Outsourcing Execution Process to reduce risks of vendor failure due to lack of operational capability, performance management, and conflict of culture between 3PL and the company, just to enumerate a few possible real life problems.

In this respect, many articles tend to present logistics service providers (LSP) in the form of taxonomies, and to highlight their evolution with the help of representative figures. However, there are doubts about the origin and credibility of these figures, because LSP are not clearly identified in the international industry classifications on which they are based. The author’s aim is to identify the community of LSP, and 4PL in particular, as it is most immaterial. At first, the chapter briefly reviews the literature on LSP classifications and their limitations when it comes to taking 4PL into account. It then proposes a methodology to address this problem, which is tested through an empirical study, leading to formulate a new definition of 4PL based on the taxonomy, which is discussed at last.</jats:p>"

Using regional data from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, this study aims to quantitatively assess the contribution of key determinants, such as cotton prices and timely payment, toward the downward trend in cotton area. A dynamic supply model, based on adaptive expectations and partial adjustment, is employed to estimate the effects of prices and institutional factors, such as credit recovery rates and date of payment to farmers, on the Malian cotton supply. Results show that supply responds significantly to cotton prices relative to cereal and fertilizer prices. Date of payment varies across agricultural cycles and late payment negatively influences land devoted to cotton. Low credit repayment rates create disincentives to grow cotton. Therefore, the revitalization of the Malian cotton sector depends upon getting both prices and institutions right.</jats:p>",

Various strategies are available to young word learners for solving this dilemma. The authors consider how the acquisition of each of these strategies might be underpinned by the same domain-general ability to detect and store associations between words and the environment in which they are heard. Drawing on examples of both socio-pragmatic and linguistic cues to words’ meanings, they explore how the young child’s early experiences with words might provide a platform for the discovery of more complex word-learning strategies, facilitating the learning of further new words. The chapter outlines specific predictions of the experience-driven model of the evolution of the toddler’s word-learning toolkit that might be explored through experimental and/or computational investigations.</jats:p>"

SCRM has been considered an important source of competitive advantage and as an effective method of reducing vulnerability in supply chain systems. Supply chain risk and uncertainty and their related potential losses are becoming much larger as the frequency of natural disasters, political and economic instabilities, and unexpected events is gradually rising up in the past decade. The latest earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in Japan along with the current global economic and financial crisis remind us once again the urgent needs for effective risk management in today’s global supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an updated and complete understanding of current research on supply chain risk management (SCRM) in such highly uncertain and unstable natural and economic environments. In addition, we also aimed to provide ideas and identify potential research questions and directions for future research.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a normal port operation, yard cranes are used to move containers from one location to another for import, export or relocation purposes. In order to locate the positions of containers, a database is set up in the office server to store the current locations of existing containers within the yard. Whenever the Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) crane operator moves a container around, the database has to be updated via a program installed in the Vehicle Mounted Terminal (VMT) fitted to the crane. This requires the establishment of a communication channel between the server and the crane VMT. The current practice is to make use of wireless networks, even though these are susceptible to attenuation and interferences in rugged surroundings as in a port. This paper describes and explores another alternative, that of using 2G/SMS for short messages and 3G networks for real-time scenarios. These methods are more reliable as major telecommunication service providers normally expend substantial resources in infrastructure development. They also provide a cheaper alternative in terms of reducing maintenance expenses.</jats:p>"

It is an extension of the work of (Myburgh, 2001; McNally et al. 1982; Buzby, 1974). The results show that the voluntary information content of the (AR) does not meet the informational needs of the (TFAPM). More specifically, the provision (ie. supply) of 29 items in the (AR) diverges completely with their application (ie. demand) by the (TFAPM). Most of these items are items whose disclosure is voluntary and not closely linked to the mandatory one. However, the results reveal that the majority of the 9 items, for which the offer in the (AR) and the demand of the (TFAPM) converge, are items whose disclosure is voluntary and closely linked to the mandatory one.</jats:p>"

The anodic cell voltage decreases with increasing the frequency of power supply, however, the cathodic cell voltage increases. The thickness and roughness of the coating produced using frequency of power supply 50 Hz are high. Increasing the frequency, the thickness of the coating decreases, but coating surface becomes even, and the coating possesses better corrosion protective property</jats:p>"

In the literature, linear methods are the most commonly used. However, real time series data often include nonlinear components, so linear time series forecasting may not be the optimal choice. Therefore, also a basic nonlinear forecasting method is presented. The necessity of these methods to logistics service providers and 3PL companies is presented by case studies that present how the operational and management costs can be cut down in order to ensure a service level. Short term forecasts are useful in all the units of activation of 3PL companies, i.e. supplies, production, distribution, storage, transportation, and service of customers.</jats:p>"

Consequently, there has been a tendency of studies focusing at measuring the logistics service performance within various perspectives. This chapter provides a review on several significant studies that measures the performance of logistics services followed by presenting an empirical study on measuring logistics performance as perceived by the customers in the UK context. The empirical results confirms the relationships and consequent effects of LSQ-satisfaction, relationship quality, and customer loyalty-by providing a process model that shows the process of how customers would stay loyal in the logistics outsourcing business relationships by using exit intention as the output variable. The model in this study can greatly assist the logistics outsourcing companies in measuring the performance of their services. It helps the logistics companies understand how their customers measure the quality of their relationship experiences in receiving the logistics services provided by the logistics companies.</jats:p>"

This crucial link between synchronous and stable material flows by time and quantity to create a supply chain with the highest throughput rates is at the heart of lean thinking. Although this supply chain triangle has generally been acknowledged over many years, it is necessary to reach a finer understanding of these dynamics. Therefore, we will develop and study supply chains with the help of fluid dynamics. A multistage, continuous material flow is modelled through a conservation law for material density. Unlike similar approaches, our model is not based on some quasi steady-state assumptions about the stochastic behaviour of the involved supply chain but rather on a simple deterministic rule for material flow density. These models allow us to take into account the nonlinear, dynamical interactions of different supply chain echelons and to test synchronised and stable flow with respect to its potential impacts. Numerical simulations verify that the model is able to simulate transient supply chain phenomena. Moreover, a quantification method relating to the fundamental link between synchronisation, stability, and productivity of supply chains has been found.</jats:p>"

In demand-driven truckload shipment businesses, third-party logistics companies (or agencies) try to assign orders to the most appropriate trucks which are available for the load assignment. Efficiency and the effectiveness of the load consolidation decisions directly affect the success of any logistics operation. This is mainly because the utilization of the transportation vehicles directly affects the cost of transportation services provided. Agent-based concepts are considered as novel system approaches which have effective mechanisms for modeling dynamic systems like the truck load consolidation decisions within third party logistics operations. In this paper, truck load consolidation decisions are designed by utilizing Prometheus Design Tool (PDT) which is based on Prometheus design methodology and developed for specifying and designing agent-oriented software systems.</p>",

The study argues that even though greater economic wealth may encourage people to buy legal software instead of using pirated software, the ease of access to pirated copies in the open market as a result of corruption can have a stronger influence on the decision to use pirated software. The empirical results also reveal that while an increase in economic wealth can reduce software piracy, its effect tends to be moderated by the level of corruption in a country. These results indicate that a pricing strategy that makes software more affordable is not a sufficient policy for combating software piracy. Additional policies aimed at combating corruption should be implemented concomitantly for effective resolution of this problem.</jats:p>"

This may entail an intention to change the service provider or alter the scope of an outsourcing arrangement. Service performance and facilitating factors, notably good inter-firm relationships, play a key role in predicting outsourcing relationship continuity. By contrast, it is the failure in personal service performance that is the critical factor behind the buyer’s intention to switch the service provider. The buyer’s intention to extend the scope of outsourcing does not show a significant relationship with any of the antecedent factors. The study is based on survey data of 235 industrial companies in Finland. Multivariate methods including factor analysis and regression equations are used to test the relationships between the antecedent factors and the various aspects of loyalty or disloyalty in logistics outsourcing arrangements.</jats:p>"

The decision on the appropriate logistics partner is considered significant for the chain efficiency. The managerial problem relies in the providers’ efforts to broaden their service portfolio, thus erasing controversies concerning the identification of their core competences. This issue mainly lies in the selection among an International Freight Forwarder (IFF), a Third Party Logistics Provider (3PL), and a Fourth Party Logistics Provider (4PL). The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the characteristics and services offered by the LSPs, present the benefits and drawbacks from the collaboration with each entity, and finally form a framework regarding their representative features. The framework is articulated based on literature review and aims to provide a guideline to the interested chain members, enabling them to assess their needs against the LSPs’ characteristics.</jats:p>"

An extensive literature review is conducted to present a synergy model to develop Asian airline competitiveness, safety and service quality. The literature review is highlighted to seek the relationships between internal marketing and internal service quality and identify whether the relation of supplier can moderate them. The review reveals that a synergy model based on internal marketing, internal service quality and supplier relations can overcome the Asian industrial phenomenon, especially in maintaining the service consistency and competitiveness. This model is needed for developing airline service and safety. Research in airline business is critical, as the quality of the airline service is declining in contrast with this industry’s growth. This paper provides insight into two important suppliers needed for the success of the airline industry.</jats:p>"

The CBRTA sponsored a study by Stellenbosch University (SU) to determine the logistics cost impact of cross-border delays between South Africa and its major neighbouring trading partners, and prioritise opportunities for improvement. SU is the proprietor of both a comprehensive freight demand model and a logistics cost model for South Africa, which enable extractions and extensions of freight flows and related costs for specific purposes. Through the application of these models, the following information is identified and presented in this paper: South Africa’s most important border posts (based on traffic flows); a product profile for imports and exports through these border posts; the modal split (road and rail); the annual logistics costs incurred on the corridors feeding the border posts, as well as the additional costs incurred due to border delays. The research has proved that the streamlining of border-post operations that take a total supply chain view (i.e. of both border operations and those that could be moved from the border) is beneficial.</jats:p>"

Málinec is one of the three storages in this region. In protected zone of this storage are planted Norway spruce (hereinafter „spruce“) stands monocultures because of ensuring required water quality in storage. There are 24 years old spruce stands without admixture of deciduous trees in the upper layer. Understory is formed by blackthorn (PRP 1). On this locality was carried out geometric (schematic) thinning what is not recommended in protected zones because of worse influencing of soil permeability, humus decomposition and open forest edge creating. There was identified one older permanent research plot (PRP) and established one new PRP where was performed own measurements. Into the PRPs there are transekts and remaining area. Acreage of PRP is 0,234 and 0,315 ha. On the whole area were measured tree diameter and assessed tree classes (5 degrees–Polanský 1955). Moreover, on transekts were measured tree and also crown height. Based of measured variables were calculated stand characteristics like slenderness ratio, crown ratio, growing stock and basal area. If it is possible, these were compared with older results. The aim of this work is evaluation of spruce stands structure and their stability after schematic thinning. This kind of silvicultural treatment is absolutely unfit in stands with specific (water-protested) function (Slodičák et al. 2010). These stands are from the perspective of static stability too unfit–basal area and abundance of trees is nearly as in yield tables (Kolektív 1992) but growing stock is much higher and a lot of trees is too slim. The slenderness ratio is from 75 to 90 %. But the crown lenght is quite good with crown ratio 52–64 %. In these ages of stands are crowns reduced too much. Suitable individual thinning has been in these stands neglected (growing stock is higher than normal). There is assumed reduced stand lifetime after schematic thinning. Current stand structure is due to the young age inappropriate. </jats:p>"

It is largely grown under flooded cultivation when NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> is the main form of available soil N. The root knot nematode, <jats:italic>Meloidogyne graminicola</jats:italic>, can cause serious damage to rice crops and disturb N uptake and translocation. We have investigated if the N supply form can influence the susceptibility of rice to this important pest. Roots supplied with a 100-fold lower supply of calcium nitrate (0.1 mM Ca(NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) showed a higher level of nematode infection as measured by the gall index.

Furthermore, when the cellular responses to NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> were compared, these also showed significantly smaller nitrate transport activity in nematode-infected roots (4.7 ± 1.2 mV) when compared with non-infected control plants (11.9 ± 3.4 mV). Taken together, the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> influx and electrophysiological measurements clearly showed that the root NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> transport activity was severely decreased in nematode-infected roots.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nAster tripolium L. is a salt marsh halophyte that has recently gained interest as a cash crop vegetable. Leaf yield and quality were investigated in plants grown with salinity in experiments with Perlite in pots and in plots on dune sand. Plants were repetitively harvested in a 14-day cycle. A. tripolium irrigated with 50 mM NaCl exhibited the highest yield when grown in pots, whereas in the plot experiment no significant differences in biomass accumulation occurred up to 80 mM NaCl in the irrigation water. Chemical leaf composition changed with salinity, exhibiting higher levels of electrical conductivity, total soluble solutes and the non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds ascorbic acid and polyphenols compared with control plants grown without NaCl supplementation. Using the repetitive harvest regime, leaf chlorosis occurred, a symptom shared by deficiencies in either nitrogen or iron. Comparative applications of five iron chelate formulations in plants grown with 50 mM NaCl in pots revealed improved leaf colour and chlorophyll content for only two of the applied Fe-chelates. Concomitantly with leaf colour restoration, the activity of nitrate reductase, the first enzyme during nitrate assimilation, which requires heme-iron for its proper function, increased 3-fold as a result of the iron treatment in the plot experiment. Importantly, the enhancement of nitrate reductase activity was associated with a considerable decrease in the leaf nitrate concentration. Therefore, we concluded that iron deficiency, in addition to leaf chlorosis, reduces A. tripolium leaf quality as a vegetable by increasing the leaf nitrate content. Furthermore, nitrate reductase (NR) activity levels in A. tripolium leaves may act as an indicator of iron deficiency that manifests itself as reduced nitrate content owing to the higher NR activity upon proper iron nutrition. These results demonstrate the importance of salinity level and the application of an appropriate iron-chelating formulation to generate marketable yields of Aster tripolium leafy vegetable when grown commercially on dune sand.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent years saw the global wave of new low-carbon economy which is a strategic measure to cope with global warming, and it has gained concerns from many governments. As the representatives of developing countries, China is responsible for “common but distinguishing duty for global climate change.” Many policies have been made to develop low-carbon economy with the hope to advocate and innovate low-carbon economy in some industries and cities during these years. Therefore, it is a theoretical and innovative project to find a low-carbon economical model for various industries and carry out the experiments of low-carbon economy in some cities. Hence, guided by low-carbon economy theory, choosing booming Chinese tourism industry as the object, this paper constructs an operation framework system of low-carbon tourism development from the advantage of low-carbon tourism to the proposal of low-carbon tourism definition so as to conclude an execution scheme of “six elements” of low-carbon tourism with selecting OCT East (Chinese national ecotourism demonstration district) and Mt. Danxia (World Geo-park) as demonstration districts to discuss about models and methods of low-carbon economy in tourism.</jats:p>"

Endogeneity of supply with respect to demand provides a strong motivation for a vigorous policy response to a weakening in aggregate demand, and we present optimal-control simulations showing how monetary policy might respond to such endogeneity in the absence of other considerations.

Supply chain risks emanate from multiple sources and similarly risk mitigation in supply chains is dependent on several variables. The most difficult part of supply chain risk management is prioritizing risks and an understanding of the relationships among various types of risks and risk mitigation variables. Drawing from the standard framework, in this research a modified house of quality is developed to understand the relationships between various supply chain risks and risk mitigation variables. It helps to prioritize various risks and understand the current status of the supply chain and the deficient areas with regard to risk mitigation capabilities. The structured QFD process provides the supply chain managers a conceptual map that enables the improvement of planning and control of various risks that could impact a supply chain.</p>",

The participant enterprises are required to provide their own ontologies so as to to obtain semantic matches between the services and justify their semantic interoperability. As a result, in terms of two indicators (i.e., precision and agility), we have shown that the proposed framework outperforms traditional enterprise collaboration schemes.</jats:p>"

The experimental factors were as follows: 1. type of sowing – mixed sowing and pure sowing; 2. water supply – plants supplied with water to meet their full requirements and 50% water supply reduction. The study covered five phenological development stages (BBCH) of spring barley: emergence (10–13), tillering (22–25), stem elongation (33–37), heading (52–55), and ripening (87–91). The competitive effects were evaluated based on relative yield (RY), relative yield total (RYT), competitive balance (CB), and relative efficiency index (REI). Spring barley and Italian ryegrass competed for resources throughout the growing season. Competition intensity was found to increase until the heading stage, and it decreased towards the end of the growth cycle. More intense competition was observed under reduced water supply. Spring barley dominated over Italian ryegrass from the tillering stage to the ripening stage. In mixed populations, Italian ryegrass captured the available resources more effectively than spring barley from the stem elongation stage until the end of the growing season, particularly in the treatment with optimal water supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Phosphorus (P) is recommended as a supplement for beef cattle grazing rangelands and for dairy cows grazing pastures. However, existing supplementation mechanisms are wasteful, labour intensive, and are becoming increasingly expensive. Cattle have an inability to absorb or retain &gt;70% of the P they consume. Therefore, the need for supplementation could be reduced if the utilisation of dietary P was increased. Vitamin D and its metabolites are involved in the absorption and metabolism of calcium (Ca) and P. However, the use of vitamin D for improving utilisation of P is novel. This review presents information gathered from various studies that demonstrate the potential for vitamin D metabolites to increase P utilisation. The concentration of dietary Ca is demonstrated to be the controlling element for utilisation of endogenous sources of vitamin D. Therefore, the use of exogenous sources of vitamin D in greater than normal concentration is required to overcome the suppression of active absorption mechanisms by normal calcaemia. Use of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in sufficient doses has been shown to increase active absorption of both Ca and P and therefore potentially provide a method of increasing utilisation of existing sources of P or increase the utilisation of P supplements for cattle.</jats:p>"

This industry is important for consumer finance, and we find that ABS related losses at correspondent credit unions are associated with a large contraction in the supply of consumer credit and a hoarding of cash among downstream credit unions. We also find that this contraction in credit supply was concentrated among downstream credit unions that began the crisis with lower capital asset ratios, and that it may have amplified the initial decline in house prices. These results suggest that capital regulation might shape the ability of financial institutions to transmit securities price volatility onto the real economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A supplier facing the prospect of disruption has to decide whether or not to invest in restoration capability. With restoration capability, if disruption occurs, additional costly effort can be exerted to rebuild capacity, although its outcome is uncertain. We study how a firm (buyer) can use incentive mechanisms to motivate a supplier's investment in capacity restoration, and compare this approach with the traditional approach of diversifying part of the order to an expensive but reliable supplier. Under a Restoration Enhancement (RE) strategy, the buyer uses price and/or order quantity incentives to encourage the supplier's restoration investment decision. Two different cases are considered—when the incentive is committed to ex ante (prior to disruption) and when it is committed to ex post (after disruption). In contrast, under a Supplier Diversification (SD) strategy, the buyer splits orders between a reliable supplier and an unreliable supplier to hedge against the disruption risk. Here, the buyer does not provide any separate incentive to the unreliable supplier. Our analysis indicates that under the RE strategy, where the buyer offers incentives, both the buyer and the supplier (weakly) prefer the ex ante commitment over the ex post one. Furthermore, the RE strategy is preferred over the SD strategy when the unreliable supplier's restoration outcome is more predictable or when a high restoration outcome is more likely. However, the buyer's preference for the SD strategy increases as market demand increases. </jats:p>",

The supplier, endowed with all bargaining power, can neither fully coordinate the channel nor extract all of the channel profit. We report on a sequence of laboratory experiments designed to separate possible causes of channel inefficiency. The three causes we consider are inequality aversion, bounded rationality, and incomplete information. It turns out that all three affect human behavior. Inequality aversion has by far the most explanatory power regarding retailers’ behavior. Incomplete information about the retailer's degree of inequality aversion has the most explanatory power in regards to the suppliers’ behavior. Bounded rationality affects both players, but is of secondary importance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

With this, airline managements are able to identify the part of the service process that necessitates outsourcing. The decision to outsource some service processes to the supplier is intended to allow airlines to focus on their core business. This chapter looks at the service encounter approach to analyse the possibility of the innovation during service processes. The results indicate that there are four major groups who have experienced service encounters in which innovations originate and evolve. These four groups interact in the service process which identifies the fact that the service process can be outsourced and innovated (e.g. web-integrated system, mobile phone application for check-in, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), multi-sorting baggage handling system). Airline management has been suggested to make improvement of the services offered by considering safety, cost aspects, and enhance customer service experiences. This effort is expected to come up with an airline business strategy that will create sustainable competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

I argue that the World Bank's agenda was predicated on a set of contradictions (and an untenable public/private binary) that contributed to the emergence of ‘state failure’ arguments by the late 1980s. This perspective enables critical reflection on the historical origins of the concept of ‘state failure’, and on contemporary debates over urbanization, infrastructure, and development. </jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, different tools have been developed to help to the key processes of the supply chain; one of these tools is the e-procurement system, which helps an organization to control the interactions with the most crucial suppliers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter seeks to critically revisit existing third party logistics (3PL) purchasing literature with the aim of bridging the gap between academic research and industry practice regarding logistics outsourcing. This is achieved by focusing on hitherto under-emphasized issues (in the academic literature) relating to the role of the service provider, as opposed to that of the buyer, in 3PL exchange design and management, and the dynamics of the outsourcing process. Drawing on recent developments and practices in the 3PL industry and two in-depth case studies of logistics outsourcing, the study suggests that, under increasing complexity and uncertainty levels, the service provider in interaction with the buying firm significantly influences service definition, design, and evaluation throughout the outsourcing process. The exchanged service is not determined from the outset of the outsourcing process but it is (re)shaped in an iterative and ongoing fashion. Based on such findings, the chapter calls for increased emphasis on a dynamic and inter-organizational (buyer-service provider) perspective into the study of logistics outsourcing processes.</jats:p>"

The subcontractor is modeled as a production/inventory facility that consists of a single, failure-free server and an input buffer with infinite capacity. Jobs arrive continuously to the system at random intervals and have stochastic processing times and due dates. A setup is required when switching from one job type to another. The behaviour of the system, when operating under various rescheduling policies and job dispatching schemes, is investigated using discrete-event simulation in a series of experiments. A reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed for dynamic dispatching rule selection under the completely reactive rescheduling policy. The reinforcement learning controller is applied to two simulation cases with the aim of generating state-dispatching rule mappings that minimize mean tardiness and mean lateness.</jats:p>"

This paper addresses this lacuna by examining the expansion of a rural water-supply network aimed at reducing household water scarcity in the arid zone of Rajasthan, India. Specifically, the Indira Gandhi Canal was conceived and constructed during the green revolution to ‘green the Thar Desert’. But now, through a complex network of reservoirs, treatment facilities, distribution centers, and supply pipelines, it connects much of rural and urban western Rajasthan to a drinking water-supply network. The paper examines the interaction of water-supply technologies, social power relations and dynamic socioecological change operating within these development processes. To do so it draws on household surveys, interviews with water users and government engineers, and participant observation with women and children water collectors. The paper finds that this ongoing water development project rendered the water provision landscape technical on the surface, but that uneven flows of water between villages and people reveal a more complex water provision landscape. The expansion of the network based on a technical reimagining of water supply has resulted in intervillage scarcity, intragender differential access, usurious private water markets, the abandonment and then the proposed rehabilitation of traditional water bodies, and urban water logging. In the conclusion I argue for a rethinking of water-supply development programs through a political ecology approach that focuses on the emergent capacities of water-supply technologies to redirect existing socioecological associations in unanticipated ways. Looking at the relationship between nature—society and technology may illuminate the possible ruptures in these associations and the ways that they may be rearticulated to produce less differentiating modes of accessing water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a supply chain operating under uncertainty, a possible approach to reduce the complexity and scope of the planning process is to organize all involved critical planning decisions in a hierarchical structure. This chapter attempts to explore new ways of integrating production and scheduling plans in a complex supply chain taking into account effects of some specific uncertainty types. In particular, uncertainty types inherent to the demand and to the process or equipment are considered. To deal with demand uncertainty at the strategic level, the safety stock placement problem in supply chains with limited production capacities is investigated. Results of this analysis and its consequences at the design level are reported and discussed. At the tactical level, each stage in the supply chain generates its own aggregate plans in order to balance supply and demand. To deal with uncertainty at this level, some robust deterministic planning models are discussed. These models make use only of the readily available data, such as averages and standard deviations, related to the uncertain planning parameters. At the operational level, the issue of disaggregating the generated robust tactical plans into detailed plans is investigated. A model taking into account the progressive deterioration of the production equipment is discussed. The results of some simulations are also reported and discussed.</jats:p>"

In practice, most manufacturers distribute a line of products with different features and qualities and not just a single product. Consider a manufacturer who distributes a product line through competing downstream retailers. In this setting, we investigate how and why the retailers' price and inventory decisions deviate from the centrally optimal decisions. Due to substitution between different product variants, as well as between different retailers, the incentive problems associated with distributing a product line are more complicated than that of distributing a single product. We characterize retailers' incentive distortions under a residual‐claimancy contract, and construct contracts that achieve channel coordination. We show that retail price floors or inventory buybacks, appropriately tailored to each product variant, are among the contracts that can achieve coordination. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the optimal contract terms (such as wholesale prices and buyback prices) for each variant are influenced by the parameters of an underlying consumer choice model. </jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to quantify current HIV clinical service capacity in Australia. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of records of HIV clinical service capacity in Australia. Participants were general practitioners who completed an annual survey in 2007–2009. Information on the number of hospital departments, sexual health services, antiretroviral-prescribing general practitioners (ARV-GPs) and shared-care services providing expertise in HIV management from 2007 to 2010 were also available. Results: From 2007 to 2009, the proportion of ARV-GP survey respondents treating 2–9 patients with HIV per week increased from 36.5% to 49.1%, with a corresponding decrease in the average proportion who saw less than one patient with HIV per week. The estimated number of PLHIV has increased by 12.5% in metropolitan areas, and 16.5% in rural and remote areas over the period 2007–2010; however, the total number of services with at least one HIV ARV-GP has decreased over the same period. Conclusions: Current methods to estimate clinical service capacity reveal decreasing supply in the workforce in Australia despite increasing numbers of PLHIV. Further training of HIV clinicians and their placement in regions of greatest supply–demand deficits are required. Further studies are required to precisely quantify and locate the capacity of the HIV clinical workforce with expertise in HIV case-management to enable efficient service planning.\n\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections has been greatly reduced by improvements in donor screening and testing. However, newly recognized blood-borne infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA. The prevalence of TTV DNA and HTLV-I varied from 2.7 to 79.5% and from 0.013 to 2.3%, respectively. The WNV-specific IgM antibody and WNV RNA are negative in blood donors. Prevalence rates of SEN-V in Iranian blood donors range from 23 to 90.8%. Consequences of these infectious agents for blood safety are different. Thus, the need to perform laboratory screening as well as effectiveness and efficiency of laboratory tests depend on pathogenicity level and epidemiological conditions of emerging infections. However, being prepared based on the current level of risk and interventions to reduce the risk can be effective in reducing the potential threat for blood supply.</jats:p>"

Using system dynamics (SD) modeling methodology, which is continuous deterministic simulation modeling methodology, we apply control theory concepts to develop a suitable performance functional (or objective function) that optimizes the performance of a retail supply chain. The focus is to develop insights for inventory management to prevent stock-outs and unfilled orders and to fill customer orders at the lowest possible cost to supply chain partners under different scenarios, in a two-player supplier-retailer supply chain. Moderate levels of inventory, defining appropriate performance functional, appear to be crucial in choosing the right policies for managing retail supply chain systems. The study also demonstrated how multiple objectives can be combined in a single performance functional (or objective function) by carefully assigning suitable weights to the components of objectives based on their priority and the existence of possible trade off opportunities.</jats:p>"

Because of the massive amount of data that is generated in the global economy, new tools need to be developed in order to manage and analyze the data, as well as to monitor organizational performance worldwide. This paper proposes a framework of business analytics for supply chain analytics (SCA) as IT-enabled, analytical dynamic capabilities composed of data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. This paper also presents a dynamic-capabilities view of SCA and extensively describes a set of its three capabilities: data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. Next, using the SCM best practice, sales &amp; operations planning (S&amp;OP), the paper demonstrates opportunities to apply SCA in an integrated way. In discussing the implications of the proposed framework, finally, the paper examines several propositions predicting the positive impact of SCA and its individual capability on SCM performance. </jats:p>",

The beech forests from the lower altitude may have a better condition for the beech seeds production. As the granivorous species are peeling the beechnuts, so the peeled diet supply of beech-mast was also stated.

This work aims to\n            find an ordering strategy that is practical and can minimize the bullwhip effect. Five\n            strategies with different levels of information about inventory and components along the\n            supply line have been compared with the just in time (JIT) pull strategy and the usage\n            of point of sale (POS) data. This work uses the beer game spreadsheet simulation\n            developed by Adams, Flatto, and Gardner (2008). The simulation shows material and\n            information flow in a four-echelon supply chain. Expressions for cost incurred and\n            profit obtained by each player (manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, and retailer)\n            have been developed. Graphs for cost and profit with time are plotted. The strategy\n            using POS data is found to be the best, and the pull strategy to be the next best.\n            However, both require discipline. This study shows that putting information about the\n            inventory levels and components of the supply line into an ordering strategy can also\n            minimize the bullwhip effect.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is increasing concern about the sustainability and environmental impacts of mineral fertilizer use in agriculture. Increased recycling of nutrients via the use of animal and green manures and fertilizers made from domestic organic waste may reduce reliance on mineral fertilizers. However, the relative availability of nutrients (especially nitrogen) is lower in organic compared to mineral fertilizers, which can result in significantly lower yields in nutrient demanding crops such as potato. It is therefore important to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting nutrient use efficiency (yield per unit fertilizer input) from organic fertilizers. Here we show that (a) previous crop management (organic vs. conventional fertilization and crop protection regimes), (b) organic fertilizer type and rate (composted cattle manure vs. composted chicken manure pellets) and (c) watering regimes (optimized and restricted) significantly affected leaf chlorophyll content, potato tuber N-concentration, proteome and yield. Protein inference by gel matching indicated several functional groups significantly affected by previous crop management and organic fertilizer type and rate, including stress/defense response, glycolysis and protein destination and storage. These results indicate genomic pathways controlling crop responses (nutrient use efficiency and yield) according to contrasting types and rates of organic fertilizers that can be linked to the respective encoding genes.</jats:p>"

Using intraday security-level data on Treasury securities, we conduct five event studies to document the presence of local supply effects and duration risk effects. Further, using our new measures of local supply surprise and duration risk surprise we quantify the average impact of these two supply channels on nominal Treasury yields for each of the five events. Finally, we also try to determine how the importance of these factors has changed over time and relative to the first Large Scale Asset Purchase program in 2008-09. We find that: first, once the pre-announcement market expectations are carefully controlled for, the duration risk and local supply channels together are responsible for a decline in yields averaging about 9 basis points per $100 billion over the course of these announcements second, these two channels are almost equally important for the transmission mechanism of purchases, as on average each of these channels accounts for about half of the yields decline third, the efficacy of these two channels does not seem to have declined over time and fourth, the purchase and sale price reactions to the announcements are quite similar, a result potentially relevant for the unwinding of these programs.</jats:p>"

The paper proves that, under the independent and noncoordinated decision patterns, there exists a Nash equilibrium between the supplier and the manufacturer which reduces the supply chain's profit margin. In order to achieve the “optimal” centralized supply chain expected profit margin, new quantity discount models have been established. Both the supplier-oriented and the manufacturer-oriented Stackelberg supply chain gaming models are investigated. Our analytical and numerical analyses show that the quantity discount contract proposed in this paper can largely reduce the negative influence brought by the uncertainty of yields and demand. Therefore, the profit margin of supply chains based on quantity discount can reach the optimal level of the supply chain under the centralized setting.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water supply sources for irrigation, such as rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater, are critically important for agricultural productivity. The current rapid increase in irrigation water use threatens sustainable food production. In this study, we estimated the time-varying dependency of the supply of irrigation water from rivers, large reservoirs with a greater than 1.0 km3 storage capacity, medium-size reservoirs with storage capacities ranging from 1.0 km3 to 3.0 Mm3, and non-local non-renewable blue water (NNBW), particularly taking into account variations in irrigation area during the period 1960–2000. We also estimated the future irrigation water requirements from water supply sources in addition to these four sources, using an irrigation area scenario. The net irrigation water requirements from various supply sources were assessed using the global H08 water resources model. The H08 model simulates water requirements on a daily basis at a resolution of 1.0° × 1.0°. We obtained net irrigation water from rivers and medium-size reservoirs, and determined that the NNBW increased continuously from 1960 to 1985, but the net irrigation water from large reservoirs increased only marginally. After 1985, the net irrigation water from rivers approached a critical limit with the continued expansion of the irrigation area. The irrigation water requirements from medium-size reservoirs and NNBW increased significantly following the expansion of the irrigation area and the increased storage capacity of medium-size reservoirs. Under the irrigation area scenario without climate change, global net irrigation water requirements from additional water supply sources will account for 26% of the total requirements in the year 2050. We found that expansion of irrigation areas due to population growth will generate an enormous demand for irrigation water from additional resources.\n                        </jats:p>"

Relying on a unique set of household‐level data from the state of Punjab, we study the biggest dairy company in the world (Nestlé) in India and compare its vertical spillover effects on upstream suppliers to other market channels (informal sector and cooperatives). We find that farmers that supply informal channels are less efficient and earn lower profits per dairy animal than farmers supplying the cooperative and the multinational sector. Furthermore, we find that farmers using the multinational channel are more efficient than farmers in the cooperative channel, but equally profitable. Hence, we do not find that supplying the cooperative channel is more beneficial for local dairy farmers than supplying the multinational channel. Overall, however, dairy productivity and profitability levels are still dramatically low, with substantial scope for dairy development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Delivery of growth factors or bioactive molecules plays an important role in tissue engineering, as the duration to which these are supplied can modulate the cell fate. Thus, the delivery method plays an important role, and the same is presented in this work wherein the exogenous supply of alpha-ketoglutarate (<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>-KG) gave better results for fast proliferating cells as compared to delivery by microspheres or microspheres incorporated scaffolds which can be used while culturing slow growing cells. All these studies were performed in two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) setups in which chitosan-gelatin-polypyrrole has been used as 3-D scaffolds. Chitosan and gelatin microspheres alone as well as incorporated in the cryogels were characterized. MTT assay done using neuro-2a cell line showed approximately 42% and 70% increment in cellular proliferation when gelatin and chitosan microspheres were added in a 3-D setup, respectively, as compared to the control. Biochemical analysis of ammonia showed 6-fold reductions in ammonia level in a 3-D setup compared to the control. We also studied the synthesis of a neurotransmitter-like glutamate and found that its concentration increased up to 0.25 mg/ml when the microspheres were added exogenously in a 3-D system.</jats:p>"

These are cases that can be addressed by a label propagation process. It is a widely studied approach that may acquire complexity if new constraints in the new unlabeled data that should be taken into account are found. A kernel embedding process together with a simple label propagation algorithm will be the main tools to propagate labels by the use of all types of available information. An experimental study of biofilm development in drinking water pipes propagated through pipes belonging to a complete water supply network is approached. As a result, the proposal is a suitable and efficient way to deal with practical data, based on previous theoretical studies by the constrained label propagation process introduced.</jats:p>"

The results, based on the analysis of data relating to 53 industrial firms operating in Greece, indicate that most users are satisfied with the service providers and believe that this has led to positive developments within the organization. With a high current level of satisfaction, a large number of these firms are likely to increase their usage of 3PL services.</jats:p>"

Additionally, RFID data loggers with sensors are available to perform a cold chain optimization for perishable foods. This paper presents the temperature monitoring solution at the box level in the fish supply chain as part of the traceability system implemented with RFID technology. RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure the temperature of the product and on the box for measuring ambient temperature. The results show that the system is very helpful during the phases of storage and transportation of fish to provide the quality control. The sensor data is available immediately at the delivery to be checked on the mobile RFID reader and afterwards stored in the traceability systems database to be presented on a web to stakeholders and private consumers.</jats:p>"

A confirmed norovirus outbreak in a small rural water supply in the late summer of 2004, which is estimated to have infected over 100 people, is used as a case study. A septic system, 80 m upstream of the water intake, is considered to have contaminated drinking water. Water samples tested were negative for coliform and strongly positive for norovirus. Modelling predicts that a 4.8-log10 removal was possible in the 8 m thick vadose zone, while only a 0.7-log10 and 2.7-log10 removal in the aquifer for viruses and Escherichia coli, respectively. The model results support that the 80 m setback distance was inadequate and roughly 900 m aquifer transport distance was needed to achieve 9-log10 viral removal. Sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameters on model transport removal rate are grain size diameter and groundwater velocity, temperature and acidity. The results demonstrate a need for systematic evaluation of septic systems in rural areas in lesser studied coarse strata at low temperatures, thereby strengthening data used for regulatory requirements for more confident determination on safe setback distances.</jats:p>",

Then, a heuristic adaptive genetic algorithm is presented for the model of franchise chain. For the regular chain model, a two-layer genetic algorithm based on oddment modification is proposed, in which the upper layer is to determine the distribution period and quantity and the lower layer is to seek the optimal order cycle, quantity, distribution routes, and the rational oddment modification number for the distributor. By simulation experiments, the validity of the algorithms is demonstrated, and the two management modes are compared.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In India, Supply Chain Management (SCM) has gained significant importance due to opening up of domestic economy as a result of globalization. However, a review of literature revealed that not many papers are available which attempt to document and understand the importance of SCM within the Indian business context. Hence, the purpose of this research is to fill in this research gap by analyzing the contributions of academicians and practitioners addressing various supply chain issues—specifically from an Indian perspective. Papers focusing on SCM scenario in India were collected from multiple sources by following the established methodologies available in the literature for carrying out such reviews. Furthermore, a new taxonomy was proposed on the basis of content and research methodology utilized. Based on this taxonomy, significant trends were observed and some unique inferences were drawn, apart from identifying the directions for future research. It is hoped that this work would add value by offering a unique contribution to the body of knowledge on SCM, as there is no article available in the literature, which has attempted to summarize the works from India related to SCM. </jats:p>",

To develop new forms of interaction, and governance, researchers with very different backgrounds in social sciences try to align, or at least share, research trajectories. This first paper in a special issue on governance of differential stakeholder interests discusses, first, different usages of stakeholder categories, second, the related intersubjectivity in sciences, third, an rough sketch of the use of stakeholder management in different social sciences. Social science researchers study a wide variety of topics, such as individual stakeholder impact on new business models, stakeholder group responses to health claims, firm characteristics explaining multi-stakeholder dialogue, and the impact of multi-stakeholder dialogue on promoting production systems, and on environmental innovations. Interestingly, researchers use very different methods for data gathering and data analysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A supply chain is a complex network which involves the products, services and information flows between suppliers and customers. A typical supply chain is composed of different levels, hence, there is a need to optimize the supply chain by finding the optimum configuration of the network in order to get a good compromise between the multi-objectives such as cost minimization and lead-time minimization. There are several multi-objective optimization methods which have been applied to find the optimum solutions set based on the Pareto front line. In this study, a swarm-based optimization method, namely, the bees algorithm is proposed in dealing with the multi-objective supply chain model to find the optimum configuration of a given supply chain problem which minimizes the total cost and the total lead-time. The supply chain problem utilized in this study is taken from literature and several experiments have been conducted in order to show the performance of the proposed model; in addition, the results have been compared to those achieved by the ant colony optimization method. The results show that the proposed bees algorithm is able to achieve better Pareto solutions for the supply chain problem. </jats:p>",

In order to coordinate their replenishment policies and jointly optimize their operational costs, the two supply chain partners fully share their relevant information. For this purpose, we develop an integrated inventory replenishment model assuming linear and fixed backorders costs. Then, we use a hybrid geometric-algebraic method to drive the optimal replenishment policy and the minimum supply chain total cost in a closed form.</jats:p>"

In market economy, information asymmetry exists throughout the entirety of supply chains that ought to ensure product safety. Due to the existence of game relations between the government and manufacturers in the aspects of product safety and regulation, the formation of market equilibrium depends on political connections between the government and manufacturers. Based on study and analyses of a static game model and a dynamic game model, this paper reveals that governments and manufacturers must use positive political connections to achieve product protection and supervision of safety throughout the supply chain. On the other hand, negative political connections lead to losses of both governmental credibility and social profits. This study indicates that inherent mechanism of political connections exists in the supply chain; it will help to enrich the theory of supply chain.</jats:p>"

Methods Retrospective analysis of Level C and D consultation provision by general practitioners (GPs) across Australia. Outcome measures were extent (number of consultations per providing GP) and participation (proportion of GPs providing these consultations). Results The proportion of GPs participating in Level C consultation provision is substantial (96%) and constant; however, extent of provision per GP decreased by 21% between 2006 and 2010. Level D participation decreased from 72% during 2006 to a nadir of 62% in 2009, and extent of provision decreased by 26% between 2006 and 2010. Conclusion Two distinct types of change underpinned the overall decline in Level C and D consultation provision. GPs appear to be providing Level C consultations less often, but the overwhelming majority still provide these consultations to some extent. The extent of provision of Level D consultations and the proportion of GPs providing them has decreased; an appreciable number of GPs simply stopped providing Level D consultations. Medicare reforms appear ineffective in realigning Medicare with long-term policy objectives. What is known about the topic? Previous research has demonstrated that GP consultation delivery patterns under Medicare have changed profoundly in recent years, with provision of Level C and D GP consultations having declined substantially. What does this paper add? This research shows that the overall decline in longer consultations is underpinned by distinct supply-side changes: (1) a decrease in average consultation provision per GP (for Levels C and D) and (2) the effective abandonment of Level D consultations by GPs. Medicare reforms do not appear to be entirely effective in addressing these supply changes. What are the implications for practitioners? Despite their centrality to health policy objectives of improved preventive care, chronic disease management and mental healthcare, longer GP consultations are declining in very distinct ways. The ability of the current Medicare model to achieve these health policy objectives appears increasingly questionable.</jats:p>"

This system is composed of a boost converter, a three-phase inverter/rectifier, a bidirectional DC/DC converter, and thyristor switches. The boost converter extracts maximum power from the PV panels and sends it to the DC-link. The bidirectional DC/DC converter is connected between the battery and the DC-link, which leads to an optimized charging/discharging operation. The three-phase inverter/rectifier transmits the power to and from the grid. Also, it operates as a UPS in the islanding mode. The thyristor switches are used for connecting/disconnecting between the grid and the AC load. A 15 kW prototype is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed system.</jats:p>"

This model is based on the view of negotiation spaces (or “areas”), representing the admissible values of the goods involved in the process as convex regions. However, in order to speed up the negotiation process and guarantee convergence, there was the restriction of potential agreements to vertices included in the intersection of the two areas. We present and assess experimentally an extension to Cadoli's approach where, for both participating agents, interaction is no longer vertex based, or at least not necessarily so. This eliminates the asymmetry among parties and the limitation to polyhedral negotiation areas. The extension can be usefully integrated to Cadoli's framework, thus obtaining an enhanced algorithm that can be effective in many practical cases. We present and discuss a number of experiments, aimed at assessing how parameters influence the performance of the algorithm and how they relate to each other. We discuss the usefulness of the approach in relevant application fields, such as, for instance, supply chain management in the fashion industry, which is a field of growing importance in economy and e-commerce.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The bullwhip effect is defined as the distortion of demand information as one moves upstream in the supply chain, causing severe inefficiencies in the whole supply chain. Although extensive research has been conducted to study the causes of the bullwhip effect and seek mitigation solutions with respect to several demand processes, less attention has been devoted to the impact of seasonal demand in multi-echelon supply chains. This paper considers a simulation approach to study the effect of demand seasonality on the bullwhip effect and inventory stability in a four-echelon supply chain that adopts a base stock ordering policy with a moving average method. The results show that high seasonality levels reduce the bullwhip effect ratio, inventory variance ratio, and average fill rate to a great extent; especially when the demand noise is low. In contrast, all the performance measures become less sensitive to the seasonality level when the noise is high. This performance indicates that using the ratios to measure seasonal supply chain dynamics is misleading, and that it is better to directly use the variance (without dividing by the demand variance) as the estimates for the bullwhip effect and inventory performance. The results also show that the supply chain performances are highly sensitive to forecasting and safety stock parameters, regardless of the seasonality level. Furthermore, the impact of information sharing quantification shows that all the performance measures are improved regardless of demand seasonality. With information sharing, the bullwhip effect and inventory variance ratios are consistent with average fill rate results. </jats:p>",

Indian 3PL providers also underperform in key variables that determine performance levels. Other problems identified by the survey are the lack of awareness among Indian shippers, shortage of management talent, inadequate infrastructure, complex documentations, and multiple tax systems. Despite these limitations, the Indian 3PL industry is growing. Many global players are entering the Indian market through direct investments, acquisitions, and alliances. The Indian government is also improving the infrastructure, reducing paperwork, simplifying taxation systems, and implementing economic policies conducive to growth.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In this pilot study water was extracted from samples of two Holocene stalagmites from Socotra Island, Yemen, and one Eemian stalagmite from southern continental Yemen. The amount of water extracted per unit mass of stalagmite rock, termed \"water yield\" hereafter, serves as a measure of its total water content. Based on direct correlation plots of water yields and δ18Ocalcite and on regime shift analyses, we demonstrate that for the studied stalagmites the water yield records vary systematically with the corresponding oxygen isotopic compositions of the calcite (δ18Ocalcite). Within each stalagmite lower δ18Ocalcite values are accompanied by lower water yields and vice versa. The δ18Ocalcite records of the studied stalagmites have previously been interpreted to predominantly reflect the amount of rainfall in the area; thus, water yields can be linked to drip water supply. Higher, and therefore more continuous drip water supply caused by higher rainfall rates, supports homogeneous deposition of calcite with low porosity and therefore a small fraction of water-filled inclusions, resulting in low water yields of the respective samples. A reduction of drip water supply fosters irregular growth of calcite with higher porosity, leading to an increase of the fraction of water-filled inclusions and thus higher water yields. The results are consistent with the literature on stalagmite growth and supported by optical inspection of thin sections of our samples. We propose that for a stalagmite from a dry tropical or subtropical area, its water yield record represents a novel paleo-climate proxy recording changes in drip water supply, which can in turn be interpreted in terms of associated rainfall rates.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of environmental thinking is integrated into sustainable supply chain planning and management for biofuels, and a multiobjective modeling framework is developed. The aim is to seek best-compromise solutions that are economically and environmentally sustainable in supplying biofuels from cellulosic biomasses while satisfying demand, resource, and technology constraints. The least-cost objective and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions are integrated into the modeling framework, and carbon footprints are assessed with the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model, a life-cycle assessment framework, to ensure that strategies to mitigate GHG emissions are factored into system planning and management. Biomass-to-biofuel conversion efficiency can be highly variable because of uncertainties inherent in the conversion processes; this uncertainty is considered explicitly in the integrated modeling framework. A multi-objective, mixed-integer, stochastic programming model is proposed and solved by the compromise method, a subclass of the goal programming method. The model is used to evaluate the economic potential and environmental impact of establishing a cellulosic ethanol supply chain based on biowaste (i.e., corn stover and forest residue) in California as a case study. Significant trade-offs exist between economic competitiveness and environmental quality. The uncertainty inherent in biomass-to-biofuel conversion technology has substantial effects on multicriteria decision making, and the effects may vary with the choice of modeling approaches. </jats:p>",

There are original product and renewal product in the supply chain. A market share shift model for renewal product was firstly built on a increment function and a shift function. Based on the model, the decision-making plane consisting of two variables was divided into four areas. Since the process of product renewal was divided into two stages, Stackelberg-Nash game model and Stackelberg-merger game model could be built to describe this process. The optimal solutions of product pricing strategy of two games were obtained. The relationships between renewal rate, cost, pricing strategy, and profits were got by numerical simulation. Some insights were obtained from this paper. Higher renewal rate will make participants’ profits and total profit increase at the same margin cost. What is more important, the way of the optimal decision making of the SC was that RP comes onto the market with a great price differential between OP and RP.</jats:p>"

This latter is a consequence of the present environmental\n   problems, such as global warming, acid rain, etc. In order to decrease these\n   problems, the use of renewable energy sources is being promoted. But the\n   renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy, present the drawback\n   that there is a mismatch between the energy demand and supply. To cover this\n   mismatch, the use of phase change thermal energy storage systems is required.\n   In this work, the behavior of a packed bed latent heat thermal energy storage\n   system cooperating with solar collector located in south Spain was analyzed\n   by using a numerical method which based on Finite Volume discretization and\n   Enthalpy Method. The model was validated by comparing obtained results with\n   experimental data reported in the literature. The packed bed was composed of\n   spherical capsules filled with phase change materials usable for a solar\n   water heating system. The system was designed according to the conditions in\n   the south Spain and by using commercial components available on the market. A\n   series of numerical simulations were conducted applying meteorological data\n   for several months in south Spain, particularly in M?laga.</jats:p>"

Considering the characteristics of the fourth party logistics supply chain coalition, this paper combines Shapley Value with Distribution according to Contribution, two methods in the application, and then adjusts the profit allocated to each member reasonably based on the actual coalition situation named improved weighted Shapley Value model. In this paper, we first analyze the fourth party logistics supply chain coalition profit allocation models, the classical Shapley value method. Then, we analyze the weight of individual enterprise in the coalition by the analytic hierarchy process. To each enterprise, the weight is determined by the investment risks, information divulging risks, and failure risks. Finally, the numerical study shows that the profit allocation method improved weighted Shapley value model is relatively rational and practical. Thus, the proposed combined model is a useful profit allocation mechanism for the fourth party logistics supply chain coalition that the contribution and risks are fully considered.</jats:p>"

The retailers are risk averse with conditional value at risk (CVaR) as their risk measure, and the manufacturer is a risk-neutral agent. We construct manufacturer-Stackelberg games with retailers, who engage in horizontal price competition. For the multiplicative demand model and expected demand as an exponential function of both prices, we show that there exists the optimal pricing-ordering joint decision uniquely. We then explore the influence of the price sensitivity, risk aversion, and retail competition on optimal decisions and channel efficiency. The results show that retail competition contributes to manufacturer and improves channel efficiency of the decentralized supply chain. When the retailers are more risk averse, the channel efficiency becomes much lower. However, the level of retailers’ risk aversion has no significant impact on the manufacturer’s optimal wholesale price and retailer’s optimal selling price.</jats:p>"

In this paper we argue that practicality is not the only feature that can be addressed by means of stochastic choice theory. This theory also offers a powerful framework for developing a more realistic model for labor supply choices, founded on individuals having preferences over jobs and facing restrictions on the choice of jobs and hours of work. We discuss and clarify how this modeling framework deviates from both the conventional discrete approach [Van Soest, A. (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#joes12003-bib-0066\"/>) Structural models of family labor supply. A discrete choice approach. Journal of Human Resources 30: 63–88), as well as the standard textbook approach based on marginal calculus (Hausman, J.A.

We furthermore discuss how the model based on job choice can be applied to simulate effects of alternative restrictions on hours of work.</jats:p>",

These two most decisive factors transformed not only the economic life of the region but brought about a new era of political economy. Sustained minting of high-quality silver coinage and regular supply of war-horses for maintaining a strong cavalry formed two fundamental tasks for the Sultanate regime particularly in view of the fact that both the items i.e. raw silver and horses were not indigenous and the rulers were wholly depended on import. The primary goal of the paper is to reflect on the silver inflow and outflow into and from Bengal region through 13th to 16th centuries and correlate this with the expenditure faced by the Bengal Sultans on the maintenance of cavalry. *</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Logistics’ role in today’s global and competitive markets is critical for enterprises’ viability, since it can provide the grounds for firms to become leaders of the markets by simultaneously achieving performance maximization and cost minimization. Towards improving competitiveness and achieving their targets enterprises mostly paid attention to production and generally developing their core business. In a way to also achieve high performances in their logistics workload, enterprises often outsource non-core business, such as transportation, warehousing, et cetera. In this light, outsourcing has become lately a very common practice. However, nowadays there are numerous competitive firms that offer such services and decision-making towards selection of the most effective one is usually challenging. Towards this direction, a multi-criteria analysis approach has been developed for the selection of the optimal outsourcing strategy involving a number of service logistics providers. The approach follows the path of an outranking multi-criteria method, namely ELECTRE III. The approach is illustrated through two case studies.</jats:p>"

Six samples were collected from each of six sampling points. The concentration (NMP) of coliforms was determined by Multiple-tube fermentation Technique. The isolates of Escherichia coli obtained from the samples were tested for susceptibility to the antibiotics (cefoxitin, ampicillin, imipenem, gentamicin, and amikacin). Furthermore, was analyzed the presence of diagnostic genes for the diarrheagenic strains of E. coli. None of the genes was identified, however, the recorded concentrations of thermo-tolerant coliforms were within the recommended limits for standing water sources used for public supplies. Nevertheless, the highest concentrations of total and thermo-tolerant coliforms were recorded at two points, one adjacent to the most densely-populated area of the lake margin, and the other near the catchment area for water from the Guamá River. The susceptibility testing indicated the presence of six resistance phenotype profiles, including multi-resistant strains. The results of the study reinforce the need for the systematic monitoring of this water source, in order to provide guidelines for the development of effective management policies for public water supplies, as well as the prevention of water-borne diseases.</jats:p>"

It builds on the authors’ earlier work that developed and evaluated an IDEC system to minimize the overall system costs associated with regional repositioning of empty containers. Based on the benefits, costs and risks perceived by the involved maritime stakeholders on IDEC implementation, the authors identify strategies that may facilitate the building process and establish the system sustainably. They judge and prioritize the strategies in an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework and present results based on their analysis. The authors believe that this research will benefit authorities considering an IDEC implementation strategy and also AHP practitioners.</p>",

An economical sustainability study is being conducted according to the Net Present Value method (NPV), and two types of ventures are studied: an asset based venture, and a non asset based venture. At the end of this chapter, there is a sensitivity analysis with respect to the discount rate that is used in the NPV (Net Present Value) method. The results of this analysis showed that a change of the discount rate has significant consequences on the economics of the project.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are known to facilitate effective acquisition of phosphorus (P) by host plants in low P soils. However, the contribution of mycorrhizal traits to high P-use efficiency in modern-bred maize genotypes is still not clear. In the present study one backcross maize inbred line 224 (bred for high P-use efficiency) was used as the host plant associated with AM fungal species (Rhizophagus irregularis or Glomus mosseae) grown at a range of soil P treatments (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 mg P kg–1, Experiment 1) or foliar P applications (0, 0.025%, 0.5% m/v, Experiment 2). The experiments were to test the hypothesis whether the change point of the mycorrhizal growth and P responsiveness of 224, as well as the expression of ZEAma;Pht1;6 was at or near the optimal P supply level. In addition, different AM inoculants might differ in regulating P uptake of the host. Our results indicated that inbred line 224 was highly responsive to mycorrhizal inoculation. In Experiment 1, root colonisation rate, hyphal length density and alkaline phosphatase increased with the increase of soil P supply level. However, the mycorrhizal growth response (MGR) and P accumulation in shoot (MPR) were greatly affected by soil P supply level and varied between the two fungal species. Maize plants exhibited higher MGR and MPR at lower P supply when inoculated with R. irregularis, and at intermediate P supply when inoculated with G. mosseae. In Experiment 2, shoot P uptake was significantly increased by foliar P supply and inoculation, whereas shoot growth was significantly affected by P supply and the interaction. The expression of the AM-inducible Pi transporter gene ZEAma;Pht1;6 was neither significantly affected by soil (except at 100 mg P kg–1, Experiment 1) or foliar P supply level, nor by fungal species. Root P uptake efficiency (RPUE) was generally greatly increased by mycorrhizal colonisation at all P supply levels in both experiments, and significant correlations were observed between mycorrhizal variables and RPUE in Experiment 1. Our results indicate that the formation of mycorrhizal association could increase RPUE and thus may be partly attributed to high P-use efficiency of inbred line 224. The different responsiveness of mycorrhizal fungi to soil-available P implies the importance for the development of precision strategies to optimise the potential function of AM fungi under different P fertilisation management regime in agricultural soils.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Data from the Cicerone farmlet study were used to quantify the balance between pasture feed supply and the demand from grazing livestock, in terms of metabolisable energy (ME), on three differently managed farmlets (each of 53 ha) on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. Farmlet A had a high level of pasture renovation and higher soil fertility than the other two farmlets and employed flexible grazing management over eight paddocks. Farmlet B was designed to represent management ‘typical’ of the region and had the same grazing management and number of paddocks as farmlet A but moderate levels of pasture renovation and soil fertility. The third farmlet (C) had the same level of inputs as farmlet B but practised intensive rotational grazing over 37 paddocks. Regular measurements of the feed supply, namely herbage mass and quality, pasture growth and supplement fed and of feed demand were assembled to provide monthly estimates of the balance between feed supply and animal demand of all classes of livestock run on the experiment over its duration of 6.5 years. The significantly greater stocking rate, liveweight and reproductive rate of sheep reached on the higher input system (farmlet A) meant higher levels of ME were required to satisfy the nutritional demands of these animals. As only limited measurements were taken of animal intake, it was assumed that the supply of ME was derived from pasture growth and supplement fed. Using key livestock management dates and measurements of liveweights, the changes in the energy requirements of each class of animal were calculated and aggregated to provide an estimate of overall livestock energy demand over time. Subtracting the energy demand from the estimated energy supply provided a partial net energy balance. Measurements of the rates of change of green herbage during grazing events were found to be highly dependent on stock density with farmlets A, B and C recording rates of change of up to –50, –30 and –200 green DM/ha.day, respectively. Over a series of generally drier-than-average years, the ME supplied in pasture growth and through supplementation was at times inadequate to meet the energy demands of the livestock, resulting in periods during winter when the partial energy balance became negative. Similar feed deficits were observed for all three farmlets, suggesting that they were over-stocked to a similar extent. In spite of the divergence in the stocking rate supported by each farmlet, the similarity of the ME balances between farmlets suggests that no farmlet was subjected to bias because of decisions relating to feed supply and demand. The analyses presented suggest there is considerable potential for practical paddock and grazing management to be improved if more timely and regular assessments can be made of changes in the feed energy supply using satellite images of normalised difference vegetation indices and feed energy demand using calculations of the ME required by grazing livestock.</jats:p>"

For a long time, more than 90% of the PV cells were exported to other countries, mainly to European and US region. But in 2012, US government decided to impose high tariffs on solar modules from China, then European Commission will announce their tariffs in 2013. In this context, we discussed the question on how the supply in China will be driven by demand in the following years by analyzing the driving forces for domestic demand in past 10 years, the structure and status of PV supply chain in China, and the future domestic demand to 2020. The point made by this study is that about half of current capacity in China will survive to next wave of strong demand. But the premise is that Chinese government should make more efforts to clear technical and nontechnical barriers for grid connection. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which the adoption of RFID can improve supply chain performance in agri-food supply chains. The methodology was a case study of a fruit cooperative using semi-structured interviews and other sources of evidence in order to examine the supply chain performance before and after the RFID implementation. Benefits from the RFID implementation were classified into two broad categories: strategic and operation ones. Strategic benefits included: reduction of the warehouse costs; reduction of total lead time from production to sales; improvement of customer relationship management; improved recall management. Operational benefits included: Better handling of unforeseen events; reducing lead times in warehousing and inventory; improved quality control. </jats:p>",

First, the paper describes the representation method of cluster supply chain resilience. Second, a cluster supply chain network structure generation model is proposed. And based on cascading effect model, it makes analysis of dynamic evolution process when cluster supply chain failure happens. Then it focuses on the self-organization characteristic, which contributes to cluster supply chain emergence overall resilient recovery through local self-organization reconstruction behavior. We also make theoretical analysis of cluster supply chain network characteristics and its effect on the resilience, which helps to illustrate that the root of vulnerability lies in cascading failure while self-organization is the key to resilient recovery. Besides, with the study of self-organization characteristic, it provides theoretical guidance for local control and further achievement of overall resilient optimization.</jats:p>"

Based on this, the peak shaving reserve mechanism was designed to probe into the countermeasures against the coal-electricity price conflicts. The study revealed that in the boom seasons of coal demand, the initiatives of the coal enterprises to supply thermal coal and the electricity enterprises to order thermal coal are reduced under conditions of double price regulations. However, under the circumstances of coal price marketization, in the boom seasons of coal demand the thermal coal price may go up obviously, the initiatives of the coal enterprises to supply thermal coal are increased, and meanwhile the initiatives of the power enterprises to order thermal coal are decreased dramatically. The transportation capacity constraint of coal supply leads to the evident decrease of the initiatives of coal enterprises for the thermal coal supply. The mechanism of peak shaving reserve of thermal coal may not only reduce the price of coal market but also increase the enthusiasm of the power enterprises to order more thermal coal and the initiatives of the coal enterprises to supply more thermal coal.</jats:p>"

The paper aims to design an optimal hub location network to serve food consumption markets through efficient connections with production sites. These optimal locations can be compared with the current locations of hubs to determine whether changes could lead to greater efficiencies. The model is mathematically formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. The model minimizes the total network costs, which include the transportation of goods and the construction of hubs. The mathematical program considers several constraints on travel distance, hub capital cost and capacity, road condition, and transportation cost. Several experiments are conducted to test the sensitivity of the model to changes in parameters such as the food's average travel distance, the maximum hub capacity, and the transportation cost. Then, a real-world application is made to the Northeast United States livestock industry. Finally, the results show the effect of the changes in model parameters on the optimal hub network design (i.e., the number of hubs and the selection of hub locations). </jats:p>",

The aim of the present study was the assessment of selected parameters of speech with and without resection prostheses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patients and Methods: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The speech sounds of 22 patients suffering from maxillary and mandibular defects were recorded using a digital audio tape (DAT) recorder with and without resection prostheses. Evaluation of the resonance and the production of the sounds /s/, /sch/, and /ch/ was performed by 2 experienced speech therapists. Additionally, the patients completed a non-standardized questionnaire containing a linguistic self-assessment. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;After prosthesis supply, the number of patients with rhinophonia aperta decreased from 7 to 2 while the number of patients with intelligible speech increased from 2 to 20. Correct production of the sounds /s/, /sch/, and /ch/ increased from 2 to 13 patients. A significant improvement of the evaluated parameters could be observed only in patients with maxillary defects. The linguistic self-assessment showed a higher satisfaction in patients with maxillary defects. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In patients with maxillary defects due to ablative tumor surgery, an increase in speech performance and intelligibility is possible by supplying resection prostheses.</jats:p>"

In a supply chain, risks are mostly created by fluctuations. The aim of this study is to adopt a strategy for eliminating or reducing risks in a supply chain network. Having various solutions helps the supply chain to be resilient. Therefore, five alternatives are considered, namely, total quality management (TQM), leanness, alignment, adaptability, and agility. This paper develops a new network of supply chain risks by considering the interactions between risks. Perhaps, the network elements have interacted with some or all of the factors (clusters) or subfactors. We constitute supply chain risks in the analytic network process (ANP), which attracted less attention in the previous studies. Most of the studies about making a decision in supply chains have been applied in analytic hierarchy process (AHP) network. The present study considers the ANP as a well-known multicriteria decision making (MCDM) technique to choose the best alternative, because of the interdependency and feedbacks of different levels of the network. Finally, the ANP selects TQM as the best alternative among the considered ones.</jats:p>"

This article investigates the differences in the business models of SFSCs that may be attributed to the initiator-stakeholder, interacting with other stakeholders. Essential to business models are the value proposition, value creation and value capture, but it is the ambition of the initiator-stakeholder that starts a SFSC. Initiator-stakeholders of 57 SFSCs were interviewed on a combination of both multiple choice and open questions. The data converges on three categories of business models. First and foremost, a large majority of SFSCs is driven by the aim of the initiator-stakeholder to increase economic viability, uses the market as governance structure, resulting in profit margins likely to be above margins in conventional business. Two other categories of business models of SFSCs group around the theme of producer-support, and, producer-consumer interaction, respectively. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a mixed-product assembly line, material supply is very complicated, dynamically changing and error-prone due to large material flow. These uncertainties often cause some imperceptible Abnormal Logistics States (ALSs), which seriously hinder accurate and efficient delivery of materials to the assembly lines. There is no relevant theoretical model and efficient information collection technology so far. This paper aims to detect those imperceptible abnormal logistics states in mixed-product assembly lines through a novel RFID-based multi-deviation detection approach. Some ALSs' parameters are defined from different perspectives such as time, location, number, sequence and path. A calculation model of ALSs has been built by processing RFID data, then a RFID-based multi-deviation model is presented to quantify the abnormal degree of ALSs. Based on the developed models, a judging algorithm for ALSs of material supply is proposed. Compared to conventional eKanban monitor system, the proposed approach can detect the ALSs of material supply efficiently and accurately, including those that are difficult to detect in eKanban monitor system. </jats:p>",

The performed analysis highlighted some critical aspects in the management of the whole supply chain, from the land to the table of the end consumer, and allowed us to reengineer the most important processes. In particular, the first steps of the supply chain, which include cultivation in greenhouses and manufacturing of packaged vegetables, were analyzed. The re-engineered model was designed by exploiting the potentialities derived from the combined use of innovative Radio Frequency technologies, such as RFID and NFC, and important international standards, such as EPCglobal. The proposed tracing and tracking system allows the end consumer to know the complete history of the purchased product. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential benefits of the reengineered processes in a real supply chain, a pilot project was implemented in an Italian food company, which produces ready-to-eat vegetables, known as<jats:italic>IV gamma</jats:italic>products. Finally, some important metrics have been chosen to carry out the analysis of the potential benefits derived from the use of the re-engineered model.</jats:p>"

The study examines the efficiency of the logistics service providers, and its impact on the overall client performance, evaluated through interviews with the 3PL Coordinator, the Logistics Manager, and the Manufacturing Director. The key findings of the work are that logistics outsourcing takes responsibility for non-core business functions, brings reductions of stocks and costs as well as order-to-delivery lead-time, accelerates capital turnover and capitalizes on synergies to achieve efficiency. Overall, its contribution is evaluated by the client as satisfactory and of medium significance, with room for improvements.</jats:p>"

As the design and implementation of services requires interaction between buyer and 3PL, the 3PLs are in a critical position to support the efforts towards greening operations of different supply chain participants. However the literature in this field reflects a gap between the perspectives of buyers and 3PLs. This chapter attempts to fill this void through an explorative case study analysis on the environmental attitude of 3PLs in order to derive implications for buyers’ behavior. The results indicate that the buyer’s role is critical in different ways in the development of green initiatives among 3PLs. An increased orientation towards longer-term contracts and joint development would likely enhance the level of green initiatives. Indirectly, the buyer has the opportunity to influence its 3PLs through interaction with employees on different levels in the company, including top management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The equitable distribution of transit services is a major concern of transportation planners and policy makers worldwide. In the United States, planners are required by executive order to consider equity concerns when investing in new transportation infrastructure and services. However, equity can be difficult to assess in a consistent, objective, and quantitative way. Australian researchers recently developed a single, systemwide measure that reflects the equity of transit service distribution in a metropolitan area. This measure, known as a Gini coefficient, measures specifically how well transit supply meets transit demand. Transit supply is measured with a modified form of an established supply index, and demand is estimated with population and employment data. Although the idea of a single measure for assessing the equity of a transit system is appealing, researchers and practitioners must be careful when they implement Gini coefficients for comparative purposes. This research investigated the effect of selecting various scales, boundaries, and demand measures for calculating Gini scores for interregional comparisons. Gini coefficients were calculated for six urban transit systems within two boundaries (metropolitan statistical area and transit service area) at two scales (census tract and block group) with two demand measures (population and population plus employment). Results suggest that calculations with Gini coefficients on the basis of various boundary definitions can lead to drastically different comparative results, whereas the different scales and demand measures had little impact on interregional comparisons. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An integrated intervening opportunities model (IIOM) was developed for public transit (PT) trips. This model is generation–distribution and supply-dependent, with single constraints only on trip production values for work and study PT trips made during morning peak hours (6:00 to 9:00 a.m.) within the Island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Several data sets, including the 2008 origin–destination survey of the Greater Montreal Area, 2006 census of Canada, General Transit Feed Specification network data, and school enrollment data, along with the geographical data of the Greater Montreal Area, were used. The IIOM is a nonlinear model with sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and PT supply characteristics, as well as work and study spatial location attributes. Analysis of the modeling performance by means of several goodness-of-fit measures showed that the IIOM was well behaved (i.e., globally it had good prediction capabilities) and more accurate than the classical gravity model. On the basis of explanatory variables used in the IIOM, the study presents a new tool for PT analysts, planners, and policy makers for studying potential changes in PT trip patterns, as a result of changes in sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, PT supply, and so on. Also, this study opens new opportunities for development of more accurate PT demand models with new emergent data such as smartcard entries. </jats:p>",

TFA was detected in all samples, except for four samples including one plain bread, one sponge cake, and two batter‐made foods (egg roll and eggette) samples. For those found to contain detectable TFA, the content ranged up to 4.7 g/100 g of food or 17.3% of total lipids. On a per 100 grams of food basis, the highest mean TFA content among the 18 food subgroups was the doughnuts/French toast subgroup (0.95 g), followed by the other pastries subgroup (0.49 g) and the bread with filling/topping subgroup (0.44 g). Among the samples, the highest TFA content is from a doughnut (4.7 g/100 g), followed by two cream‐filled bread with shredded coconut (1.8 and 1.4 g/100 g) and a sweetheart cake (1.7 g/100 g). Only consuming one whole piece of doughnut would have reached 100% of the maximum daily TFA intake as recommended by WHO based on a 2000 kcal diet. About 78% of samples had TFA ≤0.3 g/100 g food. For the majority of the food samples available in Hong Kong, if TFA was present, C18:1 trans would possibly be the predominant one.</jats:p>",

The aim of\n   this paper was to investigate the enhanced efficiency of excess sludge\n   hydrolysis by the addition of thermophilic Bacillus sp. Hnu under different\n   oxygen supply conditions. The results indicated that higher temperature and\n   more oxygen supply was advantageous to the volatile suspended solid removal\n   ratio with the same effect to that of protease activity. The maximum volatile\n   suspended solid removal ratio was achieved at 21.5 %, 42.5 %, and 54.4 %\n   after 108 h digestion at pH 6.9 and 60?C and increased by 17.2 %, 38 %, and\n   45.4 % under anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic conditions compared with\n   the control test, respectively. The hydrolysis rate constants for the\n   anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic conditions were 3, 4.8, and 7 times\n   (40?C) and 3.5, 9.8, and 11.8 times (50?C) and 2.7, 7.2, and 10.3 times\n   (60?C). Hydrolysis performance indicated that the Bacillus sp. Hnu could\n   accelerate the hydrolysis rate. The kinetic study showed that the hydrolysis\n   of sludge with Bacillus sp.

The aim of the present study was to compare genome-wide placental gene expression between rat dams fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and those fed a control diet for 3 weeks before conception and during gestation. Gene expression was measured by microarray and pathway analysis was performed. Gene expression differences were replicated by real-time PCR and protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis. Placental and fetal weights at E17.25 were not altered by exposure to the maternal HFD. Gene pathways targeting placental growth, blood supply and chemokine signalling were up-regulated in the placentae of dams fed the HFD. The up-regulation in messenger RNA expression for five genes <jats:italic>Ptgs2</jats:italic> (fatty acid cyclo-oxidase 2; COX2), <jats:italic>Limk1</jats:italic> (LIM domain kinase 1), <jats:italic>Pla2g2a</jats:italic> (phospholipase A2), <jats:italic>Itga1</jats:italic> (integrin α-1) and <jats:italic>Serpine1</jats:italic> was confirmed by real-time PCR. Placental protein expression for COX2 and LIMK was also increased in HFD-fed dams. In conclusion, maternal HFD feeding alters placental gene expression patterns of placental growth and blood supply and specifically increases the expression of genes involved in arachidonic acid and PG metabolism. These changes indicate a placental response to the altered maternal metabolic environment.</jats:p>"

This aquifer provides the majority of recharge to Blue Lake, a groundwater-fed volcanic crater lake, used for Mount Gambier’s drinking water supply. However, concern remains regarding the risk posed by contaminants within stormwater, in particular when stormwater recharge may ultimately contribute to a source of drinking-water supply. The present research examined the role of the annual calcite precipitation in the lake, in protecting the quality of its water supply, by examining the composition of particulate matter in the lake and on the lake bottom. The sediment did not reveal negative impacts of stormwater recharge, but did highlight the increase in erosion as a result of settlement and extensive land clearing for agriculture at the time of settlement. Analysis of lake-floor sediment revealed increased accumulation of the lithogenic elements within the lake-floor sediment during this interval, owing to the cleansing capacity of the calcite precipitation cycle. Extraction of water from Blue Lake for water supply has resulted in a reduced water residence time in the lake and a three-fold increase in the accumulation of calcium carbonate on the lake floor.\n</jats:p>"

Most of the existing solutions have been designed without considering the difficulties of deploying traceability systems in the storehouses currently working, not dealing with specific needs, such as environment characteristics or time required to be handled by workers. In this paper, in order to test the viability of its application, a first prototype of a traceability system capable of checking the content of pallets loaded with electronic devices is presented. It is based on ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) technology using passive tags. A holistic approach has been adopted to design the system: it begins with a radioelectrical characterization of the environment where the check points will be implemented, continues with the integration of a set of data acquisition and wireless communication devices, and ends with a logistics information system able to provide final user services. The combination of physical layer analysis with a top layer system view can aid the planning as well as operational phase of this type of RFID system within a logistic chain.</jats:p>"

At the time of admission, the patient had active gastric ulcers, but these were resolved by treatment with a proton pump inhibitor. Subtotal esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction was performed. Visually, the reconstructed gastric tube appeared to be well perfused with blood. Using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging the gastroepiploic vessels were well enhanced and no enhancement was visable 3 to 4 cm from the tip of the gastric tube. Four days after esophagectomy, gastric tube necrosis was confirmed, necessitating a second operation. The necrosis of the gastric tube matched the area that had been shown to lack blood perfusion by ICG angiography imaging. It seems that ICG angiography is useful for the evaluation of perfusion in a reconstructed gastric tube.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Brantas River catchment on the Indonesian island of Java is among the most densely-populated regions in the world. Damming of the river and intensive agriculture in the catchment are supposed to affect the biogeochemistry and ecology of the river, its reservoirs and coastal waters. We collected water, suspended matter and phytoplankton samples from the Sutami and the Selorejo lakes, two major reservoirs in the catchment, in May 2001 and June 2002. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic nutrients and suspended matter was analyzed for carbon and nitrogen contents and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition. Phytoplankton cells were counted, identified and grouped into four major classes. Both reservoirs displayed clear signs of eutrophication as shown by high nutrient concentrations and high phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton abundance was generally higher in the Sutami than in the Selorejo reservoir and in the Sutami reservoir it was much higher in June 2002 than in May 2001. Phytoplankton responded to the amount and composition of nutrients in such a way that diatoms dominated when silicate concentrations and N/P ratios were high in the Sutami reservoir in May 2001. </jats:p><jats:p> The mass occurrence of the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes in the Selorejo reservoir was probably responsible for a high uptake of dissolved nutrients resulting in an N/P ratio &lt;8. This favoured the growth of cyanobacteria which can fix atmospheric nitrogen. Excessive phytoplankton growth in the Sutami reservoir in June 2002 led to a drastic silicate reduction (165 μM in May 2001, 95 μM in June 2002). This and an N/P ratio &lt;4 consequently resulted in a much lower abundance of diatoms and a much higher abundance of cyanobacteria than in May 2001. The biogenic extraction of silicate by diatoms in reservoirs has often been observed in high latitude regions where it, in combination with high anthropogenic additions of nitrogen and phosphorus and a lack of silicate replenishment downstream of reservoirs, leads to eutrophication of coastal waters and a shift from biomineralizing to nonbiomineralizing phytoplankton. Because of the high weathering rates in the tropical Brantas River catchment, silicate concentrations in the downstream portion of the river were as high as in the headwaters and coastal phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms despite nutrient extraction in reservoirs. It indicates that human activities in river catchments in the humid tropics affect coastal ecosystems in a different way than in high latitude regions. </jats:p>",

Particular attention was focused on the first steps of the supply chain, which include cultivation in greenhouses and manufacturing of packaged vegetables, known as IV gamma products (i.e., goods ready to be consumed), because they represent crucial points of the considered supply chain. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the current business processes was performed exploiting the experience of a big Italian company, with several locations and different brands. This analysis highlighted some critical aspects in the management of the whole supply chain, from the land to the table of the end-consumer, and allowed us to perform an efficient re-engineering of the main business processes. The re-engineered model was designed by exploiting the potentialities derived from the combined use of innovative technologies, including EPCglobal, RFID, NFC, and DataMatrix. Moreover, this work has led to the definition of important guidelines able to substantially improve both the culture techniques and the vegetables transformation procedures, based on strategic concepts such as precision agriculture, item-level traceability, and integration of heterogeneous Information Systems (IS). The proposed tracing and tracking system, based on EPCglobal standard, is able to guarantee to end-consumer the ability to know the entire history of the purchased product. Moreover, in order to evaluate the potential benefits of the re-engineered processes in a real supply chain, some metrics able to compare the current (AS IS) and reengineered (TO BE) models were considered. In particular, the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) method has been chosen to carry out this analysis on the pilot project implemented in the chosen company. Experimental results allowed us to derive a realistic estimate of the selected performance indicators for the re-engineered model. </jats:p>",

Loss of this nutrient supply is thought to lead to disc degeneration, but how nutrient supply influences viable cell density is unclear. We investigated two factors that influence nutrient delivery to disc cells and hence cell viability: disc height and blood supply. We used bovine caudal discs as our model as these show a gradation in disc height. We found that although disc height varied twofold from the largest to the smallest disc studied, it had no significant effect on cell density, unlike the situation found in articular cartilage. The density of blood vessels supplying the discs was markedly greater for the largest disc than the smallest disc, as was the density of pores allowing capillary penetration through the bony endplate. Results indicate that changes in blood vessels in the vertebral bodies supplying the disc, as well as changes in endplate architecture appear to influence density of cells in intervertebral discs.</jats:p>",

The relatively short shelf life of fresh products forces to maintain a punctual control of the rotation of cases in the warehouse. The implementation of an RFID system enables to real time monitor the supply chain processes an item is subject to; in particular, the present work focuses on the process of shelf replenishment, by moving cases from the backroom to the shop floor. By means of an accurate monitoring of this process, the errors caused by noncompliance with the FIFO policy were pointed out, and the economic savings resulting from the use of RFID technology in that context were evaluated. Results show that the deployment of RFID technology has potential to help manage the FIFO policy of fresh products, thus generating interesting savings for the food supply chain. </jats:p>",

Some simplifications are derived from the various levels of granularity at which a network can be considered. This is the case of some demand simplifications, specifically, when consumptions associated with a line are equally allocated to the ends of the line. In this paper, we present examples of situations where this kind of simplification produces models that are very unrealistic. We also identify the main variables responsible for the errors. By performing some error analysis, we assess to what extent such a simplification is valid. Using this information, guidelines are provided that enable the user to establish if a given simplification is acceptable or, on the contrary, supplies information that differs substantially from reality. We also develop easy to implement formulae that enable the allocation of inner line demand to the line ends with minimal error; finally, we assess the errors associated with the simplification and locate the points of a line where maximum discrepancies occur.</jats:p>"

The effect of parameters on the bullwhip effect under three forecasting methods is analyzed and the bullwhip effect under three forecasting methods is compared. Conclusions indicate that different forecasting methods lead to different bullwhip effects caused by lead time, underlying parameters of the demand process, market competition, and the consistency of demand volatility between two retailers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper shows how to leverage RFID technology in fresh fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, and, in particular, to optimally manage stock levels on shelves, shelves replenishment, and shrinkage prevention for fresh perishable products. We deployed a pilot project on a FMCG retail supply chain, encompassing a distribution centre and two stores of a major Italian retailer. About 60 products have been RFID tagged at case level. We real time tracked cases of products for 4 months, through the distribution chain all the way to the stores, where the RFID deployment made it possible to punctually monitor shelves stock levels, backroom stock levels and product shrinkage. We demonstrate that the out of stock (OOS) problem is just one piece of a broader picture, that is shelves stock optimization. The higher the stock level on the shelves, the lower the need for shelf replenishment, and thus the likelihood of an OOS. However, the capital holding costs and the risk for product shrinkage increase. The latter issue is particularly relevant for fresh perishable products. This pilot demonstrates that a retailer could reduce OOS, shrinkage and capital holding costs all together, by means of efficient RFID data management. Potential savings for fresh products account approx 1.7% of sale turnover. This study is the first pilot project which assesses the impact of RFID technology on the supply chain of fresh perishable products; a full roll-out of the project is being planned for the next future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation (PGVC) has expanded worldwide, particularly in China, where it accounts for more than 90% of all global PGVC operations. As compared with conventional agricultural methods, PGVC has doubled crop yields by extending growing seasons and intensifying agriculture. PGVC also offers more ecosystem services relative to conventional approaches, including greater soil carbon sequestration, lower water consumption, and improved soil protection at regional scales. The economic benefits of this easily implemented agricultural method are attractive to small‐holder farmers. However, greater environmental impacts (eg greenhouse‐gas emissions, generation of large amounts of plastic waste) are associated with PGVC than with conventional approaches. Here, we review what is currently known about PGVC and identify future research priorities that will comprehensively assess the ecosystem services offered by this method of cultivation, as well as its environmental impacts and socioeconomic benefits.</jats:p>",

We extend the previous studies to consider a risk-averse retailer in a two-echelon fashion supply chain. Based on the classic mean-variance approach in finance, the issue of channel coordination in a fashion supply chain with risk-averse retailer and price-dependent demand is investigated. We propose both single contracts and joint contracts to achieve supply chain coordination. We find that the coordinating revenue sharing contract and two-part tariff contract in the supply chain with risk neutral agents are still useful to coordinate the supply chain taking into account the degree of risk aversion of fashion retailer, whereas a more complex sales rebate and penalty (SRP) contract fails to do so. When using combined contracts to coordinate the supply chain, we demonstrate that only revenue sharing with two-part tariff contract can coordinate the fashion supply chain. The optimal conditions for contract parameters to achieve channel coordination are determined. Numerical analysis is presented to supplement the results and more insights are gained.</jats:p>"

One problem, particularly in the United States, is that public data sources are mostly at highly aggregate geographic levels but models with more disaggregate geographic levels are required for regional freight transportation planning. A second problem is that supply chain effects are often ignored or modeled with economic input–output models that lack explanatory power. This study addressed these challenges with a structural equation modeling approach that was not confined to a specific spatial structure, as spatial regression models would have been, and allowed correlations between commodities. A model for structural commodity generation that was based on freight analysis framework was specified, estimated, and shown to provide a better fit to the data than did independent regression models for each commodity. Three features of the model are discussed: indirect effects, supply chain elasticity, and intrazonal supply–demand interactions. A goal programming method was used with imputed data to validate the geographic scalability of the model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Brantas River is a tropical mid-sized river with mountainous headwaters, covering a catchment area of around 11,050 km $^2$ at the east coast of Java, Indonesia. Its watershed is located in one of the most densely populated regions worldwide, facing alterations by agriculture, urbanization and aquaculture ponds. Additionally, one of the two major distributaries of the Brantas River in the lowlands, the Porong River is affected by inputs from the \"LUSI\" mud volcano since April 2006. We investigated spatio-temporal variations in inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry of the Brantas River, its major distributaries in the lower reaches and its coastal-estuarine regions and related them to land use and hydrology. </jats:p><jats:p> Highest nutrient loadings occurred during the wet periods (November to April) making up 80% and 87% of the annual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO $_3^-$ , NO $_2^-$ , NH $_4^ +$ ) and phosphorus (PO $_4^{3-}$ ) loads, respectively, with the Porong River accounting for 90% and 82% of the annual DIN and PO $_4^{3-}$ input. During wet periods the estuaries were flushed with DIN and PO $_4^{3-}$ rich freshwater, leading to high concentrations in coastal waters. Much lower nutrient concentrations were observed in coastal waters during dry periods because of low river discharge and nutrient load. During dry periods an increased exchange time and increased biological activity were responsible for estuaries acting as a sink for NO $_3^-$ and a source for NH $_4^ +$ and PO $_4^{3-}$ . In contrast, during wet periods most of the introduced NO $_3^-$ was directly discharged into coastal waters without further processing and NH $_4^ +$ and PO $_4^{3-}$ fluxes were slightly lower. Variations in the DIN composition were mainly related to differences in land use with NO $_3^-$ dominating the agriculture-dominated upper Brantas River and increasing NH $_4^ +$ and NO $_2^-$ content in the lower reaches affected by urban wastewater and aquaculture. The mud volcano affected parts of the Porong River showed drastic changes in the DIN composition and depletion of dissolved oxygen during low flow periods. In contrast, during wet periods most of the mud volcano input was diluted by the large freshwater and inorganic nutrient supply from the upstream regions. Our results suggest that the densely urbanized Brantas River with multiple anthropogenic nutrient sources (agriculture, urban sewage release, aquacultures) leads to an increased export of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus into coastal waters. The enhanced nutrient export supports nutrient enrichment in coastal waters, can possibly affect the phytoplankton production and composition, leading to eutrophication within nearshore regions of the Madura Strait. </jats:p>",

Numerical analysis is performed with Lingo 12 software. This paper also discusses the influences of scale effect coefficient, order difference tolerance coefficient, and relationship cost coefficient on the comprehensive order allocation performance of the LSSC. Results show that LSI prefers FLSPs with better scale effect coefficients and does not need to set an extremely high order difference tolerance coefficient. Similarly, setting a high relationship cost coefficient does not necessarily correspond to better results. For FLSPs, the continuous improvement of large-scale operational capacity is required. When the comprehensive order allocation performance of the LSSC is high, the LSI should offer cost compensation to improve the satisfaction of the LSSC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nNapier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.) is an important fodder and relatively drought-tolerant crop in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in developing countries. For this and other species, tools are needed for identifying drought-tolerant cultivars to aid selection for semi-arid environments. We determined tissue water status, carbon assimilation, biomass yield and forage quality for Napier grass cvv. Bana and Atherton grown in bins and subjected to three soil-water supply levels (100, 50 or 25% of field capacity) in glasshouses set at either low (15−25°C) or high (25−35°C) temperature regimes, over three growing cycles. Our aim was to explore whether differences in leaf water potential (LWP) and carbon assimilation rates could be reliable indicators of the relative yield potential and forage quality of the two cultivars in environments prone to water and heat stresses.\nAt the low soil-water supply of 25% and low temperature, Bana had lower (more negative) LWP and relative water content (RWC) than Atherton, while at 50% and 100% soil-water supply, Bana had a higher tissue water status. Under the high temperature regime, Bana had consistently more positive LWP and RWC than Atherton, but the differences were not significant. The two cultivars had a similar CO2 assimilation rate (A) and there were no significant differences in the total dry matter yields over the three growing cycles. Water-use efficiency for above-ground biomass (kg ha–1 mm–1) was similar for both cultivars and was 28.5–35.1 under the low temperature regime and 16.9–22.9 under the high temperature regime. Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was often higher for Bana at low water supply and low temperature than for Atherton, but the trend was reversed under the high temperature regime. Digestibility was generally improved under water-stressed conditions, and there was a positive correlation between NDF and both LWP and RWC measured at midday, but only under the low temperature regime. We conclude that LWP, RWC and A, alone or together, are inadequate for selecting cultivars for dry and hot environments, because cultivars may differ in other mechanistic responses to water stress and high temperatures.\n</jats:p>"

We find that, with wholesale price policy, the supply chain cannot be coordinated whether the supply chain agents are risk-neutral or risk-averse. However, with buyback policy, the supply chain can be coordinated and the profit of the supply chain can be arbitrarily allocated between the manufacturer and the retailer. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the impact of stochastic consumer returns and the supply chain agents’ risk attitude on the optimal order decision.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimal pricing and remanufacturing decisions problem of a fuzzy closed-loop supply chain is considered in this paper. Particularly, there is one manufacturer who has incorporated a remanufacturing process for used products into her original production system, so that she can manufacture a new product directly from raw materials or from collected used products. The manufacturer then sells the new product to two different competitive retailers, respectively, and the two competitive retailers are in charge of deciding the rates of the remanufactured products in their consumers’ demand quantity. The fuzziness is associated with the customer’s demands, the remanufacturing and manufacturing costs, and the collecting scaling parameters of the two retailers. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the manufacturer and the two retailers make their own decisions about wholesale price, retail prices, and the remanufacturing rates in the expected value model. Using game theory and fuzzy theory, we examine each firm’s strategy and explore the role of the manufacturer and the two retailers over three different game scenarios. We get some insights into the economic behavior of firms, which can serve as the basis for empirical study in the future.</jats:p>"

Facing the random market demand, the assembler has to order the components from one supplier in advance and meanwhile requires the other supplier to deliver the components under VMI mode. We construct a Nash game between the supplier and the assembler so as to derive their equilibrium procurement/production strategies. The results show that the channel’s performance is highly undermined by the decentralization between players and also the combination of two supply modes.

Prolonged reduced glucose supply to the fetus is a feature of both. It is unknown if reduced glucose supply, independent of other complications of maternal undernutrition and placental insufficiency, would cause similar β-cell defects. Therefore, we measured fetal insulin secretion and β-cell mass following prolonged reduced fetal glucose supply in sheep. We also tested whether restoring physiological insulin concentrations would correct any β-cell defects. Pregnant sheep received either a direct saline infusion (CON = control, n = 5) or an insulin infusion (HG = hypoglycemic, n = 5) for 8 wk in late gestation (75 to 134 days) to decrease maternal glucose concentrations and reduce fetal glucose supply. A separate group of HG fetuses also received a direct fetal insulin infusion for the final week of the study with a dextrose infusion to prevent a further fall in glucose concentration [hypoglycemic + insulin (HG+I), n = 4]. Maximum glucose-stimulated insulin concentrations were 45% lower in HG fetuses compared with CON fetuses. β-Cell, pancreatic, and fetal mass were 50%, 37%, and 40% lower in HG compared with CON fetuses, respectively ( P &lt; 0.05). Insulin secretion and β-cell mass did not improve in the HG+I fetuses. These results indicate that chronically reduced fetal glucose supply is sufficient to reduce pancreatic insulin secretion in response to glucose, primarily due to reduced pancreatic and β-cell mass, and is not correctable with insulin.</jats:p>",

Under the assumption that the market demand has a multiplicative functional form, the Stackelberg and cooperative game models are developed, and the closed form solution to each model is provided as well. Comparisons and insights are presented. We show that a properly designed revenue‐cost‐sharing contract can achieve supply chain coordination and lead to a Pareto improving win‐win situation for channel members. We also discuss the allocation of the extra joint profit according to individual supply chain members’ risk preferences and negotiating powers.</jats:p>",

The model is based on the plasma hydrodynamics and chemical models, including 12 species and 27 reactions. In addition, the photoionization and secondary electron emission effects are taken into account. Simulation is carried out on a bar-plate electrode configuration with an inter-electrode gap of 3.3 mm, the positive potential applied to the bar being 5.0 kV, the pressure in air discharge being fixed at 1.0 atm, and the gas temperature assumed to be a constant (300 K). In this paper, some key microscopic characteristics such as electric field distribution, net charge density distribution, electron density distribution at 5 different instants during a Trichel pulse are analyzed emphatically. Further more, the electron generation and disappearing rates, positive and negative ion distribution characteristics along the axis of symmetry are also investigated in detail in the later Trichel pulse cycle. The results can give valuable insights into the physical mechanism of negative corona discharge.</jats:p>"

Based on that, this paper introduces the reference effect in the sea-cargo supply chain and studies a multiple-period contract problem between the carrier and the forwarder. It is found that when the capacity price in the spot market is less than the forwarder’s willingness-to-pay, the forwarder’s contract purchasing decision is not affected by the reference effect, only by the capacity price in the spot market, and the multiple-period contract problem can be simplified into a single-period game. In addition, the carrier’s optimal contract wholesale price approaches the capacity price in the spot market. Although, the forwarder’s contract purchasing decision depends upon the reference effect, it is difficult to derive the closed-form solution. Moreover, because of the risk in the spot market, the carrier tends to sell his/her capacity in the contract market. Finally, we employ the numerical simulation to study the carrier’s contract pricing decisions and the forwarder’s capacity purchasing decisions in two cases.</jats:p>"

In addition, it not only compares the manufacturer and the retailer’s optimal decision and maximum profit under the situation of the information asymmetry and free information sharing, but also analyzes their market behavior and changes in market performance. Meanwhile, it points out that the downstream in supply chain masters more information about market demands compared to the upstream one. The optimal cost threshold values of technology investment are also examined both for the centralized and the decentralized scenarios utilizing quantitative and modeling methods. By analyzing and comparing the optimal profit with or without investment on information technology, it establishes a supply chain coordination model which boosts the application of information technology. At the same time, it offers the conditions on which the upstream and downstream enterprises can coordinate with one another. The results of this paper have contributed significantly to making the price and ordering decisions on whether RFID should be adopted among members of the supply chain. Finally, we present numerical analyses, and several extensions of the model are considered as well.</jats:p>"

After that, we conduct a detailed comparison among the three models in terms of the retail price, demand, return rate, and the profits received by the supply chain members. With this study, we find the following. (i) The FS or PS support offered by the manufacturer to the third party will result in a lower retail price and a higher demand. (ii) The optimal return rate with PS scheme is always higher than that without the CRR, and the one with FS scheme is at least as high as that without the CRR. (iii) All the members in the closed-loop supply chain can always benefit from the CRR.

Raw material sourcing is one of the most important issues besetting the food-manufacturing sector. There are volume, cost, quality and sustainability concerns in this sector. These issues were brought about by the generally weak agricultural base of the country coupled with climate changes contributing to shortages of local raw materials and dependence on the foreign suppliers. Several strategic options are available to the local food-manufacturing firm with contract growership as one model proven to be a viable option to ensure raw material supply. Sourcing from foreign markets is inevitable because of the demand for processed products for which raw materials are not available locally. In addition, this is a good strategy in addressing raw material shortages. Food companies are moving towards more sustainable raw material sourcing strategies, putting more emphasis on their long-term relationship with raw material suppliers and how these suppliers will be benefitted in the long-run.</jats:p>"

Moreover, empirical analysis of Chinese listed companies in fashion and textile sector is implemented for the comparison of the methods, and some related issues are discussed.

The heat collection efficiency of the solar collector was analyzed under low-temperature conditions. The factors that affect the performance of the heat pumps, such as the fluid temperature, pressure, and energy savings, were analyzed for cases where the solar energy auxiliary heat pump and the air source heat pump are used independently. The optimal heating temperature and the changes in the fluid temperature were determined. The influence of the compression ratio and the coefficient of performance (COP) were investigated theoretically. The results revealed the parameters that are important to the performance of the system.

In this paper, a new multiobjective stochastic JRD (MSJRD) of the one‐warehouse and <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>‐retailer systems considering the balance of service level and total cost simultaneously is proposed. The goal of this problem is to decide the reasonable replenishment interval, safety stock factor, and traveling routing. Secondly, two approaches are designed to handle this complex multi‐objective optimization problem. Linear programming (LP) approach converts the multi‐objective to single objective, while a multi‐objective evolution algorithm (MOEA) solves a multi‐objective problem directly. Thirdly, three intelligent optimization algorithms, differential evolution algorithm (DE), hybrid DE (HDE), and genetic algorithm (GA), are utilized in LP‐based and MOEA‐based approaches. Results of the MSJRD with LP‐based and MOEA‐based approaches are compared by a contrastive numerical example. To analyses the nondominated solution of MOEA, a metric is also used to measure the distribution of the last generation solution. Results show that HDE outperforms DE and GA whenever LP or MOEA is adopted.</jats:p>",

We categorize and discuss three situations according to the signal availability of PCS, under which the optimal pricing strategies are derived. Finally, we conduct a numerical study and find that in fact the retailers and supplier are all more willing to avoid the existence of PCS with the objective of profit maximization.

While previous literature on cooperative advertising mainly focuses on a “single-manufacturer single-retailer” framework, the decision-making framework with “multiple-manufacturer single-retailer” becomes more realistic because of the increasing power of retailers as well as the increased competition among the manufacturers. In view of this, in this paper we investigate the cooperative advertising program in a “two-manufacturer single-retailer” supply chain in three different scenarios; that is, (i) each channel member makes decisions independently; (ii) the retailer is vertically integrated with one manufacturer; (iii) two manufacturers are horizontally integrated. Utilizing differential game theory, the open-loop equilibrium-advertising strategies of each channel member are obtained and compared.

Focusing on the existing problem in e‐commerce logistics system, we formulate a location‐inventory‐routing problem model with no quality defects returns. To solve this NP‐hard problem, an effective hybrid genetic simulated annealing algorithm (HGSAA) is proposed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Switching Mode Power Supply (SMPS) has been widely applied in aeronautics, nuclear power, high-speed railways, and other areas related to national strategy and security. The degradation of MOSFET occupies a dominant position in the key factors affecting the reliability of SMPS. MOSFETs are used as low-voltage switches to regulate the DC voltage in SMPS. The studies have shown that die-attach degradation leads to an increase in on-state resistance due to its dependence on junction temperature. On-state resistance is the key indicator of the health of MOSFETs. In this paper, an online real-time method is presented for predicting the degradation of MOSFETs. First, the relationship between an oscillator signal of source and on-state resistance is introduced. Because oscillator signals change when they age, a feature is proposed to capture these changes and use them as indicators of the state of health of MOSFETs. A platform for testing characterizations is then established to monitor oscillator signals of source. Changes in oscillator signal measurement were observed with aged on-state resistance as a result of die-attach degradation. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is efficient. This study will enable a method to predict the failure of MOSFETs to be developed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration with different decisions in the supply chain is a trend, since it can avoid the suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we provide an effective intelligent algorithm for a modified joint replenishment and location‐inventory problem (JR‐LIP). The problem of the JR‐LIP is to determine the reasonable number and location of distribution centers (DCs), the assignment policy of customers, and the replenishment policy of DCs such that the overall cost is minimized. However, due to the JR‐LIP’s difficult mathematical properties, simple and effective solutions for this NP‐hard problem have eluded researchers. To find an effective approach for the JR‐LIP, a hybrid self‐adapting differential evolution algorithm (HSDE) is designed. To verify the effectiveness of the HSDE, two intelligent algorithms that have been proven to be effective algorithms for the similar problems named genetic algorithm (GA) and hybrid DE (HDE) are chosen to compare with it. Comparative results of benchmark functions and randomly generated JR‐LIPs show that HSDE outperforms GA and HDE. Moreover, a sensitive analysis of cost parameters reveals the useful managerial insight. All comparative results show that HSDE is more stable and robust in handling this complex problem especially for the large‐scale problem.</jats:p>",

Each chain is composed of one risk-averse supplier and one risk-neutral retailer. The two suppliers, as Stackelberg leaders, can choose either wholesale price or revenue sharing contract. We compare the outcomes obtained from different scenarios and study the impact of competition density and risk attitudes on the suppliers’ contract choices. We find that it is always optimal for the first-moving supplier to choose revenue sharing contract if the follower chooses wholesale price contract. We also find that the retail price under revenue sharing contract is lower than that under wholesale price contract. Compared to Pan et al. (2010), we find that a threshold policy with respect to the degree of product substitutability holds in a sequential competition environment. There also exists a threshold policy with respect to the degree of risk aversion for the suppliers to choose their individual contract types and the corresponding chain-to-chain contract strategies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a new management mode, great attention has been paid to virtual enterprise (VE). While there is much research material on risk management of VE, a relationship perspective on owner and partner performance assessment and management can bring an added dimension. The coordination of risk management in fashion and textiles (FTs) supply chain organized as a VE is studied in this paper. The aim of this study is to find proper decision mechanisms that can improve the overall performance of risk management for the whole VE as well as each member. For the risk management problem in VE, a centralized mechanism is given as the base case, and then a distributed decision-making (DDM) mechanism with incentive scheme is introduced to establish a practicable strategic partnership. Under the DDM mechanism, a relationship performance definition that incorporates the financial dimension is investigated. For the two resulting optimization problems, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed. In the numerical examples, the study shows that the DDM mechanism with incentive scheme can improve the overall benefit of risk management beyond the centralized one. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted with respect to the bonus parameter, and suggestions are made for further research.</jats:p>"

We also derive the equilibrium strategies in the decentralized system and prove that the entire profit of supply chain is inevitably lower than that under centralized system. Based on this, we propose a reimbursement contract to coordinate the decentralized supply chain so as to achieve the maximized profit. It is worth mentioning that, under reimbursement contract, the equilibrium production and order quantities are irrelevant to the manufacturer's risk sharing coefficient but are only determined by the supplier’s risk sharing coefficient.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cross-docking, as a strategy to reduce lead time and enhance the efficiency of the fashion supply chain, has attracted substantial attention from both the academy and the industry. Cross-docking is a critical part of many fashion and textiles supply chains in practice because it can help to achieve many supply chain strategies such as postponement. We consider a model where there are multiple suppliers and customers in a single cross-docking center. With such a model setting, the issue concerning the coordinated routing between the inbound and outbound routes is much more complex than many traditional vehicle routing problems (VRPs). We formulate the optimal route selection problems from the suppliers to the cross-docking center and from the cross-docking center to the customers as the respective VRPs. Based on the relationships between the suppliers and the customers, we integrate the two VRP models to optimize the overall traveling time, distance, and waiting time at the cross-docking center. In addition, we propose a novel mixed 0/1 integer linear programming model by which the complexity of the problem can be reduced significantly. As demonstrated by the simulation analysis, our proposed model can be solved very efficiently by a commonly used optimization software package.</jats:p>"
