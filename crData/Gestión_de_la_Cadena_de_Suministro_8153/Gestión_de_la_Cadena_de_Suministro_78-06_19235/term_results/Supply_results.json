The dependence of lamp power on supply waveform and ballast type has been measured on 250 W MBI lamps for a supply voltage range of 210-270 V. Analysis of the lamp circuit for square wave supply voltage has been made using the simplifying assumption that the lamp voltage is independent of current. Expressions derived for the current waveforms and the power dissipated in the lamp are shown to agree well with experimental values. Although the analysis is used to predict the behaviour of metal-halide lamps, it is equally valid for other types of discharge lamps. </jats:p>",

As yet, there is no sign whatever of an overall national energy plan, and the American people still appear to be dangerously ignorant of the critical situation of their country in this sector: it seems incredible; for example, that in the world's technologically most advanced society, with mass communications second to none, a substantial proportion of the public believe the United States to be self‐sufficient in oil! Whilst this criticism is levelled at the position in the US, purely because that country is the biggest oil importer and consumer, the censure must extend to other major importing nations as well: even with the higher price for OPEC oil initiated in 1973 and 1974, by and large the consuming countries have reverted to their former consumption patterns, surpassing the pre‐embargo levels of 1973. Dr. Mallakh believes that it would be foolhardy to regard the present so‐called oil “glut” as heralding a fall in oil prices; it should be recognized, he says, for what it is, namely, a temporary phenomenon which will disappear with the return of a strong seller's market, perhaps as early as 1980. Too much weight, the writer submits, was given to the dampening of demand due to the OPEC price hikes of 1973 and 1974, and too little to the ramificatiorj of the worldwide recession and inflationary spiral that peaked at approximately the same time as the slump in petroleum consumption in 1974 and 1975. “In short, what was taken as price‐induced conservation in consumption primarily reflected, instead, a recession‐induced cutback in consumer spending.”</jats:p>",

The number of leaves unfolded was a linear function of time where nitrogen was supplied at high concentration but for plants supplied with low nitrogen, appearance of the third and fourth leaves was considerably delayed.

The nutrient concentration during the initial vegetative stage did not affect the time taken for double ridge formation by the main shoot but did influence the subsequent development of the inflorescence as did the post‐initiation level of nutrients. At low nutrient levels flowering was inhibited in some individuals but at the higher concentrations inflorescence emergence was hastened, inflorescence size was increased and, in particular, the number of spikelets and hence the number of seeds per inflorescence was greatly increased. The mean weight of 100 seeds was unaffected by the nutrient concentration. The number of reproductive tillers per plant was increased by high nutrient supply but the proportion of dry weight allocated to root development was reduced.</jats:p>",
