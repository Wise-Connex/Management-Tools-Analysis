Analysis of oil exploration and development projects around the world indicates that more than 49 million BOPD in additional production capacity could be gained by 2020. Taking into account risk factors and depletion rates, net additional production capacity is likely to increase by more than 17 million BOPD by 2020, the most capacity growth since the 1980s. The figures come from a report released in June by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School titled Oil: The Next Revolution. It was authored by Leonardo Maugeri, former ENI senior executive vice president of strategies and development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Leading the way in this new surge of production, in order, are Iraq, the US, Cana-da, Brazil, and Venezuela. And much of the production is unconventional—shale/tight oil in the US, pre-salt in Brazil, oil sands in Canada, and extra-heavy oil in Venezuela. The study predicts that four current major producing areas will show declines during the period: Norway, the UK, Iran, and Mexico.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Other conclusions of the study include:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The US will continue to see great gains in output from unconventional resources, thanks to “the technological revolution brought about by the combined use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.” The states of North Dakota and Texas will see the largest growth in supply. These technologies used in shale also will be used to reopen and recover oil from conventional, established fields. “The United States could increase oil production by 3.5 million BOPD … making it the second largest oil producer in the world after Saudi Arabia.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Oil prices could collapse when these large volumes of oil hit the market, contradicting conventional wisdom that global supply will struggle to keep up with world demand. The report concludes that oil production capacity is growing so rapidly that it might outpace consumption. “The oil market will remain highly volatile until 2015 and prone to extreme movements in opposite directions. After 2015, however, most of the oil projects analyzed in the report will advance significantly.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Shifts in the supply/demand balance will affect geopolitics. The US could be producing 65% of its oil consumption needs domestically, becoming less dependent on Middle East countries. And while the US shale boom likely will not be easily replicated elsewhere, development of known and unknown unconventional resources globally “could be surprising,” says the report.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The increase in unconventional oil development will lead to heightened environmental protection and regulation challenges. “Industry needs to develop technological solutions to minimize water use, minimize and report chemical use, and carefully monitor production sites,” says the report. “If such a collective effort by industry does not materialize, government may respond with more onerous regulation in the near future that could impact US shale oil production.”</jats:p>",

It is anticipated that there will be a global water crisis by 2030 if definite measures are not taken to curtail the current trends. High population growth rate, increasing urban drift, economic growth, and climate changes are the key factors contributing to the water crisis. The development of sustainable water treatment systems with innovative approaches to planning, design, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructure is imperative, while an integrated management of water and energy can be a new paradigm shift toward sustainability. Going beyond removal of conventional contaminants using coagulation–flocculation–sedimentation–filtration processes, advanced treatment technologies including advanced oxidation, membrane separation, and activated carbon adsorption processes have been adopted to address emerging issues associated with the presence of toxic chemicals in water as well as aesthetic aspects (odor, color, and taste) of water quality. Recently, nanotechnological approaches have emerged as breakthrough technologies for improving water quality with less effort and materials. Meanwhile, more basic approaches employing the concept of water conservation, reclamation, recycle, and reuse might be a better solution to the ever increasing scarcity of good quality drinking water.</jats:p>",

Comparison is made with some selected international examples to develop a better understanding of these recent Australian developments within the international context. While not a complete inventory of the many recent recycling schemes in Australia, the paper examines these emerging trends within the context of the growing number of larger-scale industrial, agricultural and dual reticulation urban recycled water systems in Australia and the trend to decentralised recycling schemes.</jats:p>",

Under this condition, utilities usually apply re-chloramination with limited success. Adjusting pH may benefit utilities. However, it is not clear whether pH should be moved up or down, and pH adjustment will also alter the chloramine decay profile (biocide) and ammonia (food) concentration. It is important to understand how this behaviour will ultimately impact nitrifying bacterial activity. We collected samples from severely nitrifying bulkwaters and adjusted the pH within a practical range to know which pH benefits the most. Results showed that even a slight increase in pH can help in protecting the chloramine residual and suppressing nitrifying bacterial activity.</jats:p>",

Neither total coliforms nor Escherichia coli were found in any 1.5 L bottle samples. Total coliforms were found in 2.9% of the small bottles, while in 20 L bottles the presence of total coliforms and E. coli was demonstrated in 15.5 and 2.4% of samples, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in 4.3, 4.5 and 9.5% of small, 1.5 and 20 L bottles, respectively. In 36.4% of the samples of 1.5 L bottles, the HPC was above 500 cfu/mL. This percentage of samples with an HPC above 500 cfu/mL increased to 52.0 and 61.9% in small and 20 L bottles, respectively. Higher contamination by total coliforms, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and HPCs occurred in 20 L bottles. In conclusion, several samples in this study were outside the international quality standard for mineral water and the large number of samples with high HPCs shows that more work must be done on the use of HPC in mineral water and the damaging effects that these microorganisms may cause to humans. The bottled mineral water was confirmed as a particularly important public health problem, due to the poor microbiological quality of the products that are marketed.</jats:p>",

The optimisation-based controller aims at maximising customer satisfaction with the least operating costs. The model proves to be very useful in maintaining an inventory level that is just enough to satisfy customer demand. A move suppression term that penalises the rate of change in the transported quantities through the network increases the robustness of the control system. Dedicated feedback controllers are utilised to maintain product inventory at all nodes of the supply chain network within pre-specified target levels that are subsequently embedded within the optimisation-based control framework. Simulated results exhibit good dynamic performance under both stochastic and deterministic demand variations.</jats:p>"

An instrumented experimental plumbing system was designed to examine the effects of a range of pressures commonly encountered in household plumbing systems. A transient triggered from within the household plumbing system structurally taxed the experimental service line and vertical plumbing sections but did not result in negative pressures. Taken together, these experimental results and observations of gaseous cavitation phenomenon with a high definition video camera demonstrated that a hydraulic transient triggered from a water main resulted in extremely low pressures events (up to −68.95 kpa) in the service line. This low pressure would be sufficient to allow the possible intrusion of microbial and chemical contaminants into the service lines. Homeowners and water utilities should be made aware of the importance of maintaining the structural integrity of their pipe systems and protecting the hydraulic integrity of water systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The stress–strain response of cast iron under tension or compression is nonlinear. This paper examines how the hyperbolic constitutive law can be applied to characterize nonlinear stress–strain behavior of cast iron used in water supply networks. Procedures are described to obtain parameters of the hyperbolic constitutive law from either the response (data) obtained from simple uniaxial tensile and compressive tests or from bending tests. To demonstrate its applicability, this hyperbolic constitutive law is first applied to data obtained from uniaxial tensile and compressive tests conducted by Schlick and Moore (1936, “Strength and Elastic Properties of Cast Iron in Tension, Compression, Flexure, and Combined Tension and Flexure,” Bulletin 127, Iowa Engineering Experiment Station, Ames, IA). In addition, an approach to extract parameters for the hyperbolic constitutive law from bending (beam and pipe rings) tests is proposed and subsequently applied to tests conducted by Talbot (1908, “Tests of Cast-Iron and Reinforced Concrete Culvert Pipe,” Bulletin No. 22, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). This latter approach is attractive for practical purposes because the test set up is simple and the test coupons are very easy to prepare. The hyperbolic constitutive law in conjunction with maximum normal strain theory as proposed by St. Venant (Collins, J. A., 1993, Failure of Materials in Mechanical Design: Analysis, Prediction, Prevention, John Wiley, New York, NY) was also used to predict failure loads.</jats:p>",

It has been found that the relative length between the inlet meniscus and Hertzian center point in the oil pool to Hertzian radius was much larger than 1 in a smaller lubricant supply of 20 μl, and the corresponding contact region initially entered the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) region and then became starved with the increasing speed. The variations of the relative film thickness as a function of starvation degree and the ratio of relative length to Hertzian radius were proposed to explain the obtained results. Besides, the fluorescence technique was used to directly observe the inlet meniscus position of the oil pool and helped to gain more understanding of the lubricant flow properties under micro oil supply condition.</jats:p>",

A total of one hundred and thirty four carefully selected refereed journal articles were systematically analyzed leading to the introduction of a novel definition for SCRes, which the authors view as the as the ability to proactively plan and design the Supply Chain network for anticipating unexpected disruptive (negative) events, respond adaptively to disruptions while maintaining control over structure and function and transcending to a post-event robust state of operations, if possible, more favorable than the one prior to the event, thus gaining competitive advantage. Finally, a critical examination of existing conceptual frameworks for understanding the relationships between the SCRes concept and its identified formative elements, is taking place.</jats:p>"

We develop a formal economic model to examine the relationship between the strictness of the regulatory environment and downstream firms' incentives to act as inspectors of their sub-contractors. We consider the interaction between a downstream producer and an upstream input supplier. The downstream chooses the probability with which to monitor the upstream's compliance and the upstream chooses a compliance level which determines compliance of the end product with quality or environmental regulation. We find that the strictness of regulation affects the downstream's monitoring strategy in combination with the level of quality or environmental standards. If the standards are sufficiently low then the strictness of regulation increases incentives to monitor the upstream. Contrary, if the standards are sufficiently high then the pressure on the downstream to monitor the upstream is relaxed and the strictness of regulation decreases incentives to monitor. We argue that the strictness of regulation should not be treated in isolation as a factor determining the choice of downstream firms to monitor their input suppliers.</jats:p>",

Results are presented for analysis of nine water quality sensors measuring six parameters and deployed in three connected district meter areas (DMAs), fed from a single water source (service reservoir), for a 1 year period and evaluated using comprehensive water utility records with 86% of event clusters successfully correlated to causes (spatially limited to DMA level). False negatives, defined by temporal clusters of water quality complaints in the pilot area not corresponding to detections, were only approximately 25%. It was demonstrated that the software could be configured and applied retrospectively (with potential for future near real time application) to detect various water quality event types (with a wider remit than contamination alone) for further interpretation.</jats:p>",

The genetic landscape of pancreatic cancer shows near ubiquitous activating mutations of KRAS, and recurrent inactivating mutations of CDKN2A, SMAD4, and TP53. To date, attempts to develop agents to target KRAS to specifically kill cancer cells have been disappointing. In this regard, an understanding of cellular metabolic derangements in pancreatic cancer could lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Like other cancers, pancreatic cancer cells rely on fuel sources for homeostasis and proliferation; as such, interrupting the use of two major nutrients, glucose and glutamine, may provide new therapeutic avenues. In addition, KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancers have been documented to depend on autophagy, and the inhibition of autophagy in the preclinical setting has shown promise. Herein, the conceptual framework for blocking the pancreatic fuel supply is reviewed. Clin Cancer Res; 18(16); 4285–90. ©2012 AACR.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One emerging tool to measure the social-related impacts in supply chains is Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA), a derivative of the well-established environmental LCA technique. LCA has recently started to gain popularity among large corporations and initiatives, such as The Sustainability Consortium or the Sustainable Apparel Coalition. Both have made the technique a cornerstone of their applied-research program. The Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) is an overarching, global database that eases the data collection burden in S-LCA studies. Proposed “hotspots” are production activities or unit processes (also defined as country-specific sectors) in the supply chain that may be at risk for social issues to be present. The SHDB enables efficient application of S-LCA by allowing users to prioritize production activities for which site-specific data collection is most desirable. Data for three criteria are used to inform prioritization: (1) labor intensity in worker hours per unit process and (2) risk for, or opportunity to affect, relevant social themes or sub-categories related to Human Rights, Labor Rights and Decent Work, Governance and Access to Community Services (3) gravity of a social issue. The Worker Hours Model was developed using a global input/output economic model and wage rate data. Nearly 200 reputable sources of statistical data have been used to develop 20 Social Theme Tables by country and sector. This paper presents an overview of the SHDB development and features, as well as results from a pilot study conducted on strawberry yogurt. This study, one of seven Social Scoping Assessments mandated by The Sustainability Consortium, identifies the potential social hotspots existing in the supply chain of strawberry yogurt. With this knowledge, companies that manufacture or sell yogurt can refine their data collection efforts in order to put their social responsibility performance in perspective and effectively set up programs and initiatives to improve the social conditions of production along their product supply chain.</jats:p>"

This paper compares the fate of DBPs and organic halogen content generated during the production of HQRW under two different disinfection strategies employed prior to RO filtration: (i) in line-formed chloramines with a short contact time between secondary effluent and disinfectant versus (ii) pre-formed chloramines with a long contact time between secondary effluent and disinfectant. In general, pre-formed chloramines formed less trihalomethanes (THMs) in comparison to in line-formed chloramines even after a longer contact time. However, pre-formed chloramines still generated iodo-THMs (I-THMs) which are of concern since they are suspected to be more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues. I-THMs were very effectively reduced by the advanced oxidation process placed after the membrane process. Chloramines also form other halogenated by-products whose identity is unknown. In this study, more than 95% of total organic halogen formed by chloramines was rejected by the RO membranes although the reduction of targeted low molecular weight DBPs was only around 50%. Specific rejections for individual DBPs vary, ranging from low for haloacetonitriles and high for haloketones.</jats:p>",

Women might increase their labor supply in the anticipation of divorce. We review the methodological developments in measuring economic independence and the recent evidence on its impact on divorce. Then we turn our attention to the alternative literature on the impact of divorce on female labor supply. We outline the theoretical arguments put forward by this literature, discuss the methodological issues in establishing causality, summarize the findings, and suggest avenues of further research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water supply systems (WSSs) are vital infrastructures for the well-being of people today. To achieve good customer satisfaction the water supply service must always be able to meet people's needs, in terms of both quantity and quality. But unpredictable extreme conditions can cause severe damage to WSSs and lead to poorer levels of service or even to their failure. Operators dealing with a system's day-to-day operation know that events like burst water mains can compromise the functioning of all or part of a system. To increase a system's reliability, therefore, designs should take into account operating conditions other than normal ones. Recent approaches based on robust optimization can be used to solve optimization problems which involve uncertainty and can find designs which are able to cope with a range of operating conditions. This paper presents a robust optimization model for the optimal design of water supply systems operating under different circumstances. The model presented here uses a hydraulic simulator linked to an optimizer based on a simulated annealing heuristic. The results show that robustness can be included in several ways for varying levels reliability and that it leads to more reliable designs for only small cost increases.\n                    </jats:p>"

Dehydration of sludge was performed by controlled heating at temperatures of 1100°C, 850°C, 650°C, 350°C for 3 hours. After thermal treatment the sludge was characterized by X-ray fluorescence, TG/DTG/DTA, residue solubilization and residue lixiviation tests. The aim of the present work was to observe, thought the characterization techniques, if the treated sewage sludge is or not adequate to be used as filter material to water treatment. It will be verified which treatment temperature of the sludge offer possibility to its use in water treatment without carrying pollutants in concentrations out of the standards.</jats:p>"

Multivariate statistical analysis was used to study the apportionment of elements in the water samples, while their suitability for drinking and agricultural purposes were also assessed. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) revealed considerable anthropogenic contributions of the elements in water samples. Average levels of Cd, Co, Cr and Pb in the waters were significantly higher than national and international standards. In order to ascertain the potential health risk of heavy metal contents to the local population, non-carcinogenic health risk assessment was evaluated in terms of exposure assessment (Exping/derm) and hazard quotient (HQing/derm) which demonstrated that the measured levels of Cd, Co, Cr and Pb were higher than the safety limit, thus indicating adverse health effects associated with the consumption of the lake water.</jats:p>",

Over the recent years, with the increasing consciousness of people's environmental protection around the globe and the pressure of competition on the international markets, many textile companies are forced to pay close attention to environmental friendly. In view of this trend, the textile industry hopes the implementation of the green information systems with supply chain focus help them to investigate the extent of business process improvement. We found that the business process is improved with a Web implementation on the ICT platform. A case study is employed in the research and the result shows that the green supply chain creates external effects including the promotion of corporate image, increase of customer value and loyalty, reduction of customer complaints and product conformity to global standards. It also generates internal effects with the increase of sales revenue, procurement efficiency and competitiveness.</jats:p>",

After more than 15 years of research into the ageing of water pipes, Irstea (formerly Cemagref) has developed the Linear Extension of the Yule Process (LEYP) model based on counting process theory, which relies not only on a pipe's characteristics and environment but also on its age and previous breaks. It was then decided to develop a break prediction tool usable by water utilities: the ‘Casses’ freeware. To make this possible, it was necessary to deal with several constraints. To cope with the diversity of available data for various water utilities, flexible input data formats were designed as well as an importation module which checks the conformity and coherence of data. Tools for data management and an advice module dedicated to model calibration were conceived for non-statistician users. The break prediction results can be used directly to compare break evolution with different rehabilitation strategies and they can also feed multicriteria decision tools. In this case, the ‘Casses’ freeware can work as a ‘slave’ of the integrated application.</jats:p>",

A large-scale water model is used to analyse these effects and to identify ‘hot spots’ of water stress in the Black Sea region, as an example of an area where future water demand is expected to exceed the available water resources. Two scenarios are analysed, describing different developments of water withdrawals. Depending on the scenario, water stress increases or decreases due to changing water withdrawals which are identified as the principal cause of additional water stress in the future. According to the ‘economic-oriented’ pathway, water withdrawals are expected to increase by 58%. In Turkey and Bulgaria where water is already scarce, a further decrease in water availability will exacerbate the situation. By contrast, the ‘quality of life oriented’ scenario, assuming raised awareness to save water, results in a reduction of water withdrawals by approximately 59%. The situation of decreasing availability and increasing demand leads to growing competition between users and may finally end in cross-sectoral conflicts. This type of modelling study helps to prepare and foresee which kind of management options (in which sectors especially, and where) would be required to reduce ecological, economic and social consequences.</jats:p>",

X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analysis showed the adsorption of primarily As(V), with lesser amounts of As(III). Continuous As removal performance was observed over 1 year of ARF use. By introducing a double ARF system, the As removal was significantly enhanced for the region with high As contamination levels. The ARF manufacturing cost was estimated to be US$4–5, which is low and affordable to the rural households of Bangladesh. The ARF, made of locally available materials, had a low cost and minimal maintenance and showed high user acceptance, satisfaction and sustained use.</jats:p>",

The inadequate removal of NOM has a bearing on the capacity of other treatment processes to remove organic micro-pollutants or inorganic species that may be present in water. In order to effectively study the nature of South African water sources in terms of their NOM composition, water samples were collected from drinking water treatment plants in the five geographic water regions of South Africa. A raw water sample, an intermediate sample taken before sand filtration and a final sample after sand filtration were collected three times from these water treatment plants at two-month intervals and over three different seasons. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (FEEM), biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), ultraviolet (UV) characterisation (200–900 nm) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyses were used to characterise the NOM in the water samples. The FEEM and UV results revealed that the samples were composed mainly of non-humic substances with low UV-254 absorbance, while some samples had high humic substances with high UV-254 values. The samples' DOC results were within the range of 3.25–21.44 mg/L carbon, which was indicative of the varying nature of the NOM composition in the regions where samples were collected. The BDOC fraction of the NOM, on the other hand, ranged from 20 to 65%, depending on the geographical location of the sampling site.</jats:p>",

One possibility to protect the drinking water of a well field is the maintenance of a hydraulic barrier between the potentially polluted and the clean water. An example is the Hardhof well field in Zurich, Switzerland. This paper presents the methodology for a simple and fast expert system (ES), applies it to the Hardhof well field, and compares its performance to the historical management method of the Hardhof well field. Although the ES is quite simplistic it considerably improves the water quality in the drinking water wells. The ES knowledge base is crucial for successful management application. Therefore, a periodic update of the knowledge base is suggested for the real-time application of the ES.</jats:p>",

The resulting model, MultiGAP, addresses the assignment of tasks to agents within each time period, with the attendant single‐period assignment costs and agent‐capacity constraint requirements, in conjunction with transition costs arising between any two consecutive periods in which a task is reassigned to a different agent. As is the case for its single‐period antecedent, MultiGAP offers a robust tool for modeling a wide range of capacity planning problems occurring within supply chain management. We provide two formulations for MultiGAP and establish that the second (alternative) formulation provides a tighter bound. We define a Lagrangian relaxation‐based heuristic as well as a branch‐and‐bound algorithm for MultiGAP. Computational experience with the heuristic and branch‐and‐bound algorithm on over 2500 test problems is reported. The Lagrangian heuristic consistently generates high‐quality and in many cases near‐optimal solutions. The branch‐and‐bound algorithm is also seen to constitute an effective means for solving to optimality MultiGAP problems of reasonable size. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In recent years, eutrophication has led to more frequent cyanobacterial algae blooms whose metabolites, including 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), 1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol (geosmin) and microcystin-LR (MC-LR), can be both toxic and unpalatable. Traditional treatment methods are expensive and often poorly remove these compounds. Since biodegradation has shown promise, the removal of MIB, geosmin and MC-LR in columns containing a mixture of quartz sand and Taihu lake bed sediment was tested. Results show that 24, 38.5 and 100% removal of MIB, geosmin and MC-LR, respectively, can be achieved at a 1 m d–1 flow rate through 30 cm long columns containing 10% Taihu sediment. Biodegradation rates derived from one-dimensional transport modeling were used to predict the performance of 2 m filtration beds of similar composition. The results indicate that satisfactory removal of MIB, geosmin and MC-LR can be achieved by this method.</jats:p>",

For power supply systems to meet the availability and reliability criteria for Smartfields operations, the systems must be vandal proof and renewable with 100% availability and minimal negative impact on the environment. This paper presents the results of field trials of a renewable power supply system suitable for the deployment of Smartfields in remote locations in the oil and gas industry. The power solution is implemented using lithium polymer batteries, explosion proof enclosures and a thermoelectric generator to create a renewable power supply solution. This solution is capable of providing power to all the well head valves and communication infrastructure of both the gas lifted and natural flowing wells with high reliability and availability and also with a very low susceptibility to vandalization and very negligible negative impact on the environment.</jats:p>",

Tour operators negotiate with upstream hotels on the quantity of hotel rooms and promote the accommodation to downstream travel agencies. Two types of game models are formulated to analyze quantity competition in tourism supply chains with and without a tour operator. We conduct a comparative study of the two cases and explore the effects of various parameters. The results show that when the market size of travel agencies is lower than a certain level, then both travel agencies and hotels benefit more from the presence of a tour operator in a tourism supply chain. Furthermore, in this situation, the fluctuations in the profits of both travel agencies and hotels are more violent as the supply chain’s membership changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Point-of-use (POU) and point-of-entry (POE) drinking water treatment systems are gaining prominence, particularly from the point-of-view of technical appropriateness and consumer acceptance. They are becoming an increasingly viable alternative for small water treatment systems or in individual homes. However, sustainability concerns have been voiced in a number of studies investigating these devices. In this paper, sustainability is examined with respect to the fulfillment of treatment systems for a set of technical, economic, environmental and socio-cultural objectives. Consequently, the use of a hierarchy of sustainability indicators to compare various POU and POE water treatment alternatives is proposed. The indicators' definitions, as well as calculation and normalization methods are explained. The paper also presents a decision model that is capable of selecting the most sustainable treatment option. The model employs the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to help in the analysis of indicators' relative importance with regard to sustainability and to develop the indicators and criteria weights required for aggregating a sustainability score. The generated sustainability scores essentially level the playing field when comparing POU and POE systems for technical and economic appropriateness for a particular water treatment case, in addition to incorporating more difficult to quantify system traits, such as environmental and socio-cultural sustainability.</jats:p>",

The cell was oval shaped (11.0 μm in length, 7.7 μm in width), contained organelles and was stained bright apple-green by a fluorescent monoclonal antibody, although no axonemes or curved bristles were observed. Cross-reaction occurred with the anti-Cryptosporidium, but not the anti-Giardia, immunomagnetic antibody. The specificity of the fluorescent monoclonal antibodies differed depending on the product. As a result of the analysis of the partial sequence of 18S rDNA, the microorganism was identified as Lunulospora curvula, mitosporic Ascomycota.

The concept of agile manufacturing has been proposed in response to these challenges for companies. This paper copes with the strategic and tactical level decisions in agile supply chain network design. An efficient mixed-integer linear programming model that is able to consider the key characteristics of agile supply chain such as direct shipments, outsourcing, different transportation modes, discount, alliance (process and information integration) between opened facilities, and maximum waiting time of customers for deliveries is developed. In addition, in the proposed model, the capacity of facilities is determined as decision variables, which are often assumed to be fixed. Computational results illustrate that the proposed model can be applied as a power tool in agile supply chain network design as well as in the integration of strategic decisions with tactical decisions.</jats:p>",

The analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS). Irrespective of water source (public tap water, open well water and surface water) all the analyzed samples contained high levels of ClO4−, indicating its contamination throughout the region. The highest ClO4− level found was 91.4 μg/L, which is 3.7 times higher than US EPA recommendations. ClO3− and BrO3− were also detected in the samples, with highest concentrations of 177 and 5.34 μg/L respectively in tap water samples. Regression analysis showed moderate positive correlation between ClO4− and bromide (Br−) in tap water (r2=0.659) and open well water (r2=0.485) samples, respectively. Similar correlation was also observed between ClO4− and Cl− (r2=0.591) concentrations in well water samples, indicating sea water could be one of the probable sources in addition to ClO4− manufacturing in the area. This is the first report of high levels of ClO4− and ClO3− and detectable BrO3− in water samples from anywhere in India.</jats:p>",

Because the particle characteristics of f1 (filamentous) and f2 (spherical) are quite different and the surface charge of f1 in the river water was slightly more negative than that of f2, the removal ratios of f1 were approximately 1-log lower than the removal ratio of f2 after any treatment process used in the present study. This result indicates that the behaviors of the two bacteriophages during the treatment processes were different, and that the removal of f1 by the combination of coagulation and filtration processes was more difficult than that of f2. The removal ratios for f1 and f2 were approximately 3-log and 4-log, respectively, in the coagulation–rapid sand filtration process, and 6-log and 7-log, respectively, in the coagulation–MF filtration process. Therefore, as expected, the coagulation–MF process appears to be more effective than the coagulation–rapid sand filtration process for the removal of not only spherical viruses but also filamentous viruses.</jats:p>",

Rapid sand-filtered water was obtained from a water treatment plant in Tokyo, Japan, and then concentrated by an ultrafiltration membrane for use in ion exchange experiments to simulate high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulfate conditions. AERs removed 23–50% of DOC and 70–80% of UV254 within 30 min despite high sulfate concentration (121 mg/L). Although the materials and structure of the AERs did not affect the reduction of UV254, DOC removal was affected. The highest DOC reduction was achieved by a macroporous polyacrylic AER (Purolite), while the macroporous polystyrene IRA 910 had the lowest DOC removal. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed that the rate constants and the initial sorption rates of polyacrylic resins were higher than those by polystyrene resins, suggesting that more hydrophilic structure of AERs exhibited faster DOC removal. Aromatic DOM with a molecular weight (MW) of 800–3,000 Da was almost completely removed by AERs, whereas only half of aromatic DOMs smaller than 800 Da were removed by AERs. Adsorbed DOC comprised less than 6% of all exchanged anions, whereas the adsorbed sulfate was about 90% due to comparatively high concentration of sulfate in the water sample.</jats:p>",

Here, we construct an efficient<jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>cell factory for α-santalene production.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>A multistep metabolic engineering strategy targeted to increase precursor and cofactor supply was employed to manipulate the yeast metabolic network in order to redirect carbon toward the desired product. To do so, genetic modifications were introduced acting to optimize the farnesyl diphosphate branch point, modulate the mevalonate pathway, modify the ammonium assimilation pathway and enhance the activity of a transcriptional activator. The approach employed resulted in an overall α-santalene yield of a 0.0052 Cmmol (Cmmol glucose)<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>corresponding to a 4-fold improvement over the reference strain. This strategy, combined with a specifically developed continuous fermentation process, led to a final α-santalene productivity of 0.036 Cmmol (g biomass)<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>h<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The results reported in this work illustrate how the combination of a metabolic engineering strategy with fermentation technology optimization can be used to obtain significant amounts of the high-value sesquiterpene α-santalene. This represents a starting point toward the construction of a yeast “sesquiterpene factory” and for the development of an economically viable bio-based process that has the potential to replace the current production methods.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Expansion in network capacity, however, has not kept pace with this growth. This has led to significant overcrowding and little or no capacity left to run more trains within existing stock or track provision. The UK government however has stated that as part of achieving ‘best value' it wants to further increase rail traffic, and has recently set out a strategy to optimise this. This paper reviews the issues associated with the growth in passengers, the demand placed on the network and the policy developed to accommodate and manage it. It identifies the capacity constraints and options identified for capacity enhancement. The paper concludes that while privatisation has made coherent decision-making difficult there is significant experience to be gained in the development of policy and route utilisation strategies. </jats:p>",

To test this hypothesis, we monitored larval development as well as fatty acid composition in trophic resources during two successive reproductive seasons. The decoupling we found between the presence of competent larvae in the water column and settlement rates strongly suggests that metamorphosis is delayed until conditions are suitable. In both years, the major mussel settlement peak was synchronized with a phytoplanktonic pulse rich in EFA, consisting of a large autotrophic bloom in 2007 and a short but substantial peak of picoeukaryotes in 2008. These results suggest a “trophic settlement trigger” that indirectly affects recruitment by strongly improving the settlement rate. Despite similar larval settlement rates during both years, the lower 2007 recruitment likely resulted from a mismatch with a high lipid‐quality trophic resource. The seasonal trophic conditions differed greatly between the two years, with fatty acids profiles reflecting heterotrophic plankton production in 2007 and mostly autotrophic production in 2008. In agreement with Cushing's theory, our results highlight a match/mismatch, related to the food lipid quality rather than food quantity. For the first time, we show that the recruitment in marine bivalves may be dependent on phytoplanktonic pulses characterized by high levels of PUFA.</jats:p>",

Comparisons between simulations based on present-day climate data (baseline conditions) and future simulations (change-factor adjusted baseline conditions) are used to evaluate the development and breakdown of thermal stratification, as well as a number of metrics that describe reservoir thermal structure, stability and mixing. Both epilimnion and hypolimnion water temperatures are projected to increase.

This paper rejects ‘the lowest bid’ form of procurement of the past and advocates the total cost and strategic relationship management procurement of the future. The authors develop arguments for more effective procurement leading to real cost reduction and service enhancement on a sustainable basis. This requires a range of strategic activities from the approach to the acquisition of major capital goods and associated services through to the management of relationships with contractors, suppliers and supply chains. The paper considers the differing procurement practices in Europe, Australia and the USA, and how, in comparison, equivalent practices result in higher costs in the UK than elsewhere. From this they propose a model for best practice procurement in the utilities industries and a step-by-step set of actions for improving performance. The proposed model begins with a strategic appraisal of procurement activity across an organisation focusing on overall objectives and desired outcomes leading to an effective operating model including the end-to-end management of the supply chain and the policy, resources and enabling technology required for successful delivery.</jats:p>",

Dental therapists practice in many countries delivering preventive and basic restorative care to children and adults. In North America, dental therapy education and practice date back to 1972 with the establishment of training programs at the National School of Dental Therapy in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, and the Wascana Institute of Applied Arts and Science in Regina, Saskatchewan, as a means of reducing access to care barriers in Canada's northern territories and to implement the Saskatchewan Health Dental Plan, respectively. At present, dental therapy in North America has reached a crossroads: in the United States, the profession is cautiously being explored as a solution for improving access to care in at‐risk populations. In 2011, Canada's sole training program, the National School of Dental Therapy in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, closed when the federal government eliminated its funding. This article examines the impact of private practice employment of dental therapists in Saskatchewan on the supply of dental therapist human resources for health in Canada's three northern territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon), its role in the closure of the National School of Dental Therapy in 2011, and ramifications for the future of dental therapy in Canada.</jats:p>",

Because As(III) is predominant in groundwater and is more difficult to remove than As(V) is, oxidation of As(III) to As(V) is necessary to improve overall arsenic removal. This study was undertaken to enrich arsenite oxidizing bacteria under autotrophic conditions and to isolate and characterize facultative chemolithoautotrophic arsenite oxidizing bacteria (CAOs) that can oxidize As(III) effectively to As(V). An enrichment culture which adapted wide As(III) concentrations and completely oxidized 12 mM As(III) within 4 days under autotrophic conditions was established and maintained. Among 10 isolated strains, 6 strains, B1, B2, C, D, E1 and E2 belonging to β-Proteobacteria, were facultative CAOs and contained aoxB genes encoding the arsenite oxidase large subunit. Furthermore, they displayed various As(III) oxidation capabilities: B1, B2, E1 and E2 efficiently oxidized 1–10 mM As(III). The others showed efficient oxidation at 1–5 mM As(III), suggesting the coexistence of facultative CAOs with various As(III) oxidation capabilities in the enrichment. These results suggest that constructed enrichment and strains B1, B2, E1 and E2 can be useful for the bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated groundwater.</jats:p>",

In order to accomplish this, we extend an existing software framework; this software is aimed at creating a computational design tool to aid designers in developing new modular products, by taking into account design for assembly (DfA) and design for variety (DfV). We present an extension to that work where the user has the ability to generate modular designs considering component end-of-life options, and to optimize relevant supplier selections, either to minimize costs or carbon footprint. We compare the results of this modularization with the widely used decomposition approach (DA). Overall, this computational tool enables users to understand the trade-offs between product design and supply chain performance, and the presented investigation on the two modularization methods (DA and Green DA) attests to the implications of design decisions throughout the supply chain and across the product life cycle.</jats:p>",

It is postulated that this approach disrupts the vasculature supplying the paraspinal muscles and overlying skin. Although the spinal vasculature has been investigated previously, the smaller arterioles have not been described in the context of the posterior midline approach. Eight cadaveric neck and posterior torso specimens were dissected after injection with a radio‐opaque lead oxide mixture and subsequent radiographs taken were analyzed. The deep cervical, vertebral, superficial cervical, and occipital arteries consistently supplied the cervical paraspinal muscles. The latter two arteries also vascularized the overlying skin. The deep cervical arteries were found to be located lateral to the C3 to C6 vertebrae, vulnerable to damage with the posterior approach. In the thoracic region, the superior and posterior intercostal arteries consistently supplied the spinal muscles. In all specimens, two small anastomotic vessels posterior to the laminae were found connecting the intercostal artery perforators. Both the arterial perforators and their anastomotic channels were situated in the surgical field and susceptible to damage with the posterior approach. It is likely that the disruption in spinal vasculature contributes to the multifactorial problem of wound dehiscence with the posterior midline approach. Clin.

This paper develops and applies two optimization models to analyze the impacts of biomass competition on cost structures and gross margins for four competing biomass-based power plants in northwestern Ontario. Model scenarios are run to study the impacts of changes in parameters relevant to biomass type and processing technology, and prices of inputs and outputs on procurement costs. Cost minimization model shows that per unit procurement costs are directly proportional to the size of the power plants in all scenarios. Profit maximization model, on the other hand, shows that FMUs that are closer to the power plants make higher gross margins. However, the margins significantly increase for FMUs that are close to the power plants potentially offering higher prices. The variations in costs and gross margin structures under various model scenarios are explained by location of depletion cells relative to power plants, availability of each type of biomass in depletion cells, biomass demands, and differential processing costs for two types of biomass. These results can aid decision makers to make improved decisions related to biomass supply chains for bioenergy production.</jats:p>",

Climate variability and water dispute potentials induce water managers to develop proactive adaptive management strategies to mitigate future hydroclimate impacts. The Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer in the state of Idaho is also facing these challenges in the sense that population growth and economic development strongly depend on reliable water resources from underground storage. Drought and subsequent water conflict often drive scientific research and political agendas because water resources availability and aquifer management for a sustainable rural economy are of great interest. In this study, a system dynamics approach is applied to address dynamically complex problems with management of the aquifer and associated surface‐water and groundwater interactions. Recharge and discharge dynamics within the aquifer system are coded in an environmental modeling framework to identify long‐term behavior of aquifer responses to uncertain future hydrological variability. The research shows that the system dynamics approach is a promising modeling tool to develop sustainable water resources planning and management in a collaborative decision‐making framework and also to provide useful insights and alternative opportunities for operational management, policy support, and participatory strategic planning to mitigate future hydroclimate impacts in human dimensions.</jats:p>",

Its 23-member macrocyclic scaffold, mainly with a polyketide origin, features two methoxy groups at C-13 and C-15 and one allyl side chain at C-21, due to the region-specific incorporation of two unusual extender units derived from methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) and allylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA), respectively. Whether their intracellular formations can be a bottleneck for FK506 production remains elusive. In this study, we report the improvement of FK506 yield in the producing strain\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Streptomyces tsukubaensis</jats:named-content>\n            by the duplication of two sets of pathway-specific genes individually encoding the biosyntheses of these two extender units, thereby providing a promising approach to generate high-FK506-producing strains via genetic manipulation. Taking advantage of the fact that\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">S. tsukubaensis</jats:named-content>\n            is amenable to two actinophage (ΦC31 and VWB) integrase-mediated recombination systems, we genetically enhanced the biosyntheses of methoxymalonyl-ACP and allylmalonyl-CoA, as indicated by transcriptional analysis. Together with the optimization of glucose supplementation, the maximal FK506 titer eventually increased by approximately 150% in comparison with that of the original strain. The strategy of engineering the biosynthesis of unusual extender units described here may be applicable to improving the production of other polyketide or nonribosomal peptide natural products that contain pathway-specific building blocks.\n          </jats:p>",

In order to apply minimum quantity lubrication more efficiently, an investigate of the effects of the operating parameters involving oil supply, compressed air supply, and nozzle orientation is required. This article focuses on the oil supply rate of minimum quantity lubrication and aims to identify the effects of the minimum quantity lubrication applications with different oil supply rates in high-speed end milling of Ti–6Al–4V. The experiments were conducted by adjusting the oil supply rate from 2 ml/h to 14 ml/h, and cutting force, surface roughness, tool wear and failure mode, and tool wear mechanism were discussed. The results indicate that the increase of the oil supply rate effectively reduces cutting force and surface roughness, but after 10 ml/h the reduction is no longer significant. Increasing oil supply has growing penetration depth along the cutting edge, and by increasing the oil supply rate the length of the chipping edge can be notably reduced. For an insufficient oil supply rate (2 ml/h∼10 ml/h) chipping on the cutting edge introduced by diffusion wear is the main tool rejection reason, but at 14 ml/h no diffusion wear is found and the uniform flank wear is dominant, owing to reduced cutting temperature. </jats:p>",

At the higher‐magma‐supply study area, lava morphologies characteristic of higher effusion rates are more common, eruptions typically occur along elongated fissures, and eruptive volumes are an order of magnitude smaller (0.002–0.13 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>). At this site, glass MgO contents (2.7–8.4 wt. %) and corresponding liquidus temperatures are lower on average, and more variable, than those at the lower‐magma‐supply study area (6.2–9.1 wt. % MgO). The differences in eruptive volume, lava temperature, morphology, and inferred eruption rates observed between the two areas along the GSC are similar to those that have previously been related to variable spreading rates on the global MOR system. Importantly, the documentation of multiple sequences of eruptions at each study area, representing hundreds to thousands of years, provides constraints on the variability in eruptive style at a given magma supply and spreading rate.</jats:p>",
