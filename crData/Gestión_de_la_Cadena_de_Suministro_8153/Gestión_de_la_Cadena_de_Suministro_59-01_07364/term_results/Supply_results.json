Growth increased with increasing sulphur supply, all plants except those at the highest sulphur level showing deficiency symptoms. As the severity of the deficiency increased, the root system formed a proportionately larger part of the plant, and the stems and petioles smaller proportions; the proportion of the whole plant formed by the laminae was reduced to only a slight extent. Nitrogen and sulphur fractions were examined in the laminae, nitrogen at each of three harvests and sulphur at the second harvest. The percentages of protein nitrogen and of total nitrogen increased as sulphur supply increased, protein nitrogen forming a greater proportion of the total nitrogen at the higher sulphur levels. In contrast, protein sulphur formed the bulk of the total sulphur in deficient plants, but as sulphur supply approached an adequate level for growth, there was a marked increase in non-protein organic sulphur and a smaller increase in sulphate sulphur. In this respect, white clover appears to differ from legumes other than Trifolium spp. and from non-legumes, all of which accumulate sulphur mainly as sulphate. </jats:p>"

When catecholamines were infused at any fixed cardiac output, cardiac oxygen consumption rose in association with increases in blood pressure and heart rate, while cardiac external mechanical efficiency declined. The significance of the product (blood pressure times heart rate) as an index of the total cardiac effort, as indicated by the myocardial oxygen requirement, is considered in view of the alterations brought about by catecholamines in this relationship. The decline in the coronary A-V oxygen difference, the percentage of oxygen extracted by the heart and the ratio (cardiac oxygen consumption/oxygen availability) and the rise in coronary venous oxygen, are all attributed to a direct action of catecholamines on the coronary vessels. Despite their new levels, the coronary venous oxygen, content and the coronary A-V oxygen difference remain fairly constant as the cardiac effort and its oxygen requirement vary during catecholamine infusion. </jats:p>",
