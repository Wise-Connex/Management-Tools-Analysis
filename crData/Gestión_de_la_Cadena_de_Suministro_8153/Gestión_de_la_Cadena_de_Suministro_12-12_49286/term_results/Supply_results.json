      "abstract": "<jats:p>The key to a library’s success is its ability to effectively and economically deliver services and information that users value. Additionally, the objective of supply chain management is to coordinate the focal firm’s processes and activities with those of its suppliers and customers, such that the firm’s delivered products and services meet or exceed customer requirements. It thus seemed appropriate to analyze a library from a supply chain perspective to assess and improve its ability to serve its users. Consequently, the authors employed an action research methodology to work with library personnel from two departments, User Services and Technical Services, as they merged into one division, to map the information resources supply chain of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Lied Library. Once the supply chain model was completed, key processes were analyzed and performance measures designed, with the goal of improving division products and services. This paper reviews the relevant literature, presents the Lied Library information resources supply chain model, and provides the performance measures along with several improvement examples. </jats:p>"

With an objective of providing a theoretical lens to show and solve the essential supply chain collaboration issues, this paper proposes the Extended Supply-Chain Operations Reference-Model (eSCOR), and its associated definitions, layers, sub-models followed by the discussions of two typical business elements: objects versus flows. Specifically, this paper confirms the supply chain automorphism within the eSCOR, and discusses its characteristics of self-symmetry as the solution to the four paradoxes mentioned before.

      "abstract": "<p>Original proposal objectives: Our main original goal was to develop ultra-fast methods and instrumentation for the analysis of hazardous chemicals in the food supply. We proposed to extend the QuEChERS approach to veterinary drugs and other contaminants, and conduct fast and ultra-fast analyses using novel 5MB-MS instrumentation, ideally with real samples. Background to the topic: The international trade of agricultural food products is a $1.2 trill ion annual market and growing. Food safety is essential to human health, and chemical residue limits are legislated nationally and internationally. Analytical testing for residues is needed to conduct risk assessments and regulatory enforcement actions to ensure food safety and environmental health, among other important needs. Current monitoring methods are better than ever, but they are still too time-consuming, laborious, and expensive to meet the broad food testing needs of consumers, government, and industry. As a result, costs are high and only a tiny fraction of the food is tested for a limited number of contaminants. We need affordable, ultra-fast methods that attain high quality results for a wide range of chemicals. Major conclusions, solutions and achievements: This is the third BARD grant shared between Prof. Amirav and Dr. Lehotay since 2000, and continual analytical improvements have been made in terms of speed, sample throughput, chemical scope, ease-of-use, and quality of results with respect to qualitative (screening and identification) and quantitative factors. The QuEChERS sample preparation approach, which was developed in conjunction with the BARD grant in 2002, has grown to currently become the most common pesticide residue method in the world. BARD funding has been instrumental to help Dr. Lehotay make refinements and expand QuEChERS concepts to additional applications, which has led to the commercialization of QuEChERS products by more than 20 companies worldwide. During the past 3 years, QuEChERS has been applied to multiclass, multiresidue analysis of veterinary drug residues in food animals, and it has been validated and implemented by USDA-FSIS. QuEChERS was also modified and validated for faster, easier, and better analysis of traditional and emerging environmental contaminants in food. Meanwhile, Prof. Amirav has commercialized the GC-MS with 5MB technology and other independent inventions, including the ChromatoProbe with Agilent, Bruker, and FUR Systems. A new method was developed for obtaining truly universal pesticide analysis, based on the use of GC-MS with 5MB. This method and instrument enables faster analysis with lower LaDs for extended range of pesticides and hazardous compounds. A new approach and device of Open Probe Fast GC-MS with 5MB was also developed that enable real time screening of limited number of target pesticides. Implications, both scientific and agricultural: We succeeded in achieving significant improvements in the analysis of hazardous chemicals in the food supply, from easy sample preparation approaches, through sample analysis by advanced new types of GC-MS and LCMS techniques, all the way to improved data analysis by lowering LaD and providing greater confidence in chemical identification. As a result, the combination of the QuEChERS approach, new and superior instrumentation, and the novel monitoring methods that were developed will enable vastly reduced time and cost of analysis, increased analytical scope. and a higher monitoring rate. This provides better enforcement, an added impetus for farmers to use good agricultural practices, improved food safety and security, increased trade. and greater consumer confidence in the food supply.</p>"

Despite the recent economic recession, the state has experienced significant population growth, and Colorado's population is expected to nearly double within the next 40 years. Other pressures on Colorado's water supply include severe drought, a desire to meet multiple needs (i.e., municipal, environmental, recreational) with existing resources, and impacts to agriculture due to water shortages, urbanization, and transfers to new users. To address these challenges, the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) has undertaken a visioning process to explore solutions to these future water supply challenges. As part of this process, CWCB has led the state in identifying demand and supply strategies to meet the state's future water needs while considering agriculture and the environment. These strategies have been combined into varying portfolios that include methods such as conservation, local water projects, new Colorado River development, and agricultural transfers. This paper details the development and evaluation of these portfolios and describes stakeholder's efforts to balance meeting Colorado's water needs in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In all over the world in consequence of the global warming the water use became very much increasable demanded. At present the agricultural sector remained as the biggest user for the water. At the national economic level of the developing countries, the water use for agricultural sector was 80% of all amount of the water coming from the rivers. This portion was about 65% at national economic level of the highly developed countries, in which the agricultural sector had share between 3-5% of the GDP. The other 35% were used by the industrial sector, service sectors and population water consumption. Also about 40% of the world’s food came from the irrigated 20% areas of all cultivated lands. The water use of agricultural sector was very considerable. In this case the development of the irrigation system is demanded at the international and Hungarian national levels because of its strong connection with food production. There are two kinds of irrigation systems, namely the large scale and small scale irrigation one, both of which are also public and private sectors, as well. The national governments provide the planning, financial supports, and investment activities, but in most of cases the farmers get subsidies. In private field farmers, as carrying the risk, realise economic activities including the developing irrigation system based on governmental supports. This case study analyzes the importance of large and small scale irrigation systems, because both of them are equally important based on the available capital amount and the production structure of farms.</jats:p>"

We find no evidence of perverse effects. Program expansion was not associated with drops in either labor force participation or wageformality. On the contrary, the expansion of Oportunidades was strongly correlated with a transition from informal wage employment to self-employment for men (by 1.6% and 0.6% of total employment in rural and urban municipalities respectively). These findings suggest that Oportunidades is not creating dependence from social assistance.</jats:p>"

The simulation shows that the users tend to reserve a specific quantity of power which is equal to the expected lowest reverse power supply in the condition of high risk aversion degree; however it will increase with the rise of feed-in tariff when the degree is low. In addition, the double marginalization which occurs in the reverse supply chain of V2G reserve power results in that the optimal reserve power of users cannot achieve the maximum mutual profit, in decentralized decision mode. Therefore two different coordination strategies for users with different risk aversion are proposed in this paper.</jats:p>"

And we build the demand distribution function including consumer characters which is more in line with the reality of the actual retailer operations. Through numerical analysis using Matlab software， we find that carbon emissions allocation coefficient does not affect the optimal profits of suppliers and retailer under wholesale price contract; Supply chain enterprise could gain more profit through the carbon emissions collaborative, choosing reasonable carbon emissions levels.</jats:p>"

While network technology and IT facilitate supply chain management, their security risks have brought trouble to the effective operation of the supply chain, which restricts the operation and development of the supply chain. Therefore, the supply chain information risk management issues are paid more attention. In this situation, I study and analyze the information risk of the supply chain in e-commerce environment, also explore the corresponding information risk.

The research and development of new energy sources and energy saving are two key ways to solve the potential global energy shortage. The solar energy is important for its cleanliness and unexhausting. The solar water heaters are widely used in domestic hot water supply. The former natural cycle system had a lower performance of heat collection, insulation and convenience as well as conflict with architecture. It is necessary to develop a new style solar water heater in north china. This paper presents an forced circulation solar hot water supply system with spiral copper coil as heat exchanger in heat storage tank and plate solar collectors. It has high collection efficiency and it is consistent with the architecture. The system is full of antifreeze to solve the freezing problem in north china. The experimental study was conducted for solar hot water supply system. The experimental results indicate that the forced circulation solar hot water supply system has superior performance of heat collection and heat transfer. The average heat output is respectively 2.82kWh/m2 in spring, 3.13 kWh/m2 in summer and 2.73 kWh/m2 in autumn. The hot water output is respectively75.3L/m2.d in spring, 81.2 L/m2.d in summer and 56.5 L/m2.d in autumn if the temperature difference is 28°C.In addition, by use of the experimental measured data the long-term thermal performance can be forecast.</jats:p>"

However, it has defied authoritative explanation to date. Several attempts have been offered to explain the bias. They can be divided to two main categories: demand-oriented and supply-oriented explanations. This article argues in favour of supply-side explanations. The study is based on comparison of bookmaker odds to betting exchange odds in three betting markets. The data obtained illustrate that the disparity between bookmaker odds and betting exchange prices increases rapidly as the implied probability of the event decreases. This provides an explanation of the favorite-longshot bias which is consistent with earlier empirical research, showing declining expected returns on bets as odds increase. In addition, this explanation is consistent with the evidence concerning the volume of bets actually received by bookmakers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The emergence of supply chain as a growing area of research has generated a renewed interest in theory and theory-making within the field of operations management. This interest is the result of the parallel advances in other areas like economics, sociology, and general management that have developed theoretical perspectives and tools relevant for the operations domain. Work in these areas has demonstrated the relevance of strategic action and organizational structure that are traditionally ignored in an operations framework. In this paper we propose a new theory through which existing research paradigms in the field of operations management may be reinterpreted and redirected. We call this theory the Theory of Entrepreneurial Policy Alignment (TEPA). The point of departure for the theory is the concept of the policy as the locus of institutional activity. The TEPA defines the policy as the fundamental unit of economic analysis and the strategic lever of entrepreneurial action. Analysis of policy – as opposed to the individual choice or the transaction cost – permits the examination of economic activity, which draws attention to the Schumpeterian dynamics of competing supply chains operating in environments far from equilibrium. This theoretical innovation marks the theory as distinct from others on order and can be seen as a movement through transaction cost economics. The TEPA recognizes the consequential nature of operations and incorporates policy considerations to arrive at a newer institutional economics. In this paper, we motivate the argument for developing such a theory, present its basic features and provide an example of how TEPA may be applied to a decision to offshore a manufacturing production facility. </jats:p>"

The establishment of the model is based on the principles of competition in the same layer and cooperation between different layers. Then, from the perspective of suppliers, port agents and customers, we respectively model the optimizing behavior of the various decision makers by using variational inequalities, and we derive the equilibrium conditions of the entire supply chain by using improved projection algorithm. Finally, we prove the feasibility of the model by experiment.</jats:p>"

The analytical result shows that the more flexible the delivery capacity is, the smaller the optimal production size is, which is consistent with short order lead time and small lot size that claimed by the wholesaler. Therefore, the manufacturer can quickly respond to demand of the wholesaler under the condition that the total cost is invariable. Moreover, when the delivery capacity isn’t absolute flexibility, the manufacturer may motivate the wholesaler to undertake product delivery through reducing the transfer price so that the wholesaler’s optimal order size under decentralized supply chain is closer to both the manufacturer’s optimal production size and the entire supply chain’s optimal size under centralized supply chain, which may benefit the entire supply chain since both can obtain a win-win solution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application of supply chain analysis to the evaluation of the effectiveness of social service organizations The identification and analysis of value chains is a way to find the sources of an organization’s in-/efficiency, and an opportunity to explore how an organization is managed. Having in mind that an “organization network” is a form similar, in its functioning, to a separate organization, one may, using the value chain concept, investigate the management of local activity programmes, as of the networks they are. The researched partnerships introduced a management innovation, in that the social service provision organizations were brought together to form one chain. The researched organizations providing social services have introduced innovations in management that are supposed to unite organizations providing social services in a single chain. This kind of approach allows to obtain additional benefits, including the joint management of subjects composing the chain. In practice, it is also connected with sharing benefits between the participants in the chain, as well as replacing the elements of competition and suspicion with cooperation and trust. Delivering value to the beneficiary, under the provision of social services, is important not only from the point of view of humanity, but also in order to maximize the use of resources, usually insufficient to meet all the needs. The presented studies of supply chains of social services in Silesia showed, that some features of these newly created areas being subject of joint management, still crave for numerous improvements. What may help is logistics, in particular business logistics, having years of experience in the area of observation and active participation in the chain management. However, unconditional adaptation of these experiences is not possible due to the fact that developed methods are based on cost and maintenance compromises, which are insensitive to human needs when the service cost for the chain is not sufficiently profitable. Therefore, it is necessary to implement different methods of managing these chains, principles of which are described in the social logistics. The authors are convinced that combination of the efforts of the organizers of social services and experienced logistics professionals can bring a double benefit. In practical terms it may help to improve the delivery of services with no deterioration of their quality, and to increase the range of services (quantitative or qualitative) based on specific resources. In the epistemological dimension it may enable to develop rules to adapt the theory of logistics for the socially significant needs. Therefore, this paper can be considered as the beginning of the discussion in this regard. </jats:p>"

The study aim is to estimate global and regional costs and benefits of sanitation and drinking-water supply interventions to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target in 2015, as well as to attain universal coverage. Input data on costs and benefits from reviewed literature were combined in an economic model to estimate the costs and benefits, and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). Benefits included health and access time savings. Global BCRs (Dollar return per Dollar invested) were 5.5 for sanitation, 2.0 for water supply and 4.3 for combined sanitation and water supply. Globally, the costs of universal access amount to US$ 35 billion per year for sanitation and US$ 17.5 billion for drinking-water, over the 5-year period 2010–2015 (billion defined as 109 here and throughout). The regions accounting for the major share of costs and benefits are South Asia, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Improved sanitation and drinking-water supply deliver significant economic returns to society, especially sanitation. Economic evidence should further feed into advocacy efforts to raise funding from governments, households and the private sector.</jats:p>",

The theoretical basis of our work is the priority and responsibility matrix: the study describes phases of the empirical reasearch conducted to assess the sustainability of a typical food supply chain. San Marzano Tomato is endowed with an origin certification label (pdo), meeting demand within high-value market niches. It is a product symbol of Campania region (Italy), benefiting of several interventions of the public regional operator (genetic resources research, support for the establishment of origin certification, etc.). The proposed methodology provides simple rules to follow the time evolution of a food supply chain, judging feasible solutions to satisfy inter-dimensional requisites of durable development.

On veut dire par là que Rawls entend donner une justification morale à une distribution modérée des revenus par les individus plus fortunés en faveur des individus les plus désavantagés. Cependant, depuis la parution de Une Théorie de la Justice , les inégalités économiques ont augmenté de manière dramatique, atteignant des niveaux jamais vus depuis la Grande Dépression – niveaux que Rawls aurait certainement trouvés pervers. Pour beaucoup cette augmentation est due à l’émergence de l’économie de l’offre et à la baisse spectaculaire des taux d’imposition sur les firmes et sur les revenus des plus aisés. A mes yeux, pourtant, le principe de différence, ou en tout cas la culture qu’il reflète, est en partie responsable de cet état de choses. Mon but, dans cet article, est de mettre en lumière le lien entre le principe de différence, l’économie de l’offre et l’augmentation des inégalités, d’expliquer en quoi le principe de différence est erroné, et d’établir ce que les libéraux fidèles aux idéaux égalitaires qui sous-tendent ce principe sont en mesure d’accomplir.</jats:p>",

This paper makes a deep study for drop short pulse testing system on AVR with thyristor power supply, and digital signal processing is used to obtain drop short pulse value with different frequency ranges. According to the specification of thyristor power supply, firstly, basic theory analysis of drop short pulse measuring is researched. Secondly, high-speed digital signal processing technology is adopted to sample furnace voltage signal real-timely, trap filter group is designed to remove the multiple order harmonic, and band pass filter group is designed directly to process and calculate the amount of drop short pulses in different frequency ranges, finally, the material parameters which impact on drop short frequency. Field experiment results show the effectiveness of the whole drop short pulse testing system.</jats:p>"

Examples include supply chains with consumer returns, leasing options, and end‐of‐use returns with remanufacturing. I classify the literature in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational issues, but I focus on strategic issues (such as when should an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) remanufacture, response to take‐back legislation, and network design, among others) and tactical issues (used product acquisition and disposition decisions). The article is written in the form of a tutorial, where for each topic I present a base model with underlying assumptions and results, comment on extensions, and conclude with my view on needed research areas.</jats:p>",

In consideration of the current straw biomass fuel supply system in China, that is \"fuel origin – purchasing station - power plant\", appropriate hypothesis and simplification were made on the linear transportation model. The logistics parameters for the biopower plant were obtained through the model analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to analyze the optimal delivered cost of biomass under different operation scenarios, which enhanced the reliability of the final results. The optimal model proposed in this paper can also be used as a reference for the other biopower plants in the other regions.</jats:p>"

In 2005, CSDO began a multiechelon inventory optimization (MEIO) project to improve its efficiency and effectiveness by optimizing inventory levels and locations across CSDO's end-to-end supply chain. This paper describes the project plan, workflows, and results. One year after implementation, total inventory levels were reduced by more than 11 percent; in addition, service levels of products modeled using the MEIO process were eight points higher than products not modeled using this process. The MEIO process continues to be in place at Intel and has resulted in sustained reductions in inventory levels, average service levels exceeding 90 percent, and more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of expedites. </jats:p>",

Data used are quarterly series from 1977 to 2007 and we used vector error-correction model for long-run and short-run causality tests. We found that money supply is endogenous in Australia even when the central bank targeted monetary aggregates during the period 1977 to 1993. </jats:p>",

Based on the process library parameters, the timer outputs the PWM square wave which the frequency and duty cycle can be adjusted, and the serial port output message controled DC power output. The PWM square wave is used to control the on-off of the VMOS circuit, which can be used as the DC converter of the programmable DC power supply, and generates high frequency pulse voltage to control the growth rate of the electrolyte.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, refined petroleum products are manufactured by six refineries in South Africa. The supply of refined petroleum products is supplemented by imports of refined petroleum products. These refined petroleum products are transported by pipeline, rail, road, sea and a combination thereof to depots across the country. These products are then distributed directly to commercial customers through points of resale in the form of retail service stations. The challenge is that the storage facilities and distribution networks in South Africa are currently utilised to its full capacity. There is a need to expand current storage infrastructure or to erect new storage facilities to facilitate imports. Durban Port that currently handles 70% of the country’s crude oil and 40% of refined products is also utilised to its full capacity. The investigated problem pertains to the limited storage and transport capacity available for the distribution of petroleum products in the country. The interview protocol, which was based on the literature reviewed, was used for compiling the primary data for the case study. Selected findings revealed that the respondents perceived that storage capacity is the most significant constraint militating against adequate supply by the supply chain. The findings also indicated that the respondents were of the opinion that transport rates and routes (cost of logistics) are the greatest contributor to the prices of products. As a result, there appears to be a major scope for improvement in terms of the usage of pipelines and rails for the movement of petroleum products.Keywords: Petroleum products, storage facilities, supply chain, transportation, South African energy sector.Disciplines: civil engineering, architecture, business studies, energy studies </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cover crops (CC) can provide protection from erosion and prevent soil carbon depletion. In many cases CC are fertilized to improve carbon inputs and soil cover, however there are few studies on the residual effect of nitrogen (N) in CC biomass and its contribution to N availability of subsequent crops. In order to elucidate this question, a field experiment with rye as cover crop during fallow for corn was carried out at INTA experimental station Anguil, La Pampa. The four treatments were control (C), and CC fertilized with 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha-1 (N0, N40 and N80), in a completely randomized block design. The fertilized CC treatments were later split at V6 of the corn crop, with applications of 60 and 120 kg N ha-1 for N40 and N80 respectively (N40+60 and N80+120). Dry matter (DM) and nutrient contents of standing CC and their residues was determined at “drying” of CC, planting and harvest of corn. Corn yields were recorded at maturity. Fertilized CC had significantly higher DM and N contents than N0 throughout the sampling period; loss of N from CC residues was 38.1, 43.6, 50.2 kg ha-1 for N0, N40 and N80 respectively, around 90% of this loss occurred between “drying” and planting. Assuming the total N loss from DM, this represented 40, 35 and 22% of total corn N uptake for N0, N40 and N80. The yield response of corn to N40 and N80 was 1.5 and 6.1 Mg ha-1, resulting in N use efficiencies of 0.3 and 0.12 Mg grain per kg N applied, respectively. Fertilizer applied to corn caused yield increases of 5.0 and 1.9 Mg for N40+60 and N80+120, with efficiencies of 0.08 and 0.01 Mg grain per kg N applied, respectively. We concluded that N applied to cover crops could be an efficient practice to enhance N availability for corn.</jats:p>",

Field experiments were conducted in farmers' fields in Pototan, Iloilo, for two dry seasons, to evaluate the best location-specific fertilizer management strategy suited for irrigated lowland rice under different water regimes. The verification trials were conducted in irrigated rice fields in 2002-2003 dry season at barangays Cahaguikican and Igang, both in Pototan town Province of Iloilo. In 2003-2004 dry season, the test was only conducted in Igang, Pototan. The treatments were laid out in a Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with four replications using a plot size of 30 square meters.Treatments were tested as to (a) farmer's actual practice, (b) growth stage-based N application (120 kg N/ha, 40 kg P₂O₅ /ha, and 40 kg K₂O/ha), (c) leaf color chart (LCC) - based N application. Results in Cahaguikican, Pototan showed that the LCC-based nitrogen application is suited for the site. In Igang, Pototan, the farmer's fertilizer management practice is cost-efficient under continuously flooded condition. However, if irrigation is done once a week, the LCC-based nitrogen application of fertilizer is recommended.\r\n </jats:p>"

The spring zone is used for water supply (about 250 l/s) of an important tourist area of Crikvenica and Novi Vinodolski. After unsuccessful attempts of physical separation of freshwater system from the sea influence, by construction of grout curtain, hydrogeological studies have focused on the possibility of groundwater capturing in the hinterland of discharge zone, outside of the zone of periodical salinity. The final research results with the exploitation well in the spring hinterland can serve as a model for research and exploitation of drinking water in natural conditions of unstable freshwater-saltwater interface in similar natural conditions.</jats:p>"

In regard to the collaboration between the retailer and the manufacturer, we explore a revenue‐sharing coordination mechanism for achieving a win‐win outcome. The optimality and sensitivity of the critical parameters in four strategies are obtained and examined both theoretically and numerically, which generate insights on how to manage an efficient consumer‐retailer‐manufacturer reverse supply chain, as well as on the feasibility of simplifying such a three‐stage chain structure. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We first replicate that this paradox exists in a context of the assessment of operational supply risks, and then show how the paradox can be understood as the consequence of process characteristics mediating the relation between expertise and assessment performance.</jats:p><jats:p>Using an experimental setup, we had 234 OSCM‐professionals assess the operational risk in two series of different business cases, and measured several characteristics of their decision‐making process. The strength of our approach lies in the fact that the business cases were real‐life cases from our database of purchasing transactions in the area of IT‐purchasing. This allows a comparison of the risk assessments of the professionals with the actual supply risk as was known from the survey database. Our findings show that, contrary to what is often assumed, the OSCM‐professionals with more expertise do not use less information while assessing, nor are they faster. Instead, our results show that specialized expertise goes with increased certainty about the assessments, and general expertise goes with an increased use of intuitive judgment. However, the net effects of these expertise characteristics on assessment performance are zero. In the case of specialized expertise this is because specialized expertise is itself negatively related to performance.

Based on fundamental support vector machine (SVM) principles, a parameter optimization flow for an Agent-DEVS model is put forward, and a parameter optimization model for the supply task parameter in simulation models for material supply in an emergent disaster is established. Some key techniques, including data extraction and preprocessing, kernel function selection and SVM model parameter preferences, are analyzed, and the comparison with the back-propagation neural network is examined. A simulation test shows that SVM has strong learning and fitting capabilities and weak dependence on samples. It enhances the dynamics of Agent-DEVS models. The self-learning ability significantly improves model intelligence and the optimized parameters provide models with more elaborate descriptive abilities. </jats:p>",

MRSA has been detected in a small percentage of retail meat and raw milk samples indicating a potential risk for food-borne transmission of MRSA.

This was achieved through a series of experiments with MESH and its parent numerical weather prediction model [the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale model in its regional configuration (GEM Regional)]. With forcing extracted from operational GEM Regional forecasts, MESH underestimated the NBS in fall and winter. The underestimation increased when the GEM precipitation was replaced with its corrected version provided by the Canadian Precipitation Analysis. This pointed to overestimated lake evaporation and prompted the revision of the parameterization of the surface turbulent fluxes over water used both in MESH and GEM. The revised parameterization was validated against turbulent fluxes measured at a point on Lake Superior. Its use in MESH reduced the lake evaporation and largely corrected the NBS underestimation. However, the Lake Superior NBS became overestimated, signaling an inconsistency between the reduced lake evaporation and the prescribed precipitation. To remove the inconsistency, a new forcing dataset (including precipitation) was generated with the GEM model using the revised flux parameterization. A major NBS simulation improvement was obtained with the new atmospheric forcing reflecting the atmospheric response to the modified surface fluxes over the lakes. Additional improvements resulted by correcting the runoff with a modified snowmelt rate and by insertion of observed streamflows. The study shows that accurate lake evaporation simulation is crucial for accurate NBS prediction.</jats:p>",

Secondly, make the output voltage of the inverter synchronize with the voltage of alternative access phase, then switch the electric equipment to the alternative access phase to accomplish the soft-switching.

It has been estimated that to provide safe drinking water to all rural habitations in the country with minimum satisfactory level of service would require a further investment of about Rs.450 billion. In view of increasing constraints, it would be a difficult task for the Government alone to mobilize such huge investment single handedly. Therefore, aproductive and pro-active involvement of user community and other stakeholders in resource mobilization and community participation in the implementation as well as the operation and maintenance of the system has become imperative. To translate the above strategy into practice, it requires massive efforts to transform the prevailing mindset of the major partners – the users, community, local Government, Government agencies, NGO’s etc. When users are involved in operation and maintenance of the systems, they are likely to be willing to pay forit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Orca Basin, an intraslope basin on the Texas–Louisiana continental slope, hosts a hypersaline, anoxic brine in its lowermost 200 m. This brine contains a large reservoir of reduced and aged carbon, and appears to be stable at decadal time scales: concentrations and the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) are similar to previous reports. Both DIC and DOC are more \"aged\" within the brine pool than in overlying water, and the isotopic contrast between brine carbon and seawater carbon is much greater for DIC than DOC. While the stable carbon isotopic composition of brine DIC points towards a combination of methane and organic carbon re-mineralization as its source, radiocarbon and box model results point to the brine interface as the major source region for DIC with oxidation of methane diffusing upwards from sediments supplying only limited DIC to the brine. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies reporting microbial activity focused at the seawater-brine interface. Isotopic similarities between DIC and DOC suggest a different relationship between these two carbon reservoirs than is typically observed in deep ocean basins. Radiocarbon values implicate the seawater-brine interface region as the likely source region for DOC as well as DIC. Further investigations of the seawater-brine interface are needed to advance our understanding of the specific microbial processes contributing to dissolved carbon storage in the Orca Basin brine.\n                        </jats:p>"

In Malawi, the design, implementation and evaluation of rural sanitation marketing programs has been limited. This study applied a mixed methodological approach to examine the dynamic interactions between the supply and demand of sanitation in three rural districts. The supply assessment identified an extremely limited range of latrine options. Sanitation suppliers reported very low household demand for their existing latrine options. An additional constraint reported by suppliers was householders' perception of a hardware subsidy for latrine construction. The demand assessment found a key constraint of constructing an unlined pit latrine was their short time-in-use (11–13 months). Householders expressed despondency at having to consistently rebuild collapsed, unlined pit latrines. For brick-lined latrines, a key barrier was affordability combined with an over-estimation of construction costs. Key motivations to construct brick-lined latrines included product attributes and social drivers. Wide variations in access to income and use of micro-finance organizations were recorded within and across the study sites. Formative market research is an iterative process from which new lines of investigation arise. This study provides information that will provide a foundation for the ongoing research, design, implementation and monitoring of rural sanitation marketing programs in Malawi.</jats:p>",

The resulting correlations showed very high levels of reliability and adequacy, and were uses to make conclusions on which supply chain innovation practices had a positive impact on company financial performance. The conclusions are somewhat astounding with the interesting finding that some innovation practices do not support firm performance and maybe should be avoided; while others ICS practices are shown to support firm performance to a high degree.</jats:p>",

As a number of factors may lead to inflation in an economy, this study attempts to measure the relative significance of structural shocks in explaining infiation. Monthly time series data is used on key macroeconomic variables of Pakistan from July 1992 to June 2011, and structural vector auto-regressions (SVAR) to understand the role ofsupply and demand shocks as key drivers of infiation. Long- run restrictions according to standard aggregate demand and aggregate supply framework are employed to identify structural shocks in the system. The results indicate that inflation follows a sluggish time path in response to supply shock as compared to demand shock of nominal nature. Specifically, around 75 percent oflong-run impact ofsupply shock on inflation is realized over a period of one year horizon as compared with 90 percent for demand shock. In terms of relative significance, supply side disturbances explain 48 percent of variation in inflation over the estimation period. Within demand side, nominal shocks are relatively more important than the real demand shock. The share ofreal demand shock was around 10 percent, while the reaming 42 percent was attributed to nominal shock. These results suggest that in addition to monetary factors, supply side disturbances should be taken into account for better understanding of and 'handle' on infiation in Pakistan.</jats:p>"

The paper contributes to the existing body of research by providing the food retailers’ own perspective on the factors that trigger addressing sustainability concerns in their supply chain and by providing a taxonomy of drivers and barriers. As a result, a number of additional factors that influence the launch of responsible supply chain practices have been identified. Interestingly some of these factors are beyond the trivial driver‐barrier dichotomy.

Findings from a survey of 590 employers with more than 50 employees in the State of Queensland point to an unusually strong orientation towards the recruitment of older workers among respondents, although the retraining of older workers is not prioritised by the majority. The issue of workforce ageing is viewed as being of medium-term importance by the majority of respondents, although for a substantial number the issue is of immediate concern. Both sector and organisation size are predictive of the application of a broad range of policies targeting older workers, with public-sector and larger organisations more likely to be active. Concerns about workforce ageing and labour supply are predictive of employer behaviours regarding older workers, suggesting that sustained policy making may be emerging in response to population ageing over and above more immediate concerns about labour shortages and that this broad thrust of organisational policy making may be immune to the point in the economic cycle. This study found no evidence that the flexible firm will not countenance an ageing workforce.</jats:p>",

Apart from using expert knowledge, the authors have also consulted extensively from journals, conference papers, reports, and some documents to get secondary information on the subject. The paper has reviewed the world energy scenario and how hydropower fits in as the solution to the global sustainable energy challenge. Issues of hydropower resource availability, technology, environment and climate change have been also discussed. Hydropower is sensitive to the state of environment, and climate change. With global climate change, though globally the potential is stated to slightly increase, some countries will experience a decrease in potential with increased risks. Adaptation measures are required to sustainably generate hydropower. These are also discussed in the paper.</jats:p>",

This innovation illustrates two different strategies of supplier involvement in technology development: black-box and gray-box or co-design. This paper presents two cases studies of how two mature Brazilian automakers subsidiaries (Volkswagen and General Motors) undertook the development of flex-fuel technology. We also present the development's context, which led to the technology wide spread adoption. Then we discuss the possible impact of both involvement strategies on dependence relations between automakers and their module suppliers, suggesting they will not change large trends toward more, even if limited, dependence on complex high technology modules or \"systemist\" suppliers.</jats:p>"

This paper shows that the evolution of the commercial organisational structure of agricultural products has led to a gradual improvement in the producer price. It also shows that whatever the degree of vertical integration on these markets, it has a positive impact on the farm gate price. However, even if vertical integration also improves the price of agricultural input on the intermediary market, the intermediary firms undergo a deteriorating situation.</jats:p>",

Field experiments were conducted to determine the efficiency of SODIS and evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of SODIS under local climatic conditions in Karachi, Pakistan. In order to enhance the efficiency of SODIS, the application of physical interventions were also investigated. Twenty per cent of the total samples met drinking water guidelines under strong sunlight weather conditions, showing that SODIS is effective for complete disinfection under specific conditions. Physical interventions, including black-backed and reflecting rear surfaces in the batch reactors, enhanced SODIS performance. Microbial regrowth was also investigated and found to be more controlled in reactors with reflective and black-backed surfaces. The transfer of plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) released from the bottle material polyethylene terephthalate (PET) under SODIS conditions was also investigated. The maximum DEHP concentration in SODIS-treated water was 0.38 μg/L less than the value of 0.71 μg/L reported in a previous study and well below the WHO drinking-quality guideline value. Thus SODIS-treated water can successfully be used by the people living in squatter settlements of mega-cities, such as Karachi, with some limitations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of ‘Greening’ is intrinsically linked to offsetting and abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting largely from fossil fuel–based and energy-intensive industrial operations and various anthropogenic actions. ‘Kyoto Protocol’ pioneered the concept of mandatory reduction and compliance of GHG reduction norms applicable for major polluting nations in the world by 2012 and beyond. This prompted the corporate world to go in for introduction and commercialisation of ‘clean’ and ‘green technologies’ to mass produce and market wide-ranging green products. This had in turn led to the concept of Green Marketing. The concept of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has been a parallel development to push the green products in an ever-expanding market with huge future potential—given growing customer consciousness towards eco-friendly green products and changing lifestyles. The article reviews and analyses different dimensions and facets of GSCM, including the evolution of the concept, approaches of building the constructs of GSCM, implementation strategy, linkage with transport systems, ‘Lean’ concept in supply chain management (SCM), green innovations and sustainability issues of GSCM and Green Logistics strategies for evolving integrated GSCM system. </jats:p>",

In practice, the choice of proper cooperation modes is a common issue for decision makers of underdeveloped destinations. To provide some insights into this issue, the authors propose a tourism supply-chain model consisting of one tour operator and two tourism destinations, one underdeveloped and one more mature. Unlike previous studies, in this model the mature tourism destination instead of the tour operator takes central place. Under different cooperation modes, the authors first analyse the equilibrium solutions and profits of all members of the decentralized decision-making situation. Then the quantity discount contract is used to coordinate the tourism supply chain and achieve reasonable profit allocation. Based on one numerical example, a comparison of the different cooperation modes is presented and recommendations are provided for the development of underdeveloped tourism destinations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. We used piston cores recovered in the western Bering Sea to reconstruct millennial-scale changes in marine productivity and terrigenous matter supply over the past ~180 kyr. Based on a geochemical multi-proxy approach our results indicate closely interacting processes controlling marine productivity and terrigenous matter supply comparable to the situation in the Okhotsk Sea. Overall, terrigenous inputs were high, whereas primary production was low. Minor increases in marine productivity occurred during warm intervals of stage 5 and interstadials, but pronounced maxima were recorded during interglacials and Termination I. Seasonal sea-ice is suggested to act as the dominant transport agent for terrigenous material. From our results we propose glacial, deglacial, and interglacial scenarios for environmental change in the Bering Sea. These changes seem to be primarily controlled by insolation and sea-level forcing which affect the strength of atmospheric pressure systems and sea-ice growth. The opening history of the Bering Strait and the Aleutian passes is considered to have had an additional impact. Sea-ice dynamics are thought to drive changes in surface productivity, terrigenous inputs, and upper-ocean stratification. High-resolution core logging data (color b*, XRF scans) strongly correspond to the Dansgaard–Oeschger climate variability registered in the NGRIP ice core and support an atmospheric coupling mechanism of Northern Hemisphere climates.\n                        </jats:p>"

Diffusion and convection usually are interconnected in physics world, while convection is directly connected with flow velocity. Therefore, in a diffusion oven, the velocity of the gas(es) surrounding the wafer zone would play an important role in the quality of the process. A more uniform laminar flow surrounding the area, should in fact results in more consistent wafer quality. Therefore, the focus of the study is to compare the velocity field in the neighboring area, for different arrangement of gas intake. Numerical simulation has been conducted to provide guidance of designing the gas supply tube and the nozzles. Three dimensional, Steady State Fluid Dynamics analyses have been made. From the results of the simulation, the supply gas velocity distribution is very sensitive to the parameters. Gas supply line design with variable nozzle diameters form 2.0 to 3.5 provides the better gas velocity distribution, ensuring fresh gas to the wafer zone with gentle laminar flow in this study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pushed by demand for renewable energy, the ethanol industry in Brazil is expanding. However, production of 1 m3 of ethanol generates around 13 m3 of liquid residues (vinasse), so this expansion results in an increasing need for a more adequate destination of these residues. Nowadays the vinasse is dispersed on the sugar cane fields in the practice of fertirrigation, but anaerobic digestion of this residue may be a better solution, additionally offering an alternative source of energy, able to complement hydroelectric power supply in the dry season. However, when trying to digest vinasse at reduced hydraulic retention times, complications arise from its strong tendency toward acidification, upsetting the fragile balance of transformations normally occurring under anaerobic conditions. For successful operation of an anaerobic treatment process with acceptable hydraulic residence times, increasing alkalinity levels inside the reactor is neces­sary. In the present work we show that pH regulation by means of urea dosing, in spite of the risk posed by ammonia toxicity towards methanogenic biomass, can be a viable alternative to avoid vinasse acidification. The ammonia formed in urea conversion remains in solution, rather than escaping to the biogas, and so its use as fertiliser can offset its cost of application in the process.</jats:p>",

India is the second largest producer of fruit and vegetables globally, but horticultural development is currently constrained by poor marketing. The gap between prices received by farmers and those paid by consumers is large, reflecting inefficient marketing arrangements. This study estimates the market costs, market margins, price spread, the producer's share of the consumer's rupee and the market efficiency of horticultural commodities under different supply chains, and suggests measures to improve marketing efficiency. The study was conducted in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Manipur and Mizoram, covering 29 crop types. The results show that, in the case of most commodities, marketing costs, marketing margins, transport costs and labour charges adversely affect marketing efficiency, and open market price, volume of produce handled and net price received increase market efficiency or have a positive effect. The highest marketing efficiency was found in the producer-to-consumer channel. Government policies should promote direct marketing models for more efficient horticultural marketing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In global supply chains, a multitude of public and private organizations collaborate to reach the collective goal of transporting goods from the seller to the buyer. Given the dynamicity of global supply chains it is hard to predict which information is needed by whom at which point in time which often causes service delivery delays. Integrating relevant information, processes and services prevents disruptions in the supply chain and deterioration in service provisioning caused by missing information required for processes that need to be executed to supply services. In this paper, an ontology-based, event-driven architecture is designed for integrating information, processes and services that acts as a mechanism to coordinate service delivery in a global supply chain. The architecture is evaluated in the context of a global supply chain of plastic toys. This illustrates how the events facilitated by the architecture enable the availability of information in time which positively influences the delivery of a barge planning service. </jats:p>",

Samplings were carried out monthly between June 2008 and May 2009; RESULTS: Inflow points P1, P2 and P3 in the pond had higher nutrient concentrations and high trophic rates. Moreover, capybaras in the area caused sediment suspension and an increase in fecal coliforms. There was significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in the concentrations of nutrients in water between the dry and rainy seasons. The outflow of water caused by rain carried the material around the pond directly into the water; CONCLUSIONS: The system studied was influenced by rain and lack of adequate management of the surrounding area. Water quality was deteriorated by increase in nutrient concentrations, fecal coliforms and reduction of dissolved oxygen in the water during the rainy season. This was due to allochthonous material from the area surrounding the pond that affected negatively the supply system.</jats:p>"

In order to make the most profit, the prediction of demand and the policy of inventory are the key factors for an SC unit. The ordering is a manipulate variable for an SC unit, and the pricing is introduced as another manipulate variable in this paper. The supposed price has determinate effect on the demand. The demand then can be regarded as a determinate part and a stochastic part. The inventory is regarded as a probability problem because of the stochastic demand. The two manipulate variables bring different dynamics into the SC unit. An MPC is designed, and the two‐time scale characteristic of the two manipulate variables is considered simultaneously for the SC unit. By comparing with MPC without dynamic pricing policy and order‐up‐to‐level policy, we found that the simulation results approve the validity of the MPC with dynamic pricing policy. © 2012 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold>  <jats:italic>As the biofuel industry continues to expand, the construction of new biorefinery facilities induces a huge amount of biomass feedstock shipment from supply points to the refineries and biofuel shipment to the consumption locations, which increases traffic demand in the transportation network and contributes to additional congestion (especially in the neighborhood of the refineries). Hence, it is beneficial to form public‐private partnerships to simultaneously consider transportation network expansion and biofuel supply chain design to mitigate congestion. This article presents an integrated mathematical model for biofuel supply chain design where the near‐optimum number and location of biorefinery facilities, the near‐optimal routing of biomass and biofuel shipments, and possible highway/railroad capacity expansion are determined. The objective is to minimize the total cost for biorefinery construction, transportation infrastructure expansion, and transportation delay (for both biomass/biofuel shipment and public travel) under congestion. A genetic algorithm framework (with embedded Lagrangian relaxation and traffic assignment algorithms) is developed to solve the optimization model, and an empirical case study for the state of Illinois is conducted with realistic biofuel production data. The computational results show that the proposed solution approach is able to solve the problem efficiently. Various managerial insights are also drawn. It shall be noted that although this article focuses on the booming biofuel industry, the model and solution techniques are suitable for a number of application contexts that simultaneously involve network traffic equilibrium, infrastructure expansion, and facility location choices (which determine the origin/destination of multi‐commodity flow).</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The presented Pre-Error Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) approach tunes the supply voltage of digital circuits dependent on the present Process, Voltage and Temperature variations as well as Aging (PVTA). By exploiting unused timing margin, produced by state-of-the-art worst-case designs, power consumption is minimized. Timing information of the circuit is obtained by in situ delay monitors (Pre-Error flip-flops), detecting late-arriving signals (pre-errors) in critical paths. Based on the occurrence of pre-errors, the voltage is adjusted by a low-overhead control unit connected to the on-chip voltage regulator. As the voltage is adapted during normal circuit operation (on-line), the randomness of the applied input pattern has to be considered. We developed a Markov chain model, based on transistor level simulations, to describe the resulting statistics of the closed-loop voltage control. With this model, the risk of overcritical voltage reductions and the effect of global and local variations on the closed-loop control can be analyzed. For an arithmetic circuit, synthesized in an industrial 65nm design-flow, an average power saving of 23% (including all overheads) is achieved for very low error rates below 1E-11. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Clothing and Textiles (C&amp;T) discipline was established over a century ago within the Home Economics discipline. During the early 1960s, a major shift occurred within C&amp;T, from domestic science to one focused on industry. This conceptual paper takes an updated approach to discuss the relevance and uniqueness of C&amp;T at a time when universities face reorganization or adaptation. After reviewing the scientific nature of C&amp;T, the authors defined C&amp;T as the science of investigating the satisfaction processes of humans' clothing needs and wants. These satisfaction processes are described and classified by hypotheses, theories, generalizations, and/or laws, through scientific methods built from both logics of discovery and justification. Therefore, the authors argue that C&amp;T are closely linked with human science units because of its ultimate goal --human satisfaction of clothing needs and wants. More importantly, the authors argue the clothing satisfaction processes occur through supply chain management, from history and forecasting to retailing and distribution, in the global marketplace. The global supply chain management framework of C&amp;T offers homes to all types of research, creative, and educational activities that C&amp;T scholars conduct every day, and demonstrates how each component is inter-linked with other components. Finally, visions for the future of C&amp;T are offered if the model is adopted, and the authors suggest further conversations about the nature and domain of C&amp;T. </jats:p>",

There  have  been  few  BIM  applications  in  NZ;  in  particular,  in  post-construction phases like facilities management, there is none. The paper found that the three reasons why BIM  has  not  been  widely  accepted  and  used  in  New  Zealand  are:  the  slow  uptake  by  NZ construction  companies;  a  lack  of  Kiwi-focused  BIM  initiatives  (led  by  the  government  and industry  bodies);  and  a  lack  of  BIM-based  building  life  cycle  considerations.

Given  the  fact  that  all  major  research organisations  currently  have  development  plans  in  their  pipelines,  coupled  with  potential developments of the Christchurch City after the quake, it seems an ideal time to take a BIM-based research initiative in the country.

This earthquake impacted on natural and social events, adversely affecting the water-supply system. For instance, there were long-term disruptions of regional water supplies, long-term electric power outages, extensive liquefaction damage, and damage caused by the tsunami. These multiple factors made the damage pattern complex, and water-supply restoration was delayed even though seismic ground motion was moderate. This study attempts to elucidate the factors that caused water-supply restoration to be delayed following the earthquake and to measure the earthquake impact on water-supply outages in terms of restoration time and the households affected by the water-supply outage. As a result, the long restoration time for the water supply following the Tohoku earthquake could be explained by a combination of factors, including restoration time for electric power and regional water supplies and pipeline repair in liquefaction areas, in addition to time for pipeline repair following past earthquakes. Pipeline repair required twice the time compared to past earthquakes.</jats:p>",

The <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PRIMES</jats:styled-content> biomass model quantifies scenarios for the biomass supply system based on a given demand for bio‐energy commodities which is exogenous to the model. The scenarios quantified the impacts of different scenario contexts (only climate and energy package targets and long‐term decarbonization targets) and/or of different policies and measures on the biomass supply system. The analysis shows that the demand for bio‐energy commodities in the case of achieving only the climate and energy package targets can be met mostly with currently known technologies; the assessment has also shown that demand projected by the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NREAPs</jats:styled-content>) could be met for most bio‐energy commodity types with known technologies; however, some issues have been identified regarding the mix of commodities. The 2050 decarbonization objectives are found to be feasible as far as biomass contribution is concerned, but for this, considerable development of advanced technologies will be necessary. However, if sustainability criteria are stricter the achievement of the 2020 targets is found problematic; although in the long‐term toward 2050 the effect is lower, thanks to advanced technology developments. In case demand for biofuels in transportation increases beyond standard projections, due to for example a delay in transport electrification, stronger development of advanced technologies was found necessary. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lake Ontario water levels are regulated under the International Joint Commission's Order of Approval. We assessed the availability of spawning habitat for eight fish guilds (grouped by vegetation and spawning temperature preferences) that use nearshore habitat in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, under regulated and pre-project water level scenarios. Our model used habitat characteristics of depth, substrate, vegetation cover and temperature across 14,876 habitat units and guild-based habitat suitabilities to assess the weighted suitable area (WSA) available for spawning. During the modelled 1951–2000 period, regulated water levels were on average 0.25 m lower than pre-project levels and varied about half as much. Overall, the large and shallow upper bay within the Bay of Quinte benefited from pre-project flows whereas the smaller and deeper lower bay benefited from regulated flows. Higher variance in water levels increased highly suitable wetland area and higher mean water levels increased the availability of shallow flooded area in the upper and middle bays, where the bathymetry is gradually sloping. The number of days over which WSA was available was generally greater for high temperature guilds, and appeared to decrease when temperature mismatches occurred in a season. Results emphasize the complexity of the relationship between fish habitat supply and water level regime.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Oil-in-water emulsions are generally used in tandem cold rolling mills as lubricants, as they provide good lubricity and cooling performance. Lubricants are supplied by either a recirculation system or a direct application system. The dynamic concentration and the plate-out are known as the two main lubrication mechanisms, respectively, used in the two conventional lubrication applications. But it is difficult to realize direct control of the lubrication characteristics only using the dynamic concentration mechanism while the plate-out mechanism makes it possible. Therefore, this article is concerned with an experimental study of the efficiency of plate-out oil film formation, focusing on emulsion spraying conditions. Emulsion supply conditions are also examined in the plate-out test, which enables extremely rapid evaluation in a time equivalent to that in actual high-speed cold rolling. An air atomizing nozzle, which supplies a mixture of emulsion and air, was more efficient for plate-out oil film formation than the conventional flat nozzle, which only supplies emulsion. Air atomizing expands the space of the emulsion droplet and may prevent outflow of the plate-out oil film. The results of this research suggest that it is important to consider emulsion supply conditions as well as emulsion make-up conditions. </jats:p>",

This study aimed to describe the epidemiological profile of reported cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis C in Italy after the achievement of blood supply safety. The incidence of symptomatic acute hepatitis C since 1991 was estimated. Risk factors for acute hepatitis C were analyzed for the period 2003–2010 through a case–control study within a population‐based surveillance for acute viral hepatitis. From 1991 to 2010, the incidence decreased from 2 to 0.2 per 100,000, with a more evident decrease among persons aged 15–24 years. During 2003–2010, 1,053 cases were reported. Intravenous drug use (adjusted odds ratio [<jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>OR], 30.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18.9–49.1), cohabitation or sexual partnership with an hepatitis C virus (HCV) carrier (<jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 6.6–19.2), nosocomial exposure (<jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 4.6–9.4); unsafe sexual practices (<jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.9–5.2), and cosmetic treatments with percutaneous exposure (<jats:sub>adj</jats:sub>OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4) were independently associated with acute hepatitis C. Population attributable risk estimates indicated nosocomial exposure (39.6%) and intravenous drug use (30.5%) as responsible for most cases. In conclusion, the incidence of symptomatic acute hepatitis C is declining in Italy. Currently, the most important risk factors are: having an HCV‐positive household or sexual partner, unsafe sexual practices, cosmetic percutaneous treatments, intravenous drug use, and nosocomial exposure; the latter two factors are responsible for most cases. Effective prevention programs for intravenous drug users and strict adherence to universal precautions in healthcare settings are needed. J. Med.

It confirms the low, short-run aggregate output supply elasticity of Indian agriculture as found in the literature. It validates the hypothesis that the relationships between public investment, financial institutions, and farm investment of labor and capital in agriculture have not changed over the years. The empirical estimates of aggregate output supply elasticity with respect to output price (0.2), roads (0.2), markets (0.11), and net irrigated area (0.05) are higher than previous findings for selected states in India. Aggregate agricultural output responds positively to credit availability (represented by banks) and canal irrigation, each with an elasticity of 0.01. The wage elasticity (0.3) on aggregate output is higher than price elasticity (0.2), indicating that the effects of rising wages outweigh the incentives offered by output price support.  Climatic factors (e.g., rainfall) significantly affect fertilizer use and aggregate output while deviation from normal rainfall adversely affects aggregate output. The study substantiates previous findings that public investment in infrastructure and financial institutions respond to the agriculture potential and agro-climatic endowments of an area. A renewed focus, therefore, is required for better targeting of public investments in areas that are relatively resource poor and have harsh agro-climatic conditions for a more inclusive growth and rural poverty reduction.</jats:p>",
