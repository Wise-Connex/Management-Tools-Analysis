Because the provision and planning of water supply and is a complex task, a modeling approach was used to enhance the understanding of the process and the aspects involved. In the development of a model, not only the technical aspects were taken into account, but other aspects related to the provision of drinking water and the water resources protection were also analyzed, such as institutional, financial, socioeconomic, environmental and public health. In the modeling process two different methods of conceptualization were used to describe the urban water flow through the water and wastewater systems linked to various aspects related to their implementation in large developing cities. The urban water systems of five large metropolitan areas in Brazil were also evaluated for the complete model. It is expected that the modeling approach developed in this paper consists of a valuable methodology for water supply and sanitation planning in Brazilian cities, and other developing cities with the same characteristics. The suggested conceptual model could, at least, provide more than a starting point for a useful urban water management tool.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In countries suffering from chronic water shortages, water distribution systems are often operated on an intermittent basis, leaving them unpressurised and allowing ingress of contaminated groundwater, particularly in areas lacking sewerage systems. The periods of stagnation can promote microbial regrowth, further compromising water quality. On the other hand, peaks in pressure and velocity in the pipe network lead to biofilm detachment events, thus releasing microbial cells that may escape the regular quality monitoring procedures and thus increase risk for the consumer. Finally, intermittent supply requires consumers to store water in household storage tanks, which often encourage bacterial regrowth. This paper reports on research undertaken in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, the UK and Portugal, which provided an improved understanding of the factors controlling bacterial concentrations in intermittent supplies, and presents an overview of the most important aspects of water quality control in intermittently operated networks.</jats:p>",

The German Landeswasserversorgung (LW), a long distance water supplier, uses surface water and water influenced by surface water as well as groundwater for drinking water production. A combination of several treatment steps including flocculation, sedimentation, ozonation, in-line filtration and, finally, disinfection with chlorine dioxide guarantees a drinking water of perfect quality. Since the water transport through several main and subsidiary pipes of an overall length of about 500 kilometres can take up to four days, the disinfection capacity must be sufficient to prevent bacterial growth. Measurement of the redox potential in addition to measurement of chlorine dioxide concentrations has proved to be a helpful parameter for the surveillance of the disinfection capacity. Many years of experience show that keeping the redox potential above a level of 650 mV guarantees the prevention of bacterial growth and an efficient disinfection.</jats:p>",

Water temperature in the studied network, serving 200,000 people, is less than 5°C for about five months every winter. Sphingomonads, characterised using fluorescent oligonucleotide probes and fatty acid composition analysis (FAME), were a major group of bacteria among the distribution network biofilm isolates. Intact biofilms, grown on steel slides in a biofilm reactor fed with tap water, were detected in situ using fluorescence labelled oligonucleotide probes (FISH). Hybridisation with probes targeted on α-proteobacteria and sphingomonads was detected, but FISH on intact biofilms suffered from non-specific hybridisation and intensive autofluorescence, possibly due to extracellular material around the bacterial cells attached to biofilm. These preliminary results indicate that bacteria present in the distribution network biofilms in this study phylogenetically differ from those detected in more temperate regions.</jats:p>",

Contemporary research has emphasized the need for organizations to move toward closer cooperation. The decision to engage in partnership arrangements is one that has major implications for buyers and suppliers. Using evidence from an exploratory case study, the challenges presented in developing a close, cooperative, and mutually beneficial trading relationship between a buyer and a supplier, where one partner, the buyer, is in a powerful position, are investigated. It is argued that powerful buyers can seriously damage organizational health. The findings provide evidence that it is essential to promote communication structures that encourage dialogue, consultation, and employee participation in decisionmaking. This is particularly important where decisionmaking could benefit from the in‐depth technical knowledge of middle and junior managers and shopfloor workers.</jats:p>",

In contrast, other research has found that the level of involvement by members of the supply function in strategic activities is rather low. In particular, the perception of purchasing by members of one particular group within the firm, marketing, often appears to be similar to that of a clerical function performing low‐value‐adding activities. Thus, a dichotomy exists regarding what is often claimed (being a strategic function of the business) and the apparent reality (little participation in strategic corporate activities; conflict with members of other organizational functions). In this article, a model predicting purchasing's strategic reputation within the firm is proposed and tested. The results, which are obtained from a survey of purchasing executives, indicate a role forback‐and‐forth communications and a cooperative relational history to enhance purchasing's reputation within the firm. Implications are discussed for such reputation enhancement of purchasing as a strategic, value‐adding function and recommendations are made for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Until recently most water utilities have operated as a public service. The market is still predominantly a natural monopoly. The significant infrastructure requirements militate against service duplication and competition. Generally customers do not have the option of changing service providers. With the arrival of competition policy, water utilities have initiated some customer service programmes. However, the driver for this change has been the reporting requirements of the regulator rather than customer focused imperatives.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, there are benefits for water service companies to conduct professional market research focused on customer satisfaction. This paper reviews the concepts of market customer satisfaction analysis. It discusses the shortfalls of generic methodologies which focus on the performance of the service provider rather than the needs and expectations of the customer. The application of Benchmarking or Best Practice, is also reviewed within this context.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A conclusion of this paper is that the application of focused, professional customer satisfaction analysis is an effective quality management tool and leads to a better understanding of water services customers’ needs and expectations. The outcome is more effective application of customer service resources, enhanced community perceptions and the achievement of higher levels of customer satisfaction.</jats:p>",

Data can be adversely influenced during this conversion process which can result in sub-optimal decisions being made. The collection and handling of information for a water authority must therefore be organised. Asset management systems generally consist of three major constituents: inventory, programmed action, and optimisation. The institutional capacity needs of water authorities in developing countries require greater emphasis on the first of these two constituents. A pragmatic and simple-to-use Integrated Water Asset Management System (IWAMS) has been developed comprising water meter, leakage control and incident management modules. A water audit and water balance module facilitates the determination of the levels of unaccounted for water, as well as the unit cost of leakage. Water mains rehabilitation priorities can be established through the representation of various data collected in the form of a common severity rating that aids decision making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the approach taken and the tools developed and advanced within the European research project CARE-W (Computer Aided REhabilitation of Water networks) for strategic rehabilitation investment planning as a complement to short-term performance monitoring and annual rehabilitation (rehab) budget allocation planning. In a first step, future rehab needs are quantified with a cohort-survival model from the present stock of assets taking into account the specific service lives of its components. Utility managers may choose in the short and medium range from many rehab options: doing more or less, sooner or later, on particular network components and with specific rehab technologies at lower or higher cost. So, in a second step, alternative medium-term rehab programs are specified and tested for their effects. The annual costs and benefits of these alternative rehab programs are forecast with the cohort-survival model beyond the rehab program period to capture the long-term effects of rehabilitating these long-lived assets. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative rehab programs are systematically compared to find out which one is most appropriate under local constraints. However, whereas the survival of network components can be forecast over very long periods with sufficient accuracy, many other characteristics of the water supply system that must be considered for finding the best network rehab strategy may take unforeseeable paths into the far future. Therefore, a scenario writing tool was developed allowing consistent scenarios for particular water utilities to be created and to test whether the alternative rehab programs are robust enough to meet all eventualities of the future. This approach is illustrated by a case study from East Germany.</jats:p>",

The aim of this project was to develop and test a computerised system providing a continuum of methods for selecting water meters varying from pure theoretical to semi-empirical and then to a wholly empirical process. The theoretical process relies on water demands derived from local and international design codes and standards in the selection of new water meters for buildings or water management areas. The first estimate for the selection of a water meter can be based on both records of billing data as well as on theoretically determined peak and minimum water demands. Empirically measured water demand profiles can be processed and analysed by OSMS to establish the best match for a particular water meter’s specification. Field trials in South Africa and Brazil were instrumental in identifying additional features that enhanced the development of OSMS, as well as emphasised the usefulness of the software. A literature review and a pilot study indicate a previous trend of installing over-sized meters. Replacement meters that are optimally selected can finance the costs of such investments.</jats:p>",

A key feature of the reforms is the explicit linking of economic and environmental objectives: in that the reforms seek to improve environmental management of the nation’s river systems by increasing efficiency of water use via water markets. However, there is growing evidence to evince that water markets are failing to achieve environmental objectives. This paper uses the insights of economic sociology to analyse this failure, and argues that economic efficiency does not and will not guarantee environmental effectiveness because newly constructed water markets are embedded in existing social processes/industry structures and are permeated by existing power relations. For real environmental benefits to accrue, existing water markets must be seriously restructured. This paper explores the elements of such a restructure and suggests that it is unlikely to succeed without strong state action and coordinated policymaking, institutional reform, adjustment packages, significant community involvement, and the participation of the rural sector. Finally, it proposes that social capital could play a pivotal role in the restructuring of the Australian water industry.</jats:p>",

In any utility where the asset owner and the asset operator are the same, there are pressures to reduce operations and maintenance costs and capital expenditure to maximise returns. The authors argue that this is the case irrespective of whether such returns are to private shareholders or dividends to government. On the other hand, where the asset owner and the asset operator are separate entities with a clearly defined contractual interface, it is not possible to increase returns by reducing operations and maintenance standards, presuming a properly constructed contract. This is because the performance standards are clearly stipulated in the contract with payment reductions applying for non-performance. Such a model can be put in place irrespective of whether the asset owner is a private company or a public utility. The paper examines the profit incentive applying to private and public sector organisations in models where:the asset owner and the asset operator are the same organisation;models where the asset owner and the asset operator are separate organisations, with the service delivery performance governed by a clearly defined contractual interface.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper shows why the drivers governing the behaviour of public sector and private sector owners are similar, and how the separation of asset owner and asset operator can be used to ensure that service delivery standards are achieved at the lowest cost, whilst providing full transparency to shareholders, regulators and customers alike.

With the emphasis shifting from supply‐driven to demand‐driven product design the trading relationships within the industry must become more complex. This paper hypothesizes an electronic market in design and supply capability to exploit distributed design knowledge within the supply chain. In their current form, e‐commerce and brokering systems are too immature to support such relationships, but many elements of a technical solution are available. However, how they will reshape working practices is uncertain and this poses architectural and human organization problems for information systems (IS) developers. They must anticipate and address changes in working practices across a whole group of industries competing within a complex market place. We postulate a development approach that uses simulation models supported by soft systems methods to explore these process re‐engineering options and human issues. The simulation of new business processes, combined with prototype IS designs, offers a powerful mechanism for evaluating the effects of proposed architectures for “design transactions” in e‐procurement. The open learning that occurs in simulation experiments is also a key element in helping the management of the individual organizations in understanding how to shape their particular contribution to the new collaborative process. A major barrier to enhancing construction industry performance in this way is the defensive nature of existing contracts and lack of trust between parties; we therefore propose the use of COLA process in parallel with the simulation work to engender trust and improved working relationships between the collaborating organizations.</jats:p>",

Aimed at a possible solution to the problem, this paper has two objectives: to introduce a new reliability-based optimal design formulation and a model, and to examine the effect of specifying minimum allowable pipe sizes during least-cost designs on system reliability. System reliability is estimated using the minimum cut-set method, but instead of using the mechanical failure probabilities of pipes, weighted failure probabilities are calculated by considering the ratio of the actual supply to demand. One of the salient features of this study and the new reliability-based design model in particular, is that a pressure-driven network simulation model is used to determine the actual supply at each demand point when a component fails. A simplified two-loop network is used to illustrate the performance of the new model and to study the effect of specifying minimum allowable pipe sizes. The results obtained show that the new model preserves loops and results in a system with better reliability; and, if appropriate, minimum allowable pipe sizes are specified in the least-cost design, a required reliability can be attained with a reasonably low cost.</jats:p>",

Water samples exhibit characteristic fluorescence signatures and excitation and emission spectral data can be used to provide intensity data and “optical fluorescence fingerprints”. Sewage wastes exhibit broad band fluorescence centred at 350 nm and two relatively less intense bands at about 390 and 430 nm. Samples that have been treated in an aerobic digester show a substantial reduction in fluorescence around 350 nm. Normalised intensities in this region demonstrate good correlation with BOD, COD and TOC values (R2 values between 0.85 and 0.91). Drinking and surface waters also demonstrate unique fluorescence characteristics, which provide individual characteristic fingerprints. Results are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of fluorescence spectroscopy for the qualitative and quantitative detection of certain organic species present in different water types. Tryptophan is quantified in drinking and surface waters at levels around 8 × 10-9 mol l-1. Optical fluorescence fingerprints are unique for particular water types and are readily altered in the presence of organic contaminants including phenol and pyrene. The possibility of using fluorescence techniques for the continuous noninvasive monitoring of water quality is discussed.</jats:p>",

A new concept of optimization is presented for water distribution modelling: a concept based on life-cycle cost analysis. Introducing a minimum number of parameters, technical and also economic, the authors were able to elaborate a mathematical model for optimization. The corresponding computer code’s capabilities are related both to the design of brand new networks and to the rehabilitation of old ones. The speed of the code allows, among others, a real-time optimization simulation for an existing network, making it a valuable operational tool. Finally the code has been tested on several networks and has been validated with very good results, being a simple tool that is easy to handle and capable of exchanging input and output data with practically any other similar software or graphic tool.</jats:p>",

The fitness of a trunk main system is evaluated in terms of supply security and infrastructure costs. The system may then be modified using a genetic algorithm to create a population of reduced networks, from which infrastructure which may be redundant has been removed. The fitness of each reduced network is assessed, compared with the fittest network, and progressive generations are developed using the algorithm, until an improved network is selected.</jats:p>",

Rare presynaptic localization is restricted to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) terminals. Because glutamate is a precursor for GABA synthesis, we hypothesized that EAAC1 may play a role in regulating GABA synthesis and thus could cause epilepsy in rats when inactivated. Reduced expression of EAAC1 by antisense treatment led to behavioral abnormalities, including staring-freezing episodes and electrographic (EEG) seizures. Extracellular hippocampal and thalamocortical slice recordings showed excessive excitability in antisense-treated rats. Patch-clamp recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (mIPSCs) conducted in CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices from EAAC1 antisense-treated animals demonstrated a significant decrease in mIPSC amplitude, indicating decreased tonic inhibition. A 50% loss of hippocampal GABA levels was associated with knockdown of EAAC1, and newly synthesized GABA from extracellular glutamate was significantly impaired by reduction of EAAC1 expression. EAAC1 may participate in normal GABA neurosynthesis and limbic hyperexcitability, whereas epilepsy can result from a disruption of the interaction between EAAC1 and GABA metabolism </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Discolouration is one of the biggest causes of customer complaint associated with potable water. The flushing of systems has been widely identified as an appropriate pro-active means of removing material from distribution networks and hence controlling discolouration. Such flushing involves creating aggressive hydraulic forces within the network such that the materials that contribute to discolouration are mobilised and removed. Understanding of the causes and mechanisms leading to discolouration are poor. Previous work has been presented on the characterisation of material and particles collected at hydrants during flushing trials in the UK. From this data it was hypothesised that the materials causing discolouration originated from cohesive layers on pipe walls, and that once disturbed the material is maintained as a permanent suspension even under the most quiescent of networks conditions. The work presented in this paper attempts to validate the hypothesis that the discolouration materials originate from cohesive layers, and investigate the nature and variability of such layers within live distribution systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The study involved the aggressive flushing of a long discrete length of cast iron pipe with known discolouration problems. The results showed a progressive generation of material over the length of the pipe, confirming that the material originated from a uniformly distributed cohesive source. This was followed by a sequence of flushing operations for the systematic cleaning of a complex network area, encompassing a mixture of pipe materials and ages. All measured turbidity traces showed exponential decay with time. Such exponential decay may be predicted by a model based on a change in layer strength with degree of erosion. Hydraulic forces appear to be a key factor governing the availability and mobilisation of material. Iron is the dominant material mobilised from all the pipes. There is no direct trend between the amount or the composition of the material mobilised from the different pipes.</jats:p>",

The conventional control of chlorine dosage is widely practical throughout the batch breakpoint chlorination test in the laboratory, which is not feasible for the requirement of real-time regulation of the chlorine demands. In this study, a simple automatic oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) titration system was developed for on-line determination of the chlorine demand. The experimental results showed that different decrease tendencies on ORP slope profiles were found to correlate to the ammonia concentrations in samples. In addition, the required chlorine demands were found to correlate to ammonia concentrations with a linear relationship. The ORP control strategy was, therefore, developed for on-line determination of the chlorine demands. Applying this ORP control strategy, the required chlorine demands were precisely predicted, and good disinfection efficiency was obtained in the wastewater chlorination experiments.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses the important considerations in applying quality management systems to drinking water quality management within water authorities, and the key issues of how best to integrate these risk management systems with the business management systems of the water authority. A generally applicable model for drinking water quality management systems based on ISO 9002 and HACCP is described. The paper also discusses the process of how management systems already in place within a water authority can be assessed and improvements identified. The objective is that the management systems will be consistent with the authority’s existing business management systems, ISO 9001, the principles of HACCP and AS4360, and the expected requirements of the revised Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper the hydraulic performance of water distribution networks is evaluated by assessing the head values in demand points and velocities in pipes. To obtain the hydraulic parameters a head-driven simulation method is used. In this method, nodal outflows are not fixed and vary with nodal heads. Considering the possibility of a range of demand variations and mechanical and hydraulic failures in the system, nodal heads and pressure dependent outflows are obtained. Then, by using a mathematical function, the performance of the system is realistically evaluated. As expected, the level of service in the system is decreased when head and velocity values are out of the standard ranges. Also, the reliability of a water distribution network is calculated using the ratio of the pressure-dependent outflows to the demand values considering the probability of pipe failures. Comparing the level of service index and reliability applications on a test network, it can be concluded that the reliability method is not sensitive to high-pressure values in the system. However, in this situation the performance index shows a lower level of service in the network. This means that high reliability values guarantee a good connectivity and enough pressure to satisfy the required nodal outflows, although pressure values higher than the standard codes, which lead to more leaks and bursts, are not acceptable in water supply systems. Therefore, the existing definitions of reliability are not comprehensive enough to realistically evaluate performance of the system. Using the level of service index and the head-driven simulation method, the network performance under different normal and abnormal conditions can be appropriately evaluated for water companies.</jats:p>",

No matter how developed a country is, there is a growing and general awareness of this subject. Among the several motivations that contribute to this growing concern are, without doubt, the shortage of resources availability in several water supply systems on the one hand and, on the other hand, the economic value of the volume of water lost. Portugal is no exception. In recent years, there has been some dynamism in the sector in the accounting, control, leakages and loss detection, mainly in the biggest systems. This paper presents an approach to the control of water leakages and losses through the setting of performance indicators that allow the evaluation and characterization of the management entity for this aspect. Some results of those indicators will also be described here, as well as their application to several Portuguese water utilities and the assessment methodology of the results obtained. This paper also puts into evidence expressions and correlation curves between the different indicators and factors that directly or indirectly interfere in the result of the water utilities’ performance with relation to the water losses and leakages presented.</jats:p>",

With a field study of 12 water utilities in Europe, the objectives of drinking water network rehabilitation are identified. These objectives are assigned to a number of “points of view” that can be divided in two types: internal and external points of view. Internal points of view mainly affect the cost and the monetary benefits of rehabilitation measures for the utility. External benefits of rehabilitation result from a better hydraulic performance of the system, from improved system reliability or reduction of risks and therefore, they contribute to customer and third party satisfaction. Nine points of view are rendered more precisely by 17 criteria. The criteria are expressed by detailed cost functions, quantification of current deficiencies, assessment of risks or assessment of the pipe’s potential contribution to zonal problems. Examples are given of criteria definitions and their calculation for using them in procedures of aiding decisions. This paper is a report on ongoing work in the CARE-W European project.</jats:p>",

Whatever the situation is, water management remain under state control. The law of 29 January 1993 known as “Sapin Act” limits the duration of the contracts of delegation and imposes a procedure of publicity and consultation preliminary to their conclusion or their renewal. A study has been led from 1998 by our laboratory on the impact of this competition between private companies on the delegation contracts and their price. The main conclusions are the following:Including water and wastewater contracts, the procedure of competition led to an average fall of 10% of the price paid to the contractor. The most significant falls concern services of more than 20 000 inhabitants;If the global distribution of the contracts between the three major companies in this sector is not basically modified, one notes an increasingly marked presence of independent private operators;The duration of the contracts is in reduction, on average, from 17 to 11 years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Then, it appears that the procedure instituted by the law of 29 January 1993 allowed a better exercise of competition between the private companies. The municipalities, mainly the smallest, encounter difficulties in the course of the procedure, and this is the reason why they expressed strong expectations in regard to the services of consulting. The progressive development of associations of municipalities makes it possible for the municipalities to obtain more favourable contractual conditions. This study makes it possible to follow the evolution of the number of procedures initiated pursuant to the law of 29 January 1993: nearly 300 in 1997, 582 in 1998 and 684 in 1999. In 2005, most of the 12,000 French contracts would have been renegotiated, a figure which shows the economical impact on water services.</jats:p>",

This reduction of DOC concentration levels enabled an improved stability of chlorine residual that has been reduced to 0.2 mg/L at the outlet of the plant. The formation of trihalomethanes was thus reduced by 50% in the network.

This implies that decisions must not only reflect the costs borne now but the likely costs in the future, and how these might be optimised. It is noteworthy that within the construction and transport industries, asset management decisions which have been driven in this direction utilise a whole life costing (WLC) methodology. This paper addresses the implications of transferring the concept of WLC to service-based assets such as water systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A WLC approach to distribution network management aims to achieve the lowest network provision and operating cost when all costs are considered to achieve standards enforced by regulation. Cognisance is to be taken of all relevant costs - direct and indirect, private and societal - in order to balance the needs of the service supplier, the customer, society and the environment in a sustainable manner. A WLC analysis thus attempts to develop a cost profile over the life of the asset. Accounting for the costs over this period is achieved through a combination of activity based costing (ABC) and a life cycle assessment (LCA) used to identify potential social and environmental costs. This process means that each of these identified costs must be linked to some physical parameter that itself varies over time due to changing demands on the system, the different operational strategies available to the operator and natural deterioration of the fabric of the system. The links established between the cost and activities of the operator provide the basis for the development of a WLC decision tool (WiLCO) for application to water distribution network management.</jats:p>",

The blood vessels and their branches to the muscle were dissected. The distance of the origin of the perforators was measured from fixed bony landmarks. Branches of the popliteal artery trunk, the posterior tibial artery, and the peroneal artery supplied the soleus muscle. The number of branches to the soleus muscle from these main arteries were analyzed. The medial part of the muscle was supplied throughout its length by perforators arising from the posterior tibial artery. This constant feature makes the medial part of the muscle reliable as a proximally or distally based flap. The average distances of the lower perforators arising from the posterior tibial artery were 6.5 cm, 11.6 cm, and 16.8 cm from the medial malleolus. The branches of the peroneal artery were mostly distributed in the upper half of the muscle. These large pedicles allow a composite transfer of the soleus muscle with the fibula. Lower perforators were demonstrated to arise from the peroneal artery in 60% of the limbs but the scarcity of perforators in this region limits the clinical usefulness of an inferiorly based lateral hemisoleus flap. The study demonstrates the distribution of arteries entering the soleus muscle and how the information may be used in the design of soleus muscle flaps. The average numbers of the perforators arising from the vessels and their distribution have been highlighted. Clin. Anat. 16:248–252, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Targeted flushing of water mains is generally used as a first approach to mains cleaning, while swabbing is used as a remedial action where flushing has failed to improve water quality performance. To show the benefits of flushing/swabbing two approaches were taken. The first approach looked at the quality of the discharge water, while the second looked at the compliance and operational data before and after mains cleaning. Using this data, the distribution systems were ranked in terms of water quality improvements. The rankings show that six of the ten Distribution Systems that received the most swabbing now rank in the top ten performers, while four of the ten Distribution Systems that received the most flushing now rank in the top ten performers. The discharge water was found to contain suspended solids, total coliforms, HPC20C, iron, aluminium, manganese and biofilm/biomass. Some coliform species were found to be similar to the bacteria found in compliance coliform failures. An integrated mains cleaning strategy that includes flushing, swabbing and water main rehabilitation is essential to prevent water quality deterioration in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

However, the potential and the benefits of control depend strongly on the characteristics of the individual site under question. Conventionally, RTC potential is evaluated by performing a detailed feasibility study, which in some cases may conclude that for the given site real-time control does not have any significant potential. This can result in spending considerable precious resources for a detailed feasibility study only to identify the non-feasibility of RTC in the system.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It would therefore be desirable to have a methodology that allows simple, and cost-effective, screening of sites for which the analysis of real-time control may be beneficial. Earlier research has led to the provision of an easy-to-apply scoring system allowing a quick assessment of the RTC potential of controlling flow in sewer systems. However, as this procedure does not take into account water quality aspects, nor the treatment plant or the receiving water body, it cannot be used for assessing the potential of RTC of the complete system.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes the work of an on-going project aimed at establishing an enhanced procedure for assessing the real-time control potential for the entire urban wastewater system. This entails simulating many (partly hypothetical) case studies (varying several key parameters of the wastewater system) using the simulation tool SYNOPSIS. For each of these sites, several real-time control algorithms are developed and optimised, following a general procedure, which allows for local, global and integrated scenarios to be considered. Analysis of the results reveals those system parameters which are of particular significance to the RTC potential of urban wastewater systems. Furthermore, it is recognised that there is considerable uncertainty associated with modelling of such a large and diverse system and a framework is developed for incorporating this in the RTC potential screening tool. Finally, further work is currently underway in broadening the number of case study simulations and developing more complex approaches to quantifying and propagating uncertainty in the model.</jats:p>",

Ideally a manager needs a set of near-optimal dynamic operating rules that are consistent with the objectives and level of risk set by the manager. The traditional approach for a reservoir is to develop fixed (static) rule curves based upon a statistical analysis. However, improved dynamic rules can be derived using optimisation techniques such as genetic algorithms. Also, simulation methods can be used. Here we show how both methods can be applied to generate near-optimal dynamic operating rules for a reservoir system used for drinking water supply in La Paz, Bolivia. In particular, we show how simple practical operating rules can incorporate the level of risk set by the manager. Further, these rules advise how quickly water levels should be altered when they are too high or too low.</jats:p>",

Planning for future replacements and the costs associated with these has been based upon a best guess of pipe lifetimes, which have generally been very conservative, when compared to the actual pipe life obtained. Factors such as the required level of customer service, trade-offs between repair and renewal, or operating practices such as pressure reduction or shut-off block reduction have not been widely considered, except when they are required under the water authorities operating licence. To allow long-term strategies to be implemented for the repair/renewal of water pipelines, a Pipeline Asset and Risk Management System (PARMS) is being developed. This planning model has been designed to allow a range of “what if” scenarios to be analysed to determine their effects on water authorities’ long-term costs. This model is based upon whole of life costing and includes data on externality and customer impact costs. It analyses the failures of individual pipe assets, rather than the traditional practice of predicting failure of pipe cohorts, currently used by many authorities. This paper discusses the application of the PARMS planning model to allow selection of pipeline repair/renewal, and briefly analyses the influences that a range of customer service or operating decisions can have on a water authority’s capital and operational expenditure.</jats:p>",

The most frequently detected pesticides were some of the more commonly used herbicides such as EPTC, trifluralin, atrazine, desethylatrazine, terbuthylazine, alachlor and insecticides such as carbofuran, diazinon, disulfoton, methyl parathion, ethyl parathion, fenthion and ethion. Concentrations of individual compounds ranged from 0.050 to 0.3 μg/L. Greater pesticide concentrations occurred during application seasons.

Data on trace metals, as well as conventional water quality parameters such as pH, ORP, major cations and anions, were used to analyse groundwater flow and the mechanisms of groundwater contamination using multivariate data analysis methods. The results of Cluster Analysis (CA) demonstrated that the groundwater flow and characteristics were separated into three different zones, namely the Riverain zone, the Northwest zone, and the South zone where the highest levels of arsenic, iron, organic matter and ammonia were detected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed strong correlation among two groups of trace metals: the first group includes Cd, Co, Mg, Mn, and Sr and these metals are considered to be leached out from rock minerals under moderately oxidizing conditions. The second group contains As, B, Ba, Cr, Cs, FeII, Mo, P, Pb, Rb, Ti, DOC and bicarbonate, and these are negatively correlated with SO42- and ORP, which indicates that these elements are eluted from organic matter and/or iron oxyhydroxide under anaerobic conditions. Further analyses of data obtained in the contaminated groundwaters by PCA and correlation between As and DOC suggest that there may be two possible mechanisms of arsenic release: reduction of iron oxyhydroxide and anaerobic degradation of organic matter in the peat layers.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds such as dissolved organic carbon, calcium, magnesium, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, phosphate and sulfate were also taken into account.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The formation of biofilm occurred 24 h after the exposure of test pipe materials to both chlorinated surface water and groundwater (with the average counts of 2 log.cfu.cm-2 for viable bacteria in both systems, 5 log.cells.cm-2 and 6 log.cells.cm-2 in surface water and groundwater systems respectively). A concentration of 0.45 ± 0.5 mg.L-1 free chlorine could not inhibit the formation of biofilm on the surface of pipe materials. Whereas the yield for attached bacteria was initially similar under chlorination treatment (24 h after chlorination), a significant difference in bacterial biofilm counts occurred in chlorinated water systems with the addition of monochloramine. Less than one attached viable and total bacteria colonized slides exposed to both combined chlorine-monochloramine surface water and groundwater systems. This same pattern was detected up to 7 d and 21 d on the surface of test pipe materials exposed to surface water and groundwater respectively. The present study demonstrates the inability of bacteria to colonize surfaces of stainless steel and galvanized mild steel in the combined chlorine-monochloramine system. In such a treatment the susceptibility of attached viable bacteria was observed only when the concentration of monochloramine persisted up to 0.35 mg.L-1 and 0.2 mg.L-1 in surface water and groundwater respectively. A lower monochloramine residual of 0.15 mg.L-1 led to the phenomenon of biofilm regrowth. Because the residual monochloramine depleted earlier in the groundwater system than in the surface water system, biofilm inhibition lasted longer in the latter system than in the former. A LSD test showed no significant difference in attached bacterial counts (at p &amp;lt; 0.05) when chlorine was used as primary disinfectant and monochloramine as second disinfectant for the disinfection of surface water and groundwater. Although the high concentrations (average) of organic (Surface water: DOC = 5.55 mg.L-1, groundwater: DOC = 12.6 mg.L-1 and inorganic compounds (surface water: Ca2+ = 12.17 mg.L-1, Mg2+ = 9.20 mg.L-1, COD = 11.35 mg.L-1, N = 2.70, SO43- = 21.40 mg.L-1, PO43- = 0.4 mg.L-1 = 0.54 groundwater: Ca2+ = 57.13 mg.L-1, Mg2+ = 77 mg.L-1, COD = 7.14 mg.L-1, N = 9.02, SO43- = 69.25 mg.L-1, PO43- = 0.4 mg.L-1) could influence bacterial biofilm regrowth in treated water systems, statistical data supported the findings that a combined chlorine-monochloramine process and the persistence of monochloramine in the combined systems constitutes one of the most important factors linked to the inhibition of bacterial biofilm in a drinking water system.</jats:p>",

The raw water intake must be sited to minimise the cost of capital works, which may include increased storage, while maintaining the salinity of water supplied to customers within acceptable limits. This is not a trivial exercise as flow in estuaries, i.e. where the river and ocean meet, is complicated by tides, winds, upstream river inflows, erosion, and the rotation of the earth resulting in a relatively complex system in which salinity can vary dramatically in time and space. In turn, the level of risk (of exceeding acceptable salinity in water supplied to the customer) varies depending upon the estuarine behaviour and factors, such as abstraction location, available water storage, and abstraction practice. Here we show, via a case study, how hydrology, hydraulics and economics must be integrated in order to find a least-cost solution that meets the needs of customers.</jats:p>",

For this reason, it is important to support their work and decision processes with the best available tools in order to deliver services with the most effective and efficient performance. The paper focuses on proposed performance indicators (PIs) for wastewater services and on the main aspects of PI assessment. These are based on data related to: environmental, operational, personnel, physical, quality of service and economic and financial performance. Data are mostly made available through the various common-use information systems in the utilities. This IWA forum has been important not only for the dissemination of the work already developed but also as promotion of a wider discussion to enhance the final draft version of the IWA Manual of Best Practice due for publication in 2003.</jats:p>",

Introducing a decentralized information system in an organization is a challenging task. It is often intertwined with other organizational processes. The goal of this research is to outline a new approach in developing a supply chain information system with a decentralized decision making process. Particularly, we study the incentive structure in the decentralized organization and design a market-based coordination system that is incentive aligned, i.e., it gives the participants the incentives to act in a manner that is beneficial to the overall system. We also prove that the system monotonically improves the overall organizational performance and is goal congruent. </jats:p>",

The most frequently used disinfectant is chlorine, which can decay due to reactions with organic and inorganic compounds in the water and by liquid/solids reaction with the biofilm, pipe walls and sediments. Usually levels of 0.2-0.5 mg/L of free chlorine are required at the point of consumption to maintain bacteriological safety. Higher concentrations are not desirable as they present the problems of taste and odour and increase formation of disinfection by-products.

Biofilm was not found to critically affect chlorine decay. In the other case study, Sydney Water’s Nepean system was modelled from limited hydraulic data. Chlorine decay and trihalomethane (THM) formation in raw and treated water were measured in a laboratory, and a chlorine decay and THM model was derived on the basis of these data. Simulated chlorine and THM profiles agree well with the measured values available. Various applications of this modelling approach are also briefly discussed.</jats:p>",

This article describes a new labour‐market specification for MONASH in which people are allocated in year t to categories according to their labourmarket activities in year t – 1. People in each category plan their labour supplies by solving an optimisation problem. Via these problems, we introduce the assumption that people in employment categories supply labour more strongly to employment activities than do people in unemployment categories. Thus we find that employment‐stimulating policies in t – 1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of the labour force in t in favour of employment categories and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using MONASH to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on award wage rates with tax credits for low‐wage workers in low‐income families. We find that the Dawkins policy would generate a significant short‐run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after‐tax wage rates to unemployment benefits.</jats:p>",

The field investigation focused on evaluating the quantity of turbid material deposited in key locations, identified from the desktop investigations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Several factors appeared to influence the likelihood of a dirty water complaint.

Determination of optimal harvest levels and estimation of supply function coefficients are integrated into one step by incorporating a parametric short‐run timber supply function into the harvest decision model. In this manner we convert the original harvest decision model into a new optimization problem with the supply function coefficients functioning as “decision variables.” Optimal solution to the new decision model gives the coefficients of the short‐run supply function and, indirectly, the optimal harvest levels. This approach enables us to develop stochastic models of the timber market that are particularly useful for forest sector analysis involving comparison of alternative institutional regimes or policy proposals and when the timber market is affected by stochastic variables. For demonstration purposes, we apply this method to compare the performances of two timber market regimes (perfect competition and monopoly) under demand uncertainty, using the Swedish data. The results show that the expected timber price is 22 percent lower and the expected annual timber supply is 43 percent higher in the competitive market than in the monopoly market. This confirms the theoretical result that monopoly reduces supply and increases price. The expected social welfare gain from perfect competition over monopoly is about 24 percent.</jats:p>",

Their ability to access the rich nutrient supply offered by living plants is one of the most obvious properties that distinguish pathogens from saprophytes. Successful invasion by pathogens depends as much on their ability to utilize the available nutrient sources offered by plants as on their ability to penetrate plants and evade defensive mechanisms. Here, we review current knowledge on the nature of the nutrient supplies utilized by pathogens during infection.</jats:p><jats:p>The available evidence is rudimentary in most cases. There is much evidence to suggest that fungal metabolism can be divided into at least two phases. The first is based on lipolysis and occurs during germination and penetration of the host. The second phase uses glycolysis and predominates during the invasion of host tissue. We also propose, mainly on theoretical grounds, that a third phase of nutrition occurs late in infection during which new spores are produced.</jats:p><jats:p>Contrary to early assumptions, the nitrogen sources available to some pathogens appear to be abundant. The idea that nitrogen starvation is a cue that controls fungal gene expression during infection may need to be reassessed. Very little is known about the micronutrient (Fe, S, P) or vitamin supply. The knowledge gained from this research may enable the design of new antifungal strategies targeting potential weaknesses in fungal metabolism and will also impact on agronomic practices.</jats:p>",

Based on more than 15 yr of experience, we conclude that the reduction of the external P load resulted in a corresponding decrease of the lake’s P concentration. However, contrary to initial expectations, increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations neither (1) reduced the P release from sediments during summer nor (2) resulted in anincreased permanent P retention. These observations warrant a reevaluation of the well‐accepted management strategy of decreasing the lake internal P cycling by maintaining an aerobic hypolimnion and sediment surface. We hypothesize that oxygenation only results in an increased permanent benthic P burial if, because of the depressed sulfide production, more ferrous phosphate (e.g., vivianite) and less FeS is deposited in the anoxic sediment. Hence, it is not the oxic sediment surface that directly affects the permanent redox‐dependent sediment P retention but the molar ratio of the available reactive Fe(II) : S<jats:sup>2‐</jats:sup> : PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in the anoxic sediment. This ratio is driven by the settling rate and the nature of organic matter and particulate iron, as well as the supply of oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate to the sediment.</jats:p>",

Simulation holds a great potential in portraying the dynamic evolution of supply chains and providing appropriate decision support to address challenges arising from high variability and stochastic uncertainty. Realizing high-fidelity supply chain simulation will require integration of individual supply chain component simulation models and planning systems, shielding to prevent sensitive data from being shared indiscriminately, and even the geographical distribution of the supply chain component models. The authors discuss various conceptual and technical issues that have been successfully addressed to realize a prototype of distributed semiconductor supply chain simulation as well as implementation approaches that can be pursued. The prototype emulates a semiconductor supply chain consisting of two wafer fabs, an assembly and test facility, a distribution center, a warehouse, a supply chain planning module, a logistics provider, and customers. </jats:p>",

The prediction that birds would perform area‐restricted searches when prey was more abundant was not confirmed. Moreover, we found no evidence that juveniles avoided conspecifics. Owls appeared to have an imperfect knowledge of the environment as they responded to variability in Field Vole densities by altering the time spent in different areas rather than by moving to areas with successively greater vole densities. Vole abundance explained 25.7% of the variation in the time spent in different areas. Movements did not decrease with time after dispersal, although the detection of such movements was prone to error. This study supports recent work suggesting that although dispersal may be initiated by a variety of proximate and ultimate factors, individual decisions made during dispersal may depend partly on environmental conditions encountered during the process itself.</jats:p>",

The density of the rat population fluctuated greatly throughout the year depending on the growth stages of the rice plants.

Synchronization is primarily achieved by varying first egg date, but yearly temperature variations may delay or accelerate the food peak after the first egg has been laid. We tested the extent to which great tits (<jats:italic>Parus major</jats:italic> L.) can strategically change their synchronization of hatch date with the food peak after the first egg has been laid by changing clutch size, laying interval and the amount of incubation. We also tested whether these possible synchronization change mechanisms resulted in changes in breeding success, because if the food peak is late relative to first egg date, we would predict more of the population to have larger clutches and/or a hatch date synchronous with the food peak date.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Great tits modified synchronization strategically by varying clutch size and the onset of incubation after clutch completion.

In warm early seasons (and more often in recent years) more of the great tits that laid relatively late had sufficient time to complete their clutches before having to start incubation in order to hatch in time for the food peak.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The increased proportion of synchronized nests in recent years probably resulted in increased chick output: a greater proportion of recent nests successfully fledged all of the chicks that hatched and the number of young fledged per successful nest also increased in recent years. These changes may have arisen because the proportion of nests with disadvantageous asynchronous hatching and/or smaller clutches has decreased. As the proportion of great tits that start nesting too late to synchronize has declined so selection for early laying has also declined in recent years.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

Besides the ratio of feathers to whole body mass, feather length as well as feather weight were of interest. Furthermore, data on feather loss and growth rates were estimated. In general, it could be observed that the proportion of feathers relative to body mass varied between 14 (canaries) and 7.4% (lovebirds). Feather losses (outside the moult period) amounted to an average of 6.65 (canaries), 8.98 (budgerigars), and 8.43 (lovebirds) mg/bird/day respectively or 37 (canaries), 20 (budgerigars), and 17 (lovebirds) mg/100 g body weight/day (values of interest in calculating of protein requirements for maintenance). In canaries, the average growth rate of the developing feathers amounted to 2 mm/day. In contrast to the onset of feather regeneration, the growth rate of new feathers leaving the follicle was not influenced by the supplements used here. The regeneration period (first measurable feather growth) of a plucked pinion can be used as an indicator and objective parameter to test potential nutritional influences. Parallel to the improvement of nutrient supply the rates of feather losses and also replacement increased, whereas the rates decreased when seed mixtures without any addition of minerals, sulphurous amino acids, and vitamins were fed.</jats:p>",

Days supply of each component category was calculated as the number of units in inventory reported on a day divided by the sum of units transfused, exported, and outdated on that day. Sites also provided daily responses to questions about threatened or actual shortages.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold> : The median of the days supply of RBCs at the 26 hospital transfusion services was 7.2 days. However, median days supply varied substantially by site and by day of the week. A+, O+, and O– units accounted for 30, 35, and 12 percent of total inventory and were maintained at a median supply of 7.4, 6.4, and 9.5 days, respectively. Reports of threatened RBC shortages peaked in early January 2002 and again in early July 2002. The July 2002 peak was about twice the January 2002 peak. Inventories at community‐based centers were similar to those at hospital transfusion services. Hospitals maintained only a 1‐day supply of platelets. Eight percent of random and 4 percent of apheresis platelets were outdated. There were 20 reports that surgery had to be postponed or canceled because platelets were unavailable.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS</jats:bold> : Inventories of RBCs maintained at the participating sites were sufficient, with only one brief exception, to meet local demand during the first year of this monitoring program. The weekly rate of threatened shortage reports was more sensitive than days inventory as a predictor of actual shortages of RBCs. Unlike RBCs, platelet days supply, reports of threatened or actual platelet shortages, and platelet outdate rates did not vary seasonally.</jats:p>",
