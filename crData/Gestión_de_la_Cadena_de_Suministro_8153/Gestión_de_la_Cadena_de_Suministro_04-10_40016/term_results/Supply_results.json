      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the first full‐scale application of ozone for water treatment in late 1800s, ozone has been widely used in municipal water supplies in many countries. The primary goal of the ozonation process in water treatment is often disinfection, but ozonation is also used in many other applications, including taste and odor control, color removal, oxidation of manganese and iron, flocculation enhancement, oxidation of natural organic matter (NOM) and accompanying promotion of its biodegradability, and control of chlorination byproducts (1). Recently, the application of ozone as a disinfectant has been receiving more attention because of its effectiveness in treating pathogens, such as oocysts of the protozoan parasite<jats:italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</jats:italic>, which have shown strong resistance to chlorine‐based disinfectants (2, 3).</jats:p><jats:p>In water treatment, ozone can be applied either at the early stage of treatment (i.e., preozonation) or after other treatment processes, including conventional processes such as coagulation/flocculation and sedimentation. Ozone is sometimes used with hydrogen peroxide or UV to promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Due to the increased biodegradability of organic matter after ozonation, ozonation is typically followed by biological filtration to remove biodegradable organic matter and to minimize microbial regrowth in the distribution system. Ozone decomposes relatively fast, so secondary disinfectants such as free chlorine and monochloramine are often applied after ozonation to provide residual disinfectant in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

Driven bottom‐up by local needs and priorities and top‐down by regulatory responsibilities, it must be adaptive, evolving dynamically as conditions change. Water resource spatial and political scales range from local/municipal, subregional, state, regional (multistate), national, multinational (‘regional’ in a global sense) to continental and global. Large watersheds occupy state and regional spatial scales, presenting considerable challenges for IWM and water supply, in particular, because of the number and diversity of human consumers and biodiverse habitat needs.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>A watershed spatial scale is often used by ecologists to analyze species distribution and biogeochemical cycling. Watersheds can be characterized by the proportions of land area taken up by five main land use/land cover categories: urban land, agricultural land, rangeland, forestland, and water. It is arguable whether a watershed or ecoregion scale (region of relative homogeneity based on soil, climate, and vegetative criteria) is most appropriate for managing water quality and aquatic habitats. Even in terms of water stocks and flows, the differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration in one watershed that determine the runoff and infiltration that can be used for water supply are influenced by regional climatic and hydrological processes.</jats:p>",

However, in many environments the potential for process improvement remains. This paper categorizes four historical phases of supply chain development and classifies distinct supply chain strategies that are appropriate for each environment. These historical phases of the emergence of the supply chain are then equated to those of processes, facilities, businesses, and industries. A successful supply chain integration effort is then posited to depend on long‐, mid‐, and short‐term strategies and tactics that balance the differentiation of serial supply chain activities and the integrative effort applied. These relationships offer academics and practitioners a contingency perspective of supply chains and a model to define and anticipate supply chain situations as well as mechanisms to develop appropriate responses.</jats:p>",

Existing timber supply models do not adequately capture the variation in annual area burned. This article presents a procedure to evaluatethe joint effects of harvest levels and wildfire on the sustainability of timber harvest. A Monte Carlo simulation model is developed that incorporates timber harvesting, forest fires, and replanning. The output of the model consists of projected distributions of sustainable harvest levelsgenerated by a linear programming-based timber supply model in response to specified harvest volumes and randomly generated burn areas. Because of the highly variable nature of the fire regime, it is difficult or impossible to set a harvest level that is perpetually sustainable with completecertainty. An alternative definition of sustainability is developed incorporating probabilities and time. At any point in time, a harvest level is considered sustainable if the probability of the harvest level exceeding the annual allowable cut is less than an acceptable level. FOR.

A supply chain audit methodology is described for identifying and codifying uncertainty. The proposition advanced herein is that smooth material flow leads to and statistically correlates with uncertainty reduction.

Seeks to review the key factors that have led to the globalisation of the poultry supply chain and the impact of these changes. The poultry supply chain was chosen because it is highly integrated and the research includes a literature review and an evaluation to determine how it specifically relates to the poultry supply chain. Identifies the factors that affect current and future developments in food globalisation, including: relative strength of currencies; speed of technology transfer to developing countries; tax and regulatory burden in nation states or trading groups; cost of capital and labour and its effect on competitiveness; continuing production specialization and greater differentiation between domestic and international meat trade; and concerns over production methods, food safety and hygiene standards.

But are supply chains always better off with strategies that are designed to dampen the bullwhip effect? This paper considers a model where a single product is sold through multiple retail outlets. The retailers replenish their inventories from a factory, which in turn replenishes its own finished-goods inventory through production. The factory's production capacity is finite, and there are transportation economies of scale in replenishing the retailer inventories. We study two types of replenishment strategies that are widely used in practice, and show that a replenishment strategy that reduces the volatility of orders received by the factory does not necessarily reduce the total costs in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

We propose a model for estimating the data‐communication and computation times incurred by the B2B information system using the above benchmarks. In addition, we discuss an algorithm for equitable sharing of the costs of a virtual private network by the partners.

This paper focuses on the use of product data and information systems for the design of materials supply systems in product development projects. The results from a case study show that there are product data available at an early stage in the project. However, the product data have to be retrieved from several information systems and from information systems, which the materials supply systems designers cannot use. In addition, product data can be obtained by means of personal communication much earlier than they can be retrieved from the information systems. It is concluded that research and development is required so that the information systems can be utilised for both early release and retrieval of preliminary information.</jats:p>",

Individuals have free access to the environmental resource, which is subject to negative externalities: that is, is depleted by the production and consumption of the output. Individuals react to negative externalities by increasing their labour supply in order to produce substitutes for the diminishing resource. The increase in production and consumption that ensues generates further deterioration of the future quality or quantity of the free resource, thus giving rise to a self-reinforcing process. Multiple equilibria and ‘critical mass effects’ are consistent with the functioning of this economy and the resulting level of aggregate production may be higher than is socially desirable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective was to provide results to optimize the production of table beet (<jats:italic>Beta vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) with respect to yield and quality. Field experiments were carried out over 2 years, where the effects of nitrogen (N) supply, sowing date, and cultivar were tested in a block design with four replications. In addition to yield, soluble solids and nitrate N contents of roots were measured to assess quality. Sowing date was an important factor for determining yield and quality of table beet. Sowing dates later than June at the experimental site are not recommended because they resulted in an increase in nitrate N content in fresh weight of up to 3027 mg·kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> and an average yield loss of 46% compared to sowings in April. Soluble solids content (SSC) was only slightly affected by planting date. Nitrogen supply did not affect SSC, but increasing N supply led to a major increase in nitrate N content, especially if combined with late sowing dates. It was concluded for early sowing dates that N supply be determined to achieve the maximum yield. With an early sowing date, nitrate N content in fresh weight at harvest was &lt;563 mg·kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, even with a high N supply of 250 kg·ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Late sowing dates required a reduced N supply to keep harvest nitrate contents below the 2500 mg·kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> required by the processing industry. Recommendations for optimizing N supply, sowing date, and cultivars for table beet should always take into account strong interactions between these factors.</jats:p>",

The need for reform in the water sector is evident from the years of poor performance and the growing numbers lacking piped provision. The government has chosen privatization as the main policy direction. However, privatization can cause the needs of the unserved and of low-income groups in general to be ignored. This paper discusses various policy options to secure advantage for these groups, within the framework of a privatized water sector. These include participatory sector planning, social tarification, contractual clauses, water trust funds and support for alternative water suppliers. </jats:p>",

However, it is in the product development phase where the majority of product life‐cycle costs are determined. As a guideline for further case research, we propose an approach for integration in product life cycle modelling systems. For practitioners, we point out some major requirements for implementation.

This paper presents the results of two choice experiment valuation studies in the south east of England, in which water supply problems are considered. Further to the specifics of the individual scenarios, these studies lead to more general observations relevant to the future evaluation of water supply options, namely: at the current level of supply reliability, there is a reluctance to pay for any improvement in reliability; where future increases in supply reliability are required, water customers are generally willing to pay more in water charges in order to prevent negative environmental impacts; and, to a lesser extent, customers are willing to pay for water supply operations that would bring about environmental improvements, although this depends on the type of improvements considered and may require greater efforts on the part of water companies to gain consumer acceptance. In order to explore the meaning and validity of these principles further, a more generic choice experiment was designed and studied using post-questionnaire focus group analysis. Although the qualitative results provide further support for these principles, they also illustrate the difficulties inherent in asking the general public to value unfamiliar goods and the challenges that this raises for future design and analysis.</jats:p>",

Whilst dramatic reductions in downstream finished goods, work‐in‐progress and raw materials inventories have taken place in many automotive supply chains, this paper looks at how demand information can be made more transparent in order to improve the efficiency of upstream operations. The paper concentrates on the findings from a case study that used a prototype Internet‐based system to convert original equipment manufacturer (OEM) demand into second and third‐tier component requirements. A computer‐based value analysis illustrates how this information might be used to significantly improve supply chain synchronisation in the lower tiers. The research demonstrates how information systems can be used to improve supply chain performance and provides further motivation for the development of more holistic supply chain planning information systems.</jats:p>",

Setting the flux of momentum into the ocean to zero between 35–60°S reduces the net mechanical energy input by more than a factor of two without much effect on the heat transport in the Atlantic. The strong westerly winds in the Southern Ocean are found to be more important for the circulation of bottom water and for localizing the upwelling of deep water around Antarctica. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the hydrological cycle plays a significant role in maintaining the global ocean circulation and the associated heat transport in the Atlantic, given sufficient mechanical energy to support the diapycnal mixing. A reduction of the meridional moisture transport to the Southern Ocean by a factor of two reduces heat transport in the Atlantic by about the same factor.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the operation of Alice Water Treatment Plant (AWTP), a small treatment plant serving the town of Alice in the Eastern Cape Province, was evaluated, and the major causes compromising the effectiveness of the disinfection process were identified. The investigation revealed that the AWTP's major operational problems include: (a) The lack of a proper coagulant dosing control resulting in inadequate turbidity removal in the clarifiers and filters. The most common source of problems in rapid filtration was inadequate backwashing. The filters appeared to go for days without backwashing. (b) The lack of a proper chlorine dosing procedure and monitoring program. These problems are linked to the inadequate training of the plant staff. As a result of inadequate pretreatment, which also resulted in high dissolved organic carbon and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) concentrations and insufficient chlorine residuals, Alice treated water did not meet the minimum safety limits for potable water.</jats:p>",

The methods are based on the comparison of the CUT with a golden reference chip, either simulated or determined to be defect-free, with the objective of distinguishing anomalous signal behavior introduced by a defect from that introduced by process variations. However, variations in contact resistance between the probe card and the CUT introduces anomalies in the measured power supply signals that complicates the task of comparing data between chips. This paper presents hardware results that demonstrate the effectiveness of a previously developed calibration technique designed to eliminate these types of signal anomalies introduced by the testing environment. The CUT hardware data presented in this work is calibrated using simulations of the CUT’s power grid and special on-chip sources of stimuli called ‘calibration circuits’. Several novel Look-Up Table based defect localization techniques are proposed that analyze the calibrated power supplies signals. The results of predicting the locations of emulated defects in nine copies of a test chip demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.</jats:p>",

We explain the global coherence of these records by a simple physical control on the flux of dissolved oxygen to suboxic zones and the coupling to fixation via the supply of phosphorus to diazotrophs in suitable environments. According to our hypothesis, lower glacial‐stage sea surface temperature increased oxygen solubility, while stronger winds in high‐latitude regions enhanced the rate of thermocline ventilation. The resultant colder, rapidly flushed thermocline lessened the spatial extent of denitrification and, consequently, N fixation. During warm periods, sluggish circulation of warmer, less oxygen rich thermocline waters caused expansion of denitrification zones and a concomitant increase in N fixation. Local fluctuations in export productivity would have modulated this global signal.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is widely accepted that type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is mostly present in the brain, where it maintains the homeostasis of thyroid hormone (TH) levels. Although intensive studies have been performed on activity and mRNA levels of the deiodinases, very little is known about their expression at the protein level due to the lack of specific antisera. The current study reports the production of a specific D2 polyclonal antiserum and its use in the comparison of D2 protein distribution with that of type I (D1) and type III (D3) deiodinase protein in the choroid plexus at the blood–brain barrier level. Immunocytochemistry showed very high D2 protein expression in the choroid plexus, especially in the epithelial cells, whereas the D1 and D3 proteins were absent. Furthermore, dexamethasone treatment led to an up-regulation of the D2 protein in the choroid plexus. The expression of D2 protein in the choroid plexus led to a novel insight into the working mechanism of the uptake and transport of thyroid hormones along the blood–brain barrier in birds. It is hypothesized that D2 allows the prohormone thyroxine (T<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) to be converted into the active 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). Within the choroidal epithelial cells. T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is subsequently bound to its carrier protein, transthyretin (TTR), to allow transport through the cerebrospinal fluid.

To manipulate the assimilate supply, selected branches were girdled to provide ratios of 10, 25, 50 and 100 leaves per fruit. Irrigation was managed to provide two types of water supply treatments. Fruit growth rate was greater when increasing the leaf:fruit ratio. Structural dry matter content and total dry matter content of flesh were higher in fruit with higher leaf:fruit ratios. Treatments had no effect on the structural to total dry matter ratio of flesh. Potassium and magnesium to structural dry weight ratios were not affected by treatments, whereas the calcium to structural dry weight ratio was higher in the flesh of fruit grown under low leaf:fruit ratios. Low assimilate supply increased the ratios of malic and citric acid to structural dry weight. This treatment had little effect on acid concentrations. Glucose and fructose to structural dry weight ratios were higher when assimilate supply was lower. Low leaf:fruit ratios increased fructose concentration but not glucose concentration. Irrigation treatment strongly affected fructose concentration. Sucrose concentration, based either on structural dry matter or on fresh matter, was significantly increased by higher leaf‐to‐fruit ratios. When the fruit was close to maturity, levels of sucrose storage and starch breakdown were positively correlated with assimilate supply. Levels of starch breakdown were correlated with irrigation supply. The effects of these treatments on sugar concentrations may change fruit taste.
