      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>When uncertainty is a consideration in the normative analysis of decisions and information within organizations, “best” programs of decision rules depend on the information structure which pertains to the organization. Under different information structures, different decision rule programs are optimal relative to the prevailing criteria of organization performance.</jats:p><jats:p>Propositions from team decision theory may be employed advantageously to resolve behavioral issues in the formal description of organizational decision processes. In specifying the information structure of an organization within the analysis of team problems it becomes useful to distinguish between components of the data generating process and the information system. An information system can be described completely in terms of (1) the space of states of the world, {X<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>} = X; (2) the space of information, {Z<jats:sub>k</jats:sub>} = Z; and (3) the system likelihood function or conditional probability of each item of information, Z<jats:sub>k</jats:sub>, given the state, X<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, for each Z<jats:sub>k</jats:sub> ε Z and X<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> ε X. The framework of applied statistical decision theory provides an operational procedure for the normative analysis of alternative decision rule programs and information systems.</jats:p><jats:p>These considerations are illustrated for a simple logistics organization with operating costs given by a constrained asymmetric linear function of inventory and demand. In particular, both normal and extensive form analyses of the team decision problem are detailed under several logistics information systems.</jats:p>",

The anterior cranial fossa is supplied by small twigs which spread through the dura of the anterior cranial fossa floor. The larger branch, the anterior meningeal artery, perforates the lateral orbital wall and supplies the lateral wall of anterior and middle cranial fossae. The middle meningeal artery, of the maxillary artery, divides into two branches in the floor of the middle fossa. The anterior or frontal branch always anastomoses with the anterior meningeal artery. Sometimes it also continues upward to the lateral wall of the middle fossa to supply it. The posterior middle meningeal branch passes backward to supply the parietal area. The posterior meningeal artery, of the occipital artery, enters the skull near the beginning of the sigmoid sinus and follows the general course of the lambdoidal suture.</jats:p>",

Two subcommittees were formed, one to develop rules and regulations for water, the other for sewage. The sewage subcommittee found that the existing regulations required some, but not extensive, improvement. The water subcommittee, however, found the existing regulations so inadequate and outmoded that it was necessary to apply a completely new approach to their revision. This article discusses some of the general and special provisions of the new rules and regulations for the design of public water supply facilities.</jats:p>",
