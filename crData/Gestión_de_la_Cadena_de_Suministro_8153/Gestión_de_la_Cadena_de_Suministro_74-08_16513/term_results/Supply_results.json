Hiproly accumulated approximately 50% more nitrogen per seed than Maris Mink, but maintained a balance of amino acids typical of a low nitrogen barley. The effect of varying nitrogen supply on the amino acid composition of Hiproly and a number of commercial varieties was investigated by growing plants in gravel culture in the glasshouse. In the commercial varieties the proportions of glutamic acid, proline and phenylalanine in the protein were positively correlated with protein content but the levels of the essential amino acids, particularly lysine, showed a strong negative correlation with protein content. Hiproly, however, deviated significantly from this negative correlation of the essential amino acids with protein content.</jats:p>",
