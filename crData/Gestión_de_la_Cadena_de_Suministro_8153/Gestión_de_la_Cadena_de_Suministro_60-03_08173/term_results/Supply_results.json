      "abstract": "<jats:p>The commercial development of high‐speed computers is a matter of profound importance to the water supply industry. The industry is hard pressed by population growth, increasing per capita consumption, stream pollution, explosive metropolitan expansion, and a host of other problems. To cope with these difficulties there is an urgent need for first‐rate engineering, first‐rate management, and first‐rate water utility operation. Under the circumstances, it seems that the electronic computer has been made available to the industry at a time when it is most urgently needed. This article discusses the advantages of computers and their usefulness in the water industry, necessary training, economy, large and small computers, analog and digital types, and the trend toward computers.</jats:p>",
