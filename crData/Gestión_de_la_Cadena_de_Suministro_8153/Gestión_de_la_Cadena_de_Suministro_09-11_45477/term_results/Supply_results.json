Gerber (2008) indicated that the current level of relationships that exists between travel agencies and their suppliers in Gauteng are fragmented and impact negatively on the ability of travel agents to deliver a quality service to their customers. It is against this background that the research was undertaken. The target population for this study was 228 travel agencies of which 134 managers and/or owners participated through personal interviews in the completion of questionnaires. The results indicate that the owners and managers of travel agencies are of the opinion that the level of trust between themselves and their suppliers needs to be strengthened. The stimulation of open channel communication between themselves and their suppliers could enhance the strengthening of a long-term relationship between the parties.</jats:p>"

We examine two internal sources (compensation and employment risk) and one external source (environmental volatility) of risk bearing that can make SCEs more reluctant to make the decision to promote supply chain integration. We argue and empirically confirm the notion that an employment and compensation system that increases SCE risk bearing reduces the SCE's willingness to make risky decisions and thus discourages supply chain integration. We also reveal that this negative relationship becomes stronger under conditions of high environmental volatility. In addressing the “so what?” question, we found empirical support for the hypothesis that supply chain integration positively influences operational performance. Even though this decision has a positive value for the firm, we showed that SCEs discourage supply chain integration when they face higher risk bearing. Hypotheses are tested using a combination of primary survey data and archival measures in a sample of 133 Spanish firms.</jats:p>",

There are several approaches to this system of financing, and readers will learn the pros and cons of extension strategies, a cross-border application and discounting challenges. The paper also discusses the various groups within a business that should be engaged before adopting the process to ensure its success. Accounting concerns and guidelines are also addressed. Finally, adding a supplier finance solution to a company’s payable mix can help to create a stronger balance sheet and a more stable supply chain.</jats:p>"

The analysis was performed from three standpoints: process inputs, process conduct and process outcomes. The consultation process on involvement of the private sector was hostile and resulted in a “light” form of private sector participation in the form of a management contract that can be considered a de facto compromise, although not deliberate, by stakeholders. The challenges in improving the water sector performance and water supply services are profound. Because of continuing institutional, social, political and legal constraints, the involvement of the private sector per se is not the solution to providing long-term improvement in water services. The article concludes that it is misleading to leapfrog from government to governance, calling for the transmission of a governance “recipe”, as conceptualised in the Western context, and to assume that it can work in an unaccommodating institutional context.</jats:p>",

Such research has two basic dimensions: one is related to the identification of variables affecting the performance of the vendors and the other deals with the methodology to be applied. Most of the research conducted in this area deal with the upfront selection of vendors. However, it is very common to have a list of dedicated vendors due to the development of sophisticated production technologies like just in time (JIT), a lean or agile manufacturing process where continuous flow of materials is a requirement. This paper addresses the issue of selecting the optimal vendor from the internal database of a company. Factor analysis, analytical hierarchy process and regression analysis is used in an integrated way to supplement the vendor selection process.

Archaeological evidences and landscape settings were applied utilizing all available and accessible literature relevant to ancient water resources management in Jerusalem. Irrigated agriculture was practiced for many centuries in this region, hence sustainable water supply facilities were erected, including well developed aqueducts, water harvesting pools and irrigation channels for water storage and landscaping purposes. To cope with seismic events, soil subsidence and water leakage, ancient water engineers and architects applied innovative construction methods for the erection of water pools, channels and aqueduct systems. Ancient water supply systems in Jerusalem are valuable treasures of past civilizations and crucial urban environmental facilities and their protection is consistent with sustainable development principles. Effective environmental assessment as a decision-making process for sustainable development can be applied to preserve threatened ancient water facilities from major development proposals and urban infrastructure projects in Jerusalem.</jats:p>"

It gives particular attention to the problems of the poor in the face of increasing biofuel production. It argues that sustainable results can only come about if the interests of the most vulnerable groups of the community are addressed at the international level. In particular, the current regulatory frameworks need to be enforced in order to ensure the food security of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Flexible work options could be one possibility, but are special shorter‐working‐hours‐for‐elderly workplaces really important in order to increase employment among the 65+ age group? The purpose of this paper is to argue, in the case of Japan, that increased availability of non‐standard work formats would not improve labour force participation among the elderly when it is driven by corporate objectives to reduce labour costs. On the contrary, supply‐driven increase in flexible work formats sends a signal of unfavourable labour market conditions and causes the elderly to stay out of labour.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper utilizes the Labour Force Survey, a nationally representative data set showing labour force participation and employment formats across all age groups.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>It is true that non‐standard work formats are being progressively more used among elderly workers. However labour force participation rate has increased only in cases where the increase in flexible work formats was demand driven, meaning only to the point where both standard and non‐standard work options were equally available to the whole population. When economic conditions force companies to offer more non‐standard work options, increase in supply side takes place. This sends a signal of unfavourable labour market conditions to the elderly population, who are more elastic to labour market changes and by using a pension can easily withdraw from the workforce.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This analysis suggests that policy objectives to create flexible‐elderly work formats in order to increase the employment rate and reduce costs for the retirement system will not bring expected the results.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>Although policy objective is to increase the employment rate among the elderly, focusing only on elderly will provide moderate results. Elderly population would come along, but only with the working age population. The first point of reform should be placed on the overall labour market, by diminishing major differences between standard and non‐standard work formats. One way could be the act of applying social security and company benefits to non‐standard work formats. Or opposite to that, the act of diminishing social security and company benefits to standard work formats.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper contributes to the literature by broadening understanding of elderly population behaviour in the labour market.

The solubility of heavy metals is very low, therefore there is no risk to use the wood ash in the agriculture and in the horticulture according to our experiments. The wood ash and biofertilizer contains several micronutrients in an optimum composition for forestry and agricultural plants.</jats:p>"

The policy has resulted in private sector driven supply chains in rural water supply. This paper takes a look at these private sector driven supply chains and at the perceptions of various stakeholders regarding their outputs. These perceptions were gathered through a survey carried out in two communities in Ghana. The paper concludes that though supply chains in the two communities are significantly private sector driven, demand for installation services are directly linked to the activities of implementing agencies (government, NGOs, international donor agencies) while that of repair services, maintenance and spare parts are directly linked to the installed equipment. Policy makers must therefore look more closely at the role of agencies responsible for the implementation of their policies to ensure that maximum benefits are derived from increased private sector partnership.</jats:p>",

The policy was found to be associated with a 3.5 percentage point (9.5 percent) increase in the employment and a 3.8 percentage point (7 percent) decrease in the retirement of foreign‐born elderly men. Partly as a result of their employment response, SSI ineligibility and the consequent decline in SSI receipt did not have any statistically significant effects on the family incomes of elderly foreign‐born men. Noncitizen elderly women, on the other hand, did not experience any increase in employment, and those without family support suffered a 10 to 17 percent decline in income. These findings suggest that access to SSI did not create work disincentives for noncitizen elderly women and that SSI restrictions have imposed financial hardship on those without any family support, many of whom perhaps cannot effectively increase their employment. © 2010 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.</jats:p>",

We consider a supply chain with two participants, who face interdependent losses resulting from supply chain disruptions such as terrorist strikes and natural hazards. The Harsanyi–Selten–Nash bargaining framework is used to model the supply chain participants' choice of risk mitigation investments. The bargaining approach allows a framing of both joint financing of mitigation activities before the fact and loss‐sharing net of insurance payouts after the fact. The disagreement outcome in the bargaining game is assumed to be the result of the corresponding non‐cooperative game. We describe an incentive‐compatible contract that leads to First Best investment and equal “gain” for all players, when the solution is “interior” (as it almost certainly is in practice). A supplier that has superior security practices (i.e., is inherently safer) exploits its informational advantage by extracting an “information rent” in the usual spirit of incomplete information games. We also identify a special case of this contract, which is robust to moral hazard. The role of auditing in reinforcing investment incentives is also examined. </jats:p>",

Firms must have clear strategic thinking in order to effectively organize such complicated activities, resources, communications, and processes. An emerging body of literature offers a framework that identifies three kinds of supply chain strategies: lean strategy, agile strategy, and lean/agile strategy based on in‐depth case studies. Extant research also suggests that supply chain strategies must be matched with product characteristics in order for firms to achieve better performance. This article investigates supply chain strategies and empirically tests the supply chain strategy model that posits lean, agile, and lean/agile approaches using data collected from 604 manufacturing firms in China. Cluster analyses of the data indicate that Chinese firms are adopting a variation of lean, agile, and lean/agile supply chain strategies identified in the western literature. However, the data reveal that some firms have a traditional strategy that does not emphasize either lean or agile principles. These firms perform worse than firms that have a strategy focused on lean, agile, or lean/agile supply chain. The strategies are examined with respect to product characteristics and financial and operational performance. The article makes significant contributions to the supply chain management literature by examining the supply chain strategies used by Chinese firms. In addition, this work empirically tests the applicability of supply chain strategy models that have not been rigorously tested empirically or in the fast‐growing Chinese economy.</jats:p>",

In contrast to previous studies, our findings suggest that the leading model of vertical coordination between fruit and vegetables growers and supermarkets in Croatia is restricted to loose, one-year contracts which mainly specify the terms of payment without providing farm assistance. Wholesalers more often provide farm assistance to fruit and vegetables growers. We expect that the wholesalers will drop out of the fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) supermarket supply chain since supermarkets aim to streamline the procurement system by in-creasing local procurement directly from the farmers. Thus, the amount of farm assistance provided will further decrease. Therefore, for the rather small Croatian growers to integrate in the FFV supermarket supply chain, it is even more important that they organize to meet the supermarkets’ minimum quantity requirements and obtain access to a distribution facility.</jats:p>"

While the first two causes are directly related to water utility management and may be reduced by improving company procedures, water meter inaccuracies are considered to be the most significant and hardest to quantify. Water meter errors are amplified in networks subjected to water scarcity, where users adopt private storage tanks to cope with the intermittent water supply. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of two variables influencing the apparent losses: water meter age and the private storage tank effect on meter performance. The study was carried out in Palermo (Italy). The impact of water meter ageing was evaluated in laboratory by testing 180 revenue meters, ranging from 0 to 45 years in age. The effects of the private water tanks were determined via field monitoring of real users and a mathematical model. This study demonstrates that the impact on apparent losses from the meter starting flow rapidly increases with meter age. Private water tanks, usually fed by a float valve, overstate meter under-registration, producing additional apparent losses between 15% and 40% for the users analysed in this study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT: Many factors, including Sarbanes-Oxley, fueled an increase in demand for accountants in recent years, particularly those who are professionally certified, so that demand exceeded supply in the U.S. (Anonymous 2007) and elsewhere (Hambly 2007). Future challenges facing the profession, such as implementing XBRL and IFRS, may also increase demand, perhaps again creating shortages. It is within this context that we examine the issue of the shortage of accountants by focusing on factors that affect supply. We study trends in two types of data: graduation rates for accounting majors (i.e., the number of accounting graduates divided by total business majors) and CPA exam candidacy. The former provides a measure of the total pool of potential CPA exam candidates and the latter is the subset of those who are attempting to become professionally certified. Various studies have observed a decline in CPA exam candidacy and have proposed that it results from the additional education requirement associated with the 150-hour rule (e.g., Allen and Woodland 2006). Several states have reacted by allowing candidates to take the CPA exam with 120 hours of education rather than 150 hours in order to increase supply. Following this line of reasoning, we should observe declines in candidacy and graduation rates only in states that have adopted the 150-hour requirement, but not in states that retained the 120-hour requirement. However, in our extension of existing studies that did not segment data by type of jurisdiction, we find similar rates of decline regardless of whether the candidacy requirement changed to 150 hours or remained at 120 hours. Thus, while some individuals may be deterred by the additional education costs, the finding of no jurisdictional difference in graduation and candidacy rates suggests that policy makers need to consider a variety of issues to comprehensively address shortages in the supply of accountants.</jats:p>",

Water supply facilities and sanitation systems, along with hygiene practices and their health outcomes, were studied at community level. Demographic, socio-economic and socio-cultural aspects were also studied to support the research findings and give a better understanding of the local conditions. The four selected communities, Ward 60 (W60), Ward 61 (W61), Ward 62 (W62) and Ward 65 (W65), all had different existing urban services such as water supply, sanitation, garbage management and drainage facilities. All of these services existed in W62, but W60 did not have any of the services; W61 had sanitation and drainage coverage, whereas W65 had only a water supply facility. The results conclusively showed that, compared with the null (absence of services) scenario (W60), the other three scenarios (W61, W62 and W65) showed a substantial decrease of diarrhoea (1.219, 1.284 and 2.052 DALYs/household/year, respectively) reported for children under five years old. Besides urban services, other socio-economic characteristics might also influence the prevalence of diseases.</jats:p>",

After 9/11 and implementation of several US Customs programs such as the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and regulations such as the 24-Hour Rule, the WCO began to focus much more of its work on supply chain security. This transition culminated in 2005 with the adoption of the WCO SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE Framework), a non-binding instrument comprised of technical customs standards aimed at securing without impeding international trade. This article will discuss the intricacies of the SAFE Framework including its history, political context, and technical elements (especially risk management and the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) concept) and antecedents. This article will also consider the 2007 US legislation mandating 100% scanning of US-bound cargo containers at foreign ports that clouds and constrains the SAFE Framework’s future.

To address these problems, THERMOX, a two‐dimensional (2‐D) finite element program, was developed. THERMOX simulates physical and geochemical processes in waste rock with variable sulfide content and water saturation. The program includes pyrite oxidation kinetics, equilibrium precipitation and dissolution reactions, heat transfer by conduction and convection, and oxygen transport by diffusion and convection. The program was applied to data from a waste rock pile at the Doyon Mine site in Québec, Canada. Simulations were performed for two end‐member scenarios: a nonconvective mode with diffusion as the only oxygen transport process, and a convective mode with both diffusion and convection as oxygen transport processes. Simulations confirmed previous findings from the Doyon Mine site about the development of high temperatures and high pore‐water concentrations close to the slope of a highly permeable waste rock pile with high pyrite content, linked to rapid oxygen convection. When only diffusion of oxygen was considered, the rate of pyrite oxidation was lower and the oxidation front was relatively continuous, with lower maximum dissolved species concentrations close to the slope. Calculated temperatures compared well with the Doyon Mine field data. The match for pH was reasonable, while calculated sulfate concentrations were lower. This can be explained by the high friability of the sericite schist rock at the site, which accelerates the pyrite oxidation rate, and temporal changes in recharge (most recharge occurs during spring snow melt). The program can be used for predicting various remediation scenarios (e.g., change in the slope of a rock pile or the use of an impermeable cover). Kinetically constrained dissolution of silicates should be included to simulate conditions during late stages of neutralization.</jats:p>",

A survey of the Republic of Irelands field was conducted in order to estimate and map the size and geographic distribution of the Republic of Ireland’s field boundaries. The planting and harvesting costs associated with possible bioenergy crop production systems were determined using the relationship between the seasonal operating efficiency and the average field size. The results indicate that Ireland will need a large proportion of its current agricultural area (at least 16.5%) in order to its meet national bioenergy targets by 2020. The demand cannot be met by the current area that both has suitable soil type for growing the bioenergy crops and is large enough for the required operating efficiency. The results of this study indicate that implementing and meeting national bioenergy targets using only indigenous feedstock will likely impact the country’s field boundary resources negatively, as crop producers seek to improve production efficiency through field consolidation and field boundary removal. It was found that such boundary removal results in a loss of up to 6 tC/km2 and 0.7 ha/km of previously permanent habitat where average field size is small. The impact of field consolidation on these resources reduces substantially as larger fields become consolidated.</jats:p>"

However, little attention has been given to study how testing of different corn tissues evaluates K supply especially in the optimum to excess range. We evaluated tissue tests for corn based on the K concentration of young plants (V5 to V6), ear leaves at silking, lower stalks at maturity (sections cut from 15 to 35 cm aboveground), and grain. Twenty‐eight field trials were conducted in Iowa during 2 yr with fertilizer rates of 0, 56, 112, and 168 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Initial soil‐test K (STK) by the ammonium acetate extractant (15‐cm sampling depth, air‐dried samples) was 80 to 266 mg K kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> across sites. Fertilizer K increased grain yield at one site testing 84 mg K kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; and increased the K concentration of plants, leaves, stalks, and grain at 11, 13, 21, and 5 sites, respectively. Published critical K concentrations for corn plants and leaves would have incorrectly indicated deficient soil K supply for yield in many sites. There were upper limits in plants, leaves, and grain K concentrations response to K supply that varied among sites. The limits occurred at STK values of 123, 140, and 148 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively, which are near STK values optimum for grain yield. The lack of an upper limit in corn stalks shows promise for using this tissue to assess K availability from deficiency to luxury uptake or excess. However, the large site‐dependent variability in the stalk K concentrations should be recognized as a limitation.</jats:p>",

Robust arguments supporting rainforest conservation can attract funding and shape land‐use management. However, some popular assertions regarding the value of tropical forests remain largely untested.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>2.</jats:bold> This study tests the validity of two arguments in support of mature tropical rainforest conservation: first, that these forests should be conserved based on their value as potential sources of medicine. This argument requires mature forests to be better sources of medicine than alternative land‐use types, including secondary forests. Second, secondary forest use may help conserve mature forests by providing sufficient resources to buffer against resource extraction in mature forests.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>3.</jats:bold> The research was conducted in three communities in the Cordillera Azul, Peru, where 369 individuals from 66 households were surveyed. Participants recorded all flora and fauna collected in mature (&gt;20 years) and secondary forests over 180 days in six use categories (food, medicine, wood, weavings, adornments and ‘other’). Ecological knowledge of secondary and mature forest species was assessed for male and female household heads.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>4.</jats:bold> Households used 346 folk species (as defined by local classification systems) from 3668 collection events. Individuals had better knowledge of secondary forest species, but more access to mature forests. Participants collected significantly more medicines from secondary than from mature forests. In other major use categories (food, wood, weaving, adornment), secondary forests provided fewer resources than mature forests. Participants collected a different set of species from secondary and mature forests, with only 130 folk species (38%) collected in both secondary and mature forests.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>5.</jats:bold> <jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. The arguments to protect mature rainforests as sources of new drugs may be overstated, because secondary forests can provide more medicinal plant resources than mature forests, and landscapes that incorporate forests of different ages can maximize availability of medicinal plant species. Conservation efforts must take a landscape level approach given the spread of resource use across different forest types. Because of the heterogeneity of resource availability and use among community members, and the dynamic nature of resource use on forest frontiers, conservation should embrace participatory adaptive management approaches that incorporate a variety of resource users.</jats:p>",

Extractive industries, including logging, can accelerate exploitation of wildlife by opening forests to hunters and creating markets for bushmeat. We monitored human demographics, bushmeat supply in markets, and household bushmeat consumption in five logging towns in the northern Republic of Congo. Over 6 years we recorded 29,570 animals in town markets and collected 48,920 household meal records. Development of industrial logging operations led to a 69% increase in the population of logging towns and a 64% increase in bushmeat supply. The immigration of workers, jobseekers, and their families altered hunting patterns and was associated with increased use of wire snares and increased diversity in the species hunted and consumed. Immigrants hunted 72% of all bushmeat, which suggests the short‐term benefits of hunting accrue disproportionately to “outsiders” to the detriment of indigenous peoples who have prior, legitimate claims to wildlife resources. Our results suggest that the greatest threat of logging to biodiversity may be the permanent urbanization of frontier forests. Although enforcement of hunting laws and promotion of alternative sources of protein may help curb the pressure on wildlife, the best strategy for biodiversity conservation may be to keep saw mills and the towns that develop around them out of forests.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The supply networks as a complex adaptive system are simulated using cellular automata (CA) through a dynamic evolution of cooperation (i.e., “voice” decision) and defection (i.e., “exit” decision) among supply network agents (i.e., firms). Simple local rules of interaction among firms generate complex patterns of cooperation and defection decisions in the supply network. The incentive schemes underlying decision making are derived through different configurations of the payoff‐matrix based on the game theory argument. The prisoner's dilemma game allows capturing the localized decision‐making process by rational agents, and the CA model allows the self‐organizing outcome to emerge. By observing the evolution of decision making by cooperating and defecting agents, we offer testable propositions regarding relationship development and distributed nature of governance mechanisms for managing supply networks.</jats:p>",

We then use sequence data to show that the beneficial mutations associated with fitness recovery were specific to particular genetic backgrounds, suggesting that genotypes had access to different sets of beneficial mutations. When we manipulated the supply rate of beneficial mutations, by altering effective population size during evolution, we found that it constrained adaptation in some selection lines by restricting access to rare beneficial mutations, but that the effect varied among the genotypes in our experiment. These results suggest that mutational neighbourhood varies even among genotypes that differ by a single amino acid change, and this determines their capacity for adaptation as well as the influence of population biology processes that alter mutation supply rate.</jats:p>",

Micro‐Grid is focused on as a method to solve some problems in a commercial electric power line when installing a large number of dispersed generators, and some demonstrative research on Micro‐Grid for large‐scale systems is being carried out now. Also, small cogeneration systems for houses, such as gas engines and fuel cells, are expected to improve CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. However, if the power and heat demand of a family are relatively small or are unbalanced, the cogeneration system does not operate effectively. The authors have studied the application of Micro‐Grid for home energy supply, and have developed a control system to solve this problem. The system achieves a reduction of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions and energy costs by sharing electric power and heat among some houses with cogeneration systems. This paper presents an outline of the newly developed system, and in particular describes the effect of the reduction in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions compared with a conventional energy supply method, and the case in which dispersed generators are installed in some houses and operate independently. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding ecosystem‐atmosphere carbon exchanges in dryland environments has been more challenging than in mesic environments, likely due to more pronounced nonlinear responses of ecosystem processes to environmental variation. To better understand diurnal to interannual variation in gross primary productivity (GPP) variability, we coupled continuous eddy‐covariance derived whole ecosystem gas exchange measurements with an ecophysiologic model based on fundamental principles of diffusion, mass balance, reaction kinetics, and biochemical regulation of photosynthesis. We evaluated the coupled data‐model system to describe and understand the dynamics of 3 years of growing season GPP from a riparian grassland and woodland in southern Arizona. The data‐model fusion procedure skillfully reproduced the majority of daily variation GPP throughout three growing seasons. While meteorology was similar between sites, the woodland site had consistently higher GPP rates and lower variability at daily and interannual timescales relative to the grassland site. We examined the causes of this variation using a new state factor model analysis that partitioned GPP variation into four factors: meteorology, physiology, leaf area, and water supply. The largest proportion of GPP variation was associated with physiological differences. The woodland showed a greater sensitivity than the grassland to water supply, while the grassland showed a greater sensitivity to leaf area. These differences are consistent with hypotheses of woody species using resistance mechanisms, stomatal regulation, and grassland species using resilience mechanisms, leaf area regulation, in avoiding water stress and have implications for future GPP sensitivity to climate variability following wood‐grass transitions.</jats:p>",

Better understanding of how nutrient conservation changes with variations in water availability is crucial for predicting the potential influence of global climate change on plant nutrient‐use strategy. Here, green‐leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, N‐ and P‐resorption proficiency (the terminal N and P concentration in senescent leaves, NRP and PRP, respectively), and N‐ and P‐resorption efficiency (the proportional N and P withdrawn from senescent leaves prior to abscission, NRE and PRE, respectively) of <jats:italic>Leymus chinensis</jats:italic> (Trin.) Tzvel., a typical perennial grass species in northern China, were examined along a water supply gradient to explore how plant nutrient conservation responds to water change. Increasing water supply at low levels (&lt; 9000 mL/year) increased NRP, PRP and PRE, but decreased green‐leaf N concentration. It did not significantly affect green‐leaf P concentration or NRE. By contrast, all N and P conservation indicators were not significantly influenced at high water supply levels (&gt; 9000 mL/year). These results indicated that changes in water availability at low levels could affect leaf‐level nutrient characteristics, especially for the species in semiarid ecosystems. Therefore, global changes in precipitation may pose effects on plant nutrient economy, and thus on nutrient cycling in the plant‐soil systems.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

These processes can be simulated, however, as internal flow and solute transport components within a fully integrated groundwater–surface water model. A methodology has been developed and incorporated into the MODHMS fully integrated surface–subsurface modeling framework to enable evaluation of water distribution and application and impacts to water quality on surface and subsurface domains. This methodology allows the supply and delivery of water and associated water quality to be a part of the model solution rather than being predetermined boundary conditions to the system. Furthermore, this methodology handles temporal and spatial changes to land use and water quality and associated effects on outdoor water distribution, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration properties that are related to surface cover or land use classifications. This new methodology was applied to a portion of the Upper Santa Clara River system and underlying groundwater basins of southern California to aid in the evaluation of a Cl<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> total maximum daily load (TMDL) study. The outcome of this modeling evaluation has led to an enhanced understanding of how Cl<jats:sup>−</jats:sup> is transported throughout the surface–subsurface model domain and improved collaboration among stakeholders.

Application of N at 150 to 188 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> to ryegrass increased dry matter yield and N uptake of aboveground forage and stubble (i.e., stubble, crown, and large root) tissue. Delaying plow‐down from early September to early November increased dry matter yield and N uptake of stubble tissue, but not aboveground forage. Apparent recovery of applied N in harvested forage and stubble tissue averaged 55 and 12%, respectively. High N application to the ryegrass increased soil N supply to the subsequent unfertilized potato crop as indicated by increased tuber yield, mean tuber weight, and plant (i.e., vines plus tubers) dry matter yield and N uptake. However, the increase in soil N supply (i.e., N uptake of unfertilized potato plants at vine desiccation) was small (&lt;20 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Apparent recovery of N applied to the ryegrass crop in unfertilized potato plants was low (10%). Delayed ryegrass plow‐down had no effect on soil N supply to the subsequent potato crop. Italian ryegrass green manure crop can be effective in increasing soil organic matter inputs but has limited short‐term effects on soil N supply for potato.</jats:p>",

Traditional planning methods for the professionals required to provide these services have given little consideration to changes in the needs of the populations they serve or to changes in the amount/types of services offered and the way they are delivered. In the absence of dynamic planning models that simulate alternative policies and test policy mixes for their relative effectiveness, planners have tended to rely on projecting prevailing or arbitrarily determined target provider—population ratios. A simulation model has been developed that addresses each of these shortcomings by simultaneously estimating the supply of and requirements for registered nurses based on the identification and interaction of the determinants. The model’s use is illustrated using data for Nova Scotia, Canada. </jats:p>",

Water samples were taken at four depths in this area, including subsurface, Secchi depth, euphotic/aphotic boundary and near the bottom of the lake. The variability of the reservoir’s limnological features defined two periods. Period 1, comprised of the summer months (October to April), was characterized by strong thermal stratification, nutrient limitation in the mixing layer, a metalimnetic biomass maximum and anoxia and high nutrient concentrations in the hypolimnion. Period 2, comprised of the winter months (May to September), was characterized by overturn events during which the phytoplankton population experienced light limitation. The observed water‐mixing regime was characteristic of warm monomictic system, presenting atelomixis, the incomplete vertical mixing of stratified water masses. The average total phosphorus and chlorophyll‐<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentrations suggested a meso‐eutrophic water system. The nutrient concentrations exhibited nitrogen and phosphorus limitation, suggesting that nutrients, rather than light, limit or regulate the phytoplankton biomass in the DBR for most of the year.</jats:p>",

The results of a survey of 131 firms suggest that the dimensions of institutional pressures (i.e., normative, mimetic, and coercive pressures) have differential effects on eSCM adoption intention. While mimetic pressures are not related to eSCM adoption intention, normative and coercive pressures are positively associated with eSCM adoption intention. In addition, organizational culture (i.e., flexibility orientation and control orientation) plays different roles in the relationships between these three dimensions of institutional pressures and eSCM adoption intention. While flexibility orientation negatively moderates the effects of coercive pressures and positively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures, control orientation positively moderates the effects of coercive and normative pressures and negatively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures.
