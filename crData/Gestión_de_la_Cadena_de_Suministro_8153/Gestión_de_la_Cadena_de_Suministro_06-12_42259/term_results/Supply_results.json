      "abstract": "<jats:p>The need of disinfecting potable water to eliminate potential health risks associated with waterborne pathogens, however inevitably resulting in leaving elevated toxicity in water by forming disinfection by-products (DBPs) is being considered as one of the primary threats to human well-being. Bromate is a carcinogenic DBP mainly formed during ozonation of bromide-containing water. The current maximum contaminant level (MCL) of bromate in the US national primary drinking water standard is set at 10 μg/L. With continuous improvements in analytical instrumentation and removal technologies, a lower MCL for bromate is expected in the future. Current researches on bromate control strategies involve minimizing bromate formation (like ammonia addition) or removing bromate after formation (like carbon adsorption), however have their own limitations. Seeking for alternative bromate control strategies that can be used alone (or in combine with others) is of great value and in urgent need when water quality standards are getting more stringent. This paper reviews the occurrence of bromate in water supply and evaluates the effectiveness of bromate removal technologies applied, to advance our understanding of bromate fate and degradation in water supply system for future study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The United States Coast Guard (USCG), now part of the Department of Homeland Security, has the mission to secure the U.S. coastline using a combination of air and sea capabilities. This paper focuses on an application of operations research techniques at the USCG to improve the performance of its aircraft service parts supply chain. We focused on evaluating the supply chain benefits from linking the aircraft maintenance database with the aircraft parts inventory database. This required us to (a) develop an approach to link the databases and (b) use aircraft maintenance information to improve the inventory management of service parts at the USCG. We first used mathematical programming tools to merge the maintenance database with the demand database. We then developed state-dependent supply replenishment policies that use part-age information to manage the service parts supply chain. We show that one of the proposed policies permits analytic estimation of the benefits of linking the data sets. The impact of these inventory policies was evaluated using empirical demand data for 41 critical parts over a five-year period. Computational results suggest that our proposed policies can lead to significant reductions in inventory cost over the current system, as high as 70% for some parts. Based on the insights from this study, the USCG is currently contracting with commercial vendors to develop an operational database and decision-support implementation across all parts. </jats:p>",

A total of 5 batches of samples, which included influent, effluent, supernatant and sludge from the respective aerobic and anoxic tanks were collected over the span. They were investigated by using the developed solid-phase extraction (SPE) protocol coupled with a modified yeast-based estrogen screen (YES) assay. From the results, it could be seen that M MBR demonstrated the best endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) removal efficiency. The fate and behavior of EDCs in MBR systems were fairly understood with estrogenic activity formation dominating in the anoxic tank and removal dominating in the aerobic tank. It is believed that the sorption of EDCs onto the sludge as well as biodegradation of EDCs might be the key mechanisms for the EDCs removal. The low response of YES when dealing with influent samples was mainly due to the inhibition and antagonist effects induced by the influent samples on yeast cells.</jats:p>",

Two microfiltration membrane modules with pore sizes of 0.22 μm and 0.1 μm were applied to investigate the effects of membrane pore size on the virus rejection. The MBR with these modules could reject virus in a range of 2.6–5.1 logs. The experimental results showed that the mechanisms of virus removal in the MBR involved rejection and inactivation. The virus rejection depended mainly on the dynamic layer on the membrane surface (not membrane itself) because virus rejection by the membrane modules with pore sizes of 0.1 μm and 0.22 μm were similar. The microbial activity and the aeration oxidation were the two important factors for the virus inactivation. It was found that the inactivation of coliphage f2 was much more rapidly in activated sludge mixed liquor than in clean water, and the effect of aeration was significant.</jats:p>",

Cet article propose d’étudier les facteurs-clés qui ont fait émerger le concept de Supply Chain Management, et d’analyser, à travers deux études monographiques, le processus de changement des organisations industrielles.

Mutagenicity and genotoxicity have been frequently detected in the tributary rivers of Yodo River, and novel contaminants such as phenylbenzotriazole type mutagens, nitrated PAHs, and heterocyclic amines have been suggested to be the causative agents. The contribution of nonsubstituted PAHs to the toxicity is considered to be low since only few ng/l of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene have been found in the river waters. The application of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependent bioassay in evaluating the combined toxicity caused by various pollutants in environmental samples is also introduced. Point and non-point sources of pollution discharging into the Lake Biwa-Yodo River System, including treated sewage effluents and deposited road particles, have been investigated using the AhR-dependent reporter gene assay. The results suggested the presence of newly identified AhR ligands such as anthraquinone dyes or unidentified AhR ligands in the treated sewage effluents and the road particles, respectively. Finally, toxic effects of PAHs that are mediated via AhR binding are also summarized.</jats:p>",

The SEC fractions corresponding to the high MW region were concentrated with nitrogen sparging and characterized by negative ion electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The SEC–UV chromatograms and SEC–ESI-MS spectra show that coagulation greatly reduced the formation of high MW DBPs. It is of note that phosphate from the buffer could affect the ESI-MS characterization in 2–3 SEC fractions although most of the phosphate had been removed by UF.</jats:p>",

In the second step granular sludge was cultivated to get a high PHB volumetric productivity. The PHB content of sludge increased to 43.1±2.0% in the first step. During the sludge granulation, the PHB content was constant at 40±4.6%. With the granulation, the settling ability of the PHB-rich sludge continuously improved, as evidenced by a decreased sludge volume index. The matured PHB-rich granular sludge presented a buff color and regular morphology with elliptical and flat shape.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to describe geographic proximity, quantify variation in supply, and estimate pediatric population increments that are needed to support providers across pediatric subspecialties.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHODS. Data from the American Board of Pediatrics and the Claritas Pop-Facts Database were used to calculate subspecialty-specific straight-line distances between each zip code and the nearest board-certified subspecialist. These data sources also were used to estimate the percentage of hospital referral regions with providers and calculate physician-to-population ratios for each of 16 pediatric medical subspecialties. Coefficients of variation for the ratios were used to assess intraspecialty variation in supply across markets. Estimates of the pediatric population that is needed to support an initial or additional physician in a market were generated using subspecialty-specific ordered logit analyses.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS. The population-weighted average distance to a subspecialist ranged from 15 miles for neonatology to 78 miles for pediatric sports medicine. For most pediatric subspecialties, more than two thirds of children live within 40 miles of a certified physician. For 7 of 16 of pediatric subspecialties, fewer than one half of hospital referral regions have a provider. Coefficients of variation vary across subspecialties and are lowest for neonatology at 76% and greatest for pediatric sports medicine at 287%. Pediatric population thresholds likewise vary with a tendency toward lower thresholds for procedural specialties, such as cardiology and critical care medicine.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSIONS. The practice locations of pediatric subspecialists parallel the geographic distribution of children in the United States, yet many hospital referral regions lack pediatric subspecialists and coefficients of variation vary widely across subspecialties. These findings suggest that either the supply of pediatric subspecialists is inadequate, pediatric subspecialists are distributed inequitably, or the market for pediatric subspecialists is larger than the hospital referral regions. Furthermore, population thresholds for many cognitive pediatric subspecialties are high; the extent to which high thresholds reflect low disease prevalence versus other factors, such as inadequate reimbursement, is not established.</jats:p>",

Such effluent quality with appropriate disinfection could meet the requirement for wastewater reuse for various urban usages. The acceptable MLSS level was identified not greater than 5 g/L in order to secure the effluent quality, when the maximum permeate flux of 1.5 m3/m2·day and daily backwash are applied.

To confirm the modeling prediction, an experiment with a traditional A2/O process was initiated. The experimental results were qualitatively in agreement with the modeling prediction. The minimal COD/P ratio required for the effluent standard (1 mg P/L) could be lowered from 35 to 25 with a stripping ratio of 20% at a phosphate recovery efficiency of 34%, which means a COD saving of 25–30% in bio-P removal. A practical experiment for phosphate recovery in a WWTP identified that HAP was a major form of precipitated compounds and that MAP was a minor form. Due to the higher contents of Ca2 +  and Mg2 +  in the influent to the WWTP (with groundwater mainly used for portable water), it was unnecessary to dose any extra chemicals for phosphate precipitation, and a pH value increased to ≥9 in the supernatant was all to be done.</jats:p>",

The bromate removal capacity, obtained from migration of concentration profiles, was observed to decrease with increases in flow rate. In the case that 20 wt-% iron was replaced by sands, the bromate removal capacity increased, but, on the contrary, the bromate removal capacity inevitably decreased when the weight percentage was increased by two times. Dissolved oxygen played a minor role in decreasing the bromate removal capacity, this decreasing effect only prevailed near the proximal end of depassivating irons. The bromate removal capacity increased in the presence of 100 mg/L sulfate concentration but decreased when the sulfate concentration further increased. When comparing the effect on removal capacity for phosphate and sulfate, the inhibiting effect of phosphate on the bromate removal capacity was larger. Lastly, the removal capacity increased with increasing bicarbonate concentration, which may due to the formation of aqueous complexes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, the performance of the full-scale RO process with highly permeable membranes and the governing mechanisms were carefully studied. It was found that the performance of a full-scale RO process could be controlled by two possible mechanisms, namely mass transfer rate and thermodynamic limitations. Under relatively low driving pressure, it was controlled by mass transfer rate (water flux) of the membrane. However, with the highly permeable membrane, it is possible that the performance is limited by the thermodynamic limitation, in which the osmotic pressure becomes equal to the driving pressure inside of the membrane channel. A process controlled by thermodynamic limitation is an extremely case of the hydraulic imbalance problem. When it occurs, it means part of the membranes in the processes do not contribute to permeate production. More complicated are situations in the intermediate pressure range, in which both mechanisms contribute to, but none of them can dominate, the performance of the process.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Some innovative concepts and theories on the performance of the full-scale RO processes were developed. These concepts and theories may provide better qualitative explanations for the behaviors often observed in the full-scale RO processes. A better quantitative simulations or predictions of the performance of the process were developed upon these concepts and theories. Experiments were carried out on a pilot membrane process of 6 m membrane channel to imitate the performance of the full-scale RO under various conditions. The experimental performance data were compared with theoretical simulations and excellent agreement was obtained.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Another focus of this current study was on characterization and modeling of membrane fouling in the full-scale RO process. Colloidal fouling experiments were conducted to study the fouling potential of feed water and a new fouling indicator was proposed. The indicator can be directly used in the mathematical model to simulate fouling development in the full-scale RO processes. Model simulations showed that under certain condition (thermodynamic restriction), the recovery or average permeate flux of a full-scale RO process would maintain a constant value even membrane fouling was taking place. Experimental verification of the simulation results is currently under way. With the new developments and findings in this area, methods or protocols for optimization of full-scale processes of the highly permeable RO membranes were suggested.</jats:p>",

Demand for the products during a selling season is both price sensitive and uncertain. Each of the n manufacturers faces the problem of choosing a production quantity and a selling price for his product. Two settings are considered, regarding the decision sequence of the n manufacturers: They are either simultaneous or sequential. The retailer, when present, employs a consignment-sales contract with revenue sharing to bind her relationship with the manufacturers and to extract profit for herself. Using a multiplicative demand model in this paper, we fully characterize individual firms’ decisions in equilibria, under each of the two game settings, and derive closed-form performance measures, both for the channel and for individual channel members. These closed-form solutions allow us to explore the effects of channel structure and parameters on firms’ decisions and performance that lead to conclusions of managerial interest. </jats:p>",

Both backwash waters showed different properties. However, the characteristics of each backwash water did not vary considerably among samples taken during different time. Results from jar tests indicated that both polyaluminium chloride (PACl) and alum could result in effective removal of turbidity. Both DOC and absorbance of UV254 decreased slightly with increasing coagulant dosage. In continuous operation of backwash water recycle in pilot study in CHWTP, it was found that treated water quality was not affected by two different modes of recycle: intermittent recycle at ratio of 1:7 (backwash water:raw water) and continuous recycle at ratio of 1:42. In the pilot study in SSWTP, no impact was found on the introduction of backwash water at recycle ratio of 4, 6 and 8%, regardless of whether the backwash water was recycled directly or went through 3 min pre-sedimentation before it is recycled. Further study on the impact of typhoon on treatment and recycle of backwash water was recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presented the current state of our understanding of the roles of carboxylic and phenolic groups in NOM adsorption and reviewed the contradictory opinions in the literatures. Previous studies carried out by other researchers indicated that aromatic carboxylates were adsorbed onto metal (hydr)oxides via outer-sphere complexes under most conditions and phenolic groups were very crucial for formation of inner-sphere complexes between organic acids and metal (hydr)oxides. Adsorption test with in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopic investigation were carried out to verify the role of aromatic carboxylic and phenolic groups in the NOM adsorption onto aluminium hydroxide surfaces by using a series of aromatic carboxylic acids and dihydroxybenzoic acids as the surrogate of NOM. Our studies suggested that the formation of outer-sphere complexes dominated the adsorption of most of the aromatic carboxylates over the pH range of 5–9; inner-sphere complexes were only detected at some pH levels for some aromatic carboxylates adsorption; and the aromatic carboxylates were most likely to be adsorbed to the first surface layer of hydroxyl groups and water molecules without forming coordinative bonds with the aluminium hydroxide surfaces but strong hydrogen bonds were formed in this process. Our study also revealed that (1) the presence of phenolic groups can increase the interaction strength of carboxylate groups with aluminium hydroxide; (2) chelate formation involving a carboxylate oxygen atom and ortho-phenolic-oxygen is important for the adsorption of organic matter on aluminium hydroxide at acidic pH; and 3) the phenolic groups adjacent to each other are more important than the carboxylic groups at alkaline pH for organic matter adsorption.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the secondary and tertiary effluent had no significant effects on the crop qualities. However, irrigation with the sewage could lead to increase parts of nutrient components in the crops. Irrigation with the sewage caused accumulation of nitrate and heavy metals in the crops, indicating that sewage was not suitable for irrigation.

After an operation of 72 d, the bioreactor reached at steady state with ammonia and nitrite removal percentages higher than 95%. During operation, the sludge granulated in the reactor. The morphology and internal structure of sludge granules changed conspicuously, the density increased while the color changed from khaki to red. The average granular diameter grew from 1.2 to 3.69 mm, and its settling velocity accelerated from 107.68 to 118.49 m/h. Sludge granulation improved the tolerance to hydraulic shock loading, and reduced sludge washout (TSS &amp;lt; 0.028 g/L). The dominant bacterial communities (filamentous and cocci) in nitrifying activated sludge were replaced by irregular shaped ANAMMOX bacterial species gradually. An increase of ANAMMOX rate was achieved with the increasing granular diameter. SBR is a useful reactor to cultivate ANAMMOX granular sludge, while granular ANAMMOX sludge thus developed can be used as seeding sludge in a pilot-scale or full scale wastewater treatment plant.</jats:p>",

In addition to human excreta, the sanitary concerns of livestock excreta are recently growing due to control the domestic-animal-related diseases such as bird flu. In order to address those problems, this study examines the vacuum truck-collection system combined with urine-faeces diversion for peri-urban and rural areas. In the system, the diverted faeces and livestock excreta are fermented, and urine is directly used and/or phosphorus in urine is recovered by struvite formation. Firstly, each treatment and recovery is examined from the technological aspects. Secondly, the methane and struvite production in the system is calculated. As a result, the fermentation was considered to proceeds easily compared to traditional mixed excreta fermentations, and nutrient in urine could be easily recovered in the system. In addition, the system produces methane of 1,107 Nm3-CH4 per day, struvite of 51.9 ton-P2O5 per year for a population of 100,000 with 5,000 pigs and 20,000 chickens.</jats:p>",

Australian veterinary schools, like others internationally, are being challenged by the relevance of material in current curricula for modern food-supply veterinary medicine. Additionally, student aspirations are a major issue, as curriculum designers balance companion-animal training with the herd/flock-based issues that focus on productivity and profitability. One of the challenges is to examine the relative balance of education in generic skills (self-knowledge, change management, teamwork, leadership, negotiation) with more technically or scientifically based education. An ongoing process of curriculum review and renewal, which involves input from both external and internal stakeholders and allows regular review and assessment, is needed to ensure continuing curriculum relevance. </jats:p>",

An ion chromatography–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system was used for simultaneous determination of As(III) and As(V). A reduction of arsenate (As(V)) to arsenite (As(III)) was observed in the unfiltered simulated raw waters (USW). The As(V) reduction to As(III) did not occur in the simulated waters that passed through a 0.2 μm membrane (FSW). Microorganism activities is probably the major reason causing As(V) reduction in the USW. In the FSW without NOM, As(III) tended to be oxidized into As(V). The addition of 0.036 mM of Fe(II) significantly facilitated the oxidation. The presence of 10 mg/L Suwannee River NOM as C inhibited As(III) oxidation no matter whether Fe(II) existed or not. The experimental results suggest that NOM can mediate distribution of inorganic arsenic species in water, thus it is an important factor controlling the mobility and toxicity of arsenic in drinking water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Waste activated sludge (WAS) is more difficult to digest than primary sludge due to rate limiting cell hydrolysis. High-power ultrasound can effectively disintegrate the bacterial cells and thus enhance the subsequent digestion. This research examines the effectiveness of ultrasound pretreatment on WAS disintegration at different specific energy inputs, ultrasonic densities and total solids (TS) contents. The results show that the cut diameter (d50) for WAS with 2% TS content declined nearly 6.5-fold at an ultrasonic density of 0.67 W/ml. For higher TS contents of 4 and 6%, higher densities of 1.03 and 0.86 W/ml, respectively, were needed to achieve the same degree of particle size reduction. The efficacy of ultrasonic disintegration measured as soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) release was primarily governed by ultrasonic density (W/ml); whereas ultrasonic density did not show a significant effect on protein release at all TS levels. SCOD release of about 320 mg SCOD/g TS was obtained at a TS content of 2% and specific energy input of 5 kWs/gTS. The SCOD release, however, decreased to 160 and 90 mgSCOD/gTS at 4 and 6% TS contents, respectively. The highest protein release of 73 mg/gTS was obtained at a TS content of 2% and specific energy input of 10 kWs/gTS. The sludge disintegration efficiency declined significantly at higher TS content. Thus, there is a limiting TS concentration that could be effectively disintegrated by ultrasound, and this is governed by the capability of an ultrasonic unit in producing cavitation. The degree of disintegration also depends on types of ultrasonic unit used.</jats:p>",

It was found that the MBR process used 25% less of the oxygen and 40% less of the external carbon sources, compared to the conventional nitrification and denitrification process. The key feature of the MBR process is that it provides an environment more favorable for ammonia oxidation bacterium (AOB) than for nitrite oxidation bacterium (NOB) through controlling loading, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), and NH3 inhibition. Optimum operating condition was examined through continuous running of the pilot MBR, and it was found that a minimum HRT of 4.3 days and maximum ammonia loading of 0.6 kg N- NH4+ m3.d with pH 7–8.5, temperature 25–30 °C, and DO at 2 mg/L is favorable to AOB. Kinetic study was conducted to identify the characteristic of the microorganisms in the system. Measured Ks and μA,max of MBR sludge was 19.65 mg NH4-N/L (Temperature 25 °C, pH 8.5) and 0.26 d−1, respectively.</jats:p>",

Other notable instances of system‐wide disruption happened after the attack on the World Trade Center when all aircraft were grounded and the natural gas and crude‐oil pipelines were tangled by hurricanes in 2005. We model a situation where shutting down supply facilities is very difficult and expensive because of excessive inventory buildup from an inability to move out the production.

A high‐frequency constant current must be supplied to the feeder of noncontact energy transfer systems.

When there are two or more pick‐up coils on the feeder, the output of one pick‐up coil does not affect other pick‐up coils on the feeder if the feeder current is constant. We proposed use of an immittance converter to transform the high‐frequency constant‐voltage source into a high‐frequency constant‐current source.</jats:p><jats:p>“Immittance converter” is a combined form of “impedance‐admittance converter.” The immittance converter has input impedance that is proportional to the admittance of the load connected across output terminals.

Consequently, it converts a constant‐voltage source into a constant‐current source and a constant‐current source into a constant‐voltage source.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper contains descriptions of the configuration of the new high‐frequency constant‐current power supply for noncontact energy transfer system, output characteristics versus excessive reactance and small frequency deviations for different values of the duty factor.

Proteins are the predominant components in EPS and influence hydrophobicity and flocculation of sludge.

A highly reproducible 2-DGE protocol was developed achieving &amp;gt;95% of protein spots matches in repeated runs. Results also showed that proteins of EPS obtained from the activated sludge displayed a similar protein pattern between pH 4-7 with molecular weight 10-80 kD. Protein profiles of EPS extracted from activated sludge fed glucose and acetate showed similar distribution patterns for proteins, but further separation of proteins between pH 4-7 revealed distinctive differences between the specific proteins from these two carbon sources. In addition, information of 2-DGE protein profiles indicates little relationship between the physical and chemical analyses. It is apparent that 2-DGE is a much more powerful and a very useful tool in studying metabolisms of microbial communities at the level of metaproteomics.</jats:p>",

For high air supply pressure, large bearing clearance, and a relatively small bearing outer radius, it was believed that shock waves are caused and that a complex fluid flow structure is formed in the bearing clearance. Accordingly, analytical models based on the occurrence of shock wave in the bearing clearance have been proposed. Recently, very small aerostatic bearings have been used in various machine devices where the pressure distribution near the air inlets has a large influence on the bearing characteristics due to a short distance between air inlets and the bearing edge. In order to predict various bearing characteristics accurately for these kinds of bearings, a proper analytical model has to be established. However, it is very difficult to obtain the detailed information about the flow structure from flow visualization because of a very thin bearing clearance. Therefore, we calculated the flow field using computational fluid dynamics, which can solve the Navier-Stokes equations directly. It was found that the airflow just after entering the bearing clearance becomes turbulent in a region where relatively rapid pressure recovery occurs and that no shock wave is generated at the boundary between subsonic and supersonic flow. In addition, the numerical results presented show good agreement with experimental data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past century, reductions in animal diseases have resulted in a safer, more uniform, and more economical food supply. In the United States, the passage of the 1906 Federal Meat Inspection Act mandated better sanitary conditions for slaughter and processing, as well as inspection of live animals and their processed products. Following World War II, Congress passed the Poultry Products Inspection Act. Both acts are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for regulations governing the health of live animals prior to slaughter. This article is a brief overview of the ways in which the current predominance of zoonotics among emerging diseases underscores the importance of veterinary health professionals and the need for continued coordination between animal-health and public-health officials. Examples of intersections between animal- and public-health concerns include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and Johne's disease, as well as extending beyond food safety to diseases such as avian influenza (AI). In the United States, we have in place an extensive public and private infrastructure to address animal-health issues, including the necessary expertise and resources to address animal-health emergencies. However, many challenges remain, including a critical shortage of food-animal veterinarians. These challenges can be met by recruiting and training a cadre of additional food-supply veterinarians, pursuing new technologies, collaborating with public-health officials to create solutions, and sending a clear and consistent message to the public about important animal-health issues. </jats:p>",

We find significant decreases in employment rates and labour supply. Those who remain employed beyond the pensionable age are more likely to work in jobs with flexible hours of work, and work even fewer hours than people in similar jobs who are not pension age‐eligible. Our results suggest that governments do need to consider the labour supply related incentives provided via its various welfare programmes.</jats:p>",

The data is used to test hypotheses developed from supply chain management theory in order to determine whether the phenomena detailed in the theory can be observed in practice. Few significant influences between a strategic orientation and actual supply chain implementation were found. Most notably, a company's commitment to supply chain management impacts its strategic orientation, which in turn significantly influences the supply chain's stability and the firm's independence from partners. However, at least for the sample observed, companies appear to be far removed from the strategic and systemic perspective of supply chain management proposed by researchers when evaluating current supply chain management implementation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study focused on the evaluation of performance and mechanisms of a high-rate algal pond system (HRAP System) in nitrogen and phosphorus removal for rural domestic sewage treatment. A pilot scale HRAP System was located at Yangzhu Village, Jiangsu Province, east China, with treatment processes including a septic tank, two stages of HRAPs and an aquatic pond. Results showed that the HRAP System had a good performance in nutrient removal, especially in NH+4-N removal. Total removal efficiencies of COD, TN, NH+4-N and TP were 80, 51.8, 90.2 and 52.1%, respectively. About 61.6% of NH+4-N in the 1st-stage HRAP and 70.9% in the 2nd-stage HRAP were transformed into NO−3-N and NO2−-N through nitrification, and the nitrogen losses via ammonia volatilization was only 2.7% (for 1st-stage HRAP) and 8.8% (for 2nd-stage HRAP). The other 35.7% and 20.3% of NH+4-N removal were achieved by algae assimilation respectively. About 98.0% (for 1st-stage HRAP) and 84.8% (for 2nd-stage HRAP) removal of TN were attributed to algae sedimentation, while those through ammonia volatilization were only 2.0% (for 1st-stage HRAP) and 15.4% (for 2nd-stage HRAP), respectively. Therefore, the main mechanisms of NH+4-N removal in HRAP were nitrification and algae assimilation, and TN was mainly removed by algae sedimentation. About 50.7% (for 1st-stage HRAP) and 53.1% (for 2nd-stage HRAP) of phosphorus in the deposit were organic phosphates respectively, only 20.7% and 27.7% were calcium-bound and magnesium-bound phosphates. The removal mechanism of TP in HRAP could be mainly attributed to algae assimilation in forms of organic phosphate, and chemical precipitation in forms of calcium-bound and magnesium-bound.</jats:p>",

From 1988 to 2000 a multiple veterinary school consortium approach to food-animal production medicine (FAPM) teaching was conducted to handle regional differences in case load, faculty strengths, and student interests. Six universities developed a memorandum of understanding to provide a wide variety of in-depth, species-specific clinical experiences in FAPM to balance their individual strengths and weakness in addressing food-animal agriculture, to provide for student exchange and faculty development, and to conduct research in food safety. Changes in leadership, redirection of funds, failure to publicize the program to faculty and students, and a focus on research as opposed to teaching led to dissolution of the consortium. However, this approach could work to improve recruitment and retention of students in FSVM if it focused on student exchange, fostered a more integrated curriculum across schools, encouraged faculty involvement, garnered institutional support, and used modern technology in teaching. Private veterinary practices as well as public/corporate practices could be integrated into a broader food-animal curriculum directed at building competency among FSVM students by providing the in-depth training they require. Requirements for the success of this type of program will include funding, marketing, leadership, communication, coordination, integration, and dedicated people with the time to make it work. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The future demand for and potential shortages of food-supply veterinarians have been the subject of much concern. Using the Delphi forecasting method in a three-phase Web-based survey process, a panel of experts identified the trends and issues shaping the demand for and supply of academic food-animal veterinarians, then forecasted the likely future demand and shortages of food-supply veterinarians employed in academic institutions in the United States and Canada through 2016. The results indicate that there will be increasing future demand and persistent shortages of academic food-supply veterinarians unless current trends are countered with targeted, strategic action. The Delphi panel also evaluated the effectiveness of several strategies for reversing current trends and increasing the number of food-supply veterinarians entering into academic careers. Academic food-supply veterinarians are a key link in the system that produces food-supply veterinarians for all sectors (private practice, government service, etc.); shortages in the academic sector will amplify shortages wherever food-supply veterinarians are needed. Even fairly small shortages have significant public-health, food-safety, animal-welfare, and bio-security implications. Recent events demonstrate that in an increasingly interconnected global economic food supply system, national economies and public health are at risk unless an adequate supply of appropriately trained food-supply veterinarians is available to counter a wide variety of threats ranging from animal and zoonotic diseases to bioterrorism. </jats:p>",

While demand has slowed in recent years due to major changes in the way information is disseminated and accessed, in terms of both volume and revenue the British Library remains the world's largest document supplier, and the centralized service remains an invaluable underpin to the UK information infrastructure and retains widespread support from customers and stakeholders, invaluable and essential in terms of sustaining the breadth of access to journal articles. The paper also focuses on the external drivers of change and current developments in the service. </jats:p>",

In aerobic heart, the preferred substrates are always free fatty acids, and workload‐induced increase in their oxidation is observed at unchanged global levels of ATP, phosphocreatine and AMP. Here, we evaluate the mechanisms of regulation of substrate supply for mitochondrial respiration in muscle cells, and show that a system approach is useful also for revealing mechanisms of feedback signalling within the network of substrate oxidation and particularly for explaining the role of malonyl‐CoA in regulation of fatty acid oxidation in cardiac muscle. This approach shows that a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation is the energy demand. Alterations in malonyl‐CoA would not be the reason for, but rather the consequence of, the increased fatty acid oxidation at elevated workloads, when the level of acetyl‐CoA decreases due to shifts in the kinetics of the Krebs cycle. This would make malonyl‐CoA a feedback regulator that allows acyl‐CoA entry into mitochondrial matrix space only when it is needed. Regulation of malonyl‐CoA levels by AMPK does not seem to work as a master on–off switch, but rather as a modulator of fatty acid import.</jats:p>",

First, we develop a theoretical framework that examines the effects of ECHI on the labor supply response to a health shock, which suggests that women with ECHI are less likely to reduce their labor supply in response to a health shock, relative to women with health insurance through their spouse's employer. Second, we empirically examine this relationship based on labor supply responses to breast cancer. We find that health shocks decrease labor supply to a greater extent among women insured by their spouse's policy than among women with health insurance through their own employer, suggesting that ECHI creates incentives to remain working when faced with a serious illness.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Product recovery operations in reverse supply chains face rapidly changing demand due to the increasing number of product offerings with reduced lifecycles. Therefore, capacity planning becomes a strategic issue of major importance for the profitability of closed‐loop supply chains. This work studies a closed‐loop supply chain with remanufacturing and presents dynamic capacity planning policies developed through the methodology of System Dynamics. The key issue of the paper is how the lifecycles and return patterns of various products affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The model can be used to identify effective policies, to conduct various “what‐if” analyses, and to answer questions about the long‐term profitability of reverse supply chains with remanufacturing. The results of numerical examples with quite different lifecycle and return patterns show how the optimal collection expansion/contraction and remanufacturing contraction policies depend on the lifecycle type and the average usage time of the product, while the remanufacturing capacity expansion policy is not significantly affected by these factors. The results also show that the collection and remanufacturing capacity policies are insensitive to the total product demand. The insensitivity of the optimal policies to total demand is a particularly appealing feature of the proposed model, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate demand forecasts. </jats:p>",

The JoinPoint Regression Program and exponentially weighted moving average charts (EWMA) were used to assess the timing of any statistically significant changes in prevalence.

The EWMA chart flagged a significant decrease in the fourth quarter of 1998. The JoinPoint graph had one change in slope, with a significant quarterly percent change (−0.34) between 1996 and 2002. The decline in orofacial clefts occurred in non‐Hispanic Whites but not other racial/ethnic groups, nonsmokers but not women who reported smoking during pregnancy, and women who received prenatal care in the first trimester but not women who began receiving care later in pregnancy.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION:</jats:title><jats:p>Folic acid fortification in the United States was associated with a small decrease in orofacial cleft prevalence, with the timing of the decline consistent with the introduction of fortification.

Two pairs of 120‐ and 180‐day‐old twin female lambs with a bodyweight of 18.2–19.0 kg were kept in metabolism crates and fed on purine‐free milk replacement (MR) with supplements of exogenous purine (purine base or purine nucleoside) at a level of 0.2 mmol/BW<jats:sup>0.75</jats:sup>/d for 5 consecutive days, and thereafter they were maintained in the crates for 4 days. The daily amount of exogenous purine supply was calculated based on the urinary excreted purine derivatives (PD) in lambs fed on milk replacement alone. A urine sample was collected daily for 9 consecutive days, and the urinary excretion of PD was determined daily. Urinary PD excretion opened to increase within 24 h after the dose of purine bases, and the level was recovered on 3 days after ceasing the exogenous purine supply. The recovery of PD in the urine was about 70% of the purine supplement. When purine nucleosides were added to the feed, urinary PD excretion was initiated within 24 h after dosing, and the values were recovered after ending the purine nucleoside supply. The recovery rate of PD in the urine was only 30% of the supplemented purine. The plasma allantoin levels were almost similar after feeding purine bases and purine nucleosides, and the values were mostly in the range (40–60 µmol/L). These findings indicate that an exogenous purine can be directly incorporated into the body, and the purine as nucleoside is more effectively utilized for the synthesis of nucleic acids than as a purine base in the body of growing lambs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this study was to compare the training stimuli of eccentric (lengthening) and concentric (shortening) contractions regarding the effect on signaling enzymes involved in protein synthesis. Ten male subjects performed 4 × 6 maximal eccentric contractions on one leg followed by 4 × 6 maximal concentric contractions on the other. Six additional subjects performed the same protocol, but with maximal concentric and submaximal eccentric exercise of equal force to that of the maximal concentric contractions. Muscle biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis before, immediately after, and 1 and 2 h after exercise in both legs. The average peak force produced during the maximal eccentric exercise was 31% higher than during the maximal concentric exercise, 2,490 (±100) vs. 1,894 (±108) N ( P &lt; 0.05). The maximal eccentric contractions led to two- to eightfold increases in the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70<jats:sup>S6k</jats:sup>) and the ribosomal protein S6 that persisted for 2 h into recovery but no significant changes in phosphorylation of Akt or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Maximal concentric and submaximal eccentric contractions did not induce any significant changes in Akt, mTOR, p70<jats:sup>S6k</jats:sup>, or S6 phosphorylation up to 2 h after the exercise. The results indicate that one session of maximal eccentric contractions activates p70<jats:sup>S6k</jats:sup> in human muscle via an Akt-independent pathway and suggest that maximal eccentric contractions are more effective than maximal concentric contractions in stimulating protein synthesis in the absence of a nutritional intake, an effect that may be mediated through a combination of greater tension and stretching of the muscle. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Assessments of global warming mitigation technologies are important for achieving the Kyoto target and planning post‐Kyoto regimes. Regional differences in energy resources, growth in energy consumption, current technology diffusions, etc., should be considered in the assessments. A global energy systems model, DNE21+, with high regional resolution had treated the energy supply sectors in a bottom‐up fashion and the end‐use sectors in a top‐down fashion, which was expressed by using long‐term price elasticity. However, the assessments of technological options in the end‐use sectors are currently more important, particularly for the near and middle terms. In order to evaluate the technological options not only in the energy supply sectors but also in the end‐use sectors for energy savings and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emission reductions, DNE21+ has been modified for treating two energy‐intensive end‐use sectors, i.e. steel and cement sectors, in the bottom‐up fashion. The results reveal that the cost‐effective global CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emission reductions in 2030 for stabilizing the atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>concentration at 550 ppmv in comparison with that in the reference case would be approximately 68 MtC/yr and almost zero in the steel and cement sectors, respectively. The cost‐effective options include next‐generation coke ovens and coke dry quenching (CDQ) in the steel sector. Copyright © 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The assessment is based on monitoring of suspended solids concentrations in the reservoir's primary tributary, detailed vertical profiles of optical backscattering (a surrogate measure of light scattering) in the reservoir water column, and analysis of sediment trap collections, over a seven‐month interval of high runoff. These impacts are reported to be tightly temporally coupled and strongly positively related to the magnitude of runoff events. The primary tributary entered the reservoir as a plunging inflow during runoff events, causing conspicuous subsurface peaks in light scattering, with vertical patterns that varied strongly for different events. Deposition quantified by near‐bottom trap deployments is reported to be more representative than results from metalimnetic deployments that were generally within, rather than below, the turbid layers. Direct inputs of sediment, transported by density currents, are found to drive deposition, rather than resuspension/redeposition. More than 50 percent of the reported deposition occurred in less than 15 percent of the study period, associated with the four largest runoff events.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> This article tests the thesis of supply-induced demand in the German hospital sector. The empirical investigation described makes use of comprehensive data and represents the first time this has been done for Germany. A cross-section analysis is performed at the level of geographical planning regions. At this level the hospital data encompass the whole population and distinguish ten different medical specialities. 13 different economic and social variables are analysed in a system of simultaneous equations. The result shows that the supply of treatment capacity has a positive influence on the demand for hospital treatments, the number of patients treated per 100,000 population rising with bed density. Alternative explanations for this phenomenon are also checked, without result. No correlation can be found between morbidity and the number of hospital cases in any given region. Although hospital bed density is found to depend on the number of hospital cases per head of population, this is no proof of the reverse causality, as this result can be traced back to the strategy behind the existing hospital planning. The validity of Roemer’s Law in Germany is likely to be (at least partially) due to this existing hospital planning. This is because the prevailing hospital planning procedure is distorted, indicating a higher need for hospital beds where bed density is already high. Given this situation, and the results of the regression analysis, it would seem appropriate to consider abolishing the hospital planning system and radically reducing the density of hospital beds.</jats:p>",

However, even the combination of these two methods is still less discriminatory than IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>fingerprinting. Here, we define an optimized set of MIRU-VNTR loci with a significantly higher discriminatory power. The resolution and the stability/robustness of 29 loci were analyzed, using a total of 824 tubercle bacillus isolates, including representatives of the main lineages identified worldwide so far. Five loci were excluded for lack of robustness and/or stability in serial isolates or isolates from epidemiologically linked patients. The use of the 24 remaining loci increased the number of types by 40%—and by 23% in combination with spoligotyping—among isolates from cosmopolitan origins, compared to those obtained with the original set of 12 loci. Consequently, the clustering rate was decreased by fourfold—by threefold in combination with spoligotyping—under the same conditions. A discriminatory subset of 15 loci with the highest evolutionary rates was then defined that concentrated 96% of the total resolution obtained with the full 24-locus set. Its predictive value for evaluating<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>transmission was found to be equal to that of IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism typing, as shown in a companion population-based study.
