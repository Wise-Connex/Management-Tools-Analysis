      "abstract": "<jats:p>The history of interlending since 1945 is inseparable from changes taking place in the infrastructure of library and information services and from progressive innovation in communications technology. Three phases of development can be discerned. In the first interlending based on linking individual library services through the NCL/RB system and supplemented by co‐operative acquisition schemes is paralleled by the rise of a national centralized lending service to science and technology. Expansion of library services in the academic and public sectors in the second phase gives rise to co‐operative schemes including interlending to meet specific needs. The successful and progressive development of the NLLST influences traditional interlending modes and the period closes with a rationalization of the national library structure and of the public library system for the next phase of development. This takes place against growing economic restraints and is one of integration and extension of the centralized lending services of the British Library Lending Division and a reassessment of regional connections. The innovative force of computerization is taken up at regional level by LASER and nationally by the British Library Lending Division. Such developments are intrinsic to the considerations of the LISC report Working together. This will form the basis of an evolutionary approach to national co‐ordination and co‐operation in which interlending is fundamental to an access strategy of library and information services.</jats:p>",

Ten experiments have been selected for support: TRANSDOC; Electronic Publishing of Patent Information; EURODOCDEL; The Electronic Magazine; Electronic Journals in Chemistry; a CEA proposal to place a mathematical journal online with Questel; two electronic newsletters in the fields of information technology and the information industry; a project to devise standardized methods for handling complex texts and difficult character sets within an integrated electronic publishing system; a proposal to create a system which will reduce the costs of printing low volumes of scientific documents; and a network of electronic invisible colleges for the rapid circulation of grey literature and pre‐published material. The experiments have raised several issues of concern, one of which is standards. CEC will identify these areas, draft standards and encourage their early adoption. Another area of concern is the need to build up experience of microcomputers on international public data networks. A full evaluation programme of the experiments will be undertaken by an independent team over a period of at least 15 months.</jats:p>",

It links the traditional regression based forecasting techniques to real‐time data acquired by systems such as the Soil Conservation Service SNOTEL and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Hydromet networks. The concept is based on interpolating between the forecast values obtained by using real‐time data in the forecast equations that bracket the real time. Different interpolation procedures were examined and the procedure for calculating confidence intervals about the forecast estimates is developed. The entire conceptual procedure is demonstrated using data from the Reynolds Creek, Idaho, experimental watershed maintained by the USDA‐ARS Northwest Watershed Research Center in Boise, Idaho.</jats:p>",
