One of the difficulties in designing and analysing a supply chain is that its processes are governed by the strategic attributes of the supply chain. In order to evaluate the alternatives that provide the route of performance improvement in a supply chain, an analytic network process (ANP)‐based model is proposed. The ANP‐based evaluation model is illustrated through an example of supply chain. It provides an effective framework for analyzing the alternatives affecting supply chain performance. It also provides the decision methodology to prioritise these alternatives, so that supply chain performance can be improved.</jats:p>",

In particular, the case examines the essential differences between traditional just‐in‐time manufacture and Synchronous manufacture and also explores the nature of buyer‐supplier relationships between Nissan Manufacturing (UK) Ltd and its seating manufacturer – Ikeda Hoover Ltd. The findings of this case, aligned to the developments of the “modular supply model”, suggest that the nature of buyer‐supplier relationships will change as the value‐creation ratio moves from vehicle manufacturers to global first‐tier modular suppliers. Moreover, the growth of the “modular supply model” is likely to require a reappraisal of supply chain relationships as both the nature of buyer‐supplier relationships change and a new tier‐one position is established that moves the modular suppliers closer to the buyer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well established that altering O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery to contracting skeletal muscle affects human performance. In this respect, a reduced O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply (e.g., hypoxia) increases the rate of muscle fatigue, whereas increasing O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply (e.g., hyperoxia) reduces the rate of fatigue. Interestingly, the faster onset of fatigue in moderate hypoxia does not appear to be a consequence of mitochondrial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> limitation because these effects occur at submaximal rates of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption for these conditions and at O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> tensions well above that which impairs mitochondrial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake in vitro. Alterations in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply modulate the regulation of cellular respiration and may affect the onset of impaired Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> handling with fatigue. Specifically, changes in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply alter the coupling between phosphocreatine hydrolysis and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake in contracting muscles, which by determining the rate of inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation may affect Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> release. Partial ischemia differs somewhat in that the reduction in force could be due to reduced O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply and/or impaired removal of metabolic by-products secondary to insufficient blood flow. Nonetheless, recent evidence shows a parallel decline and restoration of force with alterations in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply but not blood flow alone during submaximal contractions. Furthermore, the causes of fatigue are similar when O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is plentiful and when it is reduced.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Bass diffusion model is a well-known parametric approach to estimating new product demand trajectory over time. This paper generalizes the Bass model by allowing for a supply constraint. In the presence of a supply constraint, potential customers who are not able to obtain the new product join the waiting queue, generating backorders and potentially reversing their adoption decision, resulting in lost sales. Consequently, they do not generate the positive “word-of-mouth” that is typically assumed in the Bass model, leading to significant changes in the new product diffusion dynamics. </jats:p><jats:p> We study how a firm should manage its supply processes in a new product diffusion environment with backorders and lost sales. We consider a make-to-stock production environment and use optimal control theory to establish that it is never optimal to delay demand fulfillment. This result is interesting because immediate fulfillment may accelerate the diffusion process and thereby result in a greater loss of customers in the future. Using this result, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting demand and sales dynamics over the product life cycle. We then use these expressions to investigate how the firm should determine the size of its capacity and the time to market its new product. We show that delaying a product launch to build up an initial inventory may be optimal and can be used as a substitute for capacity. Also, the optimal time to market and capacity increase with the coefficients of innovation and imitation in the adoption population. We compare our optimal capacity and time to market policies with those resulting from exogeneous demand forecasts in order to quantify the value of endogenizing demand. </jats:p>",

The question arises how the increasing demand for gas can be assured? This will be analysed in this paper focussing on the resource base, technical viability, as well as contract security. As far as the resource base for natural gas is concerned, Western Europe's situation is quite favourable. Despite little resources of its own, Western Europe is surrounded by countries and regions with high gas potential (Russia, North Africa, the Caspian region and the Middle East). In addition to a sufficient resource base, production and transport play an important role, especially if there are long distances between producer and consumer countries. Transport costs are a decisive factor, due to the lower energy density of natural gas than that of oil and coal, which limits the distance for transport of gas. Therefore, natural gas markets are mainly regional. Only large gas fields (especially supergiants) are suitable for natural gas supply over long distances despite high infrastructure costs. An extensive pipeline network exists for the gas supply in Europe. This network has to be expanded in the future, however. The price of natural gas is coupled to the price of crude oil. Sizeable fluctuations in the oil price are a factor of uncertainty for capital investment decisions. In order to secure the future gas supply and to take advantage of this environmentally friendly energy source in competition with other primary fuels, all cost-reducing measures must be taken. Political measures must be taken to safeguard the very long-term capital investments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors examine the geographical relations between small business clients and their external suppliers of business advice. The analysis is based on the stratified random sample survey carried out by the ESRC Centre for Business Research in 1999. The analysis demonstrates the importance of localisation in a simplistic sense: a large percentage of advisors are drawn from within 10 km of the client, and almost all from within 50 km for most types of advisor. There are important differences between types of advisors, with public sector advisors, chambers of commerce, and enterprise agencies being the most localised. However, the high degree of localisation is shown to be chiefly dependent on the agglomeration benefits of the accessibility and size of centres in which advisors are located. The general pattern of client – advisor relations is demonstrated to be modelled accurately by a standard spatial interaction model. A key finding is that the spatial pattern of the location of the supply of advisors, particularly the size of the business centres in which they are located, is a key determinant of choice and must be taken into account simultaneously with any role of distance which influences demand, in order to explain the pattern of choice of business advisors. This suggests that small business support policies should be focused chiefly towards small and medium-sized enterprises that have difficulty in accessing major supply sources by virtue of their locations; that is, they should be focused on rural and more peripheral areas. </jats:p>",

The regulation of plant water potential (<jats:italic>Ψ</jats:italic>) by stomatal control and leaf area adjustment may be necessary to maximize water uptake on the one hand, while avoiding loss of hydraulic contact with the soil water on the other. Modelling the changes in hydraulic conductance with pressure gradients in the continuum allows the prediction of water use as a function of soil environment and plant architectural and xylem traits. Large differences in water use between species can be attributed in part to differences in their ‘hydraulic equipment’ that is presumably optimized for drawing water from a particular temporal and spatial niche in the soil environment. A number of studies have identified hydraulic limits as the cause of partial or complete foliar dieback in response to drought. The interactions between root:shoot ratio, rooting depth, xylem properties, and soil properties in influencing the limits to canopy water supply can be used to predict which combinations should optimize water use in a given circumstance. The hydraulic approach can improve our understanding of the coupling of canopy processes to soil environment, and the adaptive significance of stomatal behaviour.</jats:p>",

Thisarticle evaluatesthe off‐farm labor market for a sample of agrarian households in transition Bulgaria. We give particular attention to the distributional assumptions that underlie standard approaches to the evaluation of labor supply. A variety of specification tests are considered and support for standard maximum likelihood estimates which rely on normality as a maintained hypothesis is mixed. Alternative semiparametric (distribution‐free) estimators are also considered. The empirical results indicate that, five years after the initiation of the transition, off‐farm labor supply patterns for Bulgarian agricultural households are similar to what is commonly observed in developed market economies. Labor supply is positively affected by factors such as education and work experience which are hypothesized to increase off‐farm wages. Social benefit programs providing monetary or in‐kind support payments are shown to significantly decrease off‐farm work.</jats:p>",

This paper presents findings from an exploratory study that analyzes the impact of purchasing’s strategic role, industry context and purchasing organizational structure, on the use of various forms of purchasing teams. Using survey data from a broad sample of industries, we found that team usage was a two‐dimensional construct: internal teams and councils, and customer teams. In addition, purchasing’s strategic role comprised two factors: product and technology planning, and external systems planning. After controlling for firm size, purchasing’s strategic role was positively related to the greater use of internal teams and councils, but not customer teams. Industry context also played a role in the usage of teams, with internal teams and councils more extensively used by the firms that manufactured discrete goods. Meanwhile, firms in the service sector favored the use of customer teams. Finally, both industry context and purchasing’s organizational structure were related to the strategic role assumed by purchasing, with a decentralized structure tending to reduce that strategic role.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

A switch of root N source from NO3  − to NH4  + caused within 3 h a 3- to 6-fold increase in leaf apoplastic NH4  + concentration and a simultaneous decrease in apoplastic pH of about 0.4 pH units in both species. The concentration of total extractable leaf tissue NH4  + also increased two to three times within 3 h after the switch. Removal of exogenous NH4  + caused the apoplastic NH4  + concentration to decline back to the original level within 24 h, whereas the leaf tissue NH4  +concentration decreased more slowly and did not reach the original level in 48 h. After growing for 5 weeks with a steady-state supply of NO3  − or NH4  +, L. perenne were in all cases larger, contained more N, and utilized the absorbed N more efficiently for growth than B. erectus, whereas the two species behaved oppositely with respect to tissue concentrations of NO3  −, NH4  +, and total N. Ammonia compensation points were higher for B. erectus than for L. perenne and were in both species higher for NH4  +- than for NO3  −-grown plants. Steady-state levels of apoplastic NH4  +, tissue NH4  +, and NH3 emission were significantly correlated. It is concluded that leaf apoplastic NH4  + is a highly dynamic pool, closely reflecting changes in the external N supply. This rapid response may constitute a signaling system coordinating leaf N metabolism with the actual N uptake by the roots and the external N availability.</jats:p>",

In this study the sensor was calibrated so that absolute values of tc<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> could be reported. At rest, tc<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> was determined on normal, humidified skin on the volar forearm of 20 volunteers of different age groups. In order to evaluate the contribution of the blood flow to the oxygen supply of the skin, tc<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> was recorded at the end of a 5 min suprasystolic occlusion of the forearm. At normal skin surface partial oxygen pressure (163 ± 9 Torr), tc<jats:italic>J</jats:italic><jats:sub>O2</jats:sub> was 0.53 ± 0.27 ml O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>.

Published data on the oxygen diffusion properties of skin and simulations of intracutaneous profiles of oxygen partial pressure indicated that under these conditions, the upper skin layers to a depth of of 0.25–0.40 mm are almost exclusively supplied by external oxygen, whereas the oxygen transport of the blood has a minor influence. As a consequence, a malfunction in capillary oxygen transport cannot be the initiator of the development of superficial skin defects such as those observed in chronic venous incompetence and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.</jats:p>",
