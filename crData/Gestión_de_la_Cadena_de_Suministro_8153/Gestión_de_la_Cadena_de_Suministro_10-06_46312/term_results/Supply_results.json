In this context, there is a growing interest in extending mapping activities to inter-plant and inter-firm levels. However, research on the conditions under which such an initiative has actually been tackled in industry is still incipient. Based on multiple-case study method, this paper discusses some supply chain (SC) mapping initiatives undertaken in the Brazilian automotive industry. The study examines the major motivations, difficulties, and outcomes observed in the cases, as well as the methodological approach adopted in their realisation. The cases reveal that despite its intrinsic complexity, the SC mapping process provides invaluable opportunities to strengthen the SC capabilities. However, its adoption as a formal management method with strategic implications will depend on clearer understanding of its relevance and potentials.</jats:p>"

Literature review is conducted, followed by survey research data (using a sample of 108 large companies operating in Brazil) analysis using cluster analysis, factor analysis and binary logistic regression. Results suggest that the level of logistics complexity of companies is a driver of management choices in supply chain objectives and decision areas, confirming our initial proposition that a contingency approach for supply chain management would be more appropriate than the \"best practice\" one. At the end of the article some further conclusions are drawn and opportunities for further research are discussed.</jats:p>"

Sustainability perceptions were analyzed through thematic content analysis, where the most important economic, environmental and social themes of the supply chain were emphasized. According to the research findings, the socio-cultural aspects encompassing locally produced food form the most important sustainability dimension for consumers. Although the sample size is small, consisting of 19 consumers and limited to Central Finland, the findings suggest that the sustainability of local food should be promoted via socio-cultural arguments alongside economic or environmental ones. The results conclude that the development of local food networks requires direct personal relationships with producers, social networking, consumer education and communication.</jats:p>"

The use of suggestion boxes to collect process improvement suggestions from the workforce is one such example, but they are not always successful. Some organizations do a good job collecting great ideas from their workers, both staff and managers, while others see little result from their efforts. This paper presents a formal model of the (dis)incentives for entrepreneurial behavior in organizations. The model extends research on the stigma of failure into organizations by examining the implications of more conservative and more experimental organizational cultures on the incentives for entrepreneurial action by the corporate-funded employee. The models explain how a forgiving organization that is willing to accept failure as well as success will lead to more product and process innovation. Contrariwise, it explains how a bureaucratic organization will rarely innovate because of its low tolerance for unsuccessful ventures.</jats:p>"

Findings of researches and practices have shown that some intelligent activities, such as negotiation, decision and collaboration, have become the “bottleneck” to improve the performance of supply chain. \nThis paper applied the Autonomous Intelligent System(AIS) to deal with the intelligent activities intelligently and automatically, and thereof provided a new method for the Supply Chain Management(SCM) on MC manufacture. First, a new supply chain model based on E-HUB was presented according to the requirements of MC manufacture, and then the structure and operation of AIS were designed to support that SCM.

Housing supply is defined as the proportions of new housing, private rental accommodation and social housing among all housing units in an electoral district. Multivariate regressions reveal that, among all three housing supply variables, the proportion of private rentals had the largest effect on ethnic diversity and immigrant— Irish segregation. Areas with higher proportions of private rental units were more ethnically diverse, had greater presences of Africans, Asians and eastern Europeans (as opposed to high concentrations of Irish nationals) and exhibited greater integration between each of the three immigrant groups and Irish nationals. The article concludes with a discussion of immigrant assimilation and questions whether the patterns of residential integration observed would further facilitate other forms of social inclusion for immigrants in Irish society. </jats:p>",

Cable and DBS systems have used digital technology to greatly expand the amount of programming available and to more efficiently price discriminate on the basis of program quality – including the direct sale to consumers of broadcast and other HD programming. The result has been rapidly rising cable and DBS revenues since the mid‐1990s, and a general shift from advertiser to direct payment support for television services. Overall, digital transition has enhanced the economic viability of cable and DBS delivery, and decreased that of broadcasting.

The subordinate indexes for effective interface are transportation, network construction, the quality of staff, subordinate indexes for dynamic scalability are the country's economic level, competition in the market environment, market information, the quality of decision-makers, subordinate indexes for effective communication are except market information, the quality of decision-making personnel, but also subjected to the two essential elements, state laws and regulations and commercial credit. Combined Analytic Hierarchy Process with expert method to give model evaluation results, that is the supply chain decision-makers, has a greatest effect on the effective functioning of the supply chain, followed by the commercial credit, once again, market information. Based on the evaluation model, put forward its scope and the corresponding strategies.</jats:p>"

The uses include for agricultural processing, mineral water bottling, granite quarry, golf course irrigation and drinking water supply. Forty five tubewells belong to private companies operating in various places in the area were evaluated in terms of the yields and water quality. The wells were drilled using rotary air-percussion method to a maximum depth of 200 m and provided with 6 inch PVC casing and screens.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The productivity of the wells and the characteristics of aquifer were evaluated by pumping tests using a constant discharge rate and step drawdown methods. The average yield of the wells at allowable drawdown of 40 m was found to be 428 m3 per day. Results from water quality analysis indicate that the water is fresh with total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration between 101 and 150 mg/L. The hardness of the water varies from as low as 9.01 mg/L to a maximum of 337 mg /L. On the average the water is moderately hard with the hardness value of 73.17 mg/L. The water facies of the groundwater was found to be of Calcium-Sodium-Bicarbonate water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The core goal of any enterprise is to grow both in assets and profitability. Such growth is critical to the wellbeing of individual firms and the economy in general. Sound supply chains that offer strong reliable relationships have been found to play a critical role in the growth and sustainability of firms. Studies show that enterprises that exploit the benefits of supply chain management improve performance by up to 80 percent depending on the extent of adherence to key supply chain requirements. However, Small firms have largely remained far removed as far as structured growth and development of supply chain relationships is concerned. Although significant levels of success has been reported among larger firms with regard to supply chain relationships, such success has not been widely replicated among smaller firms. It is largely appreciated that competition is no longer based on just the bare company-versus-company business models but also on the extended virtual enterprise of supply chain-versus-supply chain. This underpins the importance of optimizing an enterprise’s performance within the wider context of strong inter-firm and firm-market relationships. Many studies have been conducted to try and understand the supply chain scenario. Most of these studies have concentrated on European and American firms. However, the social, economic, cultural and other fundamentals that influence the success of supply chains for small firms in developed economies are largely different from those in developing countries and on this account these studies, although important as reference points for further study, may not be representative of the scenario in developing economies.There is, therefore, need to examine the supply chain relationship gaps that characterize small firms in developing economies. This would help develop recommendations that can be used to strengthen these relationships and so improve business performance among small firms in these economies.</jats:p>",

The survey allowed the identification of three variables for the proposed model: dealer size, consumer behavior and the legal environment. The model comprises three possible organizational forms for the distribution business: isolated single-brand, single-brand group, and multi-brand group. This study is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the sector, as well as to support the analysis of future auto distribution trends.</jats:p>"

The conceptual model is validated empirically on three destination samples using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that relevant destination attributes are destination-specific, while the hypothesized relationships between destination attributes, overall destination quality, visitor satisfaction and behavioural intentions are largely supported.

This study hypothesizes that a firm’s ability to manage risk strategy— and therefore support its competitiveness—is determined by a symbiotic triad of factors: the resources it utilizes; network systems; and performance criteria it employs. The study, comprising 24 in-depth interviews with electronics and IT firms, examines resource utilization through the Resource-Based View (RBV), assesses firms’ proclivity to engage in networks for risk mitigation and competitiveness; and highlights the importance of performance evaluation as a critically important component in supply chain management. Findings reveal that both buyers and suppliers believe that the symbiotic triad can provide them with a competitive advantage in addition to improving operational efficiency, effectiveness and quality. Future research should also extend this pilot investigation to other countries and industries, and utilize a larger sample of firms for quantitative as well as qualitative assessment.</jats:p>",

Thirdly, this paper predicts the short-term future performance and investigates the resiliency of the industry against any liquidity pressure by using ARIMA models and Bayesian technique. The paper finds that the industry has historically managed liquidity very well. Nevertheless, the resiliency against liquidity pressures is not strong enough because it does not perform well when irregular demand of liquidity or a liquidity run occur. As such, this paper suggests to Islamic banks that they intensify education of the public on Islamic banking principles, improve banking facilities, products and services, and optimize bank financing.</jats:p>"

The sustainable and long-term development strategy becomes extremely urgent and important for the enterprises. Manufactures and their supply chain should take measures to implement sustainable development strategy in future production. The concept of sustainability is introduced into the field of supply chain and the structure of sustainable chain is constructed in this paper. And a method of sustainable supply chain performance evaluation is proposed. It evaluates the supply chain performance in four dimensions, namely, operational, financial, social and environmental dimensions. Then a performance evaluation model of sustainable supply chain based on AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is established. This paper gives a case to evaluate the sustainable supply chain performance with the model and implications are given finally.</jats:p>"

The results show that entrepreneurs are actively managing the demand as well as supply of entrepreneurial finance to narrow the “funding gap”. Furthermore, individuals work to fill the funding gap by creating required start‐up capital. In other words, the “funding gap” is not static or concrete; rather it is dynamic, manageable and in many cases is within individuals' power and ability to overcome.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The findings of this paper are particularly important to all stakeholders, including policy makers, educators, researchers, entrepreneurs and nascent entrepreneurs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper contributes to the conceptual, methodological and practical knowledge in advancing understanding of the “funding gap”. First, it provides insight into the relationship between entrepreneurs and their environment that shapes the “funding gap”. Second, the findings suggested that a positive, supportive enterprise culture can be particularly useful in driving individuals towards entrepreneurship. Third, in terms of methodology, the author argues that an “inside‐looking‐lout”, interpretive, multi‐stage fieldwork and network as unit of analysis is particularly distinctive in revealing the complex process of managing entrepreneurial finance in the process of new venture creation.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, the development of the world population is characterised by two trends: absolute population growth and rapid urbanisation. Especially rapid urbanisation, taking place in Asia, Latin America and Africa, poses major pressure on the affected regions. The development of e.g. Asian countries today is stamped by a combination of urbanisation with high economic growth rates. Conventional centralised infrastructure of supply, treatment and disposal of water is not able to cope with the new challenges arising from these, in history incomparable, high growth rates. Therefore new approaches to infrastructure supply and treatment systems are required – for ecological, sociocultural and economic reasons. The semicentralised approach, focusing on integrated water supply and treatment structures for wastewater and waste on the neighbourhood level, offers one possible solution to the challenges imposed by rapid urbanisation and growing resource needs. The change from centralised to semicentralised supply and treatment systems will minimise the grave discrepancy between the rapid urban growth and the provision of supply and treatment infrastructure. Integrated semicentralised supply and treatment systems face the challenge of growing amounts of wastewater and solid waste combined with rising needs of water for private households and industrial use. The semicentralised approach offers a wide range of flexibility in implementation, energy self-sufficient operation, enormous saving potentials in water demands through intra-urban water reuse and further more advantages in comparison to centralised sectored solutions as practised today.</jats:p>",

Only sparse data exist on the impact of these demographic changes on future blood demand and supply. Data on blood recipients are sparse and unconnected to data on blood donors. Based on studies in North America and Europe on the impact of demographic changes on future blood supply, the demographic trends will affect many regions in the Western world similarly. These effects are most pronounced in the new member states of the European Union where birth rates declined abruptly after 1989. Co‐ordinated efforts will be required to prevent blood shortages based upon these demographic trends in Western societies.

The emergency supplier has a shorter lead-time than the regular supplier, but the unit price he offers is higher. Excess demand is backlogged. We generalize the recently studied class of dual index policies [Veeraraghavan, S., A. Scheller-Wolf. 2008. Now or later: Dual index policies for capacitated dual sourcing systems. Oper. Res. 56(4) 850–864] by proposing two classes of policies. The first class consists of policies that have an order-up-to structure for the emergency supplier. We provide analytical results that are useful for determining optimal or near-optimal policies within this class. This analysis and the policies we propose leverage our observation that the classical “lost sales inventory problem” is a special case of this problem. The second class consists of policies that have an order-up-to structure for the regular supplier. Here, we derive bounds on the optimal order quantity from the emergency supplier, in any period, and use these bounds for finding effective policies within this class. Finally, we undertake an elaborate computational investigation to compare the performance of the policies we propose with that of dual index policies. One of our policies provides an average cost-saving of 1.1% over the best dual index policy and has the same computational requirements. Another policy that we propose has a cost performance similar to the best dual index policy, but its computational requirements are lower. </jats:p>",

From the state of the art, it proposes future developments in modeling and management and their challenges. Mycotoxin contamination in cereal grain–based feed and food products is currently managed and controlled by good agricultural practices, good manufacturing practices, hazard analysis critical control points, and by checking and more recently by notification systems and predictive mathematical models. Most of the predictive models for Fusarium mycotoxins in cereal grains focus on deoxynivalenol in wheat and aim to help growers make decisions about the application of fungicides during cultivation. Future developments in managing Fusarium mycotoxins should include the linkage between predictive mathematical models and geographical information systems, resulting into region-specific predictions for mycotoxin occurrence. The envisioned geographically oriented decision support system may incorporate various underlying models for specific users' demands and regions and various related databases to feed the particular models with (geographically oriented) input data. Depending on the user requirements, the system selects the best fitting model and available input information. Future research areas include organizing data management in the cereal grain supply chain, developing predictive models for other stakeholders (taking into account the period up to harvest), other Fusarium mycotoxins, and cereal grain types, and understanding the underlying effects of the regional component in the models.</jats:p>",

We used health administrative data to calculate county-level supply (full-time equivalents [FTEs]) of PCPs.

Of the children, 45.4% live in the highest-supply areas (&amp;lt;2000 children per FTE) and 8% in the lowest-supply areas (&amp;gt;3000 children per FTE). Compared with high-supply counties, the lowest had significantly lower rates of primary care visits (2716 vs 7490 per 1000) and higher proportions of newborns without early follow-care (58.2% vs 14.5%). Low-supply areas had higher rates of ED visits (440 vs 179 per 1000) and admissions. A stepwise gradient existed for every decrease in supply for most measures. Self-reported access barriers were most evident in areas with &amp;gt;3500 children per FTE (32.8% without a physician).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Under universal insurance there are differences in access to, and outcomes of, primary care related to local physician supply after controlling for neighborhood income.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Companies in the food industry are driven to improve their traceability for several reasons. The primary reasons are food safety and quality. Another is the response to the increased interest among consumers in imperceptible product attributes such as organic, fair trade, dolphin-safe and non genetically modified (non-GMO). Such attributes are hard to distinguish and thus require generally enhanced traceability in order to verify their existence. This has led to an emergent area in which actors engage in gaining and maintaining traceability and communicating it to the consumers. This paper describes the relations between the actors in a supply chain (SC) in the field of organic food systems. It examines the objectives each actor has for gaining and maintaining traceability throughout the SC. The focus on organic relates to the challenge for the companies to ensure this imperceptible product attribute throughout the entire food system. A single case study was conducted in an organic food system providing organic ice cream products. The data collection included semi-structured interviews, observations, a review of internal documents and a survey among the participating companies. The findings illustrate and elaborate on the objectives companies have for engaging in traceability. The objectives identified are divided into three categories: food safety and quality, managing the SC and internal resources and communication with consumers. The survey confirms the results from the interviews that all actors want to engage in traceability. They prioritize the objectives differently, however. The study highlights the value of close relations between the actors when addressing consumer concerns regarding product and process characteristics, such as the imperceptible organic attribute.</jats:p>",

The main findings indicate that (1) competitive priorities seem to \"pull\" the trajectories, translating market needs into specific tasks that must be fulfilled by each strategy, while the advances made in each step may \"push\" the trajectories, setting the basis for new strategies and making them capable of moving further; (2) although advances along trajectories are intended and planned, they cannot be foreseen and alternate decisions may be necessary and (3) secondary factors like the degree of autonomy assigned to firms and accumulated knowledge also influence trajectories.</jats:p>"

Using a triple differences approach, I find that the program has no significant effect on the time use of eligible individuals, except for the sharp decrease in the housework participation of elderly women who live with another potential beneficiary. Individuals 60 to 69 years old change their time use only if they live with a potential beneficiary, but not because they expect to receive the demogrant themselves in a few years. In particular, men in their 60s seem to retire early if they live with someone who qualifies for the transfer. Both men and women 18 to 59 years old increase their labor supply if they live with an eligible man, but decrease it if they live with an eligible woman. These results are consistent with income in the hands of elderly women being shared more with younger family members than income in the hands of elderly men.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In peer-to-peer (P2P) media distribution, users obtain content from other users who already have it. This form of decentralized product distribution demonstrates several unique features. Only a small fraction of users in the network are queried when a potential adopter seeks a file, and many of these users might even free-ride, i.e., not distribute the content to others. As a result, generated demand might not always be fulfilled immediately. We present mixing models for product diffusion in P2P networks that capture decentralized product distribution by current adopters, incomplete demand fulfillment and other unique aspects of P2P product diffusion. The models serve to demonstrate the important role that P2P search process and distribution referrals—payments made to users that distribute files—play in efficient P2P media distribution. We demonstrate the ability of our diffusion models to derive normative insights for P2P media distributors by studying the effectiveness of distribution referrals in speeding product diffusion and determining optimal referral policies for fully decentralized and hierarchical P2P networks. </jats:p>",

Polybags used were 40 cm x 20 cm in sized. Split plot design arranged as factorial was used in this experiment and was replicated three times. As main factor was volume of watering wiyh three levels of 0,25;0,5; 0,75; and 1,00 times of fied water capacity. The subfactors were soil types and media composition. The four levels of soil type used were regosol, vertisol, mediterane and alluvial. The three levels of media composition were proportion of soil: manure: rice husk of 1: 1: 1; 1: 2: 1; and 2: 2: 1. Result of this experiment showed that all of combination between treatments did not influence yield and yield components. But individual treatments significantly influenced the yield and some yield components.

Starting from a planar geometry, erosion increased bed roughness due to feedbacks between preferential sediment transport through interconnected topographic lows, focused erosion along these zones of preferential bed load transport, and local shear stresses that depended on the evolving bed morphology. Finally, continued growth of bed roughness was inhibited by imposed variability in discharge and sediment flux, due to changes in spatial patterns of alluvial deposition and impact wear. Erosion was preferentially focused at lower bed elevations when the bed was cover‐free, but was focused at higher bed elevations when static alluvial cover filled topographic lows. Natural variations in discharge and sediment flux may thus stabilize and limit the growth of roughness in bedrock channels due to the effects of partial bed cover.</jats:p>",

We surveyed 512 Canadian manufacturers, most of which were small or medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). Our survey was structured around four dimensions of supply change integration, namely: nesting, collaboration, financial incorporation, and distancing. In this paper we describe the use of supply chain management practices and show that their use is dependent on the nature of the business partners (i.e., upstream or downstream positioning of partnership in chain logistics of businesses studied), business field (i.e., sector of activities in which the business operates), and organizational size. Our findings suggest that supply chain practices were used more intensively with clients than with suppliers. They also show that practitioners and scholars need to qualify the concept of integration which is often used in a one‐dimensional perspective. Copyright © 2010 ASAC.

However, the folate model itself, the success of which was predicted by successful clinical trials and the known favorable facts of high folic acid bioavailability and the infrequency of folate malabsorption, may not apply to cobalamin fortification. Cobalamin bioavailability is more restricted than folic acid and is unfortunately poorest in persons deficient in cobalamin. Moreover, clinical trials to demonstrate actual health benefits of relevant oral doses have not yet been done in persons with mild subclinical deficiency, who are the only practical targets of cobalamin fortification because &gt;94% of persons with clinically overt cobalamin deficiency have severe malabsorption and therefore cannot respond to normal fortification doses. However, it is only in the severely malabsorptive disorders, such as pernicious anemia, not subclinical deficiency, that neurologic deterioration following folic acid therapy has been described to date. It is still unknown whether mild deficiency states, which usually arise from normal absorption or only food‐bound cobalamin malabsorption, have real health consequences or how often they progress to overt clinical cobalamin deficiency. Reports of cognitive or other risks in the common subclinical deficiency state, although worrisome, have been inconsistent. Moreover, their observational nature proved neither causative connections nor documented health benefits. Extensive work, especially randomized clinical trials, must be done before mandatory dietary intervention on a national scale can be justified.</jats:p>",

The harvest scheduling model is solved repeatedly to produce harvest schedules within a rolling planning horizon framework. The risk mitigation strategies we examined were (1) whether or not to account for fire in the planning model and (2) replanning interval. We evaluated those strategies under four representative fire regimes. We found that accounting for fire in the planning model reduced the harvest volume variability as fire activity increased (i.e., for average annual burn fractions ≥0.45%), but replanning intervals over a range of 1 to 10 years had little impact on harvest volume variability. We also developed a risk analysis decision-making aid that forest managers can use to help deal with fire-related uncertainty. Our results suggest that risk-averse forest managers should account for fire while planning, especially when burn fractions exceed 0.45%. </jats:p>",

Water supply and sanitation condition become severely disrupted during flood when it embraces various water borne diseases.

But owing to using hanging latrines or a boat and defecating directly into water bodies most people pollute those water bodies.

Using a classic protocol, ON was induced in 30 male 28-week old New Zealand white rabbits. An additional 15 untreated rabbits served as controls. Change of blood supply in the proximal femur was assessed by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and microangiography.

The hypogastric artery was temporarily occluded by removable vessel clips. Time for surgery was 126 minutes, no bleeding occurred. The postoperative course was uneventful and s‐βhCG normalized in five weeks. Histopathology of the intact specimen showed trophoblast surrounded by lymphatic tissue.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In humans, prediabetes is characterized by marked increases in plasma insulin and near normal blood glucose levels as well as microvascular dysfunction of unknown origin. Using the extensor digitorum longus muscle of 7-wk inbred male Zucker diabetic fatty rats fed a high-fat diet as a model of prediabetes, we tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia contributes to impaired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery in skeletal muscle. Using in vivo video microscopy, we determined that the total O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to capillaries in the extensor digitorum longus muscle of prediabetic rats was reduced to 64% of controls with a lower O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply rate per capillary and higher O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> extraction resulting in a decreased O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation at the venous end of the capillary network. These findings suggest a lower average tissue Po<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in prediabetic animals. In addition, we determined that insulin, at concentrations measured in humans and Zucker diabetic fatty rats with prediabetes, inhibited the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-dependent release of ATP from rat red blood cells (RBCs). This inability to release ATP could contribute to the impaired O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> delivery observed in rats with prediabetes, especially in light of the finding that the endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries from these animals is not different from controls and is not altered by insulin. Computational modeling confirmed a significant 8.3-mmHg decrease in average tissue Po<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as well as an increase in the heterogeneity of tissue Po<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, implicating a failure of a regulatory system for O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply. The finding that insulin attenuates the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-dependent release of ATP from RBCs suggests that this defect in RBC physiology could contribute to a failure in the regulation of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to meet the demand in skeletal muscle in prediabetes. </jats:p>",
