      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>How and when do relationships between supply chain stages normalize misconduct? This question is especially relevant to oversupply, a form of normal misconduct peculiar to supply chains. Oversupply occurs when apparently ordinary production and distribution processes deliver products in excess of the safe needs of a market. Although past research sheds light on firm‐level processes of organizational misconduct, it has neglected the question of between‐stage influences on systemic phenomena like oversupply. We explore this question by analyzing the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the American opioid epidemic during the early decades of the 21st century. Manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and physicians have settled billions of dollars in claims related to opioid oversupply. These settlements overshadow the fact that many supply chain members made the strategic choice to not participate in oversupply. Focusing on the pharmacy stage of the supply chain, this study finds that participation in opioid oversupply is positively influenced by pressure from supplier pools and by the example of nearby competitors as well as by market characteristics. We test our model using a unique dataset that combines geographic, market, and public health data with prescription opioid transaction data from the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. The study breaks new ground by developing the oversupply construct to explain how pressures within supply chains shape misconduct. The oversupply concept is widely generalizable with the potential to inform a next generation of responsible supply chain research that addresses wicked problems like toxic production and consumption.</jats:p>",

It further assesses the supply chain performance impact of the identified sustainable supplier selection factors.Methodology: The study adopted a quantitative survey approach to randomly collect and analyse primary data from a large sample of 116 logistics and supply chain executives in 58 healthcare organisations in Nigeria. The descriptive scores (mean and standard deviation) were summarised and used to estimate the relationship among variables.Results: Overall, the results suggest that economic sustainability towers above other sustainability factors for the selection of healthcare suppliers in the context of this study. In addition, economically sustainable supplier selection correlates strongly and positively with supply chain performance, while social sustainability supplier selection had moderate correlation with performance.Conclusion: Based on these findings, it is our conclusion that most healthcare supply chain managers in Nigeria attaches importance to economic sustainability factors in their supplier selection process than environmental and social sustainability factors.</jats:p>"

And scope of the study is dairy farmers, dairy plants and dairy retailers that are doing business in Erzurum dairy supply chain. And Erzurum city is chosen for the study because economic events taking place in Erzurum has wider consequences for the whole region. According to the study it is determined that there is a perception difference among dairy supply network partners of SCO and SCRU. And finally, it is determined that SCO affects dairy SCRU negatively. This means as SCO among members increases SCRU decreases in the dairy products supply network.

Two kinds of players support the currencies differently and choose their volume fractions of transactions in each currency. The variable-supply currency enables money printing/withdrawal and inflation/deflation, which counteract each other in each player’s utility. The exponentially increasing 1959–2021 US M2 money supply and the positive inflation cause this utility to increase over time with high weight assigned to money printing/withdrawal, and decrease otherwise. Three replicator equations determine each player’s volume fraction of transactions in each currency, and which kind of player each player prefers to be. High weight assigned to money supply relative to inflation induces players to prefer the variable-supply currency. A player’s utility of transacting in each currency is proportional to the player’s support of that currency, the volume fraction of all players’ transactions in that currency, and the fraction of players of the same kind as the given player. A player’s utility of transacting in the variable-supply currency is additionally proportional to two ratios. The first is the initial money supply plus the accumulative money printing/withdrawal divided by the initial money supply. The second is the inverse of the accumulative inflation/deflation. The players’ fractions of transactions in each currency may be inverse U shaped or U shaped before typically converging towards preferring one or the other currency. If each player can choose which kind of player to be, it may choose to be the kind with the highest support of a given currency. If a player’s utility of transacting in a given currency depends more on the fraction of players being of one kind than the other kind, the player prefers to be of the first kind, thus assigning less weight to its support of that currency and the volume fractions of transactions in that currency.</jats:p>"

SMEs representthe vast majority of enterprises throughout economies and contribute to automotive supply chains in various tier ranks. As SMEs are known to lack resources and skills while focusing on short-term benefits rather than on long-term gradual improvements, the aim of of this paper is to analyse the perception of six sigma process capabilities in automotive supply chains assuming differences in company size, supply chain rank and six sigma duration. This was tested with Fisher’s exact test. Companies with less than 1000 employees, subsuppliers and companies with a six sigma implementation in the last 3 years struggled to meet six sigma principles, suggesting that mainly small companies inhibit a risk for the supply chain. These findings contribute to the existing theoretical body of knowledge by identifying a three-to-five-year period for six sigma implementations until six sigma maturity. Practically, the findings contribute to the research by explaining the need for a continuous supplier development over a three-to-five-year period until the company meets its performance requirements, with a supply chain risk incorporated in lower-tier ranks and with small companies.</jats:p>"

However, there is no detailed information on Jakarta's water supply and demand, which is essential to understand the resources situation. This study estimates Jakarta's total water supply and demand for 5 years. Furthermore, we analyze the natural and socio-economic factors shaping the current supply and demand using thematic analysis based on the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, Status, Impact, and Response) framework. This paper contributes to two building blocks in the system strengthening approach to water and sanitation, i.e., (1) the sector policy strategy and (2) planning, monitoring, and review.

Besides other costs, supply chain costs vary from time to time depending on the sourcing, transportation, and inventory-related costs. Improving the operational efficiency of the supply chain has become the primary objective for increasing profitability from supply chain operations in present-day context. In reality, supply chain operations are complex with uncertainty predominantly influencing various costs associated with supply chains affecting return on investments and profitability. Supply chain cost optimization should enable the supply chain managers to ensure that the supply chain is ‘responsive’, ‘agile’, and ‘reinvented’ for present and future operations. Optimization of supply chain costs bestows improving operating efficiency that promotes improvements in revenue and increment in profits. The present article aims at considering various supply chains cost parameters such as total operating costs, profit, revenue, logistics costs, and information sharing costs for optimization of supply chain costs using multi-objective optimization. A generic three-stage supply chain model with usual entities like suppliers, manufacturers, and customer zones is assumed in the present article. A trade-off curve among the selected objective function sets and relevant constraints was developed and presented in the article. The trade-off curve provides the basis for decision-makers to better understand the supply chain optimization effect on the selected objective function set elements to make the present and future supply chains promote startling ‘profitability’ and increase revenue generation in operations.</jats:p>"

Technology adoption has dramatically changed many organizations' revenue patterns with high income on technology adoption and low income on non-adoption. The timeline of technology adoption was also the biggest concern for many firms because of restrictions on the people's movement. The research has been done on technology usage in different supply chain functions and its effectiveness in business performance.  The chapter contents displayed the possible outcomes of the technology and its importance of adoption. The supply chain techno-umbrella has been portrayed as a saver of the pandemic during the non-revenue time. The chapter also described the various available forms of technology in the decision-making of the supply chain processes. </jats:p>",

In particular, supply chain profits and profitability are important performance measures. However, since it is very difficult to evaluate the profit side of the supply chain, this chapter focuses on the cost management of logistics and supply chain costs. The premise of supply chain cost management is that each company participating in the supply chain is able to manage logistics costs appropriately. Therefore, the authors discuss the management of logistics costs by utilizing management accounting methods such as activity-based costing, total cost of ownership, and life cycle cost. Then, after clarifying what exactly is meant by supply chain costs, supply chain cost management is discussed. The management of costs incurred across multiple companies is much more difficult than the cost management of a single company, and the issues that must be overcome are clarified. Finally, directions for future research are presented. </jats:p>",

These approaches greatly contribute to its improvement in terms of efficiency, performance, and anti-risk capabilities. In addition, reducing costs and raising efficiency are effective measures for optimizing the GSC. Specifically, warehouse integration, positioning of warehouses, matching and sharing consumers' needs with both suppliers and agencies, further informatization and visualization of goods, innovative packing methods, reducing container numbers, and storage points are worth considering. A common SC platform and better SC resilience are expected. Other specific measures are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The issues of energy efficiency of alternative fuels in Ukraine is more acute than in the world. The reasons for this are outdated technologies, the exhaustion of resources, the use of fixed assets for electricity and heat generation, which together with low fuel efficiency leads to significant emissions of harmful substances. The use of solar energy in Ukraine will make it less dependent on fluctuations in fuel prices. It is known that, solar installations are often characterized by complex structures or low utilization of the useful space, require complex electro mechanical systems and guidance mechanisms. Currently, there are a significant number of solar collectors, different design and technical and economic indicators. Environmental friendliness and economic benefits of these systems remain the main issue during installation. Taking into account the scientific and technological progress that reduces the cost of energy obtained with the help of solar collectors, the improvement of structures that generate thermal and electrical energy remains an urgent issue today. The paper offers design solutions for improving the translucent facades of buildings, which today play an extremely important role in architectural and structural terms. Such a solution based on the use of solar energy is a solar collector integrated into the light transparent facade of the building, which will save space for its self-installation and allow generating consumer energy by the structure of the building. Theoretical formulas for constructing and calculating the energy characteristics of a solar power supply system are elucidated for the proposed design of a hybrid thermal and photovoltaic solar collector.</jats:p>"

Industry members are in a hurry to gain the initiative. In EV, there is a belief that the horizontal division of labor in the supply chain will be promoted by eliminating complicated engines. Therefore, in this chapter, the author examined whether the vertical “KEIRETSU” or “KEIRETSU transaction,” a characteristic of the supply chain of the Japanese automobile industry, would be swallowed up by the wave of horizontal division of labor. </jats:p>",

While BANDAI sold 40 million of the first Tamagotchi™ worldwide by March 1999, this effort ended in tragedy. BANDAI suffered from the tragic boom and bust. The causes can be summarized as follows: a demand forecast failure and an immature SCM including a wrong response which created an excessive boom and sudden bust.

For a restaurant to grow by developing a chain and opening multiple stores, it needs a supply chain that links the central kitchen, manufacture and direct sales, and cold chain. Therefore, using Saizeriya, a major restaurant chain in Japan, as a case study, the authors identify Saizeriya's management strategy, supply chain model, and its functions. Although Saizeriya is in the restaurant industry, it has adopted the business model of speciality store retailer of private label apparel (SPA), which is prevalent in the apparel industry. In this study, the authors clarify how the company has improved the efficiency of its supply chain while controlling the effects of the rising costs of raw materials and logistics. </jats:p>",

Therefore, for automakers to steadily implement CSR initiatives, not only automakers but also all companies that make up the supply chain must promote such initiatives. Until now, existing studies have focused only on the efforts of companies such as automakers and suppliers and have not examined the efforts of industry associations, which play an extremely important role in the steady development of CSR initiatives in the supply chain. Therefore, this chapter examines the role and importance of the supplier-side industry association (JAPIA) in the development of CSR initiatives in the supply chain of the Japanese automotive industry. About CSR initiatives in the Japanese automotive industry, JAPIA's efforts have been extremely important in facilitating and ensuring supply chain initiatives. Thanks to the efforts of JAPIA, the Japanese automotive industry has been able to realize supply chain management in terms of CSR. </jats:p>",

Additionally, resilience capabilities aid the SC to thrive against such challenges. Indeed, change management complements the resilience behaviour towards facing changes induced from SC disruptions and proactive change management strategies foster smooth transitions to facilitate faster recovery to steady-state conditions following future change events. Conversely, most SC employ a reactive approach to change management aiming at reducing the impact of disruptions already in place, consequently forcing the SC to instill, develop, and implement change capabilities in a chaotic fashion with reduced efficiency to infuse resilience capabilities for speedy and effective recovery from future disruptive events. Hence, an in-depth literature study is needed to leverage proactive change management processes for resilience enhancements within SC. </jats:p>",

Information systems involve creating specific environment for the fulfilment of organizational strategy. However, information system affords an organization an enormous benefit that materializes in the long-run. Unfortunately, realization of information system is also accompanied with risk which mostly deters management from taking the initiative hence missing out on the intended benefits of implementing information system usage in organizations. Without overemphasizing the crucial role played by information system in the supply chain performance, this study seeks to focus on investigating the effect of Explorative Information Systems Usage and Exploitative Information Systems Usage on Supply Chain Performance. Even though Information Systems is an increasingly important element of academic research and discussions, there seems to be no consensus in the extant literature on the impact of information systems (IS) usage on the supply chain. Most importantly the study investigates moderating functions of supply chain integration (SCI) and managerial commitment (MC). Survey instruments were collected from manufacturing companies in Ghana. Simple random sampling was used to select 100 companies of which 1,300 respondents were identified, and questionnaires were administered. The study showed that Managerial Commitment, Explorative Information Systems Usage, and Exploitative Information Systems Usage impact significantly and positively on Supply Chain Performance. Additionally, the findings concluded that Supply Chain Integration, specifically operational integration significantly and positively mediates the relationship between the usage of Information Systems and Performance of Supply Chain. In this regard, these results imply that operational integration between partners can help influence the performance of supply chains. </jats:p>",

In this study, we develop the novel concept of<jats:italic>buyer abusive behavior</jats:italic>(BAB) and examine BABs exerted by buyers of trucking services against truck owner–operators as their suppliers. This focus is timely given the recent emergence of online platform businesses where precarious work and associated worker abuse are prevalent. Building on the theory of power imbalance and risk‐taking behavior, we elaborate on how BAB can jeopardize supplier welfare that comprises performance and safety. The analysis of the data pertaining to 260 owner–operators in South Korea shows that contract‐unrelated BAB (e.g., buyer's request for money and valuables) harms supplier performance and supplier safety while contract‐related BAB (e.g., buyer's unfair subcontract price decision) does not. Furthermore, the positive relationship between supplier performance and supplier safety is attenuated by contract‐related BAB but reinforced by contract‐unrelated BAB. We contribute to the growing body of the literature on decent work by exposing BAB as a major detriment to supplier worker welfare and laying the groundwork for the development of theories on power abuse and working conditions in multi‐tiered subcontracting work environments.</jats:p>",

This chapter presents a review of literature that addresses supply chains risks, which are generated in transportation and distribution. In this regard, it's crucial to bring to light as well some measures and strategies that companies can implement to cope with the risks caused by some disruptions. These include the rising importance of safety, digitalization, and the need to revisit the meaning of efficiency in transportation and distribution management.</jats:p>",

In spite of the potential advantages of the BCT in the supply chain management (SCM) area, the adoption of this novel technology is still in its very early stages. This chapter per the authors proposes a quality function deployment (QFD)-based strategic decision support tool to determine the aptness of BCT adoption in a given SC context. In addition, the proposed tool also allows us to understand the maturity of BCT capabilities in addressing the key SC performance aspects. The application of the proposed tool is explained through a couple of illustrative examples. </jats:p>",

As profitability of any business is directly impacted by its inventory, so any basic changes in operations would impact its performance. However, established supply chain paradigms are no longer valid as they are shaken up by VUCA economy, demographic change, sustainability, globalization, digitization, rise of ecommerce, political turmoil, social media, buying behaviour, and most importantly, by COVID-19. This COVID-19 pandemic crisis has taken over the world and brought additional challenges at an unprecedented scale. Since identifying and structuring the problem are the first steps towards effective SCM, so redesigning the distribution strategy is the need of the hour. Companies should innovate with data and new digital technologies to increase automation in their core process to forecast predictive analysis for greater customer experience and harness the disruption.

It is evident that crafting the supply chain procedures and results based upon cost-competitiveness are no longer adequate and businesses will be required to reconsider approaches that hold “risk-competitiveness” to warrant resilience moving forward. In this context, the Bangladesh supply chain industry is no exception. The supply chain practitioners have faced an unprecedented challenge from the supplier timely shipment failure to a long delay in the voyage, congestion at transshipment and at the customs, delay in the clearance procedure, and finally, difficulties in the distribution. This chapter justifies the current global disruption demands to revalidate the supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) of an organization, and the Bangladeshi supply chain needs to become more agile and adaptable to these acute crisis moments and should emphasize building effective response strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Interannual dynamics of feeding conditions for nekton in the upper epipelagic layer of the western Bering Sea is considered for the summer and fall seasons of 2002–2020. In the summers, daily consumption by fish and squids ranged from 0.01 to 0.10 t/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the deepwater basins and between 0.01–0.38 t/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the shelf area at Cape Navarin. In the falls, the consumption increased to 0.03–0.14 t/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the deep-water basins, and to 0.01–0.53 t/km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the Navarin area. Summary in the summer-fall periods, the fish and squids consumed 2–5 % of zooplankton production (up to 5–7 % in some years) in the deep-sea basins that is rather low degree of the zooplankton resources usage. In the Navarin area, the consumption is considerably higher and is estimated as 5 % in summer and 21 % in fall season, on average. In cases of heightened nekton biomass and reduced zooplankton biomass in some years, the grazing pressure on plankton increased, in particular on euphausiids, hyperiids and pteropods, while the intensity of salmon feeding decreased, with extension the portions of nektonic food and other zooplankton groups, as arrowworms, in their diet. On the other hand, the portion of juvenile fish and squids in the salmon diet increased in cases of high abundance of this prey, too. Weak correlation was detected both between the salmon feeding and abundance of their prey and between the salmon feeding and abundance of salmons. The feeding conditions for pink salmon during their offshore migration did not determine the rate of their returns. Strong year-classes of pink salmon had large returns in conditions of either poor or rich food supply in fall season, so the feeding in fall was not important for the pink salmon survival in the ocean in winter. Feeding of other fish and squids species did not change noticeably in the years with reduced food supply. In general, abundance and species composition of plankton and nekton communities were rather stable in the western Bering Sea in the 2000-2010s, and this current state of the ecosystem provides stable functioning of nekton communities both in the deepwater and Navarin areas.</jats:p>"

A Project Management and Engineering (PME) model has been developed and employed for effective delivery of various components involved in the mooring package. The goal of the development is to prepare the mooring system supply chain and be ready for commercial scale FOWF developments.

The PME model for WindFloat Atlantic mooring project is introduced. The anchor design for the project is explained. The anchor design is based on a model developed for limited and sparse geo data. The engineering geological and geotechnical characterization with limited soil data, the definition of soil design bounds and identification of geotechnical risks are explained.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results show that the PME model is successful in the management of the numerous components, stakeholders, and interfaces.

This extension is expected to improve HSEQ, traceability and identification therefore avoiding risks and increasing efficiency in farm scale mooring system deployments, inspections, and maintenances. The regulatory approval and the successful installation of anchors proves the effectiveness of the applied anchor design methodology. The results show that the anchor type selection and anchor sizing are highly dependent on the mooring design conditions, applicable class rules, and the geotechnical risks within the windfarm development area. The value of laboratory scale model testing under the simulated mooring tensions and in comparable soil conditions has been demonstrated as a further risk reduction measure before the actual offshore installation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The mooring system delivery and the offshore installation of the project anchors are completed successfully in a noticeably short time proving the effectiveness of the applied models and design methodologies. The PME model and the anchor design methodology developed for WindFloat Atlantic project are expected to improve the delivery time of the mooring system and anchors, and to reduce the cost of overall package for the farm scale FOW developments. It is expected that the experiences gained in this project and the methods developed will help accelerating the launch of the FOWF projects.</jats:p>",

Our estimates show that the annualized quarterly core PCE prices could reach 5.45% in the second quarter of 2022 and are as high as 8.57% in a longer time horizon unless corrected with restrictive monetary policies. Thus, the inflation shock since COVID-19 is not transitory, but it is persistent. As economists expect the Federal Reserve to tighten the money supply in March 2022, the insufficient policy responses may be attributed to a failure to incorporate a unique macroeconomic shock to unemployment during the pandemic. We propose a modified vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine structural shocks after COVID-19, and our proposed model performs well in forecasting future price levels in times of a pandemic.</jats:p>"

This demand is for an important part because of cobalt use in (electric vehicle) batteries. This study investigated the environmental impacts of the production of cobalt and how these could change in the future. We modeled possible future developments in the cobalt supply chain using four variables: (v1) ore grade, (v2) primary market shares, (v3) secondary market shares, and (v4) energy transition. These variables are driven by two metal‐demand scenarios, which we derived from scenarios from the shared socioeconomic pathways, a “business as usual” (BAU) and a “sustainable development” (SD) scenario. We estimated future environmental impacts of cobalt supply by 2050 under these two scenarios using prospective life cycle assessment. We found that the environmental impacts of cobalt production could likely increase and are strongly dependent on the recycling market share and the overall energy transition. The results showed that under the BAU scenario, climate change impacts per unit of cobalt production could increase by 9% by 2050 compared to 2010, while they decreased by 28% under the SD scenario. This comes at a trade‐off to other impacts like human toxicity, which could strongly increase in the SD scenario (112% increase) compared to the BAU scenario (71% increase). Furthermore, we found that the energy transition could offset most of the increase of climate change impacts induced by a near doubling in cobalt demand in 2050 between the two scenarios.</jats:p>",

Credit ratings, as an approximate but important measure of corporate credit risks, have been widely used by investors, creditors, and supply chain partners in their decision‐making. This study studies the role of supply chain information in predicting companies’ credit ratings. Using firm‐level supplier–customer linkages and corporate credit rating data, we develop a machine learning framework with gradient boosted decision trees to examine whether and what supply chain features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of credit ratings, and what types of supply chain links have higher information content that positively affects the predictability of the supply chain features. We construct a firm's supply chain variables from its supplier and customer portfolios. We show that incorporating supply chain features can improve prediction accuracy over the benchmark credit rating model using only the focal firm's features. Moreover, the informativeness of supply chain links in focal credit risk prediction depends on the focal firm's industry sector, the relationship strength of such links, and the switching costs. Finally, we develop a focal credit rating prediction model with a high accuracy level using supply chain factors solely, which can potentially be applied to predict credit risks of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) and private firms with no public financial information, as long as their supply chain information is available. </jats:p>",

Conditions for the sustainable development of an active system are presented in general form and then specified to the class of intertwined supply networks. As an illustration, a concise example of the dynamic Cournot duopoly and a detailed example of the model of Social and Private Interests Coordination Engines (SPICE-model) for a marketing network are considered and analytically investigated and sustainability conditions are established. An important conclusion is that the sustainable development of the active system is possible only under the viability conditions satisfied simultaneously with coordinating the interests of all active agents of the system.</jats:p>"

We present a novel function describing the volatile system as a whole. The new function, in turn, depends on three characteristic numbers, which means that the volatility of this system is characterized by those numbers. Using the data of the total electric power consumption and the total wind-solar power generation in Germany for the last seven years (2015–2021) taken every 15 minutes we determine the characteristic numbers from these data and get the result that marginalizing the volatility is possible with a minimum of required storage capacity, provided (i) a surplus of wind-solar power is supplied about doubling the number of devices, (ii) smart meters are installed, (iii) a different kind of wind turbines and solar panels is partially used. Our results suggest that all the present electric energy required in Germany can be obtained from wind-solar power if (i), (ii) and possibly (iii) are fulfilled. And our results indicate that, because of the minimal necessary storage capacity, controlled wind-solar power can in addition produce the energy for transportation, warm water, space heating and in part for process heating, requiring an increase of the electric energy production in total by a factor of 5. Then, however, a huge number of wind turbines and solar panels is required changing the appearance of German landscapes fundamentally. Our method can be applied to the wind-solar power problem of any country provided a reliable basis of power data exists over a sufficiently long period.</jats:p>",

Supply chains are part and parcel of every business and have multiple inefficiencies in the system. Some of these inefficiencies can be managed by usage of blockchain Platform .Technology, intracompany synergies, intercompany collaboration, extrinsic factors, and innovation are critically evaluated for adoption of blockchain in supply chain. A pilot study is conducted in form survey for analysis of these factors. Hypotheses are derived for these factors for quantitative research. Subsequently these hypotheses are examined with the help of ADANCO2.3 for structural equation modelling. As an outcome, it is evident that Innovation and Extrinsic factors are significantly impacting the adoption of blockchain in supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The intent of this study is to emphasize the relevance of sustainability in supply chain management in the textile and apparel industry. The industry with a long supply chain, starting with raw materials procuration, clothes manufacturing, and its distribution has been a major source of pollutants and waste generation. With the growing importance of sustainable development, companies feel the need to follow up with environmental standards in the apparel chain to keep up with their brand image and other brands. But as companies strive to cut their cost, reduce the manufacturing and distribution time, and keep up rapidly changing trends in a volatile market, it can be a demanding task. This paper is a review resource of over 250 studies regarding similar avenues and aims to provide the reader an overview of the developments in this field and the present scenario of this issue. It also aims to generate dialogue of subsequent future scope of research. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, it provides tangible data about the domain of this research.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore a new type of sustainable supply chain network (SSCN) that focuses on carbon neutrality and personalization. The first significance of the SSCN model is that it combines carbon neutrality and personalization problems into one research framework for the sustainable development of corporate management environments. In addition, evaluation and optimization mechanisms are crucial for decision-making in an SSCN. Thus, in this study, a creative evaluation and optimization mechanism was developed as a second significance for the sustainable development of the supply chain. The model used two evaluation indices (EIs) to measure the performance of the entire network in terms of the degree of personalization and carbon neutrality. The proposed SSCN is formulated as a mathematical model using mixed-integer nonlinear programming, and it is implemented by combining two types of approaches: hypergeometric distribution and a genetic algorithm. The results show the evaluation values and comparisons by the average values of transportation cost, handling cost, fixed costs, carbon dioxide emission cost, total cost, and average processing time. In addition to providing help for mass-customized production enterprises, this study also provided constructive suggestions for the conversion of small or venture enterprises to multi-variety and small-scale production, and it suggests the direction of job creation for such enterprises.</jats:p>"

We quantify to what extent inventory, promotions, delivery type, commitment changes, order variations, order cycle, and quality issues influence spoilage. We discuss the mechanisms through which inventory age and product standards impact spoilage of days-fresh products.

The HRIA aimed to assess the actual and potential human rights impacts at the production stage of the value chain in Morocco, to identify their root causes, and to provide recommendations to relevant stakeholders concerning their mitigation and/or remediation.  The assessment took just over a year and consisted of five phases of analysis using a methodology aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). The field phase took place between January and April 2021.  The HRIA was commissioned by Coop Sweden, who wanted a better picture of working conditions in the citrus sector and of the experiences of workers in seasonal production.</jats:p>"

For the food supply chain to cope with the raising issues an e-commerce type of supply chain must be implemented. This approach creates challenges for supply chain, because the food industry must shift towards high variety and low quantity freight forwarding with multiple delivery points. The methodology of the paper consists of scientific literature analysis and macro indicator clustering. The author of the paper proposes a supply chain management framework, which is grounded through complexity theory. The framework mainly consists of 3 characteristics, which organizations should operationalize to maintain system resilience and which in the long-run would evolve to sustainable development–capabilities, collaboration, complexity management. The proposed framework defines how operational and tactical levels should be automated through cyber-physical systems, while the automation should be controlled through strategic level variables. The macro level analysis of existing EU markets of the food industry has been conducted to identify the food industry’s contingencies, in which an agent-based model will be used to validate the proposed framework. Main 3 clusters were identified, which number was chosen based on the elbow method and validated with the silhouette score of 0.749. The food industry can be categorized in to developing, underdeveloped, and developed food industries. Moreover, singularities of different contingencies have been identified which considers population size, population density, market size of the food industry and disruption intensity. The application of the framework depends on the identified contingencies. From strategic level the SCMF is similar in all contingencies, however, depending on the type of market, more emphasize on vehicle routing or demand forecasting should be made.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interconnections between countries in a globalizing world continue to deepen and are central to the modern international economy. Yet, governance efforts to build resilience to the adverse risks and impacts of climate change are highly fragmented and have not sufficiently focused on these international dimensions. Relationships between people, ecosystems and economies across borders change the scope and nature of the climate adaptation challenge and generate climate risks that are transboundary (Challinor et al., 2017). Climate impacts in one country can create risks and opportunities – and therefore may require adaptation – in other countries, due to cross-border connectivity within regions and globally (Hedlund et al., 2018). These Transboundary Climate Risks (TCRs) may develop in one location remote from the location of their origin. This dynamic necessitates examining the governance structures for managing climate change adaptation. For example, with regard to trade and international supply chains, climate change impacts in one location can disrupt local economies and vulnerable people’s livelihoods, while also affecting the price, quality and availability of goods and services on international markets (Benzie et al., 2018). Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world with an immensely globalized supply chain. The global coffee sector involves more than 100 million people in over 80 countries. Coffee production and the livelihoods of smallholder coffee farmers around the world are at risk due to climate change, threatening to disrupt one of the world’s largest agricultural supply chains. The coffee supply chain represents an important arena for public and private actors to negotiate how resource flows should be governed and climate risks should be managed. Currently, neither governments nor private sector actors are sufficiently addressing TCRs (Benzie &amp; Harris, 2020) and no clear mandates exist for actors to take ownership of this issue. Furthermore, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main body for climate change policy and governance, does not provide any coherent recommendations on how to manage TCRs. This governance gap raises questions about what methods are likely to effectively reduce climate risk and be taken seriously by coffee market stakeholders. This policy brief explores different ways to govern TCRs, and how public and private actors view their effectiveness and legitimacy. Focusing on the Brazilian-German coffee supply chain, the brief presents a deductive framework of five governance pathways through which TCRs could be managed. It is based on 41 semi-structured interviews with 65 Brazilian and German public and private experts, including roasters, traders, cooperatives, associations and certification schemes, as well as government ministries, international development agencies, international organizations and civil society representatives.</jats:p>",

The latter calls for a methodological approach that allows a dynamic study under alternative policies in mitigating the disaster effects with a focus on creating sustainable CLSCs. For this reason, we provide a System Dynamics (SD)-based analysis for disaster events on the operation of CLSCs. By “disaster event”, we mean three different categories taking shape on the basis of duration. Furthermore, three different demand patterns emerging due to the disaster event are examined. We assume that the disaster event affects the manufacturer, and we examine the system response under different mitigation policies. For each demand pattern two different mitigation policies at the manufacturer level are examined by considering the total CLSC profit and demand backlog as measures of policy performance. For each combination, extensive simulation experimentation reveals sustainable policy recommendations under alternative settings regarding the reduction in the manufacturer’s production.</jats:p>"

The practical use of solar installations, both photovoltaic and directly water heating, has found widespread use, at the same time, the peculiarities of the introduction of these installations are due to the climatic and technical conditions of their use. For countries located in climatic zones with relatively cold climates, the development of water heating installations is most rational when they are used seasonally. The relatively low potential of the coolant, the frequency of heat supply in these installations, associated with the seasonality of their operation, time of day and weather, necessitate a number of technical solutions using additional equipment in the form of thermal energy accumulators, heat pumps and other equipment, which in any case must be combined with a traditional source of thermal energy operating on fossil fuels or electricity, performing the functions of both an additional and emergency source of thermal energy. Reserving the capacity of alternative energy sources is most efficient and least energy-consuming to carry out with heat sources using gaseous or degasified fuel. The use of electricity for the purposes of heat supply, with small capital investments, requires significant installed capacities of the heat source with a low coefficient of efficiency for primary fuel. In order to achieve the highest efficiency of energy use, thermal schemes of autonomous heat supply installations for objects using modern condensing boilers of low power and, together with them, various heat storage devices, providing year-round operation of equipment at heat supply facilities, are considered.</jats:p>"

In contrast, when the upstream supplier achieves the information advantage, the green product development modes affect neither the decisions nor the performance of supply chain members because the supplier discloses its CEA information through pricing and/or green level decisions. We further find that under the outsourcing mode, the supplier has more incentive to achieve CEA information superiority, which always improves the total environmental quality and may benefit the manufacturer; however, under the in-house mode, the supplier’s superior information benefits the manufacturer and itself as well as total environmental quality only under certain conditions. Finally, we show that the downstream CEA information disclosure under the outsourcing mode helps supply chain members achieve a Pareto improvement and increases the total environmental quality; this finding is contrary to the extant literature that focuses on demand intercept information disclosure.</jats:p>"

However, the prospect of green mussel farming which is quite large is still not realized by all fishermen so it is necessary to conduct research to determine the green mussel supply chain and see what opportunities from its business so that it can be developed. This is a descriptive research which is conducted in field and desk research. The results indicate the green mussel supply chain starts from farmers to distributors then to retailers and to end consumers, while supply chain players manage relationships between supply chain from upstream to downstream and vice versa well. Some of the green mussel business opportunities that are visible include selecting the Longline method to minimize costs and increase profits also suitable for high wave waters, farming is simple and does not require special treatment, lots of green mussel seeds are available in the waters, the profit from one longline is around Rp. 691,667, the location is close to PPI Lempasing (3 km in 8 minutes). In addition to developing the green mussel business, it is necessary to conduct a study that is in line with the government's efforts in formulating a strategy for developing the fishing industry in Bandar Lampung.</jats:p>"

This research is conducted with the data mining software, NetMiner 4, utilising the three analytical tools of statistical analysis, keyword network analysis, and topic analysis. The research also utilises the qualitative method of in-depth interviews in order to investigate current trends and perspectives on the future of sustainable packaging and to validate the analysis results. The research findings reveal that research in the field of ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’ field has been extremely limited, and this study acts to address this research gap. The results confirm that the vast majority of research focus has been in the fields of engineering and science. Research on the topic has gained momentum and has significantly increased since 2013 with research trends becoming increasingly diversified and gradually aligned with the concept of circular economy, while the topic of operational management has been highlighted as an area requiring additional attention. The keyword frequency analysis reveals the following highest occurring keywords in TF: life cycle; environmental impact; consumer; transportation; and production. The highest occurring keywords in TF-IDF: production; transportation; consumer; food; and environmental impact. Topic modelling revealed the following six topics: consumer behaviour; environmental pollution; circular economy; waste management; resource conservation; and operational management. This study contributes to understanding past, present, and future research agendas, and can be utilised as foundation for research development, as it provides insight to current research status and trends provided by the keyword network analysis highlighting research focus and trends in ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’.</jats:p>"

The biofouling propensity of the UF membrane was investigated. The results showed that after the single filtration using the gravitational-driven UF unit, E. coli cells were accumulated on the membrane surface and gave fair rejection of 86.35–90.22% for initial E. coli cells concentrations of 5,000 and 10,000 MPN/ 100 mL, respectively. On the other hand, the double GDU membrane unit (filtration in series) could enhance E. coli removal up to 97.70–99.03% based on initial E. coli cell of 5,000 and 10,000 MPN/100 mL, respectively. For river water as feed, it was found that the permeate is free of pathogenic cells. No significant E. coli cells were found on the membrane surface of second filtration unit. Although there is ten-fold flux decrement by using a double filtration unit, the module is able to polish the contaminated water to potable water quality. The membrane could be cleaned using the simple backwash and the flux could be recovered up to 94%. In overall, this study has demonstrated the potential of using gravitational-driven UF to remove pathogens from contaminated river water.</jats:p>",

In the present study, an experimental and numerical investigation was conducted to improve the rectangular labyrinth weir performance. In this context, four configurations were tested to evaluate the influence of the entrance shape and alveoli width on its discharge capacity. The experimental models, three models of rectangular labyrinth weir with a rounded entrance and one with a flat entrance, were tested in rectangular channel conditions for inlet width to outlet width ratios (a/b) equal to 0.67, 1 and 1.5. The results indicate that the rounded entrance increases the weir efficiency by up to 5%. A ratio a/b equal to 1.5 leads to an 8 and 18% increase in the discharge capacity compared to a/b ratio equal to 1 and 0.67, respectively. In addition, a numerical simulation was conducted using the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) OpenFOAM to analyze and provide more information about the flow behavior over the tested models. A comparison between the experimental and numerical discharge coefficient was performed and good agreement was found (mean absolute relative error of 4–6%).</jats:p>",

Firstly, the supply and demand relationship between the terminal area capacity and service resource consumption was analyzed based on the configuration of the terminal area route network, traffic flow characteristics and airspace safety, and security capacity requirements. Secondly, by defining a flight service probability matrix, a demand service time model and a maximum available service time model for the terminal area were developed. Based on the balance between the supply and demand of service resources, a model was constructed to forecast the capacity of the terminal area. Finally, the validity of the model was verified by simulation. The example results indicated that the difference between the limit and correction capacities obtained from the model calculations and the simulation results is lesser than 0.3 vehicles/hour. Both the results are consistent with the actual operation, thus proving the validity and reliability of the calculation model used in this study. It was also found that when the capacity is known, the model can calculate the maximum number of aircraft receiving services simultaneously within the terminal area at peak times. These findings suggest that the proposed model can provide a theoretical basis and reference for terminal area sectoring and traffic alerting.</jats:p>"

Potential paths to improve supply chain’s sustainability based on SSCF and AI are presented on the example of two internationally operating companies from the clothing industry using omnichannel. An exploratory case study has been conducted. Three methods were used to gather data: document/reports analysis, direct and participative observation and unstructured interviews. By implementing AI, supply chain leaders can more easily improve all key dimensions of sustainability, especially in the strategic field, based on strengthening partnership and cooperation with suppliers offering value-added materials that guarantee a competitive advantage. The paper contributes to the limited existing literature on SSCF and AI and disseminates this information to provide impetus, guidance and support toward increasing the productivity, efficiency, consistency and quality of service.</jats:p>"

This is intrinsically linked to the coexistence of saturated versus unsaturated, open-channel versus closed-conduit flow and laminar versus turbulent flows within these aquifers. These multiple dualities together with a lack of knowledge of their internal structure lead to increasing difficulties in the management of groundwater resources related to karst aquifers. However, karst aquifers constitute strategic fresh water resources and many stakeholders carry out withdrawals sometimes continuously or centered on the period of low water level as for the irrigation. These withdrawals generate discharge decreases that can constitute sources of conflicts between upstream and downstream users of the resource. In this study, we propose a methodology to assess the impact of withdrawals on the spring discharge of a karst aquifer based on a conceptual non-linear reservoirs model. This methodology is applied to the second largest karst system in France: The Touvre karst system (La Rochefoucauld). The simulated influence of the total withdrawals on runoff deficit is larger than the total withdrawals in relationship with the non-linearity of the conceptual models. Globally, this impact is about one and a half of the total withdrawal depending of the year under consideration. Moreover, we show that it also implies a decrease from 10% to 20% of the low-flow annual discharge. The next step will be to also address the issues raised by the climate change projections.</jats:p>"

A literature review was conducted in order to identify pertinent variables and propose relevant measuring items. An email survey was carried out in 423 Greek companies in the food and beverage sector. The questionnaire was sent by e-mail in the Google Forms format and it was requested to be answered by a representative of the company. The collected data was processed using exploratory factor analysis in order to extract the latent constructs of the SSCM critical factors, practices and performance measures. The validity of the proposed instrument was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. The extracted SSCM critical factors are “firm-level sustainability critical factors” and “supply chain sustainability critical factors”. The extracted SSCM practices are “supply chain collaboration” and “supply chain strategic orientation”. The extracted SSCM performance factors are “economic performance”, “social performance” and “environmental performance”. The three developed constructs constitute a measurement instrument that can be used both by practitioners who desire to implement SSCM and by researchers who can apply the proposed scales in other research projects or use them as assessment tools.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's environment, businesses are looking into cutting-edge strategies to improve their supply chain's cost and operational effectiveness. Cloud computing appears to be a promising technology that can help with this optimization by providing infrastructure, platform, and software solutions for the entire supply chain network over the Internet. The use of cloud-based services in supply chain management has financial and operational benefits, but all supply chain stakeholders should be aware of potential dangers and restrictions. Cloud computing can improve supply chain collaboration and infrastructure needs by allowing for more flexible outsourcing of software. Rather of sustaining and paying for maximum use, this technology proposes an approach that allows for flexibility in adding on the way, depending on the entire business process and supply chain network model. Aside from the normal tech hype, cloud computing has the potential to be an ideal technology for supporting and managing a constantly changing and dynamic network, and thus for supply chain management (SCM). This paper provides an overview of cloud-based supply chain management. A quick introduction to cloud technologies is given first. The factors of cloud computing which effect supply chain activities is then examined, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating this technology into current supply chains. Finally, findings are offered, as well as future study directions.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the supply and demand relationship between the terminal area capacity and service resource consumption was analyzed based on the configuration of the terminal area route network, traffic flow characteristics and airspace safety, and security capacity requirements. Secondly, by defining a flight service probability matrix, a demand service time model and a maximum available service time model for the terminal area were developed. Based on the balance between the supply and demand of service resources, a model was constructed to forecast the capacity of the terminal area. Finally, the validity of the model was verified by simulation. The example results indicated that the difference between the limit and correction capacities obtained from the model calculations and the simulation results is lesser than 0.3 vehicles/hour. Both the results are consistent with the actual operation, thus proving the validity and reliability of the calculation model used in this study. It was also found that when the capacity is known, the model can calculate the maximum number of aircraft receiving services simultaneously within the terminal area at peak times. These findings suggest that the proposed model can provide a theoretical basis and reference for terminal area sectoring and traffic alerting.</jats:p>"

As more and more people are opting to use this service, a huge number of mobile accounts are opened every day and a substantial amount of money is deposited, withdrawn and transferred frequently through the mobile network. This ever-increasing amount of mobile money flowing through the network may have a sizeable impact on the overall money supply of the country. Thus far, no systematic study has been conducted to quantify the impact of the mobile money on the conventional money supply of Bangladesh. In this study, we attempt to quantify the contribution of mobile money on the money supply which is an important quantity-based nominal anchor of monetary policy in Bangladesh. Apart from deriving algebraic relationships between money supply and e-money, here we have empirically shown that during the 03 years span of 2018-2021, MFS transactions account for nearly 10.88% and 11.29% of total narrow and broad money supply of Bangladesh as on January 2021. Besides, we also qualitatively discuss the impact of e-money on an important price-based nominal anchor of monetary policy in Bangladesh, i.e., interest rate. Based upon the above discussion, here we argue that MFS can act as an effective tool to slash interest rate by a reasonable proportion through adding significantly to the overall supply of money in Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

It is concluded that the surge current and peak voltage generated by the boost circuit are the main causes of electromagnetic interference. According to the reasons, the electromagnetic interference suppression measures are proposed. It mainly includes three measures, namely adding capacitors at both ends of the switching tube, adding a filter circuit at the low voltage input end of the switching power supply, adding an optical coupler equipment and adding a common-differential-mode synthetic choke coil filter. These measures all effectively reduce the influence of electromagnetic interference of the switching power supply, and they are beneficial to improve the reliability of the switching power supply.</jats:p>",

Agriculture and development activities in floodplains affect the floodplain shape over the length, leading in a converging compound channel. Few laboratory investigations proved overbank flow in converging floodplains. Therefore, innovative and precise approaches are still in great demand. In this paper, new approach has been proposed to forecast the water surface profile of various compound channels with converging floodplains using gene expression programming (GEP). The models are constructed utilising pertinent experimental data from past studies. A new equation is devised to compute water surface profile in such channels using non-dimensional geometric and flow parameters such as converging angle, width ratio, relative distance, relative depth, aspect ratio and bed slope. The findings demonstrate that the GEP-derived water surface profile is in good correlation with the experimental data and data from other studies (R2 = 0.99 and RMSE = 0.028 for the training data and R2 = 0.99 and RMSE = 0.027 for the testing data). According to the results of statistically based investigations, the GEP model created for the study of compound channel flow is reliable and can be used in this domain.</jats:p>",

The most frequent UTPs are late payments (39.6%), payments unrelated to a specific transaction (39.6%), and unilateral changes by buyers in contracts and orders. The results of the probit model show that producer organisations decrease the probability of UTPs relative to conditions in which the main buyer is a private trader (by 32%) or supermarket (by 35%). This result provides some justification for the support of producer organisations under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors of the world’s economy and society. Firms need to have disaster recovery and business sustainability plans and to be able to generate profits in order to develop. Trade credit may be a good way for firms to free up cash flow and finance short-term growth. Extensions of payment will provide firms with low-cost loans under the COVID-19 credit guarantee scheme. Implementation of hybrid trade credit activities has been shown to improve the financial crisis of many firms, and the effects are particularly evident within two-echelon supply chains. An economic order quantity (EOQ) model is derived under conditions of deteriorating items, an upstream full trade credit or cash discount, and downstream partial trade credit in a supply chain. A computer program is developed to provide a numerical solution and a numerical example is used to show the solution’s form and verify that the solution gives the minimum total cost per unit time.</jats:p>"

Doctors prescribe too much fentanyl, Demerol, and sleeping pills, along with anxiety medications, that are legal and frequently abused. In order to combat prescription drug abuse, it is imperative to develop an efficient monitoring and identification system. Blockchain technology is a promising solution to tracking prescriptions because of its decentralization and auditability, which allow medical records to be more secure as well as more reliable. Blockchain technology can help ensure the authenticity, integrity, and transparency of drug distribution between pharmacies and doctors. In this paper, we aim to develop a system of managing the integrity of the drug supply chain by integrating Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology with Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Because of its secure encryption framework and anti-fraud and anti-forgery measures, it has prevented prescription abuse. A smart health care ecosystem is created by using smart contracts to track drugs on the blockchain. In addition, by using this approach we are able to recognize and track drugs that may be misused by individuals who shop for doctors and hop between pharmacies. The cryptographically safe and reliable framework created by Healthcare Chain can be used by doctors, pharmacists, and patients to improve how opioid prescriptions and medication are administered.</jats:p>",

In the standard problem of optimal income taxation, the role of income distribution is to aggregate the labor supply effects of taxation.

Geomorphological and hydrological parameters of the watershed were extracted using GIS measurement tools. The data identified various parameters (time to peak, time of base, and peak flow) of the synthetic unit hydrograph. The peak discharge (Qp in m3 s−1 cm−1) of rainfall excess for different time durations (5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 360, and 720 minutes) was estimated. The results revealed that the peak discharge (Qp) decreased with the increase in time of rainfall excess. The maximum peak discharge (27.5 in m3 s−1 cm−1) was reached 84 minutes after the beginning of the rainfall storm for 5 minutes of rainfall excess whereas the minimum peak discharge (5.2 in m3 s−1 cm−1) was reached after 7 hours and 22 minutes for 12 hours of rainfall excess. Geographic information system (GIS) data-based SCS synthetic unit hydrograph model was verified by comparing the simulated runoff with the estimated runoff from measured rainfall data of the watershed.</jats:p>",

Because a wholesale price contract cannot coordinate the supply chain due to misaligned incentives of supply chain parties, we explore what common coordinating contracts in the classical coordination literature can continue coordinating the supply chain with the IS adoption. Interestingly, our analysis appears to reveal the power of simplicity: some simple classical coordinating contracts (e.g., the buy‐back and revenue‐sharing contracts), though not designed with the IS consideration, still coordinate the supply chain, whereas other more complicated classical contracts (e.g., the quantity flexibility and sales rebate contracts) fail to do so. We derive a general condition for supply chain coordination and show that any contract with a newsvendor‐like transfer payment can coordinate the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Digital transformation and the adoption of new technologies could support the development of sustainable strategies, as they support supply chain processes, decrease operational costs, enable control and monitoring of operations and support green practices. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between sustainable supply chain management and digital transformation through the adoption of specific technologies (Blockchain technology, big data analytics, internet of things). It aims at theory building and the development of a conceptual framework, enabling the explanation of under which circumstances the above combination could lead to the development of sustainable performances. It also aims to examine how companies can increase their competitive advantage and/or increase their business performance, contributing both to academics and practitioners. After conducting a literature review analysis, a significant gap was detected. There are a few studies providing theoretical approaches to examining all three pillars of sustainability, while at the same time analyzing the impact of big data analytics, internet of things and blockchain technology on the development of sustainable supply chains. Aiming to address this gap, this paper primarily conducts a literature review, identifies definitions and theories used to explain the different pillars of flexibility, and examines the effect of different technologies. It then develops a theoretical conceptual framework, which could enable both academics and practitioners to examine the impact of the adoption of different technologies on sustainable supply chain management. The findings of this research reveal that digital transformation plays an important role to companies, as the combination of different technologies may lead to the development of significant capabilities, increasing sustainable performances and enabling the development of sustainable strategies, which can improve companies’ position in the market.</jats:p>"

The subject of research is the energy losses when pumping drilling fluid from a platform supply vessel to an oil platform. The research was carried out on a vessel with deadweight of 3840 tons. It has been experimentally established that for a drilling fluid with an initial density of 1272 kg/m3 for transportation within 6–48 hours, the following changes in rheological characteristics occur:\n– a layer with a density of 1235–962 kg/m3 is formed on the surface of the cargo tank;\n– a layer with a density of 1283–1422 kg/m3 is formed in the bottom part of the tank;\n– sedimentation resistance decreases by 3.89–47.82 %.\nA variant of modernization of the drilling fluid transportation system by installing additional circulation pumps providing forced circulation of the drilling fluid between cargo tanks is proposed. Additional circulation of the drilling fluid with an initial density of 1272 kg/m3 for transportation within 6–48 hours ensures that the rheological characteristics are maintained in the following range:\n– density on the surface of the cargo tank 1270–1232 kg/m3;\n– density in the bottom of the tank 1288–1338 kg/m3;\n– decrease in sedimentation resistance 1.42–7.92 %.\nSimilar results were established for drilling fluid with an initial density of 1323 kg/m3 and 1188 kg/m3.\nTo reduce energy losses, the process of unloading the fluid onto the oil platform is proposed to be performed at the completion of the technological process of unloading the vessel. At the same time, due to a decrease in draft and an increase in the height of the freeboard of the vessel, the static component of the pressure and hydraulic losses of the cargo pump decrease.\nA set of studies for drilling fluids with different initial density (1272 kg/m3, 1188 kg/m3, 1323 kg/m3) confirmed that when using additional X-shaped drilling fluid circulation:\n– relative performance of cargo pumps increases from 37–57 % to 88–96 %;\n– the time of pumping the drilling fluid from the vessel to the oil platform is reduced from 7.1–8.5 to 3.3–3.8 hours.\nThe presented results confirm the expediency of using additional X-shaped circulation of the drilling fluid to reduce energy losses during transportation by Platform Supply Vessels.</jats:p>"

However, this practice causes increasing difficulties and undesirability of traditional transactions or interactions. Accordingly, various manufacturing firms around the world have become more committed not only to accelerating the development of digital technologies, but also to integrating them with existing processes. In this study, we address an important issue of how manufacturing firms can adapt to the ever-changing volatility and unpredictable global business environment, and achieve sustainable growth by developing a strong supply chain management capability. Two specific interrelated research questions are considered: (1) How do supply chain management capabilities contribute to firm environmental performance; and (2) What are the sources of such capabilities? In so doing, we integrate various forms of digital innovation into a supply chain management capability logic to explore their antecedents and consequences. By using survey data from 272 manufacturing firms in China, we examine the relationship between three key forms of digital innovation (i.e., product, platform, and service) and firm environmental performance. Results show that digital product, platform, and service innovations all have positive contributions to supply chain management capability. In turn, supply chain management capabilities have a partial mediating effect between digital product innovation and firm environmental performance, but a full mediating effect between digital platform and service innovations and firm environmental performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Outsourcing is one of the major challenges for production firms in the current supply chain management (SCM) due to limited skilled workers and technology resources. There are too many parameters involved in the strategic decisions of the outsourcing level, quantity, quality, and cost. The outsourcing process removes the burden of capital investment; however, still it creates crucial concerns related to inventory control and production management by adding extra inventories. The semi-finished products are outsourced for a few processes due to limited resources and then returned to the manufacturer for the finishing operations. The article is based on the mathematical modeling and optimization of the process outsourcing considering imperfect production with variable quantity for the effective supply chain management. The numerical experiment was performed based on the data taken from the industry for the application of the proposed outsourcing-based SCM model. The results are significant in finding optimal production and outsourcing quantity with a minimum total cost of SCM. The sensitivity analysis was performed to see how important the effect of input parameters is on the total cost. The research is an important contribution in developing a mathematical model of process outsourcing in SCM. The research study is beneficial for managers to find the economic feasibility of process outsourcing for managing inventory and supply chain between manufacturer and outsourcing vendor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main trend in the development of district heating systems in recent years is a decrease in the temperature of heat carrier, based on the desire to include renewable energy sources in such systems. Despite the ever-increasing demands on the thermal envelope of buildings, lowering the temperature entails the need to increase the area of heating appliances. In turn, this leads to an increase in material consumption of heating systems, increasing their hydraulic resistance and design problems. In order to avoid or at least reduce these negative consequences of the struggle to increase the environmental friendliness and energy efficiency of district heating systems, it is necessary to intensify the heat dissipation of heating appliances. The existing designs of sectional aluminium radiators, which are the most promising for improving their thermal performance, have reached a certain limit in the design, to overcome which it is necessary to change the technology of manufacturing the heat dissipating element of the section. The article shows the reasons for the emergence of such a limit for the existing design of devices, formulates requirements for advanced designs and shows the way to achieve higher thermal performance. The article presents the results of calculations that confirm the presence of the detected limit of thermal performance of existing structures of sectional aluminium radiators. Based on the analysis of existing designs and the identified limits of their further development, a new design of aluminium sectional heating device is proposed, which allows to bypass and overcome the limitations that are characteristic of existing ones. The results of calculations showing the possibilities of intensification of heat transfer of a sectional aluminium device are given. At the same heat output, the dimensions of the proposed radiator will be about thirty percent smaller than the size of existing appliances. The article presents the results of tests of prototypes of sectional radiators of the new design, manufactured using new technology. Devices consisting of seven sections of three sizes in height were investigated: 293 mm, 596 mm, 1097 mm. The results of the study confirmed previous theoretical developments. The tests were conducted in a laboratory certified according to European Union standards at the Institute of Heating and Sanitary Engineering in Radom (Poland).</jats:p>"

The object of the study is St. Sophia Cathedral – a monument of architecture, history and monumental painting of national importance, which is a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. The location of it in the city centre determines the influence of adverse outdoor conditions, in particular, high air pollution, and the attraction of the site – a high level of attendance and, as a result, dynamic changes in the indoor parameters of the air environment. The existing regime of heat, moisture and gases in the St. Sophia Cathedral is periodic with characteristic maxima of temperature and relative humidity values in different areas of the building when people visit it. Three series of natural studies of the air environment parameters in the Cathedral were carried out. The first series was held on 02 October 2019 at an outdoor temperature of plus 18.9 °C and a relative humidity of 47.5 % with the ventilation system turned off and on before the start of the heating season. The second series of measurements was carried out on 12-14 November 2019 at an outside air temperature of plus 8.9 °C and a relative humidity of 73 % with the ventilation turned off and the heating turned on. The third series of measurements was carried out on 08 February 2020 at an outside air temperature of minus 3.2 °C and a relative humidity of 56.2 % with ventilation off and heating on. An analysis of the results indicates the need for reconstruction and modernization of the engineering microclimate systems and heat supply of the Cathedral. Currently, the physical deterioration of heating and ventilation systems is 75-85%. They need immediate reconstruction and change of operating mode. Taking into account the performed field studies, a project for the modernization of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems was developed.</jats:p>"

Many multinational companies are moving towards reduction of carbon emission across its various operations. Carbon neutrality is the process where steps are taken to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions. This article proposes measures to achieve carbon neutrality across the supply chain globally. As part of its sustainability initiative, organizations have decided to reduce carbon consumption across their plants. This calls for estimation of carbon dioxide emissions and reducing the carbon footprint in the entire supply chain process. It also involves gauging greenhouse CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions during the transportation process for all TMC regions and transportation models used by various companies. The main calculations include total CO<jats:sub>2 </jats:sub>emissions, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions per ton of goods transported, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions per transport Km. These calculations are done based on factors such as full truck load, less truck load, sea mode of transportation, and air mode of transportation. An analysis is performed on the resulting calculation figures for different modes of transportation such as road, air, and sea. The analysis shows that there is an increase in overall CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> for air mode of transportation. The least increase in overall Co<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is sea mode of transportation. Through this analysis, it helps the company to take better decisions regarding the mode of transportation that they need to adopt to achieve carbon neutrality.</jats:p>",

However, I argue that this phenomenon is dependent on the riskiness of the firm. Better quality firms choose to concentrate debt structure when supply is abundant whereas low‐quality firms may have little or no choice. I hypothesize that firms concentrate debt structure as a way to enhance negotiating leverage over creditors and increase the value of their strategic default option.</jats:p>",

To fulfill the requirements of this huge urban housing shortage, it is necessary to formulate a system that will be able to supply affordable housing rapidly without compromising sustainability. Prefabricated construction technology (PCT) has the potential to provide significant environmental and economic benefits, hence gaining popularity as a viable alternative solution to on-site construction. There are many debatable issues associated with PCT prevailing among the stakeholders, which are preventing the adoption of PCT. Thus, this research aims to analyze the current scenario of PCT, its potential to supply sustainable affordable housing. It also attempts to address major challenges that need to be addressed with possible recommendations to enable the easy adoption of PCT as an efficient supply method for sustainable affordable housing.</jats:p>",

The use of GIS (geographical information system) in this project is to prepare a schematic map and identify water demand, which is done by several relevant parameters. Mapping of the MIDC area can be done by geo sensing or by capturing drone images. Then these images are transferred to arc GIS Where the digitization of images is done and attribute tables are filled with data such as consumers’ water demand, consumers’ water meter readings. As the available drawings and data were around 30-year-old, all the drawings are prepared on AutoCAD with the latest information. Along with satellite images and drone images of the MIDC area DGPS (Differential global positioning system) survey is also done to generate topographical data. Application\\improvements: this study concludes what parameters are required for a feasibility study of the water supply system and application of GIS for carrying out the project and its application in the mapping of utilities of industrial areas in MIDC. GIS is used over another method because of its high accuracy and its capability to show all the utilities which also include underground utilities, structures, and any other such assets in the real world. With all these advantages GIS has an edge over any other method of surveying and data collection which then allows theda decisions decide on planning and execution also with the data collected augmentation can be done if required.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the temporal variations in these three factors is given relatively less attention in healthcare accessibility research, which mislead the wise policy decisions of healthcare planners. This study aims to examine the spatiotemporal variability of accessibility to primary healthcare services and identify areas with spatial discrepancy between time-varying and static accessibility models in Seoul, South Korea. <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: Using the generalized two-step floating catchment area method, we measure time-varying spatial accessibility with <jats:italic>de facto</jats:italic> population from hourly-collected mobile-based data, available healthcare facilities, and actual traffic conditions in Seoul, South Korea. Additionally, the bivariate Local Moran’s <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> allowed for the identification of the areas with discrepancy between the two accessibility models.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: The results show that a geographical pattern of time-varying accessibility significantly differs with that of static accessibility. Time-varying accessibility is lower in commercial areas and higher in residential areas, compared with static accessibility, whose accessibility is higher in central Seoul. The result of the bivariate Local Moran’s <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> analysis highlights that ignoring time variations of the three factors will result in overestimation in commercial areas and underestimation in residential areas. Based on the discrepancy between the two models, we typified overestimated areas and underestimated areas as attention needed and false attention areas, respectively.<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: We suggest areas in which the healthcare policy needs to pay more attention by identifying areas with spatial discrepancies between time-varying accessibility and static accessibility. Considering the time variations will provide a more realistic impression of spatial accessibility to primary healthcare.</jats:p>"

The prevalent theories and models consider that energy supply from the vascular system to different brain regions is adjusted both dynamically and in the course of development and evolution to meet the<jats:italic>demands</jats:italic>of neuronal activity. In this perspective, we offer an alternative view: that regional rates of energy use might be mostly constrained by<jats:italic>supply</jats:italic>, given the properties of the brain capillary network, the highly stable rate of oxygen delivery to the whole brain under physiological conditions, and homeostatic constraints. We present evidence that these constraints, based on capillary density and tissue oxygen homeostasis, are similar between brain regions and mammalian species, suggesting they derive from fundamental biophysical limitations. The same constraints also determine the relationship between regional rates of brain oxygen supply and usage over the full physiological range of brain activity, from deep sleep to intense sensory stimulation, during which the apparent uncoupling of blood flow and oxygen use is still a predicted consequence of supply limitation. By carefully separating “energy cost” into energy supply and energy use, and doing away with the problematic concept of energetic “demands,” our new framework should help shine a new light on the neurovascular bases of metabolic support of brain function and brain functional imaging. We speculate that the trade-offs between functional systems and even the limitation to a single attentional spot at a time might be consequences of a strongly supply-limited brain economy. We propose that a deeper understanding of brain energy supply constraints will provide a new evolutionary understanding of constraints on brain function due to energetics; offer new diagnostic insight to disturbances of brain metabolism; lead to clear, testable predictions on the scaling of brain metabolic cost and the evolution of brains of different sizes; and open new lines of investigation into the microvascular bases of progressive cognitive loss in normal aging as well as metabolic diseases.</jats:p>"

The digital transformation of the supply chains provides enormous benefits to organizations by empowering collaboration among multiple internal and external organizations and systems. This study presents a narrative review explaining the existing knowledge on digital transformation in supply chain process management using text mining. It summarizes the existing literature to explain the current state of the art in supply chain digitalization. This comprehensive review identifies the most important topics and technologies and determines the future trends in this emerging field. We investigate the articles published in Web of Science and Scopus databases and use text mining techniques (clustering and topic modeling) on the article contents. Using VOS viewer, a bibliometric analysis of 395 articles with 12,700 references is analyzed. The contents of the articles are explored using text mining approaches. The synthesized results reveal that the most important topics in digital transformation are “sustainable supply chain management” and “circular economy and industry 4.0 technologies”. The study further discovers big data, data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things as the most critical technologies for facilitating supply chain digital transformation. Finally, an overlay heatmap analysis of the research articles found that digital transformation, supply chain management, industry 4.0, decision-making, and sustainability are emerging trends in supply chain digitalization.</jats:p>"

Firstly, we investigate a benchmark scenario of an integrated supply chain with freshness effort and consideration of decreases in both the quality and quantity of produce while in the supply chain. Secondly, we introduce call, put, and bidirectional option contracts to mitigate risks of the retailer. A call option contract can reduce the underage risk, while a put option contract can reduce the overage risk, and a bidirectional option contract can reduce bilateral risks. We derive the optimal ordering decisions and freshness-keeping effort for a retailer in a supply chain of fresh produce with option contracts, and the conditions for achieving coordination of the supply chain. We find that the bidirectional option results in the highest option price and lowest option order quantity, while the call option results in the lowest initial order quantity and the put option results in the highest initial order quantity. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the impacts of various parameters on optimal decision-making.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today buildings should be designed for energy efficiency class not less than C. This requires ventilation with heat recovery. On the market, there are different compact heat recovery ventilation units for decentralized ventilation. Regenerative ventilators represent a promising area of effective ventilation with exhaust air heat recovery. They operate cyclically for the inlet and outlet of air. These kinds of ventilators should work in a blocked pair(s) – one for input and one for output in each pair. If not, the effectiveness will decrease. A mathematical model of the ceramic heat regenerator in the regenerative ventilator “Twin Fresh” by Vents has been created to improve the efficiency of its operation. In previous works, on the basis of two different approaches, the operation of the heat regenerator was simulated. The first one uses M. Mikheev’s formula for the Nusselt number. The second one is computational fluid dynamic simulation by SolidWorks Flow Simulation. The efficiency coefficients obtained as a result of the simulation had a significant difference – up to 66.5 %. The aim of the work is to find alternative methods for adequately determining the efficiency of the ventilator. A mathematical simulation was performed using a different formula from “Novyi spravochnik khimika i tekhnologa. Protsessy i aparaty khimicheskikh tekhnologii”. This formula takes into account the Grashof number. Values obtained are significantly different from both previous ones – up to two times. There is no information in the literature about the experimental conditions for determining the Nusselt number, which was used in the simulation. Therefore, we can’t assume, what approach is closer to the conditions of the ceramic regenerator. There is a need to conduct experimental studies to determine the efficiency of the regenerative heat exchanger.</jats:p>"

This study aims to investigate the effect of climate change on the monthly groundwater level in the Golpayegan aquifer in the future (2017–2032). After a spatio-temporal analysis, the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) model was used to simulate the monthly groundwater level in the historical period (2002–2017). The input data included precipitation, temperature, pan evaporation, soil moisture (from the ESA CCA SM product), and groundwater level in observation wells on a monthly time-scale. Future climatic data were downloaded from the CanEsm5 model of CMIP6 for the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios and then downscaled using the Change Factor Approach (CFA). The spatial analysis of groundwater levels indicated four different behaviors in the observation wells in the Golpayegan aquifer, resulting in four different clusters using the AGNES clustering method. Historical and future period modeling were performed separately for each of the four observation wells from each cluster. The modeling in the historical period demonstrated an average of NRMSE (0.09), MBE (0.030), and R2 (0.94) for the four clusters. The groundwater level in all clusters showed a decreasing trend in the future period, with SSP5-8.5 (average: 3.9 cm/month) showing a greater decrease than the SSP1-2.6 (average: 0.5 cm/month) scenario. The decline in groundwater level under SSP5-8.5 compared with SSP1-2.6 was more, respectively, 4.8, 5.8, 9.9 and 3.7 metres for clusters 1–4. The results indicate the acceptable efficiency and accuracy of the LSSVR model results in evaluating the effects of climate change on groundwater levels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the automotive domain, the vast majority of testing is performed through simulations, which can validate a system design before the actual implementation and can emphasize eventual faults in the design process. Hence, the simulation is of utmost importance. Behavioral models are necessary for the creation of each electronic device desired in the system, and some of the components have very complex behavior: low-dropout linear voltage regulators (LDOs), gate drivers, and switching regulators. In the automotive industry, LDOs are essential components because they power all the other subsystems and very accurate behavior is needed to make sure that the system behaves as in reality. LDO models are already commercially available and most of their intrinsic characteristics are modeled (dropout voltage, line regulation, load regulation, etc.). However, one characteristic that is extremely useful, yet the hardest to model, is the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). This paper proposes a new PSRR modeling technique for automotive low-dropout voltage regulators. The new PSRR characteristic was modeled for an automotive LDO product in a Texas Instruments portfolio, which has a commercially available model, and was simulated using the PSpice Allegro simulator and the OrCAD Capture CIS environment.</jats:p>"

The daily electricity generated and transmitted data, daily distribution companies (DISCOs) electricity demand and consumption data, and data of transmission lines connected to other neighbouring countries (international lines) within the year 2018 and 2020 were used for the analysis. Also, the extrapolation of the monthly energy of each of the data obtained was computed. The analysis was done and graphs and results obtained showed that daily average electricity day-ahead demand by DISCOs varied majorly between 3.5GW to 4GW with a corresponding increase above 4GW and the total daily day-ahead electricity demand by DISCOs varied majorly between 80GW and 90GW from 2018 to 2020. But despite this demand, the study showed that distribution companies did not at any time pick up to their declared load demand despite being the major electricity stakeholder in electricity delivery to consumers. Also, some generating station units were not generating to their capacity due to fault and gas constraints and some generating stations were connected to the grid without using free governor mode (control required for the generating units to respond to the state of electricity demand on the grid in real-time). The study recommends that the government should ensure proper monitoring and impose necessary sanctions if needs be on any electricity stakeholders and participants who violate the Nigeria Electricity Supply Market Rules for effective and the Nigeria grid code created for efficient power delivery. The government should, as a matter of urgency, start the expansion of her generating stations as well as developing new ones considering other sources for power generation such as wind and solar which are predominately abundant in the northern part of the country. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In studies of low consumption in China, there is a lack of consideration of land policy, which may be an important factor contributing to the industrial structure, thus impacting consumption. This paper explores the relationship between local governments’ distorted land supply strategies and final consumption and its mechanism of action based on panel data for 31 provinces in China from 2002 to 2017, using a fixed-effects panel model and a mediating-effects model. The results show that (1) the ratio of industrial land supply area to the land supply area of commercial and residential significantly suppresses the final consumption rate, and the results remain significant after robustness tests; (2) the effect of land supply structure on final consumption is related to the development strategy adopted by local governments and the urban–rural inequity, thus showing heterogeneity, with regions with high economic growth and large urban–rural income gaps further contributing to the suppression of consumption rates; (3) the intermediation effect suggests that the structure of land supply affects consumption through the industrial structure. As land supply favors the development of industrial enterprises, it increases the ratio of gross capital formation to GDP and can have a crowding-out effect on the income of the household sector, thus reducing the rate of final consumption. Under the Chinese decentralization system, in order to achieve regional economic development, local governments intervene in the allocation of land resources among different industries through differentiated land supply strategies, resulting in an industrial structure dominated by the secondary industry, which has an important impact on consumption. Therefore, the reform of the land supply structure should be accelerated to restrain the excessive intervention of local governments in the land supply structure and promote the transformation of the economic development model to enhance consumption.</jats:p>"

Specifically, areas of businesses depending mainly on internal supply chain capacity are experiencing a paradigm shift to ensure effective company performance regarding purchases, production, company sales, and product distribution. This shift means that challenges faced by the internal chain supply unit can be solved by adopting and adapting IoT as a new way to minimize work delays and save time. Moreover, IoT automatically leads to performance and productivity increases. Therefore, the present paper aims to justify adopting and adapting IoT applications in Indonesian companies, including retail businesses. Most companies’ internal supply chain units face several difficulties during and after the devastating peak of COVID-19, which has led to a total global lockdown. These problems' complexity is exponential and requires innovative ways to solve their prevailing challenges. This study used observation, interview, and documentary research methods through a large-scale survey. The survey obtained the necessary information regarding how companies utilize IoT to improve their performance and productivity without hindering their internal supply chain and production units. The study concluded that the adoption of IoT, if well implemented, leads to a sustainable company and uninterrupted supply chain performance, indicating the proper performance of the organization. Doi: 10.28991/esj-2021-SP1-017 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

With certain ratios between specific heat and electricity consumption in production, the enterprise is forced to buy a certain part of the electricity in the district power system (DPS) to prevent the discharge of steam exhausted by the turbine into the atmosphere or to deliver excess electricity of its own generation to the DPS. The problem cited in the article indicates that the choice is determined by the prices for fuel for CHP and the ratio between the prices for electricity purchased in the DPS and delivered to the DPS. Although electricity consumption in the production of sugar does not exceed 11% of the energy of the fuel, it is profitable to generate it in excess (turbine generators operate at maximum, close to the nominal mode) and deliver it to the distribution zone at a price higher than the cost. The proposed method for selecting operating modes for CHP turbine plants using the example of a sugar plant, which can also be used for the construction industry, as well as a method for determining energy costs for all operating modes of a sugar plant turbine plant. The influence of the cost of electricity in the distribution zone on the choice of the mode of operation of turbine plants of the CHP, which provide the minimum financial costs for the energy supply of the enterprise, has been established. A method for determining the standard size of a CHP turbine plant that satisfies the specific indicators of heat and electricity consumption of an enterprise is presented.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology offers transparency of energy consumption reports. Blockchain keeps all the transactional records and guarantees security, and decentralization between the blockchain network. Blockchain technology integration for energy consumption can promote transparency and integrity of energy management reporting. Among the reasons for companies’ reluctance to report energy consumption is non-transparency, the unnecessary cost for the report, and lack of regulation to release an energy consumption report or it is voluntary in best cases. This paper reviewed 121 papers related to the topic and conclusions drawn based on findings of previous literature. Blockchain can help to alleviate the issues of transparency and cost related to energy reporting. Decision and policymakers should offer incentives and include regulations on energy reporting requirements. The reporting should be requested through a blockchain network to guarantee transparency and integrity.</jats:p>"

In the Northeastern U.S., for example, producers often argue that lack of access to slaughter and processing facilities limits expansion potential, whereas slaughterers and processors posit that there is not enough supply to keep plants fully utilized. We develop an optimization model to determine whether the existing slaughter and processing infrastructure in the region meets producers’ demand for these services. The model allows us to identify the minimum‐cost solution to efficiently utilize those facilities and to assess relative costs associated with product handling. The analysis explores the spatial structure of the Northeast beef cattle assembly, slaughter, processing, and distribution system that might result if these supply chain activities were regionally coordinated. We find that a consolidated network that allows for coordination of the regional beef supply chain system can address possible bottlenecks of plant capacity. This study sheds light on ways to establish and improve regional coordination mechanisms to enhance efficiency in regional food systems.</jats:p>",

By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods.</jats:p>"

We formulated a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to minimize the total supply chain cost, including the B2B orders’ packaging, handling, and transportation, with carbon emission taxation. Furthermore, the purchasing cost of the RFID tags and IoT facilities that were provided on the transport vehicles was high. The proposed model was solved by using the global solver in the LINGO software package and finding the optimized value of the total supply chain network cost. We tested the proposed model in different case scenarios, i.e., small- to significant-sized problems. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the variations in the overall cost of the supply chain network when there were changes in the main parameters of the proposed model. The results of the models showed that models can be helpful for efficient logistics planning and supply chain design.</jats:p>"

Our results show that the manufacturers’ misreporting strategies lead to higher profits for them, which means that manufacturers tend to misreport the green degree of the products. However, the manufacturer’s misreporting strategy will put the retailer and the whole supply chain in a disadvantageous position and, hence, reduce the profit of the retailer and the whole supply chain. In addition, we also show that the manufacturer’s misreporting strategy only affects the greenness of the product and does not affect the pricing decisions of the manufacturer, the retailer and the whole supply chain. Finally, we design a revenue-sharing contract to achieve the coordination of the supply chain, which provides managerial insights for the decision makers of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Based on the data of geological stratum in Guanzhong area and the actual engineering application of medium-deep geothermal buried pipe heating system in Xi’an New Area, the influence law of medium-deep geothermal buried pipe heat exchanger on surrounding geotechnical soil is simulated and analyzed by FLUENT software. The results show that: after four months of heating operation, in the upper layer of the geotechnical soil, the reverse heat exchange zone appears due to the higher fluid temperature; in the lower layer of the geotechnical soil, the temperature decreases more with the increase of depth and shows a linear increase in the depth direction; without considering the groundwater seepage, after eight months of thermal recovery of the geotechnical soil after heating, the maximum temperature difference after recovery is 3.02 ℃, and the average temperature difference after recovery is 1.30 ℃ The maximum temperature difference after recovery was 3.02 ℃ and the average temperature difference after recovery was 1.30 ℃. The geotechnical thermal recovery temperature difference has no significant effect on the long-term operation of the buried pipe, and it can be operated continuously and stably for a long time. Practice shows that due to the influence of various factors such as stratigraphic structure, stratigraphic pressure, radioactive decay and stratigraphic thermal conductivity, the actual stratigraphic temperature below 2000m recovers rapidly without significant temperature decay, fully reflecting the characteristics of the Earth’s constant temperature body.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain coordination deals with collaborative efforts of supply chain parties and making globally-optimal decisions that can improve overall performance and efficiency of the entire supply chain. In many situations, the problem of supply chain coordination requires formulation of a continuous time optimal control model, in which optimal solution is identified approximately through numerical estimation. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach was presented for optimal control problem by developing a new formulation based on advanced ingredients of differential and Poisson geometry. Thus, the exact optimal solution of control problem can be obtained using an analytical methodology that converts the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation (PDE) into a reduced Hamiltonian system. The proposed approach was applied to the problem of coordinating supplier development programs in a two-echelon supply chain comprising of a single supplier and a manufacturing firm. For further illustrating applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology, a numerical example was also provided. The proposed approach offers unique advantages and can be applied to find the exact solution of optimal control models in various optimization problems.</jats:p>",

The supply of materials in the form of mined sand has problems so it experiences delays and also has an impact on shipping to sand depots to consumers. With this problem, the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is considered not optimal, so research is needed to measure its performance from the company's supply chain. This study aims to measure the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM) using the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method in order to optimize every activity in the company's SCM. The research was conducted with a qualitative approach through direct observation, interviewing company experts along with filling out special questionnaires and documentation. Performance measurement will focus on five core processes, namely Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, and Return. There are 18 indicators studied with indicators that have the attributes of Reliability, Responsiveness, Agility. The method used in this study is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method which is used to obtain weighting results so that the performance assessment is more precise. The final value is obtained by multiplying the performance value with the weight of importance. This research was conducted at a sand mining company in Yogyakarta. The results of this study indicate that the performance of SCM in the sand mining company is in the good category with a final performance rating of 77.05 from a scale of 0 to 100. For indicators that have a low performance rating below 70, suggestions for improvement will be given. One of the proposed improvements is to provide training and certification to employees. The company is expected to be able to make improvements according to the suggestions given based on the research that has been done.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study examined the maintenance structures, as they exist for the effective management of water supply facilities in the Builsa North District. The study was descriptive, non-interventional and applied the mixed method approach to collect data from 138 water users who were randomly selected from hand pump communities. The study found that the management architecture of the water supply systems of the district hinged on the District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWSTs), Water and Sanitation (WATSAN) committees, area mechanics and pumped spare-parts dealers. The significant constraints to pump maintenance were inadequate logistics, finance, and remuneration of DWST, poor financial mobilisation, financial embezzlement, and high attrition among WATSAN committee members. Additionally, poor transport support for area mechanics, bad access routes, and scarcity of spare parts were also significant constraints to the maintenance architecture. The study recommends government and donor/agency to provide requisite financial and logistical support to the DWSTs, WATSAN committees and area mechanics and provision of spare parts at affordable prices.</jats:p>"

Food supply chain management (FSCM) unites the major disciplines, aimed at providing an understanding of the supply chain (SC), supporting managers of the chain components, and improving the development activities of research in the SC.\n\nMethod: Narrative review was conducted using available literature on Google Scholar and Scopus database.\n\nResults: In developing countries, many factors act as barriers to maintaining effective FSC. The potential reasons include the absence of infrastructure for cold chains and the lack of modern processing facilities that result in the highest inadequacies and losses of food and its allied products. Moreover, the whole FSC is loaded with various problems including quality and safety of products, poor SC connection, and cost-related issues. The important hindrance is “mandi systems (local word of wholesale markets)” that are entirely obsolete and ineffective in reducing food losses. Other issues include traceability problems, fair trading, technological issues, financial issues, processing, and value addition.\n\nConclusion: Blending new and innovative models of FSC with mandi systems can decrease food waste and losses and further improve the income of producers and processors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most common solutions to protect the supply chains for disruptions are increasing inventory, adding capacity, and using multiple suppliers. While these approaches in general prove to solve the disruption problem, they come with a negative effect on cost per product and cost of capital. In a highly volatile demand environment with fast pace changing technology, increasing inventory can constitute a big risk for obsolesce, hence additional measures are needed to create a competitive business advantage with such a supply chain. Furthermore, when competing about the same sources, as in the case of semiconductors, Operations Executives need to be able to respond fast when supply issues occur, in order to minimize the potential impact from a disruption. The ability to react and response to a disruption is enhanced with Supply chain risk tools utilizing the most recent technologies, such as Control Tower solutions enabling End-to End monitoring and transparency. However, even with the help of such technology, the decision maker will still be reactive and can merely respond to occurrences. To reach the next level of responsiveness, additional layer of intelligence is needed in the supply chain solution. From the available literature about Supply Chain Resilience, and similar advanced supply chain solutions, we can conclude that the main focus of research has so far been on the demand side, i.e., how to enhance forecast management. There are thus few practical and academic contributions on how to manage the supply side or more precise on how to manage the Inbound Supply Chain in a volatile business environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what factors that are crucial to regard when creating a proactive and responsive Inbound Supply Chain.</jats:p>",

While a broad consensus exists on the value of green innovation, current empirical research on how different types of green innovation strategies may account for the international performance of a firm remains scant. Addressing this gap is important because determining how to better manage a firm’s green innovation strategies nowadays has become increasingly important for firms hoping to achieve and maintain their sustainable performance advantages. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically examining how various types of green innovation strategies (i.e., green product, green process, and green service innovations) can be beneficial to firms in an emerging market economy. This study also examined the important role that potential risks of supply chain play in shaping the relationships between various types of green innovation strategies and firm performance. This study proposes that the effective management of supply chain risks may be important to the successful implementation of green innovation strategies because green innovation has increasingly become a collaborative effort. This study empirically tested the hypotheses by gathering survey data from a sample of 337 firms in China’s manufacturing industries. Results demonstrate that the green innovation strategies of firms are positively related to their firm performance. Additionally, the potential risks faced by the firms in efficiently and effectively managing their supply chain significantly moderate the impact of green product innovation and green process innovation strategies on their firm performance. This study not only offers useful theoretical implications for the green innovation strategy research and for better and effective supply chain risk management. It also provides important practical guidelines and managerial actions that practicing managers can implement to accelerate their green innovation strategy, assess the effect of supply chain risks, and thus improve firm performance in the post-pandemic era.</jats:p>"

The E. coli removal mechanism and antibacterial activity of PFCA were established by FTIR spectroscopy, XRD pattern and SEM analysis. PFCA achieved complete removal of E. coli with sufficient reusing capacities and possessed 100% antibacterial efficiency in a bacterial suspension of 5 × 106 CFU/mL. The study also showed that varying pH from 5 to 9 did not make any significant changes in the removal of E. coli. The presence of co-existing ions and organic matter did not reduce the efficiency of PFCA. The elution of silver ions (a very common limitation in treatment processes involving silver ions) was found to be much less, well below the drinking water limit. The study proved excellent potential of PFCA in removing E. coli, making it a viable disinfectant for water/wastewater treatment.</jats:p>",

We mainly investigated how the randomness of yield and demand influences the profit of the supply chain members and the performance of the entire supply chain. We adopted an additive random yield model to capture the effect of uncontrollable weather factors on crop yield. For the case where a wholesale price contract fails to achieve coordination, we propose a revenue-sharing contract with a new structural arrangement and explore its influence on the contract coordination ability. In the revised contract, the retailer purchases all the actual output from the supplier instead of an order quantity; thus, the retailer shares yield risk with the supplier. To look at the implications in detail, we conducted a numerical analysis where the uncertain yield of maize crops originates from the fluctuating rainfall; the results indicate that the revised revenue-sharing contract can achieve supply chain coordination, and all the members improve their profit. This paper shows that by redesigning the contract structure, the classical revenue-sharing contract still has the coordinating ability in the presence of simultaneous yield and demand uncertainties.</jats:p>"

This investigation is important for understanding the real effect of short sellers in facilitating stakeholders' investment decisions. Prior research suggests that short interest conveys negative news in a timely manner, which predicts future deterioration in firm fundamentals. We predict and find that a supplier's future investments decrease with its major customers' short interest. Consistent with predictions, this result is more pronounced when customers' short interest is more informative about their future performance, when customers have a more opaque information environment, and when suppliers incur lower customer switching costs. The results are robust when we use various approaches to address endogeneity concerns and establish causality. Our findings suggest that short sellers provide valuable information to supply chain partners when making investment decisions.</jats:p>",

The integration of industry 4.0 technologies can enhance the supply chain performance in terms of efficiency, collaboration, quality, and transparency. This paper aims to evaluate the current status of digitalization in supply chains, by analysing the existing literature and mapping research trends. in an aim to create a clearer vision of the current state of digitalization in supply chains in general and focusing on the wood manufacturing supply chain in particular, the results of the literature review will be used to develop a comprehensive framework for future research direction, to fully achieve the benefits of supply chain 4.0 in the wood manufacturing industry. This framework serves as a departure point to continue explaining and observing the best way to accelerate and implement Supply Chain 4.0 practices for digitalized supply chain management while focusing specifically on the wood manufacturing industry. To achieve the overall purpose, a literature review of the key literature from 2016 to 2021 has been performed. using a bibliometric and content review analysis, the results shed light on various technologies and their applications within supply chains and identify research gaps especially between theoretical frameworks and actual implementation. This paper provides a conceptual framework to further aid researchers in the exploration of knowledge regarding the most current trends in Supply Chain 4.0 and its applications in the wood manufacturing industry compared to other advanced industries, as well as the directions of the new research in the wood manufacturing Supply Chain 4.0.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global resource markets are still reeling from the impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; the two countries are major suppliers of energy, food and fertilizers. Supply disruption and the sudden imposition, in response to the crisis, of unprecedented economic sanctions, trade restrictions and policy interventions have caused prices of commodities to skyrocket.   Before the conflict, demand for global resources already exceeded supply and drove up prices as economies rebounded after the COVID-19 pandemic. This gave rise to a global cost-of-living crisis, characterized by increasing levels of energy and food poverty. This situation is likely to become much worse as a consequence of the war in Ukraine, and poses a threat to human security, particularly among low-income and vulnerable populations.  Governments must invest now to build resilient societies and economies to meet these long-term challenges. Mitigating the most immediate harms to populations is a top priority for policymakers, but failure to keep long-term objectives in mind – climate change mitigation, in particular – can lead to bad decisions that further embed existing fragilities in economic and social systems.</jats:p>"

Supplier selection, environmental effects such as social cooperation, and other SSCM programmes, can all help to achieve the “triple bottom line (TBL)” of economic, environmental, and social advantages. Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and firm performance are important factors in supply chain management (SCM). Organizations will traditionally consider a new framework when evaluating SSS performance to obtain all-encompassing criteria/sub-criteria of the sustainability index by encapsulating sustainability. This paper compiles 12 subcriteria for three sustainability pillars, namely economic, environmental, and social performance. Despite the fact that many articles on SSS and evaluation were published during COVID-19, there seems to be little research on sustainability issues to date. The goal of this study is to suggest a fuzzy multicriteria approach to SSCM planning. Additionally, using the TBL method, the problem of determining a current model for SSS in the supply chain was investigated. The linguistic value of the subjective preference of experts is represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to use standard weights to rank SSS for qualitative performance evaluation. COVID-19, on the other hand, has a detrimental impact on SSS and company results. The organization’s performance suffers as a result of the COVID-19 shutdown. The proposed method is demonstrated using an example.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a situation awareness-based capacity optimization strategy for wind-photovoltaic-thermal power systems and establishes a bi-level model for system capacity optimization. The upper-level model considers environmental protection and economy, and carries out multi-objective optimization of the system capacity planning solution with the objectives of minimizing carbon emissions and total system cost over the whole life cycle of the system, further obtaining a set of capacity planning solutions based on the Pareto frontier. A Pareto optimal solution set decision method based on grey relativity analysis is proposed to quantitatively assess the comprehensive economic–environmental properties of the system. The capacity planning solutions obtained from the upper model are used as the input to the lower model. The lower model integrates system stability, environmental protection, and economy and further optimizes the set of capacity planning solutions obtained from the upper model with the objective of maximizing the inertia security region and the best comprehensive economic–environmental properties to obtain the optimal capacity planning scheme. The NSGA-II modified algorithm (improved NSGA-II algorithm based on dominant strength, INSGA2-DS) is used to solve the upper model, and the Cplex solver is called on to solve the lower model. Finally, the modified IEEE-39 node algorithm is used to verify that the optimized capacity planning scheme can effectively improve the system security and stability and reduce the carbon emissions and total system cost throughout the system life cycle.</jats:p>"

Whilst there is emerging body of evidence on benefits of integration of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) and HIV/AIDS, experiences from sub-Saharan Africa has shown that there is insufficient research on what WaSH and HIV/AIDS mainstreaming means in practice for these two sectors. In view of inadequate national integration policies, guidelines and frameworks, the potential health improvements achievable by WaSH investment on HIV may fail to substantially improve the desired health outcomes. Therefore, the question that this systematic review tries to resolve is: What is the combined effect of improved water supply interventions and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy on frequency and severity of diarrhea among HIV exposed infants and PLWHA? <jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>We examined existing literature on effect of co-trimoxazole and improved water supply interventions on diarrhea amongst PLWHA and HEI. We systematically searched for articles in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, DOAJ and Google Scholar databases guided by the acceptance practice developed by PROSPERO and COCHRANE for systematic search and selection of studies. A PRISMA flow diagram was used to explain on the number of articles retrieved, retained, excluded and justifications for every action. Relevant articles and abstracts were gathered, reviewed and prioritized by thematic outcomes of interest. A Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the methodology that was used. All studies that sought to establish the efficacy of co-trimoxazole alongside other proven forms of healthcare preventive packages for HEI and PLWHA such as improved water supply and hygiene interventions were selected for evaluation.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>Improved water supply interventions and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis together reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (IRR _ 0.33, 95% CI 0.24–0.46, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.0001), days with diarrhea (5.5 versus 10.5 days per person-years; IRR_0.46, 95% CI_0.32–0.66, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea. The combined interventions resulted in 27% risk reduction in HIV disease progression whilst safe water alone was associated with reductions in the longitudinal prevalence of reported diarrhea of 53% among HIV exposed infants aged ≤2 years (LPR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.30–0.73, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.001) and 54% among all household members (LPR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.30–0.70, <jats:italic>P </jats:italic>&lt; 0.001). The overall quality of evidence of studies examining mortality was determined to be poor due to lack of clarity and the limited number of studies reporting mortality as an outcome. <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>Improved water supply interventions and sanitation uptake improves health.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The question of how the changes in money supply influence investment and GDP have been studied intensively in recent history. However, not all aspects of this impact are sufficiently researched. In particular, the “new normality” (that has evolved recently) limits the use of well-known classical concepts and models in monetary policy, especially for emerging economies to which Ukraine belongs. Thus, the subject of this study was to assess the relationship between monetary aggregates, investment, and GDP by the world economic data analysis using mathematical statistics.  As the information base for the study, the World Bank official statistics were taken (including broad money, gross capital formation, and GDP). More than 71% of all investigated countries showed a significant correlation between M3 and gross investment. The issue of how the strength of this relationship depends on the level of socio-economic development was investigated.   Classification of countries was carried out using the “nearest neighbors” method in a two-dimensional feature space, namely, per capita income and correlation tightness. The analysis showed that 79% of all countries fall into the class with a proven high correlation. Moreover, their level of wealth and development was irrelevant.  A cluster analysis of countries was fulfilled in the chosen feature space using the “mean shift” method. With the help of this method, all countries have been distributed into five clusters with different socio-economic conditions and an accuracy of 91%. Among them, there was a group of countries highly sensitive to change in monetization, up to extremely negative economic impacts.  The study helped to conclude that, regardless of economic development, GDP benefits from an increase in the money supply. Although this factor is considered necessary, it is nevertheless not sufficient for economic growth, especially in the time of the fourth industrial revolution, when the government has to play a more active and complex role in accelerating national technological development.</jats:p>",

Due to econometric and theoretical restrictions, the test yielded conclusive findings only in 11 over 25 EU Countries. Such results show that in Austria, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia, the downstream sector exerts market power. Other EU countries (Spain, UK, Denmark, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Sweden) are characterised by perfectly competitive dairy chains. These results were consistent with the findings of previous studies based on structural and mark-up models. Results of the market power test in the subsample of 11 countries have been related to various structural characteristics of the dairy chains. Market power exertion is negatively related to the average farm size. Such variable may be seen as a proxy of the degree of supply concentration provided by Producers Organizations (POs) to increase the bargaining power of the farm sector along the food chain. To test such a hypothesis, comparable data on supply concentration by POs across EU Countries are necessary. On the other hand, the structural change, represented by the increase of average farm size over time and the concentration rate in higher classes (above 250,000 € of Standard Output) is almost unrelated to the perfectly competitive conduct along EU dairy chains.</jats:p>"

The risk of diarrhea is more acute when populations have poor access to improved water and sanitation. This study seeks to determine individual and joint effects of climate variation, water supply and sanitation on the occurrence of diarrhea among children under five in SSA using multilevel mixed-effect Poisson regression including cross-level interaction. We merged 57 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 25 SSA countries covering the period 2000–2019 with climatic data from the DHS geolocation databases. The results of the research indicate that 77.7% of the variation in the occurrence of diarrhea in Sub-Saharan households is due to climatic differences between clusters. Also, a household residing in a cluster with a high incidence of diarrhea is 1.567 times more likely to have diarrhea cases than a household from a cluster with a low incidence. In addition, when average temperature and rainfall increase, households using unimproved sanitation or unimproved water have more cases of diarrhea. For SSA, the results of the multilevel analysis suggest the adoption at both levels; macro (national) and micro (household), of climate change adaption measures in the water sector to reduce the prevalence of diarrhea.</jats:p>",

Due to the dynamic interconnections between the several parts that comprise a typical SCN such as customers, organizations, sites, departments, geographies, and so on, efficient collaboration between all parts is vital to assure business success, especially in times of uncertainty and unpredictable disruption. Collaborative risks such as poor communication, deficient information exchange, lack of trust, lack or deficient access or reach, just to name a few, that essentially emerge as a result from a shift toward one of the extremes of the collaborative dimension (lack of collaboration or collaborative overload) are very often invisible; however, they are responsible for undesired outcomes such as production defects and delivery delays, just to name a few. In this work, a strategic process to identify and manage collaborative risks in SCNs to help improve resilience and sustainability is proposed. The proposed strategic process analysis contains three key SCN’s collaborative dimensions ((1) network access or reach, (2) trust, and (3) communication) applying graph centrality metrics, looking for emergent collaborative risks in a quantitative way that potentially may threaten an organization’s efficiency and performance, and thus negatively impact resilience and sustainability. A case study conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic is illustrated to describe how organization benefit regarding the timely and quantitative identification of potential behavioral patterns that lead to one of the collaborative extremes. The results show that the application proposed strategic process is very successful in ensuring sustainability improving resilience of SCNs.</jats:p>"

The reader mounted on the box will check whether the glows are authorized or not. If it gets authorized, then only the main door of the box will open and engineer will do his work. When the door gets opened it will share the details to the main server of the electrical distribution office in the form of message “The door is open”. We have made the provision that it will help engineer to solve the issue after door opens. There will be one-way communication from distribution office to electrical field engineer regrading guidelines for the issues. We have also made an application to record the history of the problems in the data base which would help to identify problems in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For decades, infrastructure planning in informal settlements has been a major challenge for urban planners and engineers. In particular, the planning process for the rapidly changing heterogeneous structures in these areas usually require individual and non-sustainable solutions. In this report, a method for the sustainable and practical planning of a piped water distribution system (WDS) that generates different expansion variants as a planning support tool is presented. In this tool, all real-world routing options are included in the decision-making process, based on the existing infrastructure, settlement structure, and identifiable open spaces. Additionally, proposals for the localization of the future public water points are supported by methods from Logistics. The consideration of the existing settlement structure and real route lengths (pedestrian walking distance) to a potential water point location lead to very practical and realizable results. The principle of participatory planning was considered, to easily include individual adjustments at any given timeframe. At the same time, automated processes generate fast results. The method is modular and linked to a geographic information system (GIS) to directly visualize the impacts and effects of the planning and decision-making process.</jats:p>"

The results indicated that the concentrations of boron in the Huaihe River ranged from 37.99 to 105.99 μg/L, much lower than those of groundwater, farmland irrigation water and sewage water. The δ11B values were between −3.12‰ and 3.21‰, with a mean value of −0.44‰. There were obvious variations trend of boron and δ11B between upstream, midstream and downstream. δ11B had a relatively high correlation with pH, boron and chlorine. Boron was positively correlated with EC, Na+, K+, F−, Li+, As and δ11B, while negatively correlated with Ca2+and Mg2+ in water. The structural equation model suggested industrial structure, population, economic development and pollution emission had positive effects on boron, whereas industrial structure and pollution emission had positive effects on δ11B. The contents of boron and δ11B showed a slight difference between the farmland, groundwater, sewage treatment plant and the Huaihe River. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the same source was occurred between the Huaihe River and groundwater, between farmland and sewage treatment plant. A stable isotope analysis in R model revealed that detergent provided the greatest proportion of boron sources, followed by washing powder, municipal wastewater and contaminated groundwater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Experimental and numerical analysis of the drop-on-demand inkjet was conducted to determine the jetting characteristics and meniscus motion under the control of the ink supply pressure. A single transparent nozzle inkjet head driven by a piezoelectric actuator was used to eject droplets. To control ink supply pressure, the pressure of the air in the reservoir was regulated by a dual valve pressure controller. The inkjet performance and the motion of the meniscus were evaluated by visualization and numerical simulation. A two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical simulation with the dynamic mesh method was performed to simulate the inkjet dynamics, including the actual deformation of the piezoelectric actuator. Numerical simulation showed good agreement with the experimental results of droplet velocity and volume with an accuracy of 87.1%. Both the experimental and simulation results showed that the drop volume and velocity were linearly proportional to the voltage change. For the specific voltages, an analysis of the effect of the ink supply pressure control was conducted. At the maximum negative pressure, −3 kPa, the average velocity reductions were 0.558 and 0.392 m/s in the experiment and simulation, respectively, which were 18.7 and 11.6% less than those of the uncontrolled case of 0 kPa. Therefore, the simulation environment capable of simulating the entire inkjet dynamics, including meniscus movement regarded to be successfully established. The average volume reductions were 18.7 and 6.97 pL for the experiment and simulation, respectively, which were 21.7 and 9.17% less than those of the uncontrolled case. In the results of the meniscus motion simulation, the damping of the residual vibration agreed well with the experimental results according to the ink supply pressure change. Reducing the ink supply pressure reduced the speed and volume, improved the damping of residual vibrations, and suppressed satellite drops. Decreasing ink supply pressure can be expected to improve the stability and productivity of inkjet printing.</jats:p>"

The eminence of knowledge sharing (KS) for supply chain (SC) innovation is undeniable to initiate development in products, services, and operations. However, KS process is undergoing challenges in sustaining KS engagement by SC partners. Hence, recent researchers call for the need to address this gap in the literature to assess VE barriers. This paper studies the causal relationship of VE barriers on two MNCs, i.e., Toyota and Suzuki, via the fuzzy DEMATEL approach. The case examination findings indicate culture's alignment as the prime cause of VE and leadership commitment has stronger interdependence. The core problems which need elimination are fear of losing the job, prominence and opportunistic behavior. The study concludes that companies need to instigate the natural attributes of employees’ VE by setting-up earnest guidelines to practice free information and knowledge flow.</p>",

The survey measured beliefs about local physician supply, while the experiment manipulated beliefs by altering information the participants read about the local supply of physicians. Willingness to see an NP was assessed in 2 ways. First as an overall preference over a physician and the second as a preference given 2 clinically significant scenarios in which participants imagined they were experiencing either coughing or a headache (presentation order randomized). Multiple regressions and ANOVAs were used to assess how beliefs about the local physician supply and self-rated health were associated with overall willingness to see an NP.

The developed method is easily implemented using an electronically controlled ring-type discharge valve. A valve made in the form of rigid elastic ring and installed in the high-pressure line above the plunger pair regulates fuel skip. An electromagnet located in the cavity of the annular valve controls it using an electronic regulator, acting at the right time according to the signals coming from the sensors of the engine crankshaft speed, the volume of incoming air and the position of the piston. The proposed fuel supply system of direct action with an electronically controlled annular valve reliably ensures the speed and load characteristics of the engine by influencing the number of cycle fuel supplies. With a decrease in the load and speed of the engine crankshaft, the number of fuel supply cycle’s decreases due to a decrease in signals to the electromagnet winding and, as a result, the valve is not attracted and the fuel supply is skipped. A decrease in the unevenness of the fuel supply in terms of the dynamic component that occurs when the supply is turned off is ensured by a decrease in the inertia of the regulator action due to the electronic control of the annular valve. The developed mathematical model of a direct-acting fuel supply system with an annular pressure valve makes it possible to reveal the relationship between the fuel supply parameters and the design dimensions of the split ring. Such a fuel supply system of direct action with an electronically controlled delivery valve allows, due to skipping of working strokes in low load and idle modes, redistributing the provided volume of fuel to working cylinders, significantly reduce fuel consumption</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Limited knowledge on the water–energy–carbon nexus of water supply systems (WSSs) with brackish groundwater sources in arid regions exists to date. In addition, the large amount of fossil-fuel energy utilized by treatment processes generating a significant amount of carbon emissions remains a challenge for the municipalities in Saudi Arabia to meet long-term sustainability goals. To achieve Saudi Arabia Vision 2030’s target of sustainable cities with reduced CO2 emissions, the present study aimed to analyse the water–energy–carbon nexus for WSSs and propose mitigation measures for reducing energy and carbon footprints from both the water management and treatment technologies perspectives. The detailed energy consumption data for three main components (source extraction, water treatment, and conveyance and distribution) of the main WSS, serving the 600,000 population of Buraydah City (Qassim, Saudi Arabia), was obtained from the concerned municipality. The city water treatment plant removes naturally occurring iron, TDS, and radionuclides in the source water with the help of ion detention, oxidation, sand filtration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, chlorination, and backwash water management. The study found that the treatment facility consumes around half of the total system’s energy (131,122 kWh/day); while, with deep confined aquifer (&gt;600 m) and an average water loss of 8%, conveyance and distribution (34%) and source extraction (18%) are consistent with the reported literature. With oil-driven energy, carbon emissions were found to be 10.26, 27.18, and 19.72 million tons CO2 eq/year for source extraction, water treatment, and conveyance and distribution, respectively. The reverse osmosis process, with higher energy consumption—1.1 kWh/m3 of treated water—than the global average, consumes most (88%) of the treatment plant’s energy and thus needs effective energy management practices. Moving to renewable (solar and wind-driven) sources, subject to a detailed life cycle analysis, can achieve significant energy and associated carbon emission reductions. To sustainably meet the water demand of the growing population in arid regions, the study also suggests raising the awareness of the public about how water conservation can control CO2 emissions, proactive maintenance of aging infrastructure, and increasing rainwater and treated wastewater reuse, to enhance the operational life of existing treatment facilities.</jats:p>"

The method of data collection is library studies and the method of data collection is field through a questionnaire. The statistical population of the experts includes two groups of 25 people for screening and 6 people for specialized and final solutions of the model. Obstacles were identified by reviewing the theoretical research literature and then screened by fuzzy Delphi method. To analyze the data, a multi-criteria decision-making method was performed in a triangular fuzzy manner due to the ambiguity in answering the questionnaires. Fuzzy DEMATEL method was used to determine the relationships between barriers and Network Analysis Process (ANP) method was used to weigh and prioritize barriers and MAIRCA, F. MAIRCA, F. MOORA, WASPAS methods were used to rank barrier overcoming strategies. According to experts, six main barriers were identified, including environmental barriers, economic barriers, technical barriers, supply chain barriers, organizational barriers, and facility barriers. Among the main barriers, environmental barriers are the first effective barriers and with an intensity of 0.15 on organizational barriers, with an intensity of 0.13 on facility barriers, and with an intensity of 0.20 on technical barriers, and with an intensity of 0.16 on barriers. Economic, and with an effect intensity of 0.21 on supply chain barriers The results of data analysis through questionnaires and solutions with EXCEL software showed that environmental barriers affect other barriers and supply chain barriers affect the identified barriers. Also, the solution by F. ANP method showed that the most weight is related to the obstacles of \"lack of financial investment\" and gained the first priority. Also, the solution of \"formulating an effective supply chain management strategy\" has won the first place.</jats:p>"

In particular, we develop a two-stage procurement planning model in a random environment. We consider a pre-event policy, in which each healthcare institution seeks to minimize the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage, and a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs and the penalty for the prior plan, in response to each disaster scenario. Thus, each institution deals with a two-stage stochastic programming model that takes into account the unmet demand at the first stage, and the consequent penalty. Then, the institutions simultaneously solve their own stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state governed by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept. Moreover, we formulate the problem as a variational inequality; both the discrete and the general probability distribution cases are described. We also present an alternative formulation using infinite-dimensional duality tools. Finally, we discuss some numerical illustrations applying the progressive hedging algorithm.</jats:p>",

According to questionnaire survey and principal component analysis, the risk indicators caused by uncertain demand are screened and classified to construct evaluation system and complete risk identification. The Bayesian network integrating fuzzy set theory and left and right fuzzy ranking is used to explore the relationship between risk indicators and supply chain to achieve risk evaluation. In view of the highest risk factors, an incentive mechanism model based on information sharing is put forward to prove theoretically that information sharing is an important strategy to reduce risk. The results are as follows: The uncertain demand will lead to a high level of risk in China’s manufacturing supply chain, in which the level of information technology is the biggest cause. Only when manufacturing enterprises are willing to share information and other node enterprises join the information sharing team, can demand uncertainty be fundamentally reduced. The proposed risk assessment model realizes the method innovation and theoretical innovation. It can practical and effectively help relevant enterprises to determine and control risks.</jats:p>",

This paper provides a review of recent work on the application of AM technology specifically for spare parts. The review shows that there are supply chain opportunities and challenges to the adoption of AM in spare parts within various application sectors. Our research reviews both the quantitative and qualitative models used for analysis to meet the emerging needs of the industry. The review also shows that the development of technology and its application is still emerging; therefore, there will be further opportunities to develop better spare parts supply chains to support AM applications.

Therefore, an experiment was performed to simulate the growth of wall-attached bubbles at various water flow velocities, a quantitative relationship between the wall-attached bubble growth period and flow velocity was obtained. Another quantitative relationship, between the wall-attached bubble departure diameter and turbulent kinetic energy of flowing water, was also determined. The analysis results of the TDG release rate proved that the adsorption of TDG on solid walls was considerably affected by flow velocity. The analysis models the TDG release mechanism through complex experiments and provides a method to better identify sites for supersaturated TDG adsorption. This study serves as an important theoretical basis for revealing the mechanism by which solid surfaces promote the release process of supersaturated TDG in natural water.</jats:p>",

This results in a mismatch between the ecosystem service supply from the urban natural landscape, and demand from the urban dwellers. While the mapping of ecosystem service supply and demand has been widely conducted for ecosystem service assessments, spatially explicit assessments of supply-demand balances and distributions are rarely explored in the urban context. Using Singapore as a case study, we mapped out the distribution of mismatches in six urban ecosystem services. In addition, we investigated the potential influence that a lived experience of ecosystem service supply-demand mismatch may have on residents’ perception towards the importance of ecosystem services. We found that the level of mismatch is predicted by proportion of unmanaged vegetation and distance to nature reserves. This is likely due to the distribution of unmanaged vegetation around the island state. Except for the noise abatement ecosystem service, we failed to find evidence of correlation between mismatch and Singaporeans’ perceived importance of ecosystem services, except in the case of noise abatement. This could potentially be influenced by the hyper-connectedness of Singapore’s landscape, allowing a locally unmet demand for ecosystem services to be fulfilled in a location with higher supply.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, an effective method for predicting IWQI using artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models was proposed. The accuracy performance of each model was evaluated at the end of this paper. According to the calculated index based on 49 groundwater samples, the Sidi El Hani aquifer was of good and sufficient quality. Moreover, both the ANN and MLR models performed well in terms of actual and predicted water quality. The ANN model, on the other hand, demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy. The results of this model also revealed that the predicted and computed values were close, with determination coefficients R2, RMSE, and MAE of about 0.95, 1.02, and 0.90, respectively. As a result, the proposed ANN model in this study was consistent and sufficient. These findings will help to guide irrigation water management decisions for the study aquifer in the future. The proposed ANN model can also be used to estimate the irrigation water index of other semi-arid aquifers, but accuracy is dependent on proper training techniques and selection parameters.</jats:p>",

The numerical examples empower us to investigate the effects of diverse carbon emission regulations (cap-and-trade regulation, mandatory cap policy, and cap-sharing scheme) on enterprises’ decisions. The results reveal that the cap-sharing scheme is effective in coordinating the relationship between system profit and carbon emission abatement, while cap-and-trade regulation loses efficiency compared with the cap-sharing scheme. The government should allocate caps scientifically and encourage enterprises to adopt green production technologies, especially allowing large enterprises to share carbon quotas.

AM is bridging the digital and physical world as a 3D computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) method. The usage of AM has made the supply chain of the aviation spare parts industry simpler, more effective, and efficient. Methods: This paper demonstrates the impacts of AM on the supply chain of the aircraft spare parts industry following a systematic literature review. Hence, centralized and decentralized structures of AM supply chains have been evaluated. Additionally, the attention has been oriented towards the supply chain with AM technologies and industry 4.0, which can support maintenance tasks and the production of spare parts in the aerospace industry. Results: This review article summarizes the interconnection of the industry findings on spare parts. It evaluates the potentiality and capability of AM in conceptualizing the overall supply chain. Moreover, MROs can adopt the proposed framework technologies to assist decision-makers in deciding whether the logistics hub with AM facilities is centralized or decentralized. Conclusions: Finally, this review provides an overall view to make critical decisions on the supply chain design of spare parts driven by new and disruptive technologies of industry 4.0. The next-generation supply chain may replace the logistics barriers by reducing waste and improving capability and sustainability by implementing AM technologies.</jats:p>"

Here electric poles were surveyed in the Ekosodin community using visual observation of randomly tagged functional poles to evaluate the extent of the infestation and the functional state of the poles relative to the infestation, alongside the economic cost of replacing the damaged poles in three predetermined areas (zones) within the community, based on the scale of human development. A total of 164 poles were surveyed, 26.8% (44) of which were concrete poles. The survey showed that the infested wooden poles outnumbered the ‘unaffected’ ones as more than two-thirds of the 120 wooden poles surveyed were infested as opposed to the uninfected ones (30.83%). The termite implicated in this impact was Macrotermes bellicosus Smeathman (Blattodea: Termitidae) and its impact visibly eroded the base and structural strength of affected poles, thus contributing to the tilting (53%) of the infested poles, which are load-bearing poles in dire need of replacement. Replacement cost for the affected poles within the community was estimated alongside the cost of pre-installation treatments of wooden poles, and the use of concrete poles, though more expensive than wooden poles which could mitigate termites’ impacts on the utility poles were recommended. Frequent replacement with untreated wooden poles may heighten the pressure on our natural resources through lumbering for pole production; besides the attendant threats and dangers of pole wreckage on people, homes and other facilities such as electricity transformers.</jats:p>"

Although the benefits of operating in these environments are understood, little is known about how supply chain clusters form and adapt. From a systems theory perspective, causal events lead to this formation and adaptation and facilitate sustained operation in modern business settings. This paper extends this understanding by theorizing key antecedents responsible for supply chain cluster formation and adaptation, conceptualizing individual firms as agents. Through a characterization of agents as either passive or active, we construct propositions and a conceptual model. The modelling, supported by causal loop diagrams, details the interactions between agents that lead to cluster formation and adaptations to contextual changes in supply chain clusters. These findings can guide policy design that is more effective in enabling the emergence and sustained existence of supply chain clusters through facilitated causal interactions.</jats:p>",

In this study, a new method was proposed to evaluate the data quality of water balance components and application levels of water balance practices by considering a total of 27 components. The developed model was applied in 4 pilot water administrations in Turkey. The weaknesses and strengths in water balance practices were determined by considering scoring in accordance with the dynamic structure of each administration. The quality of basic data measurement components and application levels of water balance practices were found to be at a good level in Administrations II and IV, at a poor level in Administration I, and at an average level in Administration III. Moreover, quality of water balance analysis and performance monitoring practices are at a good level in Administrations II and IV, and at a poor level in Administrations I and II. Thus the components that need improvement in each administration were identified and an improvement process was suggested. It is thought that this model will make a significant contribution to the testing of current application levels of water loss management components for practitioners and decision makers.</jats:p>",

In some locations local food system organizations, along with state governments, created the infrastructure to enable this pivot. Research on this phenomenon—what we call “the local pivot”—has been extensive. However, evidence collected so far has mostly been reports of case studies looking at particular communities. Using Google Trends and Twitter data, we examine whether “the local pivot” was evident as a general trend in the US during the depth of the COVID-19 food supply crisis in 2020, and whether places with high local food infrastructure allowed more people to pivot to local food provisioning. Our Google Trends analysis indicated a temporary rise in searches for local food. However, we found very little discussion of local food systems on Twitter. We then compared three states with a “high,” “medium,” and “low” local food infrastructure based on the Union of Concerned Scientists rankings. We found a weak but positive relationship between places that were classified as high local food system infrastructure and a pivot toward local food reflected on Twitter. We did, however, find strong support for local restaurant businesses during this period on Twitter, although this support did not necessarily reflect a local food system pivot. We acknowledge that Twitter results are not generalizable to the entire population: local food system actors may not be using Twitter in their interactions, so Twitter activity may not reflect local food system activity in general, or COVID food sourcing behavior in particular. However, our results do indicate the need for more research on whether or not the evidence of a pivot to local food systems during COVID in the United States reflected a larger national movement or occurred in just a few scattered communities. Further research on this topic can help ascertain the ability of local food system infrastructure to provide a resilient response to future global food supply chain crises.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is imperative to build a balanced and sustainable cross-border e-commerce system, and cross-border e-commerce on the Silk Road has become a new highlight of China’s e-commerce development. This study proposes a cross-border supply chain model based on the complex computer blockchain for international cooperation scenarios, contrasts and analyzes decision making in two cross-border supply chain scenarios with and without blockchain implementation, and investigates the sufficient conditions for blockchain implementation in the cross-border supply chain from the perspective of various value objectives. The analysis reveals that the cross-border supply chain has sufficient incentive to implement blockchain when the value gain generated by implementing blockchain is high or the value gain is low but the potential market size weakening factor of cross-border products is greater than a certain degree. It demonstrates that the link between cross-border product price elasticity, manufacturer cross-border effort cost, and customer cross-border preference degree would impact the circumstances for adopting blockchain in cross-border supply chains. The model also lays out a plan for the government to improve cross-border e-commerce logistics, strengthen oversight, and create a regional financial service network system to reduce credit risk.4</jats:p>",

To accelerate the digitization process, the Indonesian Government has distributed digital terrestrial television (DTT) decoders for households in several DTT trial areas so that the recipients are able to experience DTT broadcasts on their analogue television. To ensure that the DTT is adopted sustainably, this study aims to provide evidence-based policy recommendations by first understanding underlying factors of the intention to purchase a new DTT receiver, either a new DTT decoder or an integrated digital television (DTV).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study uses 2018 survey data collected by Badan Aksesibilitas Telekomunikasi dan Informasi.

An algorithm is introduced here to select the optimal pump speed pattern to save the most energy while satisfying the constrain of sufficient pressure at all times and all locations. It was found that five of the 15 systems operated unsuccessfully using a VSP, due to the VSP operating at lower speeds causing a lower pressure than normal, thereby causing the pressure to become negative. Additionally, a new chart that compares the payback period, project life, and energy costs between the base case and the VSP case was developed and different regions on the chart reflect different decision criteria.</jats:p>",

The present work aims to improve the performance of the broadband phase-locked loop (PLL) based on the linear Kalman filter. Specifically, this paper first introduces linear Kalman filter and second-order generalized integrator (SOGI). Then, SOGI is added to PLL based on the linear Kalman filter. The purpose is to use the infinite gain effect of SOGI at the central angular frequency to eliminate the time-varying angular frequency component in the error when the system inputs SOGI to achieve a better filtering effect. Then, the system’s stability analysis and parameter settings are carried out to establish an intelligent phase-locked method of aviation variable frequency power supply. Finally, simulation experiments are performed. The experimental results demonstrate that PLL via the linear Kalman filter with SOGI can solve the problem that the output phase angle contains high-frequency components when the power supply voltage distortion rate is 10%. This scheme has a strong anti-interference ability under power grid voltage imbalance. The accuracy of the Long and Short-term Memory network used here is about 80%, which can well realize the intelligent aviation power frequency conversion control method. The research reported here provides a reference for establishing smart phase-locked technology of aviation variable frequency power supply.</jats:p>"

No matter whichever weather it is, either too hot and dry or too cloudy and wet, you want to be able to control the amount of water that reaches your plants. Modern watering systems could be effectively used to water plants when they need it. But this manual process of watering requires two important aspects to be considered: when and how much to water. In order to replace manual activities and making gardener's work easier, we have create automatic plant watering system. By adding automated plant watering system to the garden or agricultural field, you will help all of the plants reach their fullest potential as well as conserving water. Using sprinklers drip emitters, or a combination of both, we have design a system that is ideal for every plant in the yard. For implementation of automatic plant watering system, we have used combination of sprinkler systems, pipes, and nozzles. In this paper we have used ATmega328 microcontroller. It is programmed to sense moisture level of plants at particular instance of time, if the moisture content is less than specified threshold which is predefined according to particular plant's water need then desired amount of water is supplied till it reaches threshold. Generally, plants need to be watered twice a day, morning and evening. Thus, the microcontroller is programmed to water plants two times per day. System is designed in such a way that it reports its current state as well as reminds the user to add water to the tank. All this notifications are made through mobile application. We hope that through this prototype we all can enjoy having plants, without being worried about absent or forgetfulness.</jats:p>"

While entertainment and fashion brands aim to consolidate their identities, increasing consumers’ participation in new, engaging, and immersive experiences, other industry sectors such as food and drugs are called to adhere to stricter regulations to increase the quality assurance of their processes. The pharmaceutical industry is inherently one of the most regulated sectors because the safety, integrity, and conservation along the distribution network are the main pillars for guaranteeing the efficacy of drugs for the general public. Favoured by Industry 4.0 incentives, pharmaceutical serialization has become a must in the last few years and is now in place worldwide. In this paper, a decentralized solution based on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can improve the track and trace capability of the standard serialization process, is presented. Non-fungible tokens are minted in the blockchain and inherit all the advantages provided by this technology. As blockchain technology is becoming more and more popular, adoption of track and trace will increase tremendously. Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry’s use of track and trace, this paper presents the concepts and architectural elements necessary to support the non-fungible token solution, culminating in the presentation of a use case with a prototypical application.</jats:p>"

The current world is facing an ongoing climate change along with other human-induced environmental changes. Most research has focused on the impact of increasing temperature as a major driving force for climate change, but other factors may have important impacts on plant traits and pollination too and these effects may vary from season to season. In addition, it is likely that the effects of multiple environmental factors, such as increasing temperature, water availability, and nitrogen enrichment are not independent. Therefore, we tested the impact of two key factors—water, and nitrogen supply—on plant traits, pollination, and seed production in<jats:italic>Sinapis alba</jats:italic>(Brassicaceae) in three seasons defined as three temperature conditions with two levels of water and nitrogen supply in a factorial design. We collected data on multiple vegetative and floral traits and assessed the response of pollinators in the field. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of growing conditions on seed set in plants exposed to pollinators and in hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that water stress impaired vegetative growth, decreased flower production, and reduced visitation by pollinators and seed set, while high amount of nitrogen increased nectar production under low water availability in plants grown in the spring. Temperature modulated the effect of water and nitrogen availability on vegetative and floral traits and strongly affected flowering phenology and flower production. We demonstrated that changes in water and nitrogen availability alter plant vegetative and floral traits, which impacts flower visitation and consequently plant reproduction. We conclude that ongoing environmental changes such as increasing temperature, altered precipitation regimes and nitrogen enrichment may thus affect plant-pollinator interactions with negative consequences for the reproduction of wild plants and insect-pollinated crops.</jats:p>"

The developed method is easily implemented using an electronically controlled ring-type discharge valve. A valve made in the form of rigid elastic ring and installed in the high-pressure line above the plunger pair regulates fuel skip. An electromagnet located in the cavity of the annular valve controls it using an electronic regulator, acting at the right time according to the signals coming from the sensors of the engine crankshaft speed, the volume of incoming air and the position of the piston. The proposed fuel supply system of direct action with an electronically controlled annular valve reliably ensures the speed and load characteristics of the engine by influencing the number of cycle fuel supplies. With a decrease in the load and speed of the engine crankshaft, the number of fuel supply cycle’s decreases due to a decrease in signals to the electromagnet winding and, as a result, the valve is not attracted and the fuel supply is skipped. A decrease in the unevenness of the fuel supply in terms of the dynamic component that occurs when the supply is turned off is ensured by a decrease in the inertia of the regulator action due to the electronic control of the annular valve. The developed mathematical model of a direct-acting fuel supply system with an annular pressure valve makes it possible to reveal the relationship between the fuel supply parameters and the design dimensions of the split ring. Such a fuel supply system of direct action with an electronically controlled delivery valve allows, due to skipping of working strokes in low load and idle modes, redistributing the provided volume of fuel to working cylinders, significantly reduce fuel consumption</jats:p>",

Supply chain transparency (SCT) efforts are intended to signal positive information about the company to consumers but the benefits are often unclear, especially when consumers receive multiple, but mixed signals that include negative events. We draw on signaling theory to explore how consumers develop impressions of a company's products based on different evaluative dimensions: the positive integrity signal of SCT and the negative capability signal of a product recall. The incongruent signal set creates ambiguity for consumers in assessing product quality and subsequent purchase decisions. We develop two scenario‐based experiments to test aspects of interdimensional signal incongruence. Experiment 1 investigates the magnitude of signal incongruity by considering combinations of different levels of SCT and product recall severity. Experiment 2 investigates the temporal effect of the incongruent signals, considering the restorative effect of SCT after a product recall signal has been received. While product recall signals are salient for consumers in shaping perceptions of product quality and purchase intentions across both experiments, we demonstrate the strategic value of SCT as a positive integrity signal to consumers.</jats:p>",

Based on the premise that leasing involves issues that are insufficiently elucidated by its innovators, this article analyses the causes of the resistance observed in its implementation. To achieve this goal, a qualitative social science research method was used, favouring discussion with 18 participants. The data were analysed in the backdrop of the market mode of local governance and fuzzy set theory. The results of this research show that the populations of Atchannou Village do not fully accept the leasing of water, or at least they set out the preconditions to be met by the local government authorities before this innovative approach to governance of the water point can become operational: guaranteeing the management of the funds from the sale of water (1), and repaying the debts related to the community management of the water supply (2). The local actors are therefore in a logic of preserving the interests that will be generated by the sale of water, which is now retroceded to the Municipality; this further increase their resistance to the leasing of the water supply system.</jats:p>"

The binary blend produced a wider and shorter geometry, while the ternary blend resulted in a narrower build that was more equivalent to the CAD geometry. The data indicated that the binary blend provided a higher oxygen concentration in the weld as compared to that of the ternary blend. The results imply that the arc characteristics and heat input had a significantly higher impact on the weld penetration than the surface tension effect of surface active elements. This was further verified by developing and applying a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the thermophysical properties of gas mixtures. The results from the model showed that, while the influence of increased oxygen concentration on the surface tension for the binary blend led to a deeper penetration, the ternary blend gave rise to heat flux to the workpiece.</jats:p>"

Traditional financing methods, which mostly relied on corporate credit to give credit to the whole supply chain, have been replaced by supply chain finance. This paper studies the supply chain financial credit risk through the logistic model and chooses the financial data and supply chain financial operation indicators of relevant listed companies from 2014 to 2016 for analysis. Because not all of companies can find the bad debt rate of accounts receivable from 2014 to 2016, and some agricultural listed companies only have one or two years of relevant data, this paper creates an unbalanced panel data with 91 sample sizes, which is larger than previous studies. Binary logistic regression and principal component analysis are mainly used to accurately calculate the compliance probability of cooperative customers in agricultural supply chain financial products. Unlike the existing literature, which mainly uses s.t to define whether an enterprise defaults, this paper uses <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>Z</a:mi>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula> value to define the default risk of listed companies in agricultural supply chain finance.

Bulletin of the Tomsk Polytechnic University. Geo Аssets Engineering, 2022, vol. 333, no. 4, рр. 224-235. In Rus.&#x0D;\nThe relevance. An increase in the contribution of renewable energy sources to the generation of the autonomous hybrid energy industry is important in order to reduce the environmental impact of diesel generator plants and decrease operating costs in the production of electrical energy in smart microgrids with distributed generation, including so-called «green» generation. This issue has the highest relevance for cell towers of mobile communication, rotational residential camps, meteorological stations and other remote consumers, the rated capacity of which is tens to hundreds of kW. Objective: the development of computer models for optimizing the management of the operational staff and modes of an autonomous photo-diesel power supply system with a DC bus, so as to make it possible to minimize the operating time of a diesel generator plant by increasing the contribution of the photovoltaic plant at optimal technical and economic indicators. The use of a DC bus for the electricity integration from distributed energy sources is considered promising in reducing the number of hours of inefficient operation of a diesel generator plant, which will make it possible to save diesel fuel and extend the life expectancy of the diesel generator. Novelty. This work expands the known options for modeling and optimizing the modes of a standalone hybrid DC power plant in terms of using an objective function with appropriate restrictions, adapting models of power equipment for the intended purposes of modeling, presenting the structure of a feasibility study based on commercially available characteristics of the elements of the power supply system. Methods. The study entails the development of computer models of the intelligent control architecture of a standalone hybrid power plant including a photovoltaic plant, a diesel generator plant, an electric energy storage system, a remote consumer, as well as auxiliary converter devices. Modeling of control processes is implemented in the Stateflow library, as well as by using the language syntax of the Matlab high-level package, the capabilities of which are acceptable for the intended purposes. Results. The analysis of the results shows that DC PV-diesel power supply systems can be cost-effective in all scenarios that include different types of batteries while for systems without power storage, DC distribution is often not cost-effective. The results will be of interest to specialists developing or operating standalone power supply systems and organizations planning to upgrade existing diesel power plants.</jats:p>"

Fingermarks on five porous substrates were treated using IND-Zn formulations operationally used by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), UK Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST), and German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA). Despite the variations in composition, primarily associated with the difference in the carrier solvents, all three formulations gave similar sensitivity. However, BKA was identified as the most effective formulation in consideration of cost and supply chain issues, which could be adopted for use in resource-limited micro-jurisdictions with minimum modification. Further experiments also found that using ethanol as a substitute co- solvent to methanol did not significantly reduce sensitivity, which could provide a safer modification of the CAST formulation used in other regions. The findings provide the basis for developing an effective but sustainable IND-Zn formulation for the Seychelles Police, resilient to the challenges of resource limitations and supply chain disruption, which may also be applicable to other micro-jurisdictions.</jats:p>"

Production processes are evolving as customer demands change, which leads to greater variability. Firms must respond to changing environmental conditions to remain sustainable. Companies today look for ways to overcome their problems not only on their own but also with their supply chains. Reduced cost and improved performance are two significant benefits of supply chain management. Because companies can work together in the face of challenging market conditions throughout their supply chains, it makes sense for them to collaborate. When companies work together, they can collaborate to produce better-designed products and more efficient manufacturing processes. Learning, supply chain integration, and flexibility throughout the supply chain are critical to successful supply chain management.\nIn this study, the effect of supply chain learning on supply chain integration and production flexibility has been investigated.  The mediating role of supply chain integration on the impact of supply-chain learning on production flexibility has been tested. For this purpose, survey data was collected from the 144 companies selected out of Turkey's largest exporting companies. The data were analyzed via structural equation modeling and process macro methods. As a result of the structural equation model analysis, it was found that supply chain learning significantly affects the chain’s integration and its production flexibility. As a result of the intermediation test, it was determined that the integration of the supply chain has a vital intermediary role regarding the effect of supply chain learning on the flexibility of production.</jats:p>"

Considering the regulation characteristics of different power supplies and the requirements of shallow charging and shallow discharging of energy storage battery, this study proposes a joint active power control strategy of multi-energy complementary power supply systematically. The basic regulation of hydropower is used to supplement the output of wind and solar power plants, while the compensation regulation of energy storage power supply is used to improve the stability of total output. Additionally, hydropower is used to charge and discharge the energy storage battery. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively give play to the regulation advantages of different power supplies, and meet the requirements of shallow charge and introduction.</jats:p>",

The study, therefore, sought to assess the extent of community stakeholders’ involvement, and whether this can explain the outcomes in these interventions. A mixed methods approach was followed, and primary data was collected through a survey and key informant interviews. Key documents were also reviewed. The study findings show that the very idea to bring a communal water point into the community is largely exogenous, and that there are significant levels of exclusion of community-based stakeholders in first three phases of water projects, with the exception of maintenance phase as it is essentially fate accompli. When functional and non-functional water points are compared in areas where there is evidence of community involvement, the former shows significant degrees of community involvement unlike the latter. This is one key aspect explaining positive outcomes and sustainability. All this, arguably, entails serious shortcomings in water sector in Malawi, demonstrated by failure of policy and enforcement of standards. </jats:p>",

The case study included proposed a coastal reservoir located on the coastlines of the Caspian Sea in the vicinity of Tajan River estuary. To conduct this research, four types of reservoirs with different sizes were considered. Input parameters to the model included 5-year flood of Tajan River, initial reservoir salinity and ambient temperature data. The results showed that construction of a shallower reservoir due to better surface and depth mixing could achieve higher water salinity during the desalinization period. Furthermore, the greatest water temperature change value was determined after passing hydrograph peak discharge, which shows the effect of inflow on reservoir water quality. Finally, the results of water density revealed that the decreasing trend of water density occurred mostly due to the decreasing water salinity in the reservoir.</jats:p>",

Secondly, research on the international cooperation patterns of supply chain research shows that China and the US have always been each other's largest partners, and the two countries have generally maintained or increased international cooperation with their top research producing countries during the epidemic. In addition, in supply chain research during the epidemic, the proportion of US–China cooperation in China's international cooperation has declined, while that of the US has increased.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The time span of the datasets used to analyze the research status before and during COVID-19 is different.

The methods for managing leaks are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, the suitability and applicability of water loss management (WLM) methods should be analyzed. In this study, a new comprehensive framework was proposed using the scoring table to evaluate and highlight the reliability of data and to analyze the current application level of leakage management practices in WDSs. The developed framework consists of 60 sub-components determined to cover the WLM practices. A scoring structure was created to analyze these sub-components in measurable criteria. The developed framework was applied to three pilot administrations, and the results were discussed. The data quality (quite good, good, doubtful, poor, and quite poor) is classified according to the application level of the leakage management practices. The data quality of leakage management components and the application levels of practices are at good level in Administrations I and II and at moderate level in Administration III. The weaknesses and strengths in administrations were defined in the scope of leakage management, and the components that need improvement are determined dynamically. This framework will provide more accurate data for sustainable leakage management in the administration and make field applications more systematic.</jats:p>",

Drinking water is a common problem in Ejere Town. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the accessibility of the town's drinking water distribution system. To achieve this research goal, the hydraulic performance of the town's water distribution system and the level of customer satisfaction were assessed. 374 sampled households were randomly chosen from a total of 13,380 to measure the degree of customer satisfaction with the town's water supply services, and the hydraulic performance of the town's water distribution system was analyzed using the WaterGEMS software. Of the 374 customers surveyed for the study, 85 (22.7%) were satisfied and 289 (77.3%) were dissatisfied, implying that the satisfaction levels were below average. The WaterGEMS hydraulic model was calibrated (R2 = 0.94) using measured data from nine randomly chosen nodes. According to the model results, a great amount of the velocity and pressure in the water distribution system was below the minimum recommended limits. These minimum pressures and velocity levels indicate that there is not enough water pressure in the distribution network to reach all parts of Ejere Town. Finally, it was concluded that there was insufficient access to drinking water in the town.</jats:p>",

The model intended to estimate the total cost and CO2 emissions of a company operating in the cold supply chain, was carried out in Microsoft Excel™. Specifically, the model reproduces the main FCSC processes, i.e., Product collection, Backroom storage, Product delivery and Reverse logistics. For each process, we have exposed the implemented equations. Results show that the product delivery process is the most critical in both economic and environmental terms. Conversely, product collection and reverse logistics process contribute to the total cost and emission to a limited extent.

Administering ESR programs throughout a complex supply network, however, is challenging. In this paper, we apply a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to coordinate ESR investments in a general supply network and analyze to what extent an ESR initiator should directly engage the higher-tier suppliers as opposed to delegating that responsibility to the first-tier suppliers. Our bargaining framework not only generalizes the conventional Shapley value approach by allowing the flexibility of modeling imbalanced power distribution among the firms but also provides an explicit way of implementing the resulting gain sharing among the firms through negotiated contract terms. We show that the eventual structure of ESR negotiation relationships can be derived by finding a shortest path tree in the supply network with the arc cost defined as the logarithm of the negotiating parties’ relative bargaining power. These developments allow us to analyze ESR implementation in generally extended supply networks. We find that the ESR initiator tends to delegate ESR negotiations to a supplier that is strong in negotiations with higher-tier suppliers. When the supply network is complex (i.e., wide and deep), directly engaging all suppliers can lead to a larger gain by the initiator than fully delegating the negotiations with higher-tier suppliers to the first-tier ones. However, as the network gets increasingly complex, the ESR initiator tends to directly engage a reduced percentage of higher-tier suppliers. We further extend our analysis to situations where the ESR relationships are sequentially formed in a decentralized manner, where the benefit of ESR depends on the collective choice of the firms’ investment levels, where multiple ESR programs are implemented in the network, and where ESR investments depend on the negotiation relationships.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management.</jats:p>",

One of the most important efficiency measurements is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The traditional DEA model treats the decision-making units (DMUs) as a black box. It considers only the initial inputs and the final outputs. But the internal interactions between subsystems are neglected. This type of DEA is used for straightforward systems, but the complex multistage systems like supply chains, traditional DEA get inaccurate efficiency indicators. As well as, one of the main challenges is the uncertainty of data. The inputs and outputs values are usually required to be deterministic in traditional DEA. Although, this is not a case of real-life problems. Therefore, we develop a mixed innovative approach from Two-stage DEA and rough set theory to produce a modified Two-stage RDEA. The proposed model can measure the efficiency of DMUs comprehensively by considering the internal structure of any supply chain and treating with incomplete and imprecise data. We applied the Two-stage RDEA model in a three-level supply chain to show its applicability to measure the efficiency for both a whole supply chain and all levels comprehensively.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to analyze the status of accountability of Health Facility Governing Committees in Tanzania under the Direct Health Facility Financing setting as perceived by the supply side. In 32 different health institutions, a cross-sectional design was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data at one point in time. Data was collected through a closed-ended questionnaire, an in-depth interview, and a Focus Group Discussion. Descriptive statistics, multiple logistic regression, and theme analysis were used to analyze the data. According to the findings, Health Facility Governing Committees’ accountability is 78%. Committees have a high level of accountability in terms of encouraging the community to join community health funds (91.71%), receiving medicines and medical commodities (88.57%), and providing timely health services (84.29%). The health facility governance committee’s responsibility was shown to be substantially connected with the health planning component (p = 0.0048) and the financial management aspect (p = 0.0045).

We used a numerical approach consisting of a sediment cascade model and a stochastic weather generator to quantify climate forcing effects under a range of sediment supply regimes in a debris‐flow catchment in the Swiss Alps (Illgraben). We show that sediment yields estimated from short records are highly uncertain both in terms of mean and interannual variability. Furthermore, sediment yields tend to be underestimated in supply‐limited systems, where also long‐term memory effects, driven by the history of sediment storage, are evident.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global economic activity in all sectors, including forest industries. Changes in demand for forest products in North America over the course of the pandemic have affected both primary processors and downstream industries reliant on residues, including wood pellet producers. Wood pellets have become an internationally traded good, mostly as a substitute for coal in electricity generation, with a significant proportion of the global supply coming from Canadian producers. To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian wood pellet industry, economic and market data were evaluated, in parallel with a survey of Canadian manufacturers on their experiences during the first three waves of the pandemic (March 2020 to September 2021). Overall, the impact of the pandemic on the Canadian wood pellet industry was relatively small, as prices, exports, and production remained stable. Survey respondents noted some negative impacts, mostly in the first months of the pandemic, but the quick recovery of lumber production helped to reduce the impact on wood pellet producers and ensured a stable feedstock supply. The pandemic did exacerbate certain pre-existing issues, such as access to transportation services and labour availability, which were still a concern for the industry at the end of the third wave in Canada. These results suggest that the Canadian wood pellet industry was resilient to disruptions caused by the pandemic and was able to manage the negative effects it faced. This is likely because of the integrated nature of the forest sector, the industry’s reliance on long-term supply contracts, and feedstock flexibility, in addition to producers and end-users both being providers of essential services.</jats:p>"

However, achieving energy efficiency in the water distribution systems of Kampala that is characterized by variable demands and prescribed pressures would be impossible if this utility continued operating on trial and error methods. This research was undertaken in the year 2016-2017 and aimed at exploring how pump schedule optimization could enable NWSC to deal with the challenge of high energy costs and improve water utility performance. In this research, the energy consumption of existing pumps was obtained from historical data, data was diagnosed and based on the diagnostic findings, decision variables were selected and optimal pump schedules were formulated. The formulated schedules were applied to the Gabba Muyenga supply system of National Water and Sewerage Company (Uganda) as a proof of concept. The formulated pump schedules when applied on different pumps classified as models 1, 2 and 3 based on pump flow ratings and motor voltage ratings, results show that scheduling pump operations based on time of the day tariffs enabled NWSC to save about 0.373 Million kWh annually. On the other hand pump scheduling based on pressure, modulation had the potential to reduce water losses enabling NWSC to save 12 m3/hr equivalent to 0.068 million kWh per year in energy terms without compromising customer service levels and this was only for the established DMA within the case study area and not for the entire NWSC water distribution network. The data presented were obtained through field measurements, statistical analysis and hydraulic design calculations</jats:p>"

Data were collected through a face-to-face interview schedule from a sample of total 60- 30 farmers, 6 wholesalers, 5 aratdars, 5 retailers, and 14 consumers in Sirajdikhan and Sadar Upazila of Munshiganj district. Descriptive statistics (percentages, frequencies, etc.) and multiple linear regression analysis were used for this study. The result shows that channel 4 is the longest marketing chain in the study area which includes the marketing actors – farmers, aratdars, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. In the supply chain of potatoes, the amount of postharvest loss is 6.6% for the producer’s level, 5.3% for the wholesale level, 1.10% for the aratdar level, and 2.1% for the retailer level in the study area. The regression model reveals that age and amount of production have a significant positive relationship, while experience has a significant negative relationship with the postharvest losses of potatoes. The study also shows that lack of storage facility (48.94%) and poor packaging system (32.73%) are the major reasons for occurring postharvest losses of potatoes. The farmers and intermediaries suggested that it is necessary to identify the maturity stage of potatoes at harvesting time (70%), improve the cold storage facility (56.67%), and improve the loading and unloading system (56.25%), etc. for reducing postharvest losses of potato.</jats:p>"

An attempt has been made in this work to understand the suitability of groundwater for human consumption. The parameters of pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr), Sulphate (SO4), Iron (Fe), Nitrate (NO3), Chloride (Cl), Total Hardness (TH), Total Alkalinity (TA), and Sodium (Na) were analyzed to estimate the groundwater quality. The water quality index (WQI) has been applied to categorize the water quality, which is quite useful to infer the quality of water for the people and policy makers in the concerned area. The WQI in the study area ranges from 17.90 to 176.88. According to the WQI rating, sites 1, 3, and 4 are not appropriate for drinking water or have low water quality and site 2 has moderate drinking condition, whereas site 5 has excellent drinking condition. The current study suggests that the groundwater of the area with deteriorated water quality needs treatment before consumption.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS WQI values in sites 1, 3 and 4 are 106.99, 176.88, 161.25, showing that the groundwater is not suitable for drinking purposes.

In this study, 17 PAH compounds are mapped at eight sites along the Nile River and its tributaries in Greater Cairo. In addition, their removal efficiency is evaluated with the conventional treatment in eight water treatment plants. PAHs were analyzed using GC–MS from January to December 2018. Naphthalene, anthracene, fluorene, pyrene, and phenanthrene were detected. The total amount of PAHs in raw water was highest in Shamal Helwan (1,325 ± 631 ng/l) and lowest in Mostorod (468 ± 329 ng/l), and the removal ranged from 25 to 31%. Further research is needed to integrate other techniques to reduce PAHs using the conventional treatment, and more efforts should be made to reduce the presence and release of PAHs in raw water.</jats:p>",

The main objective of this study is to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of using solar photovoltaic (PV) energy to reduce the net power drawn from the grid by submersible pumps in urban water supply systems. The Germiraltı catchment area (Kayseri, Turkey), which provides all of its energy needs from the city electricity grid, was chosen as the research area. Two different scenarios, ‘hybrid-powered water pumping system’ and ‘grid-connected PV system’, were analyzed and evaluated. A 1,620 kWp grid-connected PV system can inject 2,787.8 MWh/year of energy into the grid, which is more than the total annual energy need of the submersible pumps. The system operates with 85.7% performance ratio (PR), 19.6% capacity factor (CF) and 4.71 (h/d) final yield. The payback period of the system is calculated as 4.1 years. The results show that it is economically competitive to meet the energy needs of submersible pumps in urban water supply systems with solar PV energy.</jats:p>",

Demand for goods is supposed to be an increasing function of advertising costs. In this case, marketing investments affect only the base selling prices of articles and do not affect competitive discounts. The explicit form of this dependence can be established as a result of marketing research. It is also assumed that investments in innovative technological projects could reduce industrial costs; production costs are decreasing functions of the size of the investment. It is believed that the demand function is linearly dependent on the total volume of output produced. The criterion of optimality for supply chains is the maximum of the total profit received from the sale and delivery of finished products to points of consumption, taking into consideration the costs of production and advertising. As a result of this study, equilibrium solutions of the duopoly according to Cournot and Stackelberg were found. That has made it possible to determine the optimal values of product volumes for output, the size of investment investments, as well as product advertising costs. The model helped study the impact of investment deductions and advertising costs on the acquisition of competitive advantages by manufacturing enterprises. A numerical illustration of the results obtained is given. The proposed approach could be used to build and analyze dynamic optimization models taking into consideration the innovation and marketing activities of enterprises, as well as to study other market structures</jats:p>"

Embedding TDR monitoring instrument in the indoor soil box, it can detect the characteristics of moist soil under the conditions of different capillary source infiltration water percolating capacities. The results show that there is a power function relationship between the cumulative infiltration quantity and time under the condition of water supply of surface capillary. The wetting front pushes forward like semi ellipse curve, and the moist soil presents like approximate semi ellipsoid. When the infiltration time and infiltration rate are constant, the soil water content in the infiltration point tends to a stable value, the soil water and heat coupling movement is complex, and the numerical variation tendency of each monitoring point is similar. Based on the above results, we construct empirical solution equation to predict the eigenvalues of soil wetting body under the condition of water supply of surface capillary. In this research, the capillary source infiltration material is found, and the surface capillary source water supply device with low cost and high efficiency is constructed. The device makes the growth of plants with enough water for the first year, but it can still keep the roots dry enough to make the seedling root down. Preventing soil evaporation loss, slowing down water loss of the surface micro environment of the main land and other bad influence, the device can improve the efficiency of water use. Meanwhile, the device can effectively enhance the ability of seedlings against high temperature of the surface in desertification area, wind-blown sand, animal browsing stress, damage, and create a proper environment for the normal growth of plants, which enjoys broad prospects.</jats:p>"

They forage large amounts of fresh plant material to nourish a symbiotic fungus that sustains the colony. It is unknown how workers organize the intra-nest distribution of resources, and whether they respond to increasing demands in some fungus gardens by adjusting the amount of delivered resources accordingly. In laboratory experiments, we analyzed the spatial distribution of collected leaf fragments among nest chambers in <jats:italic>Acromyrmex ambiguus</jats:italic> leaf-cutting ants, and how it changed when one of the fungus gardens experienced undernourishment. Plant fragments were evenly distributed among nest chambers when the fungal symbiont was well nourished. That pattern changed when one of the fungus gardens was undernourished and had a higher leaf demand, resulting in more leaf discs delivered to the undernourished fungus garden over at least 2 days after deprivation. Some ants bypassed nourished gardens to directly deliver their resource to the chamber with higher nutritional demand. We hypothesize that cues arising from that chamber might be used for orientation and/or that informed individuals, presumably stemming from the undernourished chamber, may preferentially orient to them.</jats:p>",

Effective implementation of transport processes is a factor affecting the possibility of medical intervention, in terms of both planned and life-saving care. The reliability of the healthcare supply chain is a key factor in patient health. In our research, we have used the method of a single case study of a public regional hospital in Poland providing comprehensive medical services. The aim of the research is to identify the factors that affect the reliability of the healthcare supply chain in relation to the interhospital air transport of patients. Our qualitative research using process mapping reveals what factors affect the reliability of interhospital medical air transport. The analysis of 100 interhospital medical air transport cases has allowed us to create a general procedure related to the movement of patients between the facilities of the healthcare system in Poland. Our research shows that the key factor of reliability is the coherent and integrated cooperation of institutions involved in transport processes.</jats:p>"

Based on a pilot survey with data ranging from 50 respondents, each for passengers and drivers, with SEM models, it was indicated that level of user satisfaction, which was affected by income level has a higher influence (-0.039) than movement characteristics (0.011), while at consistency level analysis based on driver’s perception indicates that safety aspect has a higher effect (-0.288) than income level (0.251).

In the economic activities of the tripartite cooperation between financial institutions, logistics enterprises, and loan enterprises, the goods will enter the logistics and supervision links of pledged goods immediately after they are postponed. It is proposed to integrate computer network communication technologies such as the Internet of Things with supply chain finance and logistics supervision to strengthen the information interaction between suppliers, which is widely used in supply chain activities to help realize the Internet finance. An intelligent supply chain supervision can implement monitoring and early warning of the time of the pledged goods in the warehouse, in transit, and during processing.

Dans cet article, nous nous proposons d’étudier des supply chains selon une approche micro-fondée menant à l’explication des relations interpersonnelles. Une analyse de réseaux d’individus via le concept polymorphe de proximité permet de répondre à la question de recherche suivante : comment différents réseaux sociaux influencent-ils des supply chains dans une logique d’interaction dynamique ? Un prestataire de services logistiques multi-clients et ses partenaires représentent le terrain d’investigation. Une étude qualitative s’appuyant sur une analyse des proximités décrit la dynamique des relations interpersonnelles et leur influence sur la chaîne logistique. Les résultats révèlent l’existence de deux réseaux sociaux typiques au sein des supply chains étudiées. Le réseau social ancré contribue à développer à la fois réactivité et agilité de la chaîne logistique. Le réseau social efficient impacte plutôt sa performance économique. L’organisation formelle de la supply chain affecte aussi le comportement des acteurs et leurs relations dans une sorte de jeu d’interaction dynamique. La chaîne logistique focalisée sur la réactivité et l’agilité donne plus d’autonomie aux actions individuelles d’acteurs adaptables tandis que celle recherchant davantage de performance en termes de coûts exige conformité et intégration des individus dans des relations structurées et codifiées. Cette dynamique donne dans le cas présent, la perception d’un co-renforcement des réseaux étudiés.</jats:p>",

The heterogeneous properties of groundwater systems are related to the dynamic temporal-spatial patterns that cause great difficulty in quantifying their complex processes, while good regional groundwater level forecasts are completely required for managing water resources to guarantee suitable support of water demands within any area. Water managers and farmers need intelligent groundwater and irrigation planning systems and effective mechanisms to benefit from the scientific and technological revolution, particularly the artificial intelligence engines, to enhance the water support in their water use planning practices. Therefore, this work aims to improve the groundwater level prediction based on the previous measures for better planning of hydraulic resource use. For this concern, the suggested method starts with data-preprocessing using the Principal Component Analysis method. Next, we validated the effectiveness of the hybrid artificial neural network, combined with an extended genetic algorithm for the hyperparameters and weight optimization, in predicting the groundwater levels in a selected monitoring well in California. The evaluation results have demonstrated the performance of the optimized ANN-GA model.</jats:p>",

In order to analyze the risks of water resources allocation under uncertain conditions, a new methodology called the stochastic simulation-based risk assessment approach is developed in this paper. First, the main hydrological stochastic variable is fitted by a proper probability distribution. Second, suitable two-stage stochastic programming is constructed to obtain the expected benefit and optimized water allocation targets. Third, the Monte Carlo method is used to obtain a suitable stochastic sample of the hydrological variable. Fourth, a pre-allocated water optimization model is proposed to obtain optimized actual benefit. The methodology can give a way for risk analysis of water allocation plans obtained by uncertain optimization models, which provides reliable assistance to water managers in decision-making. The proposed methodology is applied to the Zhanghe Irrigation District and the risk of the water allocation plan obtained under the randomness of annual inflow is assessed. In addition, three different division methods of the annual inflow are applied in the first step, namely three levels, five levels and seven levels, respectively. From the results, the risk of the water allocation scheme obtained by the TSP model is 0.372–0.411 and decreases with the increase of the number of hydrological levels. Considering both the risk and model complexity, seven hydrological levels are recommended when using the TSP model to optimize water allocation under stochastic uncertainty.</jats:p>",

IR64‐K had a greater average grain yield and harvest index than IR64 in a pot culture experiment with three levels of potassium fertilizer. The differences were most significant under treatment without the potassium fertilizer. IR64‐K also showed a slightly higher grain yield than IR64 when grown in a paddy field without applying the potassium fertilizer.

A dataset of 112 sites in Ontario, Canada with their Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) and richness values was used in the development of two ELM models. Each model used 70 and 30% of the dataset for training and testing respectively. The models show a great fit with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)=0.12 and 0.33 for HBI and richness test models, respectively. Then, features elimination based on ELM coefficients and coefficient of variation showed a slight increase in the models' RMSE to reach 0.09 and 0.33 correspondingly. Accordingly, this high predictability of the models in this research provide better insights into which factors influence HBI or richness, and suggests that ELM has a better architecture than other machine learning models and ANN to learn complex non-linear relationships. Also, sensitivity analysis expressed channel slope as the most affecting stream-health parameter for stream health.</jats:p>",

In many cases, the operators of water supply systems (WSS) have already reached their perception limit for analysing information. Therefore, the managing process of the WSS requires quasi-intelligent informatics systems, the main purpose of which is to minimise the WSS operating costs in addition to maintaining the proper water delivery to customers. It can be achieved by the detection of abnormal functioning of WSS operations (leakages, water outages). The standard SCADA monitoring systems, in most cases, are not able to distinguish a significant water leakage and water tank filling process. Such cases occur relatively often in complex water supply systems with many water tanks. The aim of this paper is to present the quasi intelligent method of detecting abnormal WSS functioning, including its concepts and effects after a 3 month period operation. The essence of the detection method is the integration of numerical model (built-in Bentley WaterGEMS software) and SCADA monitoring system. The monitoring data are constantly compared to the simulation results and when accepted accordance limits are exceeded, the appropriate alerts are generated. Such solution cause the WSS operator does not need to analyse SCADA system indications constantly. The additional application of the method enables the detection of essential water leakages.\n</jats:p>",

Furthermore, this study analyzes the impacts of the service cost coefficient and the consumer loyalty of the offline channel on the optimal price, service decision, and profit of different integration modes. This study also compares the profits of enterprises under centralized and decentralized decisions. The results show that centralized decision making can improve the service level of the SA (Store Assistance) effort and the sustainable performance of the supply chain. Whether the BOPS channel is managed by the manufacturer or retailer, the service cost, the product return rate, and the offline channel consumer loyalty have an impact on the decision of product sale price, wholesale price, and SA effort service level. Offline customer loyalty is less sensitive in the BOPS channel managed by the retailer than that managed by the manufacturer. It is suitable for the manufacturer to manage the BOPS channel when offline customer loyalty is low. Otherwise, it is appropriate for the retailer to manage the BOPS channel. The profit of the supply chain under the decentralized decision is less than that under the centralized decision. When executing a wholesale price contract, different omni-channel integration modes can alleviate the double marginalization effect. It can fully coordinate the supply chain members, motivate retailers to improve the service level of the SA effort, and realize Pareto improvement to support supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>"

This research assessing the benefit of adopting ERP technology and practicing green supply chain management toward operational performance in manufacturing industry. The study is essential to provide insight for the manufacturing industry regarding the consequences and benefits of practicing the green supply chain and adopting ERP technology amid the current constraints of the environmental protection issue and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study has surveyed 122 companies domiciled in Indonesia. Data collection used a questionnaire designed with a seven-point Likert scale. Questionnaire created in Google form, printed and distributed using social media and postal mail. Data analysis used SmartPLS software version 3.0. The result revealed that ERP adoption enables green purchasing, production, distribution, and operational performance. Furthermore, operating performance is directly affected by green purchasing and green production. However, operating performance was not supported by green distribution. In addition, ERP adoption indirectly improves operational performance through green purchasing and green production. But ERP adoption did not affect operational performance through green distribution. This result provides essential insight for the manager in the manufacturing industry that adopting ERP in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and practicing environmental protection such as green purchasing, green production enhances operational performance. In summary, the result of this study encourages the practitioner to adopt environmental protection in running their business since it benefits the company. While there are very few studies examining the relationship between ERP adoption, green supply chain practices, and operational performance, this study is essential in terms of exploring the mediating role of green supply chain practices on the effect of ERP adoption on operational performance. Thus, these research findings could enrich the current research in the supply chain management context.</jats:p>"

The existence of the PAMSIMAS program is expected to help residents access clean water. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact that PAMSIMAS had on the village community of Stabat Lama and also what factors supported and hindered community participation in the PAMSIMAS Program. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative. The findings of this study indicate that the existence of PAMSIMAS has had an impact on lifestyle and social interaction in the community. In addition, there are several supporting factors in community participation including the establishment of cooperation between the community and local officials and the availability and ease of information to the community regarding the management of PAMSIMAS. The inhibiting factors for community participation are the limited information on the program that was launched due to the tight regulation of program arrangements, the lack of understanding between the community and the government in managing PAMSIMAS, and the PAMSIMAS program administration system which tends to be less involved with the community in program implementation</jats:p>"

In this regard, arginine participates in important regulatory functions associated with nutrient metabolism, cell proliferation, and immune response that contribute to the maintenance of a functional intestinal tract. However, Current nutritional practices for weaned pigs do not consider the critical regulatory roles of arginine related to pig gut health and function. The objective of this study was to determine growth response of weaned pigs fed increasing levels of L-Arginine during the first weeks after weaning. A total of 225 weaned pigs (BW 5.8 ± 0.9 kg) were used in a randomized complete block design and assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments, with 9 replicate pens of 5 pigs. A basal diet was formulated to meet current arginine requirements (0.66% - NRC, 2012) and L-arginine was supplemented at 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2%. Experimental diets were provided in meal form during phases 1 and 2 of a 3-phase nursery feeding program: Phase 1 (d 0-d 7), Phase 2 (d 8-d 21), and Phase 3 (d 22-d 42). A common diet was provided during phase 3. Feed disappearance and body weight were measured at d 7, 14, 21, and 42 after weaning. Through the first 3 weeks after weaning, increasing dietary arginine supply linearly improved (P ≤ 0.05) body weight (8.25 - 11.20 kg), average daily gain (Figure 1), average daily feed intake (251.53 - 387.75 g), and gain to feed ratio (0.60 – 0.66) of pigs. These beneficial effects persisted throughout phase 3, where arginine supplementation resulted in a linear improvement in pig overall growth performance. In addition, increasing arginine supply reduced the percentage of pigs that lost weight during the first week post-weaning by 29%. Overall, weaned pigs require more dietary arginine for optimal nursery performance, which includes reducing fall back pigs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p />",

The purpose of the work is to identify research dimensions based on AM-enabled supply chain management (SCM) taxonomy from the product, information and service flow point of view. This article uses a systematic literature review (SLR) on AM-enabled SCM. The literature from 116 peer-reviewed journal papers over 10 years (2010–2021) was comprehensively reviewed and assessed. The selected articles were characterized using (a) SC processes—upstream, manufacturing and downstream and (b) SC flows—goods and services, information and finance. This work provides a direction to scholars and academicians for identifying important SC implications of AM technology adoption. Practitioners can benefit by understanding several challenges involved in AM technology adoption and its implications on SC processes. This work adds new insights by identifying research dimensions based on AM-enabled SCM taxonomy. </jats:p>",

The technological revolution in supply chain logistics is experiencing a significant wave of new innovations and challenges. Despite the current fast digital technologies, customers expect the ordering and delivery process to be faster, and as a result, this has made it easier and more efficient for organizations looking to implement new technologies. “Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)”, which means using the Internet of Things to perform intelligent tasks with the help of artificial intelligence integration, is one of these expected innovations that can turn a complex supply chain into an integrated process. AIoT innovations such as data sensors and RFID (radio detection technology), with the power of artificial intelligence analysis, provide information to implement features such as tracking and instant alerts to improve decision making. Such data can become vital information to help improve operations and tasks. However, the same evolving technology with the presence of the Internet and the huge amount of data can pose many challenges for the supply chain and the factors involved. In this study, by conducting a literature review and interviewing experts active in FMCG industries as an available case study, the most important challenges facing the AIoT-powered supply chain were extracted. By examining these challenges using nonlinear quantitative analysis, the importance of these challenges was examined and their causal relationships were identified. The results showed that cybersecurity and a lack of proper infrastructure are the most important challenges facing the AIoT-based supply chain.</jats:p>"

The advent of COVID-19 has forced changes in the supply chain and some cases disrupted it. In some cases, it has been a do-or-die situation as social distancing and passenger travel and essentials have affected most economies. China controlled about 40% of the global supply chain, and most countries were made to change and initiate alternative supply chains to reduce the risk. The purpose of this study is to study how the emerging technologies of blockchain, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning are the few additions to enhance the supply chain. The supply chain digitalization will lead to cost reduction, improved efficiency, data security, and storage of the information. The emerging technologies are poised to revolutionize the supply chain and logistics.

Over the last decade of the evolution of supply chain management (SCM), a steady stream of research and articles dealing with the theory and practice of SCM have been published, but the topic of performance measurement has not received adequate consideration. However, many critical drawbacks prevent the existing performance measurement systems from making a significant contribution to the development and improvement of SCM and thus, several researches is still needed in this area. So, we present a unique multi-adaptive spider monkey optimization algorithm (MASMOA) to enhance the ability of hub and spoke model to educate the key process throughout the SCM. Initially, for the pre-processing step, we use a normalizing technique to remove unwanted noises from the raw dataset, and then we use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the unwanted features from the pre-processed data. The information was then encrypted and fed into the hub-and-spoke model for data protection purpose. The proposed method is then used to optimize the hub and spoke model's transport process over hubs. The optimized data is then decoded using a decryption technique to transform the encrypted information into actual format. The Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm was used for the encryption and decryption operations. Finally, performance measures such as encryption and decryption execution time, security rate, and scalability level are compared to comparable techniques. Using the MATLAB environment, the results are shown.</jats:p>"

The critical period for bees is the end of winter and the beginning of spring. During this time, there are large fluctuations in air temperature, and bees are forced to change their state from passive to active. By the end of winter, the club rises to the top of the hive, and the honey supply decreases significantly. Thus, this article considers a model that takes these changes into account. According to the results of the simulation, it was found that the movement of the bee club and the decrease of honey reserves in winter increase the fluctuations of the air temperature inside the hive. This affects the internal temperature regime of the bee club. At the same time, the stock of heat energy in the honey decreases and smoothes temperature fluctuations within the bee aggregation less. It is proposed to add a hive weight strain gauge to the previously developed electric bee heating control circuit, which will allow to correct the PWM output voltage coming to the heaters.</jats:p>",

The objective was to quantify the net nutrient contribution of the beef supply chain to Fe, Zn, Se, P, B12, B6, riboflavin, niacin, and choline in the human diet. Beef cattle production parameters for the beef supply chain were as described by Baber et al. (2018; 10.1093/tas/txy086) with the red meat and liver yield from each production segment estimated using literature values of serially harvested beef cattle. Nutrient concentration of feeds was acquired from feed composition tables in beef, swine, poultry, and equine nutrient requirement texts, and the nutrient concentration of beef and liver was based on 2018 USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies. Nutrient absorption values of feeds, red meat, and liver were acquired from the literature for humans or swine if human studies were unavailable. The human-edible conversion ratio was &amp;lt; 1.0 for all nutrients except for P and B12 when only red meat yield was considered indicating that the beef supply chain consumed more human-edible nutrients than it produced. Results were similar when liver yield was added although the ratios were closer to 1 for other nutrients. After adjusting for the absorptability of nutrients, the beef supply chain was a net contributor of niacin, P, and B12 in the human diet with or without liver. The net nutrient contribution is driven primarily by the ratio of nutrient concentration and absorbability of nutrients in beef relative to corn. In the current production scenario, the combined ratio of nutrient concentration multiplied by the ratio of absorbability must equal 15.17 or 12.45 to achieve equilibrium between nutrient consumed and produced for red meat or red meat plus liver yield, respectively. In conclusion, current beef production system is a net contributor of human-absorbable P, B12, and niacin to the human diet.</jats:p>",

On the negative side, in-forest drying may result in dry matter losses (DML), impacting the quantity and quality of residues delivered to energy plants. This paper investigated the impact of roundwood and residues in-forest drying and DML on supply chain costs and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. For the assessment, a short-term optimization planning tool was applied to a supply chain located in Asturias, Spain, consisting of fourteen supply points and two demand points: A pulp mill (demanding roundwood) and a power plant (demanding residues). Four scenarios were included in the analysis comprising different combinations of DML for roundwood and residues resulting from in-forest drying. Our results indicate that in scenarios that include in-forest drying and DML, the negative economic effects are offset by the substantial reductions in transport costs and GHG emissions. In-forest drying of roundwood and residues without DML can result in a 6.5% reduction in supply chain costs, 14.9% fewer truckloads to destination points, and 18.1% less fuel consumption and GHG emissions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Until recently, China was the largest scrap and unsorted waste importer in the world. Chinese industries sorted the imported wastes and recovered plastic, paper, textiles, and metals, using them as raw materials for manufacturing processes. Since 2013, the Chinese government has imposed measures to ban the import of wastes, the latest one being the “National Sword” policy (fully deployed in January 2021), banning the import of unsorted and recycled wastes. As a result, collecting wastes and recyclables and sending them to China is no longer an option; this has drastically affected the recycling industry supply chain with considerable consequences. This study analyzed the development of Chinese foreign policies on the export of paper waste materials from the U.S. and their specific impact on the recovered paper recycling industry. The economic and environmental consequences of the policy on the U.S. paper recycling industry were analyzed using three scenarios: landfilling (as a baseline), incineration, and recycling. The CO2 emissions were estimated and then compared. It was found that recycling would result in the largest reduction in greenhouse gases. Although recycling was the best evaluated scenario, it has the greatest costs; therefore, possible solutions towards adding value to paper wastes were analyzed.</jats:p>"

The SC is managed by an SME entrepreneur, seeking financial support from a multi-sided FinTech platform (MSP) to develop a portfolio of green and non-green products. The MSP offers the SC a combination of equity financing (EF) and debt financing (DF) facilities and must decide on the interest rate of its DF facility. Using a benchmark model, we first characterize the SC’s production and the MSP’s financing decisions under a deregulated scenario. Focusing on an alternative case with government intervention (i.e., hybrid environmental-green entrepreneurship policy), we next develop a three-level game theoretical model and sequentially characterize the decision-making behavior of government, MSP, and SC. The model outcomes are analyzed by considering the policy approach (i.e., economic influence vs. social welfare) and the platform’s risk attitude. The results reveal that, when coupled with an appropriate government intervention policy, a regulated scenario leads to a better outcome, particularly when the MSP is risk-neutral and strikes a right balance between the EF and DF. The win–win situation may not be realized when the MSP is risk-averse and the host government is merely focused on its economic influence. To successfully promote sustainable supply chain finance (SSCF) through digital platforms, policy makers are urged to leverage their legislative power and prioritize green entrepreneurship and social welfare over their financial maximization agenda.</jats:p>",

Therefore, our objective was to evaluate feeding strategies to prolonged feed availability in group housed finishing pigs and assess impacts on pig performance. 1,407 mixed sex pigs (92±11 kg BW) were blocked by initial average BW to pens and assigned to 1 of 5 treatments (n =12 pens/treatment, 22 pigs/pen) over a 21-d test period. Treatments were fed for 14 d (P1) and thereafter all pens returned to ad libitum access to a standard commercial diet for 7 d (P2). Treatments included: 1) Pens fed ad libitum (CON); 2) Pens fed at 1.45x ME maintenance requirement daily (1.45x); 3) Pens fed 2x ME maintenance requirement daily (2x); 4) Tightened feeders to lowest setting, fed ad libitum (Closed); and 5) Whole corn kernels, fed ad libitum (Corn). The P1 and P2 BW and feed disappearance were recorded to calculate ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Data were analyzed with pen as the experimental unit and least squares means values reported by treatment. Compared with CON, 1.45x, 2x, Closed and Corn treatments significantly reduced P1 ADG (1.09 vs 0.02, 0.34, 0.72, 0.41 kg/d, respectively), ADFI (3.21 vs. 1.42, 1.90, 2.49, 2.40 kg/d, respectively) and G:F (P &amp;lt; 0.05). During P2, ADG and G:F were both increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with CON across all treatments. However, ADFI increased only from the CON in the 2x, Closed and Corn diets (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Overall (d 0-21), all strategies attenuated BW, ADG and ADFI (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) compared with CON. However, G:F was only reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in 1.45x and Corn, but not 2x and Closed (P &amp;gt; 0.05) from the CON.

Though, the influencing factors of IoT are highly complex and diverse, which result in the information-intensiveness of the SCs processes. This, in turn, leads to lots of barriers to SCs. In this paper, we evaluate and rank the IoT risks for “Supply Chain Management (SCM)” by utilizing “Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)” and “Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS)” under “q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFSs)”.

Magma cooling and crystallization substantially shape the axial thermal regime by providing heat that is lost to the ocean through conduction and hydrothermal convection. Geological data suggest that melt is emplaced over a wide depth range, variably accessible to hydrothermal cooling, and that periods of higher and lower melt supply may alternate at a given location. Until now, numerical models focused on steady‐state thermal regimes controlled by either spreading rate or melt supply, falling short at slow‐ultraslow ridges. Here we present results from a 2‐D numerical thermal model that couples repeated melt injections and hydrothermal convection. We first constrain thermal regimes inferred from two ultraslow‐spreading endmembers in melt supply at the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR): a magmatically robust endmember at 50°28'E and a nearly amagmatic endmember at 64°30'E. We adjust parameters associated with melt supply (the melt injection frequency and the temperature of the host rocks upon melt emplacement) and hydrothermal circulation (the extent and permeability of the hydrothermal system). Our simulations predict that greater melt injection frequencies unsurprisingly produce hotter thermal regimes. However, at a given frequency, melt emplacement in cooler host rocks (e.g., &lt;800°C) causes cooler thermal regimes with transient black smoker‐type hydrothermal circulation that extracts heat efficiently. Periodic waxing and waning magma supply, as proposed from geological data at the SWIR 50°28'E, induces an oscillatory thermal regime. Transience in the axial thermo‐mechanical state may be an integral part of lower‐crustal construction at magmatically robust sections of slow‐ultraslow ridges.</jats:p>",

Whilst accepting their general premise, we argue that they downplay the fact that the evolution of logistics and supply chains has received sparse attention in the historical literature. Using case studies of the domestic British milk trade (1919–c.1945) and international quail trade ( c.1850–1914), we demonstrate how a concept originating in the study of modern supply chains – supply chain governance – can be illuminating. As a conceptual framework, this can facilitate the identification of key agents, institutions and goods movements within supply chains, and the nature of the relationships between them, whilst illuminating how change and development is shaped by regulation, economic cycles, consumer demand, and, of course, transport. The concept's application therefore presents a robust way to better understand the movement of goods in history. </jats:p>",

This emerging financing method can solve the problem of financing difficulties for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Many commercial banks are involved, but there are also many risks. As a representative of industrial integration, how commercial banks manage risks and improve the financial service supply chain is the focus of the article’s research. The article designs a set of risk management system based on machine learning and trains similar models to verify consumers by learning user behavior patterns. The system realizes the server-side authentication module and the intelligent terminal protection module and achieves the purpose of real-time protection of the intelligent terminal system. The system will adapt to mainstream Android and IOS on the market, including portable terminal devices and smart wearable devices. If it is found that the device has not been operated by the user, the user will be provided with corresponding feedback results, and a series of automatic protection operations such as device lock and system alarm will be provided. At the same time, we provide two modes of online detection and offline detection. The device only needs to have our cloud user model to authenticate users in an offline environment to ensure that systems in different environments can run. The article solves the imbalance between user data and negative samples and most unlabeled user data and designs a set of management learning methods to ensure user certainty. By cooperating with enterprises, we can learn and analyze this set of data in our system. The results show that the accuracy rates of effective operation and user static data are 93.77% and 95.57%, respectively.</jats:p>",

How to reasonably allocate vehicles, optimize driving routes and travel time, deliver goods to customers on time at the lowest cost, and realize efficient and low-cost operation of the logistics distribution system has always been a problem in academia and industry for many years. Logistics enterprises face problems such as low efficiency of logistics operation, lack of scientific rationality of logistics resource planning, and lack of overall optimization of logistics management operation mode. These are severe tests that steel companies must accept. Under the background of logistics supply chain, the integrated service platform of logistics supply chain has become an urgent research topic. This study takes a steel enterprise as the main research background. On this basis, the two core modules of warehousing and distribution in the logistics business of iron and steel enterprises are qualitatively analyzed, the concept of business process reengineering is proposed, and the logistics supply chain of iron and steel enterprises is established. The concept of comprehensive service platform is realized through RFID technology. In addition, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis and research on the logistics distribution path optimization and vehicle scheduling problem, designs and implements a logistics vehicle scheduling management system, and then adopts the multiobjective method to solve the logistics distribution path planning problem, SMEs. Genetic algorithm and a simulation decision-making subsystem suitable for this problem are designed, which can better solve the problem of route optimization and vehicle scheduling in small-scale distribution.</jats:p>",

It was found that the supply level of healthcare service in the Yangtze River Delta had improved significantly. The differences in the supply level of healthcare service between cities had tended to narrow without polarization, and the supply level of healthcare service generally showed a high spatial pattern in the south delta and low spatial pattern in the north delta. The higher the supply level of healthcare service was, the weaker the interannual variability was. The supply level of healthcare service in the Yangtze River Delta region presented obvious spatial association and differentiated tendency of local high and low spatial clusters. The relative length and curvature of the supply level of healthcare service in the Yangtze River Delta generally presented a spatial pattern with low values in the northeast and high values in the southwest. Population density and urban-rural income gap generally exhibited negative spatio-temporal impact on the supply level of healthcare service across most cities. On the other hand, urbanization level and per capita disposable income generally had positive spatio-temporal impact on the supply level of healthcare service across most cities. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) showed an increasingly positive spatio-temporal impact on the supply level of healthcare service across most cities.

Methodology and results: The method use to analyze the potential of Ciberang river is a hydrological statistical analysis. The results of the hydrological statistical analysis show that the water resources of the Ciberang River are not sufficient to meet domestic and industrial water needs in Banten Province. Domestic and industrial water demand in Banten Province in 2025 is estimated at 14.64 m3/s and 10.46 m3/s, respectively, while the mainstay discharge with the return period of 10 and 20 year for all durations does not meet these water needs. The mainstay discharge of the Ciberang River with a 10-year return period of 1, 2, 7, 15 and 30 day respectively was 0.08 m3/s, 0.1 m3/s, 0.19 m3/s, 0.36 m3/s, and 0.87 m3/s. The mainstays of the 20-year return period of 1,2,7,15 and 30 day respectively are 0.04 m3/s, 0.06 m3/s, 0.11 m3/s, 0.23 m3/s and 0.59 m3/s. Conclusion, significance, and impact study: Based on this, it is necessary to conserve water resources to increase the main flow of the Ciberang River. One of the strategic policies to increase the river's mainstay discharge is constructing the reservoir.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a general trend of increased marketization of long-term care (LTC) services across Europe, with the natural consequence that market forces will affect the supply of LTC. At the same time, there has been a rapid increase in the use of home-based provision for those requiring LTC support. However, there is little evidence about what the effects of growing domiciliary care provision has on the markets for institutional forms of care. This is important from a policy point of view in terms of managing local markets, access to services, the quality of services and inequality. Using data from England for all care homes and domiciliary care providers registered to provide care to older people during 2014–2016, we assessed if increased domiciliary care supply was linked to increased likelihood of care home closure. Using Cox proportional hazard models of care home closure controlling for care home characteristics including quality and local area measures of needs and income, the findings provide no evidence that domiciliary care provision is a substitute for care homes. In some specifications, there was even a complementary relationship between the two forms of social care: increased domiciliary care supply significantly reduced the likelihood of care home closure. Potential reasons for the complementary relationship and implications for European LTC policy are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The performance of axial-piston hydraulic feed pumps depends on the technical condition of the coupling parts that form a radial gap in the pumping unit of the pump. The dynamics of its growth is largely due to the technical condition of parts that form a radial gap in the plain bearings of the pumping pump assembly: «drive shaft pin - bushing hole», «driven axle pin - bushing hole». Stabilization of a radial backlash in sliding bearings is possible by carrying out constructive improvement of the plug which will provide reduction of a contact angle of surfaces of friction of details in couplings. The aim of the work is to ensure the stabilization of the radial clearance in the pumping unit of the feed pump by developing constructive measures to reduce wear of parts in its plain bearings. From the analysis of the operating conditions of the plain bearing it is established that the reduction of the friction force is possible due to the reduction of the contour pressures and the increase of the area of liquid friction between the surfaces of the parts. Providing such conditions is possible by using combined bushings, which consist of working and guide bushings, between which is installed an elastic damping element in the spherical channels of which are additional compensation springs, which are placed in a circle through . The reduction of the friction force when using a combined sleeve with compensating springs is explained by the formation of the deformation component of the friction force at the vertices of the microroughness of the sleeve surface, as the spring elasticity is 4% less than the modulus of elasticity of the sleeve material. The lower value of the moment of friction forces at the end of the test is due to the constant absorption of vibration loads by the elastic damping element, the elasticity of which is 2% less than the modulus of elasticity of the sleeve material, which also reduces the contact area. The total less wear of the experimental friction pair is due to the reduction of the contact area of the shaft with the sleeve in the area of maximum values of friction forces.</jats:p>"

The credit of the core enterprises in the supply chain cannot penetrate the SMMEs in upstream and downstream. This paper establishes a blockchain pass-through model for supply chain financing by improving the PBFT consensus algorithm based on blockchain’s decentralised and tamper-evident characteristics and the pass-through of SMMEs’ assets in the supply chain. The model improves the circulation efficiency of the supply chain; moreover, it enables the credit of core enterprises to the upstream and downstream, solving the financing dilemma of SMMEs. </jats:p>",

The study specifically assesses the AHR demand of regional employment enterprises and the human resource development goals and related curricula in the three branches of PHEIs. It also analyses the employment situation of PHEI graduates and whether they address the actual AHR supply needs of the regional labour market. Six PHEIs and nine enterprises as employers were investigated as the study population, combining qualitative and quantitative data. The findings indicate that China’s PHEIs quickly identified and overcame the challenges in their previous student cultivation goals and relevant curricula by researching the regional situation and taking responsibility for meeting demand. As a result, the PHEIs worked on developing transformative human resource systems through various initiatives. Moreover, these transformations of educational content worked in conjunction with a process that matched the graduates with jobs at regional enterprises. The transformed PHEIs are beginning to provide a human resource supply system that successfully expands the AHR supply from the various categories of PHEIs in the region. </jats:p>",

On the basis of emergy theory, this paper constructs the water-supply-benefit model of economic (industry, agriculture, and the tertiary industry) and social (domestic, employment security, entertainment, scientific research) systems. Taking Xi’an from 2014 to 2020 as an example, by analyzing the energy flow of each system and the multisource water transformities, the water contribution rate, the water-supply benefit, and the unit-water-resource value in each system are calculated. For the water-supply benefits: Industry &gt; Agriculture &gt; Domestic &gt; Tertiary industry &gt; Employment Security &gt; Entertainment &gt; Scientific research. For the unit-water-resource values: Industry &gt; Tertiary industry &gt; Agriculture &gt; Domestic &gt; Entertainment &gt; Employment security &gt; Scientific research. In the economic system, the water-supply benefit and the unit-water value of industry were always the largest, followed by agriculture and the tertiary industry. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the water contribution rate and the output of the industrial system was only 0.52, which was less than that of other production industries, which indicates that there might be a waste of water and that industrial water conservation needs to be further strengthened. In the social system, the domestic-water-supply benefits and the water-resource value were the largest. This is because water resources, as a basic resource, always affect people’s health and quality of life.</jats:p>"

This short‐termism has sabotaged repeated attempts to move the UK economy onto a higher and more sustainable growth path and will likely hinder the government in meeting its objectives on productivity, decarbonisation and levelling up through reindustrialisation. The problem has both institutional and ideological causes, largely to do with Treasury domination of the supply‐side agenda and its default market failure approach.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The significance of trade in the development of nations made this study examine the impact of trade balance, exchange rate, and money supply on economic growth with reference to Nigeria's economy and serve as a lesson for other African countries. The study relies on the Mundell-Fleming BOP model for its framework with the use of secondary time-series data extracted from the statistical bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 1981 to 2020. The ARDL cointegration of the least square was adopted. The result showed a long-term relationship among trade balance, exchange rate, broad money supply, interest rate, inflation rate, and economic growth in Nigeria. Our study thus concludes that the oil trade balance is the fundamental driver of Nigeria's economic growth, and appropriately, we suggested that to ensure economic growth in Nigeria and other African countries, the government should strategize on policies to develop trade in the non-oil sector; also the monetary authorities should design frameworks towards making money supply growth enhancer, and stabilization of the exchange rate for domestic countries to gain more from trade by intensifying the flux of credit to the real and exporting sector towards setting the economies on the track of expansion.</jats:p>",

While an open and collaborative environment has been essential for advancing R&amp;D, this approach exposes university-based R&amp;D to a variety of security threats including state-supported efforts, attacks by malicious actors, and insufficient internal mitigation. As the pandemic led to more remote work and online collaboration, the incidence of exploitation has expanded. Increased security measures are needed to insulate and protect the R&amp;D ecosystem, and US innovation more broadly, while maintaining the fundamental qualities that have contributed to its historical success. In this article, we present the Research Integrity Security Certification (RISC) framework. This concept preserves the autonomy of the US higher education system while also suggesting a mechanism whose effect would be a general enhancement of the security of the US university R&amp;D enterprise with minimal additional state involvement. Much of the work in the proposed model is done by market mechanisms and self-interested microeconomic calculations that generate beneficial aggregate effects. The RISC framework modernizes the university R&amp;D enterprise while strengthening it to operate in this evolving security environment.</jats:p>",

For this study, the remote sensing data of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration were combined with the SWAT model using the Data Assimilation method, Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Calibration of runoff flow rate in the SWAT model showed the correlation coefficient ranging between 0.69 and 0.84 in the calibration period (2000–2009) and between 0.64 and 0.86 for the validation period (2010–2014). The assimilation of the remote sensing data with the calibrated SWAT model showed that the model simulations for both the variables of surface soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration improved by at least 25% in both 2010 and 2014. It has been determined that 10.5 and 25.4% of the region's lands have a Very Appropriate and Appropriate potential for rainfed wheat agriculture, respectively. Areas with Moderate and Inappropriate potential occupy 64.1% of the lands in the region.</jats:p>",

The supply quality levels of the four analyzed park types could be ranked as follows: garden parks (118.00) &gt; community parks (73.67) &gt; comprehensive parks (−16.64) &gt; specific parks (−32.17). Among the analyzed recreation parks, the accessibility of daily recreation parks was poor, while the overall service efficiency of weekly recreation parks was better, except in a few regions. These research results can provide suggestions for future green space planning in Shenyang city. In addition, from the perspective of landscape patterns, studying the service quality of parks and green spaces can provide new ideas for further research on accessibility.</jats:p>"

We categorized the CRM environment for small businesses by primary customer type and by size, and examined the performance differences across these categories. Specifically, the CRM categories were business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government/federal (B2Gf), or business-to-government/state and local (B2Gs); while the size categories were Micro (&lt;10 employees), Mini (10–24 employees), Small-I (25–49 employees), and Small-II (50–99 employees). We found evidence of superior performance for B2B firms on several dimensions including sales, employment, as well as sales per employee and sales per payroll measures of efficiency.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain financing guaranteed by third-party logistics (3PL) firms is an effective way to solve the financing difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Studies have explored factors that affect the willingness of supply chain financial credit providers under guarantee of 3PL firms (e.g., the scale of financing enterprises and credit). However, whether the scale of 3PL firms will affect the bank’s credit decision has not been studied, as well as the neural processing of credit decisions. To clarify these issues, this study extracted behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) data when participants performed a selection task of judging whether to grant credit to guaranteed financing-seeking enterprises according to the large or small scale of the 3PL guaranteeing firms. The behavioral results showed that under the condition of a large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm, the willingness to provide credit to SMEs was higher than that under the condition of a small-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm. This finding indicates there was credit scale discrimination against 3PL guaranteeing firms in supply chain finance. The ERP results showed that compared with the condition of a large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm, a greater N2 amplitude was induced under the condition of a small-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm, which indicated that credit decision makers experienced greater perceived risk and more decision-making conflict. In contrast, a larger LPP amplitude was detected under the condition of a large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firm (as opposed to a small-scale firm), which indicated that large-scale 3PL guaranteeing firms received more positive comments and more positive emotions from credit decision makers than small-scale 3PL guaranteeing firms. Based on these results, this study reveals the cognition process of credit decision makers regarding the impact of the 3PL guaranteeing firm scale on the willingness to provide credit in supply chain finance and explains the theory of credit scale discrimination from the perspective of decision neuroscience.</jats:p>"

Female adolescents are more at risk of anemia due to stress, eating late, and losing large amounts of iron during menstruation. One part of the moringa plant (Moringa oleifera), namely the leaves, is believed to increase hemoglobin levels. The method of attracting adolescents to moringa leaf is by processing the moringa leaf becomes a snack called moringa leaf cilok. This research aims to determine the hemoglobin level of adolescent girls who experience anemia before and after being given moringa leaves cilok. This is experimental research with one group pre-post test design from October to November 2021 in Mataram. The subjects in this research are female adolescents with anemia who met the sample criteria. The sample used is n1=n2=32 respondents. The treatment group received moringa leaf cilok and was controlled tablets by giving iron tablets. The data collected was processed by a nonparametric test. The results show an effect of giving moringa leaf cilok on the hemoglobin levels of adolescent girls (p&gt;0.05). The content of iron and vitamin C in moringa leaves cilok has increased hemoglobin levels. This research concludes that moringa leaf cilok can increase hemoglobin levels in female adolescents.

Especially, low voltage auxiliary converters, which usually supply high current and low voltage loads, are not readily available industrially and need special attention. In terms of energy density and efficiency, LLC converters are among the most commonly used and efficient topologies for automotive and aerospace applications. In the case of aerospace applications, a fault-tolerant topology is highly desirable to reduce the need for redundant components and weight by removing backup systems. To solve this issue, this study introduces a new 2.0 kW LLC-based converter with a reconfigurable fault-tolerant architecture. With the help of a specially designed secondary side, the proposed converter can reconfigure itself so that even if one of the semiconductor switches fails permanently, the converter can still maintain power at nominal voltage levels, ensuring that the aircraft’s vital functionality is preserved. This paper also describes the basic operation principle, component-design aspects, conduction loss reduction techniques, and control system algorithm. Finally, a 2.0 kW experimental prototype is built to verify and demonstrate the operation of the proposed reconfigurable LLC converter.</jats:p>"

The paper describes the developed control system of the grid converter, which, in addition to transferring the generated power to the single-phase grid, effectively compensates the reactive power occurring in it. The proposed structure of the proportional resonant regulator with finite gain that cooperates with the single-phase grid was discussed. The use of quadrature estimators of voltage and current enabled independent control of the active and reactive components of the current, thus compensating for the reactive power.

Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites of certain fungi in agricultural products that are harmful to animal and human health. The presence of mycotoxins in these products depends on a variety of management and environmental factors in the field, during storage and/or processing of feed and food commodities. To date, information on mycotoxin management is available, but is not easy to access by supply chain actors. This study aimed to design, build and test a Decision Support System (DSS) that can help decision making on mycotoxin management by various actors along the feed and food supply chains. As part of this, available knowledge and data on mycotoxin prevention and control were collected and synthesised into easy to understand guidelines and tools for various groups of end-users. The DSS consists of four different modules: (a) static information module and (b) scenario analysis module, (c) dynamic module for forecasting mycotoxins, and (d) dynamic module for real-time monitoring of moulds/mycotoxins in grain silos. Intended end-users are all end-user groups for modules (a) and (b); growers and collectors for module (c) and; post-harvest storage managers for module (d). The DSS is user-friendly and accessible through PCs, tablets and smartphones (see<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://mytoolbox-platform.com/\">https://mytoolbox-platform.com/</jats:ext-link>). In various phases of the DSS development, the tool has been demonstrated to groups of end-users, and their suggestions have been taken into account, whenever possible. Also, a near final version has been tested with individual farmers on the easiness to use the system. In this way we aimed to maximise the DSS uptake by actors along the chain. Ultimately, this DSS will improve decision making on mycotoxin management; it will assist in reducing mycotoxin contamination in the key crops of Europe, thereby reducing economic losses and improving animal and human health.</jats:p>",

By comparing the prediction data with the classical literature, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Gray-monarch butterfly optimization prediction model are confirmed.Finally a carbon neutral pathway is given for Tianjin based on the prediction results.</jats:p>",

Studying the relationship between precipitation, runoff and sediment load, traditional methods are based on observational data fitted or artificial intelligence predictions, whose accuracy is directly dependent on the quality and quantity of the data. This paper developed a new approach for researching the relationship between precipitation, runoff and sediment load. Based on the sliding accumulative anomaly method, the M-K mutation analysis and the wavelet functions, variation of precipitation and runoff annually were discussed. The results indicated the annual variation trend of the precipitation and runoff have been consistent since 1969, both with a 28-year main cycle, and runoff variations were less subject to human influence in the Luozha River. Therefore, the formula of the relationship between annual runoff and sediment load can be obtained by integrating discrepancy in the magnitude of its variation in the natural state, which was verified by the observational data and was applicable to acquisition of annual sediment load. The current work broadens the current knowledge of recent changes in the Lancang River Basin and improves the recognition of the water-sediment interrelation in the river.</jats:p>",

As cross-border e-commerce occupies a share of foreign trade in foreign trade increases, so does their influence. In order to eliminate bottlenecks in the cross-border logistics of an electric enterprise, it is of great importance to systematically study the issues of synergy in the logistics of the supply chain of a cross-border electric enterprise and validate how cross-border traders and cross-border logistics work together using cross-border discussion based on the perspective of cross-border e-commerce ecosystem.

Flow batteries are a highly efficient solution for long-term energy storage in critical and alternative energy facilities. The main advantage of the flow batteries is the ability to create a system with the required power and capacity without redundant parameters due to the fact that the characteristics of the system are regulated by independent blocks, as in a fuel cell. Among flow batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are of particular interest, as they have a long service life. The main elements of a flow battery are the stack, which determines the power of the battery and its efficiency, and the electrolyte, which determines the energy capacity of the battery and its service life. A stand for testing the operating modes of the flow battery stack has been developed. A 5 kW flow battery operating on an electrolyte with the addition of hydrochloric acid, which is a stabilizer in new generation electrolytes, has been tested.</jats:p>"

The investigation was made on 40 specimens of the human pancreas: 17 – corrosive preparations, 23 – fixed preparations of the pancreas with the parenchyma dissection. Pancreatic vessels were filled with latex of different colors to verify arteries and veins. The preparations were fixed in 10 % acid formalin for a week. After this period, a part of the preparations was dissected, another part was immersed in alkaline solution to obtain corrosive casts of vessels.</jats:p><jats:p>Results. The greatest number of cases of the gland vascularization (50.0 %) was of type II, which was characterized by mixed presence of long and short branches of the splenic artery in the arterial blood supply of the gland parenchyma. The variant with predominance of short branches (Type I) was the second most frequent (32.5 %). The variant with predominance of blood supply of the gland only due to long branches (Type III) was observed less frequently, in 17 % of cases. In the majority of cases there were numerous arterial anastomoses in the form of arcades in the gland parenchyma (88,2 % of cases). They usually continue large branches of the splenic artery (dorsal pancreatic artery and large pancreatic artery), whereas short branches usually supply only a small part of the gland.</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusion. The human pancreas has a marked anatomical variability of its arterial blood supply. The investigation showed that in most cases its parenchyma is vascularized by short and long branches of the splenic artery forming arcade-type anastomoses.

Among these techniques, solar air preheating systems with different configurations have proven their ability to reduce the energy consumption of buildings during the heating season. In this study, we propose a ventilated solar wall (VSW) with a thermal storage unit intended for preheating ventilation air. The final aim of this study is to determine the thermal performance of the studied VSW over a significant time period (during the heating season) under various climatic conditions when it is integrated into the building envelope. Therefore, for this purpose, a simplified model was developed to be coupled to a building energy simulation (BES) code. The results from the detailed steady-state 2D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model show that the thermal efficiency of the VSW ranged from 55% to 70% as the air mass flow rate increased from 0.008 kg/s to 0.02 kg/s for a surface of 2.15 m2. These results were used to evaluate the convective heat transfer coefficients in the two air cavities and to validate the simplified model. The results indicate good agreement between the two models.</jats:p>"

The paper presents results of the thermal and economic efficiency assessment of such ventilation system for multi-storey buildings. A comparison of the thermal energy consumption for the needs of heating and ventilation through the use of the proposed ventilation system has been made for two variants of buildings – with the thermal protection level of enclosing structures that meets modern regulatory requirements (buildings with heat consumption up  to 130 kW×h/(m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>×year)), and for a building similar in terms of planning structure, but with enclosing structures, the insulation level of which corresponds to buildings built before 1993 (buildings with heat consumption up to 260 kW×h/(m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>×year)).  The temperature conditions have been determined under which it becomes necessary to turn on the operation of devices  for additional (peak) heating of the supply air, when the thermal potential of solar radiation and secondary energy resources  is  insufficient to provide the calculated temperature of the supply air. For the ventilation system under consideration, it has been  established that the thermal resistance of the building envelope influences the indicators of the thermodynamic and economic efficiency of the proposed solution.

The P30 regime did not reduce yield, and promoted fruits’ dry matter and total phenols content, along with their concentrations of macronutrients, mesonutrients (S and Na) and micronutrients (mostly Cu, B, Zn); however, their Fe concentrations were depressed. The rootstock ‘Espina’ increased fruit yield, dry matter content, epicarp chroma (in ‘Birgah’) and Ca content, together with their concentrations of B and Zn (especially at P30), but reduced their Fe content, mostly under P30. Thus, the reduced P supply and grafting proved to be effective tools to enhance fruit yield, carpometric and almost all nutritional traits in eggplant, in a framework of more sustainable crop management.

The prioritization criteria and the levels within each criterion were identified based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on the criteria selected by Tunisian scientific committees. To determine the weights for the criteria and levels, reflecting their relative importance, a panel of frontline physicians treating COVID-19 were invited to participate in an online survey using 1,000 minds MCDA software (<jats:ext-link>www.1000minds.com</jats:ext-link>) which implements the PAPRIKA (Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives) method. Ten criteria and twenty-three levels have been selected for prioritizing the uses of COVID-19 vaccines in groups of people at significantly higher risk of severe disease or death. Among the invited physicians, sixty have completed the survey. The obtained scores were, in decreasing order of importance (mean weights in parentheses, summing to 100%). Obesity (16.2%), Age (12.7%), Chronic pulmonary diseases (10.8%), Chronic cardiovascular conditions (10.3%), Bone marrow or organ transplantation (10.1%), Immunodeficiency or Immunosuppression (9.6%), Diabetes (9%), Renal failure (8.4%), evolutive cancer (6.9%), and high blood pressure (6%).

To compensate for the shortage of electricity on board the spacecraft, various options for remote power supply from the system of space power stations transmitting energy to the solar battery by laser radiation during periods of its forced inactivity are possible. Long shadow-sunlight periods of time are a distinctive feature of functioning of low-orbit spacecraft. During these periods the solar battery is idle, and, in addition, even in the daylight portion of the spacecraft's orbit, the energy output from the spacecraft may be reduced to almost zero during the operation of some special systems that require special modes of spacecraft orientation. Reception of energy from a CES with energy flux density higher than that of the solar flux may lead to overheating of the solar battery panel of conventional design, a decrease in its efficiency and even to its failure. Therefore, the analysis of thermal modes of reception and conversion of laser radiation energy which affect the energy efficiency of the solar battery is an important aspect of remote power supply. Relationships of a mathematical model for estimating the available power supply from the solar battery operating in the mode of optimizing control of its power are proposed.

There have been an increasing number of studies in sustainable supply chain practices in the recent past. Limited studies have been done to identify the key strategic factors for sustainable operations of automotive sector in context to developing countries like India. The primary goal of this research is to undertake a thorough assessment and give a brief understanding of the barriers of sustainability in the automotive supply chain. Various barriers are identified from experts' interviews and past academic literature. An integrated approach comprising of the “decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory method” (DEMATEL) and “interpretive structural modelling” (ISM) method is employed to develop a contextual and hierarchical relationship among the identified barriers. The lack of awareness concerning reverse logistics adoption has the greatest causal effect. This is followed by a lack of information sharing on sustainable practices and complexity in measurement and monitoring of suppliers' environmental activities. To ensure the robustness of the model, sensitivity analysis has been also performed. The novelty of this work is that it identified several barriers towards a sustainable supply chain in automotive sector with a special focus on India. This work will help the practitioners to prioritize the strategic actions needed to be taken for developing sustainable supply chain management. This research has crucial policy implications for stakeholders working to build a sustainable CE by remanufacturing and reusing production waste.</jats:p>",

Digital technologies associated with Industry 4.0, such as blockchain, facilitate the implementation of circular economy principles throughout the supply chain. However, because blockchain implementation in the supply chain is still in the early stages, real‐world examples of the blockchain‐based circular supply chains (CSCs) are limited. The principal purpose of the paper is to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing blockchain‐based CSCs. Following that, 10 CSFs are identified through a short systematic literature review, and then, the integrated fuzzy cognitive mapping and fuzzy best‐worst method (FCM‐FBWM) is implemented to examine CSFs for the blockchain‐based CSC. The study's main findings demonstrate that network collaboration is the best CSF, while the shared circular economy toolbox is counted worst of all. This research enriches the literature by identifying the CSFs for implementing blockchain‐enabled CSCs to address the lack of a suitable decision‐making framework that assists managers in comprehending how blockchain technology can be adopted in the circular economy context. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed, offering new insights into the measures necessary to ensure successful blockchain implementations in CSCs.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the role of the airport, above all, is to unite the efforts of the air transport system and find a balance between their economic interests in order to maximize the efficient and safe use of air transport. In addition to effective cooperation with its partners, the airport must meet the requirements of international standards for aviation security, the appropriate state of infrastructure and efficiency of technological processes. States are also interested in developing, increasing the capacity of airports, expanding opportunities in the process of operation, as the airport contributes to the revival of ties between countries and the development of the global economy, tourism. Bringing the air transport infrastructure in line with international requirements is an important component of Ukraine's strategy aimed at ensuring the competitiveness of the national economy on the world market. Solving the problems of airport development is a nationwide problem that hinders the use of the high transit potential of the state. The complex and diverse challenges facing airports require rational, integrated and flexible solutions in business process management and active cooperation of air transport system participants, which is manifested in the coordination of strategic, tactical and operational decisions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the face of global competition, competitive enterprises should pursue sustainable development, and strengthen their supply chain resilience to cope with risks at any time. In addition, big data analysis has been successfully applied in a variety of fields. However, the method has not been applied to improve supply chain resilience in order to reduce sustainable supply chain risks. An approach for enhancing the capabilities of big data analytics must be developed to enhance supply chain resilience, and mitigate sustainable supply chain risks. In this study, a decision framework that integrates two-stage House of Quality and multicriteria decision-making was constructed. By applying this framework, enterprise decision-makers can identify big data analytics that improve supply chain resilience, and resilience indicators that reduce sustainable supply chain risks. A case study of one of China’s largest relay manufacturers is presented to demonstrate the practicability of the framework. The results showed that the key sustainable supply chain risks are risks regarding the IT infrastructure and information system efficiency, customer supply disruptions, transport disruptions, natural disasters, and government instability. To reduce risk in sustainable supply chains, enterprises must improve the key resilience indicators ‘financial capability’, ‘flexibility’, ‘corporate culture’, ‘information sharing’, and ‘robustness’. Moreover, to increase supply chain resilience, the following most important big data analysis enablers should be considered: ‘capital investment’, ‘building big data sharing mechanism and visualisation’, and ‘strengthening big data infrastructures to support platforms and systems’. This decision framework helps companies prioritise big data analysis enablers to mitigate sustainable supply chain risks in manufacturing organisations by strengthening supply chain resilience. The identified priorities will benefit companies that are using big data strategies and pursuing supply chain resilience initiatives. In addition, the results of this study show the direction of creating a fruitful combination of big data technologies and supply chain resilience to effectively mitigate sustainable risks. Despite the limited enterprise resources, management decision-makers can determine where big data analysis enablers can be most cost-effectively improved to promote risk resilience of sustainable supply chains; this ensures the efficient implementation of effective big data strategies.</jats:p>"

Here we estimate mass flow as well as food loss and waste along the US food supply chain for 10 commodity groups and nine management pathways to provide a baseline for designing efficient strategies to reduce, recycle, and recover food loss and waste. We estimate a total food loss and waste of 335.4 million metric tonnes from the U.S. food supply chain in 2016. Water evaporation (19%), recycling (55%), and landfill, incineration, or wastewater treatment (23%) accounted for most of the loss and waste. The consumption stage accounted for 57% of the food loss and waste disposed of through landfill, incineration, or wastewater treatment. Manufacturing was the largest contributor to food loss and waste (61%) but had a high recycling rate. High demand, perishable products accounted for 67% of food waste. We suggest that funding for infrastructure and incentives for earlier food donation can promote efficiency and sustainability of the supply chain, promote FLW collection and recycling along the U.S. FSC, and improve consumer education in order to move towards a circular economy.</jats:p>"

Characteristics of NTM, such as exposure via inhalation, disinfectant resistance, survival in oligotrophic conditions, and association with amoebae, are largely different from those of Escherichia coli (E. coli) which has been traditionally regarded as a model bacterium causing gastrointestinal diseases in water safety. However, the fate of NTM in water supply systems from source water to the point of use has not been systematically revealed yet. Thus, this review proposes that NTM should be regarded as alternative model bacteria in water use by updating the current knowledge on the occurrence, removal efficiency, and regrowth of NTM in water supply systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the need to establish a comprehensive quantitative microbial risk assessment to identify the critical control point, which is indispensable to mitigate NTM risk in water use.</jats:p>",

However, there are few techniques for measuring the efficiency of logistics supply chain systems. In order to be able to effectively analyze the efficiency measurement of the urban and rural logistics supply chain system and obtain higher accuracy, using a method derived from analysis of data envelopes, this essay examines the impact elements by establishing a data envelopment analysis model, using compound DEA analysis method and linear regression analysis method. The composite DEA analysis shows that all indicators in the indicator system are positively correlated, and the amount of people working in the field of distribution has the greatest impact on logistics efficiency. The annual average of pure technical efficiency is 0.932, and the annual average of scale efficiency is 0.910. In the eastern region, it is a lower-middle level. The empirical results of changes in the efficiency of the urban and rural logistics industry show that there is a significant positive correlation. This paper also builds a fuzzy algorithm optimization model and designs an overall fuzzy algorithm to solve the LRPPD problem. The simulation results show that the algorithm has good optimization performance, high computational efficiency, and strong convergence speed.</jats:p>",

To overcome this problem, the Government of Bangladesh launched the e-Procurement system in 2011 under the e-GP guidelines. Following the successful pilot testing conducted under the umbrella of the CPTU, all public Procurement Entities (PE) are attempting to implement e-procurement tenders. This study aims to test the cost and time involved in tender dropping both manual and e-procurement tenders. Roads and Highways Department (RHD) is chosen as population. Sample data was collected from the 11 RHD zones. Structured survey questionnaires were made to collect primary data from the bidders of RHD. The independent samples t-test was used to perform a hypothesis test of two groups like tender dropping cost and tender dropping time.

Reasonable evaluation of the scale of power-electronized supply that can be carried by the receiving-end grid is of great significance to guide power grid construction and maintain its operational safety. Firstly, this paper explains the theory that the unified effective short circuit ratio (UESCR) can reflect the static voltage stability of buses. Then, a multi-objective optimization model, which considers the external dc feed-in, local renewable energy, unit output, and operation constraints, is established to obtain the power-electronized supply accommodation capacity. And it is solved repeatedly by means of cyclic increasing dc feed-in scale and renewable energy penetration. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are verified in a modified IEEE 39 bus system.</jats:p>",

The determining and leading factor influencing the safety and proper residual life of the WWER-1000 reactor vessel is the radiation embrittlement of the reactor steel. The consequences of radiation embrittlement of reactor steel are negatively manifested in emergencies with cooling of the core. This process itself – radiation embrittlement – accumulates constantly and gradually. Therefore, it is important to monitor it by periodically performing ongoing rapid assessments of the brittle strength of the WWER-1000 reactor vessel (along with other factors, including cyclic damage, as discussed in a previous publication). Therefore, it is important to use the calculated express methods of periodic assessment of the brittle strength of the WWER-1000 reactor vessel with guaranteed accuracy. The effectiveness of the approach is supported by low cost of resources – engineering staff, fast and relatively simplified use of computers and software.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we consider a dual-channel farming supply chain with two farmers and one distributor, where agriculture products produced by farmers have different quality levels. Farmers sell high-quality products to supermarkets and normal-quality products to small retail markets, respectively. Three scenarios are investigated: decentralized selling through the distributor to supermarkets (the DD mode); centralized selling through the distributor to supermarkets (the CD mode); centralized selling directly to supermarkets (the CS mode). Under the CS mode, farmers need to bear some extra sale cost such as inventory and transportation cost. We derive farmers’ optimal strategies of production effort and quality investment. It turns out that as farming scale expands, farmers’ production effort decreases, while quality investment increases. Moreover, two farmers’ quality investments are the highest under the CS mode and the least under the DD mode. black Further analysis indicates that farmers’ total profits are generally the highest under the CS mode, but farmers obtain the highest profits under the CD mode if farmers’ extra sale cost under the CS mode exceeds a certain level. Therefore, to improve farmers’ welfare and agriculture products’ quality simultaneously, the CS mode may be the best choice in most cases, and it leads to a “win–win” situation for farmers and consumers. </jats:p>",

This study aims to investigate the possible pollution sources from catchments with different types of land use and landscape patterns and develop the relationships between water quality and the catchment hydro-geological and environmental variables. Data from 10 monitoring sites in Trondheim formulated the basis of the case study. Thermotolerant coliform bacteria (TCB) and total phosphorus (TP) were applied as main indicators to represent the water quality in the recipient rivers, streams and in Trondheim Fjord. Based on the GIS-oriented spatial analysis, 15 hydro-geographical and landscape parameters were selected as explanatory variables. Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were developed at catchment and river reach scales to study correlations between the explanatory variables and the response variables, TCB and TP, in rain and snow seasons. The study showed that the spatial landscape patterns resulted in differences in the concentrations of TCB and TP in the recipients. The agricultural land was shown to be the main pollution source, leading to a higher concentration of TP in streams. Buildings, roads, and other impervious areas have induced an increase in both TCB and TP. In contrast, the forest areas, lakes, river density and steep river slopes were shown to have capacity to filter incoming P-rich runoff, thus prevent pollutant conveyance and accumulation in recipients.</jats:p>",

The COVID-19 pandemic clearly reveals the lack of resilience in the supply chain domain, and the business failures show the impact of disruptions may have on a global network scale as individual supply chain connections and nodes fail. This cascading failure also has an impact on service quality dimensions of a business. Service quality advances have profoundly changed the way service organizations and consumers interact. This impact can be observed across sectors and industries. Service quality has become a popular area of researchers and academic investigation and has become recognized as a key factor in differentiating service products and building competitive advantage. Any shortcoming of a lack in service quality is easily identified and is translated into negative reviews on social media through word-of-mouth and other channels.</jats:p>",

We analysed a suite of indicators for non-provisioning ecosystem services on a large subset of Swedish farms (71% of farms, covering 82% of agricultural land) and related these to farm type, farm size and livestock density. The analysed indicators exhibited clear geographical patterns with hotspots especially in less productive regions. Controlling for this spatial variation we still found that small-scale and ruminant farms were associated with more varied landscapes, small-scale habitats, semi-natural grasslands and better crop sequences compared to nearby farms specialised in crop production, while farms specialising in monogastric livestock were associated with less varied landscapes and inferior crop sequences. Results for cultural ecosystem services indicated that farms with more semi-natural grassland were associated with more visitors and more likely located within designated recreation or nature conservation areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Advanced heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. With an aging population, its prevalence is expected to rise further. Although orthotopic heart transplantation (HTX) remains the gold standard in therapy, there is a significant deficiency in the ratio of donor organs to recipient patients. Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) could relieve this problem either as a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) or as a destination therapy (DT). Despite the widespread implantation of ventricular assist devices, their efficacy may be limited by some serious adverse events, while infection is a major issue. A longer period of LVAD support significantly increases the risk of driveline infections (DLI). The Jarvik 2000® ventricular assist device (Jarvik Heart, New York, NY, USA) offers prolonged infection-free survival. In our report, we present the case of a 61-year-old female patient with a driveline pedestal that has become fully detached from the skull following a fall trauma. We describe how the traumatized pedestal was surgically replaced by removing the previous, damaged unit and inserting a repositioned new one. The surgical procedure presented in our case has not been performed before and we have not found any similar one in the literature. It requires individual surgical planning and a multidisciplinary surgeon’s team to ensure the procedure is safe and feasible. </jats:p>",

This paper underscores the compounded impacts brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic on resource supply security and, hence, the long-term development of the region. It outlines the Sahel-specific COVID-19 scenario by firstly highlighting the underlying vulnerabilities and later linking the health sector outcomes to increased political instability and environmental insecurity, particularly the deterioration of food security. In this sense, this paper shows from a region-wide perspective how COVID-19 in the Sahel is associated with enlarged sociopolitical developmental perils. Lower remittance sent by expatriates, violent conflicts, increased cross-border terrorism and migration, discriminant mobility restrictions of people and goods, weak national healthcare infrastructures, bottlenecks in international aid, pressures on the education system and recent climate extremes are some revealing examples of aggravators of the impacts on the supply of vital resources, such as food. This paper also shows the importance of considering the close interlinks between health, food and political stability in the Sahel. There is a paramount need for more comprehensive approaches linking human health to other sectors, and for re-considering local sustainable agriculture. To avoid prolonged or recurrent humanitarian crises, the Sahel countries need to strengthen response capacities through public sector-led responses. Examples of these responses include reinforced national disaster programs for the vulnerable, support to sustainable agriculture and food markets, improved performance and communication of public sector relief, state-based cooperation, building of regional alliances and peacemaking efforts.</jats:p>",

Next, with these identified articles, a map is created with bibliographic data using Vosviewer network visualization software, and then the enablers were identified by conducting keyword co-occurrence analysis. Later, a total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) is employed to analyze the interrelationships among enablers and then determine each enabler’s hierarchies, further representing them in a diagraph. Finally, the identified enablers are classified using cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis, and the graph is plotted.

Structuring a procedure for modeling the ESS, according to development requirements, is vital for decision making. This publication reviews the main methods for designing local development programs that apply a sustainable livelihoods approach and a group of modeling tools for ESS. The necessary criteria are verified to structure a model that integrates the expectations of sustainable development, through the indicators of sustainable livelihoods (SLs), with the requirements of the ESS and the use of available renewable energy resources. In the review carried out, it is found that the methods of analysis and planning of sustainable local development are disconnected from the models for energy planning. On the other hand, the relationship of the indicators for calculating SLs with the characteristics and behavior of energy demand with respect to time is verified. The main criteria, parameters, and optimization methods necessary for the design and expansion of ESS in hard-to-reach areas are also discussed. Lastly, the necessary elements are proposed to be validated through a future study case for the dimensioning and expansion of ESS in hard-to-reach communities, integrating the analysis of development programs based on SLs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>How cascade hydropower stations (CHSs) play the electricity market game is regarded as an important issue. The majority of the work to date has focused on short-term horizons and several simplifications in the hydropower system. If future prices are expected to be higher than the current price, CHSs with large reservoirs allow the bidder to postpone energy production for a longer time scale, such as several months or more, which generally matches with the regulation period of the reservoir. Rejecting the assumption of simplifying the hydropower system (ASHS), the long-term bidding strategy of CHSs is discussed for a price-maker based on the supply function equilibrium (SFE). This study considers multiple price-makers, time-coupling, and the characteristics of the hydropower system, with significant challenges. The difference from the conventional model is that the long-term optimal scheduling model of CHSs is added. Moreover, a new methodology is proposed, the equilibrium curve of the uniform clearing price (UCP) is introduced, and the Nash equilibrium solutions are solved based on the nonlinear complementarity approach. In a simulated electricity market, the result can validate the feasibility of the model and adopted methodology and the rationality of the results by taking certain CHSs with multireservoir as an example. The negative influence of ASHS is analyzed, which shows that the characteristics of the hydropower system should be fully considered in the long-term bidding research. Future study aspects are also considered, which are presented as the key issues such as market assumptions and randomness.</jats:p>",

The removal efficiency of the MBBR technology of Prayagraj WWTP was observed to be better than that of the ASP and UASB technologies of Varanasi and Kanpur respectively for both seasons. Correlation analysis explained the strong negative correlation of pH and DO with nearly all the parameters of the study; whereas TDS, hardness, ammonia and BOD were highly correlated with each other in each city. The factor analysis suggested the best fit amongst the physicochemical parameters, with four factors elucidating 78.00% of the total variance, which further explained that DO, TDS, total alkalinity, nitrate, COD, and temperature were the major components for pollution. The results indicated that most of the samples were not appropriate for direct discharge into water bodies and irrigation purposes and thus needed further implementation of advanced technologies in their treatment procedure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electricity markets are currently experiencing a period of rapid change. The intermittent nature of renewable energy is disrupting the conventional methods used in operational planning of the electrical grid, causing a shift from a day-ahead forecast policy to a real-time pricing of delivered electric power. A path towards a more renewable, robust and intelligent energy system is inevitable but poses many challenges to researchers and industry. In the field of process industry, strategies based on demand side response are receiving attention and could represent a partial solution for this challenge. Coordination between production scheduling and procurement of electric power is of high importance and can contribute to reducing cost and emissions associated with production. A methodology to quantify such benefits is presented here with a case study, which reveals the potential benefits of flexible operation. In this case, the minimum compensation for flexibility services ranges between 5 and 20 € per unit (MWh) of restricted power. However, such a compensation depends on geographic location (electricity prices) and the frequency of restrictions. The method follows a rolling scheduling approach that provides optimization of the short-term schedule. This work introduces the concept of representing flexible processes as ‘equivalent batteries’ which store electricity from low-cost periods as intermediate products and consume the embedded energy during high-cost periods. Cost related to providing flexibility combined with the profits from optimized process scheduling contribute toward monetization of flexibility as an ancillary service for the grid. Balancing this service with the cost of implementing DSR solutions provides a means for calculating a pricing strategy for grid flexibility.</jats:p>"

In this study, seven physical and chemical indicators, namely, pH, TOC, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, salinity and redox potential were selected and spatial interpolation, principal component analysis, and geographic detector methods, were used to quantitatively analyze and evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in the small watersheds in this region. Tailwater pollution in the whole basin of the study area is serious. The spatial difference is manifested as east tributary &amp;gt; mainstream and reservoir area &amp;gt; southern tributary. Source pollution is the smallest, and water quality pollution is mainly manifested by excessive ammonia nitrogen, salinity, and TOC. The spatial differences in the physical and chemical properties of water bodies are significant. The distribution of ammonia nitrogen content is consistent with the spatial distribution of soil and water pollution, while nitrate-nitrogen is the opposite. Other indicators also show a certain spatial regularity, and the spatial regularity of dissolved oxygen content is not obvious. Water pollution in mining areas is mainly due to a large amount of ammonia nitrogen ions remaining in the mountains. As a result, the southern tributary ecological pool has an obvious purification effect on water quality. Salinity is extremely affected by ammonia nitrogen and TOC, oxidation-reduction potential is affected by pH and TOC, and TOC is influenced by ammonia nitrogen and pH. Salinity, ammonia nitrogen, and TOC are the potential risk factors of major pollution. The changes in the physical and chemical properties of the pollution index are not independent of each other. From the perspective of macro and micro, the comprehensive water pollution assessment system is adopted to provide a new idea for the prevention and control of rare earth industry tail water pollution, and further make exploratory efforts for the study of industrial wastewater pollution.</jats:p>",

At high amplitudes of self-oscillations, conditions for its damage can be created. Thermoacoustic self-oscillations are a consequence of flow instability. A well-known example of processes accompanied by the generation of thermoacoustic self-oscillations is vibration combustion, which is observed in rocket engines, in air heaters for blast furnaces, etc. In order to determine the characteristics of pressure self-oscillations, numerical studies of natural convection in a vertical channel with internal local heat release are carried out. Heat release from internal sources occurs in a limited section of the channel, which is closer to the inlet cross section of the channel. At the outlet cross section of the channel, there is a system of coaxial cylindrical bodies that constitute additional local hydraulic resistance to air flow. The characteristics of the air flow in the channel, which are accompanied by self-oscillations of velocity and pressure, are determined from the numerical solution of the system of equations of dynamics and heat transfer for a compressible medium, taking into account the dependence of the thermophysical properties of air on temperature. Based on the results of this solution, the velocity, pressure and temperature fields in the flow are determined. It is shown that changes in flow velocity and pressure with time have the character of oscillations with variable amplitude. Velocity oscillations at the channel outlet are in antiphase with velocity oscillations at the channel inlet. The amplitudes and frequencies of these oscillations are found. The measures were determined to reduce the amplitude of pressure fluctuations in the flow. Among them - the dispersal of sources of internal heat release and a decrease in local hydraulic resistance. These measures can be applied to reduce the negative impact of self-oscillations on power equipment.</jats:p>"

Merging the concept of supply chain management with sustainable development goals, leads to simultaneous consideration of all economic, environmental and social factors. This paper addresses the design of a sustainable closed-loop supply chain including suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, customer zones, and disposal centers considering the consumption of energy. In addition, the distribution centers play the roles of warehouse and collection centers. The problem involves three choices of remanufacturing, recycling, and disposing the returned items. The objectives are including the total profit, energy consumption and the number of created job opportunities. As far as we know, these objectives are rarely considered in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model. The proposed model also responds to the customer demand and also addresses the real-life constraints for location, allocation and inventory decisions in a closed-loop supply chain framework. Another novelty of this research is to develop a set of efficient Lagrangian relaxation reformulations and fast heuristics for solving a real-world numerical example. The results have revealed that the obtained solution is feasible and the developed solution algorithm is highly efficient for solving supply chain models. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided to highlight our findings and managerial insights from our results.</jats:p>",

On the basis of remote-sensing, meteorological, and socio-economic data, we mapped the supply, demand, and matching status of four ESs (i.e., water production, carbon sequestration, food supply, and soil conservation) using biophysical models and the ArcGIS spatial analysis module within the Zhengzhou–Kaifeng–Luoyang (ZKL) urban agglomeration in 2018. Four-quadrant analysis was employed to identify the spatial matching types of supply-demand relationships within the study region. The results are as follows. The supply-demand ratios of different ESs in the cell scale exhibit different spatial characteristics because of major influencing factors, including the natural environment (e.g., precipitation and temperature) and social development (e.g., urbanization level). Analysis of the supply-demand imbalances of the four ESs indicates that water production is deficient across the entire research area, whereas the whole research area’s carbon sequestration, food supply, and soil conversation are in the surplus state. Regarding the spatial matching types for supply and demand of the four ecosystem services, water production is dominated by the “low–low (low supply and low demand)” type. Carbon sequestration is dominated by the “low–low” and “high–low (high supply and low demand)” types. The “low–low” type dominates food supply and soil conservation. Due to the severity of the deficit in water production, all districts and counties in the ZKL urban agglomeration are identified as areas requiring ecological conservation, ecological restoration, or ecological improvement. Development guidance strategies and planning suggestions are proposed in different ecological areas. These policies could also be applied in other similar urban agglomerations.</jats:p>"

When herbivore abundance is high, heavy grazing can severely defoliate primary producers and, in some cases, even drive ecosystem to undergo regime shifts from a high productivity state to a denuded, low productivity state. While the phenomenon of herbivore‐driven regime shifts is well documented, we only partially understand the mechanisms underlying these events. Here, we combine herbivory experiments with 21 years of long‐term monitoring data of kelp forest ecosystems to test the hypothesis that herbivores drive regime shifts when herbivory exceeds primary production. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how the foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores—sea urchins—change with increases in sea urchin biomass and trigger regime shifts to a foundation species, giant kelp (<jats:italic>Macrocystis pyrifera</jats:italic>). Using experiments, we quantified how the grazing capacity of urchins increases as urchin biomass increases, then we combined these estimates of urchin grazing capacity with estimates of kelp production to predict when and where urchin grazing capacity exceeded kelp production. When grazing capacity exceeded kelp production, sea urchins caused a 50‐fold reduction in giant kelp biomass.

A clustering analysis based on a double-bottom map particle swarm optimization algorithm was applied to cluster real estate–related data collected from public websites. We report key findings from the clustering results and identify three essential variables that could affect trends in real estate prices: money supply, population, and rent. Mortgages are issued more frequently as additional real estate is created, increasing the money supply. The relationship between real estate and money supply can provide the government with baseline data for managing the real estate market and avoiding unlimited growth. The government can use sociodemographic data to predict population trends to in turn prevent real estate bubbles and maintain a steady economic growth. Renting and using social housing is common among the younger generation in Taiwan. The results of this study could, therefore, assist the government in managing the relationship between the rental and real estate markets.</jats:p>"

Laboratory experiments are conducted to examine empirical decisions by all three members in this dual sourcing channel. We observe that the supplier who receives large orders mostly agrees to supply; however, the supplier who receives small orders frequently refuses to supply. Consequently, the manufacturer experiences severe supply shortage, which hurts its profit and the supply chain efficiency. We develop behavioral models to explain the empirical decisions, and find that fairness concerns of the small‐order supplier cause supply rejections and shortages. To mitigate this behavioral supply risk, we apply the modeling results to design a subsidy mechanism and conduct a validation experiment. The experiment shows that the proposed subsidy mechanism successfully reduces supply rejections, and that the channel efficiency is significantly enhanced at no additional cost to the manufacturer. The study demonstrates the viability of the behavioral mechanism design approach in addressing issues in empirical decision‐making, and offers insights for manufacturers to manage asymmetric sourcing with two suppliers. </jats:p>",

Therefore, supply chain finance credit risk assessments are key financing indicators for decision makers. However, most current supply chain finance credit risk assessment research has been based on traditional and subjective methods and has focused less on the actual decision‐making requirements. The TODIM method in a fuzzy environment has proven to be a useful tool for multi‐criteria decision‐making as it can better reflect the DMs' psychological characteristics. As probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy sets can contain more original evaluation information and more comprehensively reflect the DM uncertainties, this paper first proposes a Hamming distance measure in a probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy environment to compare the relationships between two probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy elements and prove some of the properties. Then, to fully consider the DMs' risk preferences, a model is proposed to evaluate supply chain finance credit risk that extends the TODIM method to a probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy environment based on cumulative prospect theory and the proposed Hamming distance. Finally, using improved credit risk assessment criteria, a practical case from Ping An Bank is given to demonstrate the proposed model's practicality, and a comparison given with the classical TODIM and the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy TODIM method to illustrate the effectiveness of the extended method.</jats:p>",

While exploratory in nature, the results suggest both practitioners and academics agree at differing levels that logistics and supply chain management research is relevant, but pressure to chase indices and rankings has influenced behavior of academics. Consequently, the academic peer‐reviewed process no longer seems to focus on managerial implications. The article begins with theories pertinent to human motivation, namely, self‐determination theory (SDT), and employs qualitative interviews of academics to help develop surveys of both academics and logistics and supply chain management practitioners. It then presents the methodologies of quantitative data collection and analysis—combined with interviews of deans and editors—to explore the research questions to offer discussion, implications, future research directions, and conclusions.</jats:p>",

We include consistency constraints to obtain stable incentives over time and eliminate the need for re-negotiation. The findings emphasise that the dynamic contract significantly reduces the overall supply chain costs. The consistency constraints guarantee high incentives, thus assuring the players remain in the total contract period and enable long-term integration.</jats:p>",

These food supply structures often accompany new forms of hybrid cooperation models, including actors and institutions that have not shared resources previously. They form new alliances for sustainable transformation in the agri-food sector. Simultaneously, discourse has arisen in science and practice about the sustainability potential of such hybrid cooperation, referring to a lack of critical systematization and the necessity for creating an assessment concept. From the latter, one could draw conclusions about the transformative potential of such cooperation models and their potential to serve as blueprints for other regions. In this conceptual paper, a classification approach derived from social enterprise literature is elaborated, extended, and evaluated, to design a classification of new hybrid cooperation models that allow comparisons between regions and are sensitive to their dynamics. We show in an application how the classification approach, considering the dimensions “actors”, “resources”, and “actions”, serves to discover patterns in the development of short food-supply chain practices, identifying individual transition paths and, thus, making statements about their sustainability and challenges.</jats:p>"

Listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1973, improvements in erosion control and habitat restoration led to the Okaloosa darter being downlisted from Endangered to Threatened in 2011. However, the long-term management of the species is hampered by the lack of knowledge of the spatial extent of the recharge areas that ultimately support creek flow through groundwater discharge. To address this lack of data, we collected groundwater samples from the sand and gravel aquifer beneath 11 headwater and 11 downgradient sites across six creek basins during February and December 2020. The groundwater samples were collected from 1 to 1.2 m beneath the creek bottom. Concentrations of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were analyzed and used to calculate groundwater age (residence time), and indicated that at the 11 headwater sites, recharge occurred between 11 and 28 years ago. Groundwater ages in downgradient parts of the same creeks indicated that recharge occurred between 5 and 25 years ago. When combined with representative values of hydraulic conductivity for the sand and gravel aquifer, the ages reveal that the extent of the maximum recharge distance from the sampling sites ranged from about 222 to 2011 m from the creeks. This new information can be used by natural resource managers as additional evidence to support the USFWS Recovery Plan and proposed delisting of the Okaloosa darter from the Endangered Species List. Moreover, these results may also be useful to fisheries biologists to incorporate groundwater inputs to facilitate fisheries management.</jats:p>"

We argue that variations in agrarian systems and labour regimes constitute an important set of factors explaining some of these differences in gender patterns. The structural differences in the productivity, intensity and the social organisation of labour in agricultural economies in both countries led to notable variances in the gender composition of the supply of (rural) labour for the factories. Differential deployment of rural farm and non-farm labour, in combination with distinct labour recruitment practices in the countryside, caused rural households to adopt radically different income-generating strategies. </jats:p>",

Smart technologies emerged by Industry 4.0, sustainability, and circular economy (CE) connection, which remain unexplored, can be integrated into the supply chain as a business strategy to increase collaboration and cooperation between different tiers of the supply chain to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) according to LMIC. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to discover the drivers of a smart sustainable circular supply chain (SSCSC) in achieving the SDGs in LMIC through stakeholder theory. First, a systematic review is employed to identify the drivers of the SSCSC to achieve the SDGs in the LMIC incorporating existing literature on the subject. Second, the Best‐Worst Method (BWM) is applied to analyze the identified drivers, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to analyze the SDGs. The applicability of the solution methodology was illustrated by providing a numerical example. The results of the study are twofold: firstly, drivers are analyzed by implementation of BWM. The results of the BWM reveal that economic sustainability is the best key driver among the eight driversin achieving the SDGs, meaning that without financial assistance and support achieving the SDGs becomes ineffective. Secondly, the TOPSIS analysis reveals that SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) is the SDG most supported by drivers.</jats:p>",

It is intriguing that there is a strong positive correlation between economic growth and foreign debt in the short term. While it is logical that foreign debt boosts growth temporarily, it eventually (in long term) weighs down the economy. Economic growth is driven by the strengthening of the exchange rate, but not the money supply in both the long and short term.

Specifically, decisions on the recovery planning are subject to multi-dimensional uncertainty stemming from singular and correlated disruptions in demand, supply, and production capacities. This is a new and understudied research area. In this study, we examine, SC recovery for high-demand items (e.g., hand sanitizer and face masks). We first developed a stochastic mathematical model to optimise recovery for a three-stage SC exposed to the multi-dimensional impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. This allows to generalize a novel problem setting with simultaneous demand, supply, and capacity uncertainty in a multi-stage SC recovery context. We then developed a chance-constrained programming approach and present in this article a new and enhanced multi-operator differential evolution variant-based solution approach to solve our model. With the optimisation, we sought to understand the impact of different recovery strategies on SC profitability as well as identify optimal recovery plans. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrated capability towards efficiently solving both small- and large-scale SC recovery problems. We tested, evaluated, and analyzed different recovery strategies, scenarios, and problem scales to validate our approach. Ultimately, the study provides a useful tool to optimise reactive adaptation strategies related to how and when SC recovery operations should be deployed during a pandemic. This study contributes to literature through development of a unique problem setting with multi-dimensional uncertainty impacts for SC recovery, as well as an efficient solution approach for solution of both small- and large-scale SC recovery problems. Relevant decision-makers can use the findings of this research to select the most efficient SC recovery plan under pandemic conditions and to determine the timing of its deployment.</jats:p>"

Exploiting the fact that regions in Switzerland have been differentially exposed to ICT due to their pre-ICT industrial composition, we present evidence suggesting that more exposed regions experienced stronger ICT adoption, accompanied by considerably stronger growth in relative employment and wage premia for college-educated workers. Following this change in the landscape of relative economic opportunities, we find robust evidence that these regions experienced a much larger influx of highly educated immigrants in absolute terms as well as relative to lower educated groups.

A method is proposed for calculating the optimal values of pipe diameters and the velocity of water and waste liquid in pipelines based on the costs of their life cycle. The conducted numerical experiments showed that the optimal values of the velocity depend on the flow rate of water and waste liquid, the cost of electricity and the number of years of the life cycle of water supply and wastewater disposal systems.

Most research mainly focuses on optimal design problems. However, the system operation has not been investigated adequately regarding resilience. Therefore, we proposed an integral format of the demand-weighted modified resilience index (IMRI), which can capture the overall resilient performance throughout the operational period. This indicator was incorporated into the multi-objective operation optimization model as one of the objectives. Two benchmark networks were considered as case studies. The resulting Pareto fronts show a clear competing relationship between cost and resilience. Operating conditions in pumps, reservoirs and tanks at each regulation step were characterized by methods of resilience decomposition, which proved valuable intuitively for resilience regulation. A framework for explicit resilience assessment was also developed to examine directly the overall performance in statistics about those optimal solutions obtained. Explicit resilience results show that the IMRI can effectively quantify the resilience of system operation in the temporal dimension. Furthermore, scheduling more pumps, higher trigger-on levels of tanks and a wider range of trigger-level control could yield a more resilient solution to the operation of WDSs.</jats:p>",

A farming cooperative has some private quality information of its product and can convey it via quality certification in the planting stage. A product distributor makes the order decision based on the farming cooperative's quality certification and can observe the exact product quality information only after the product is reaped. During this process, a local government provides free but imperfect demand forecasting to help the farming cooperative make more efficient pricing and quality certification decisions. We show that the impact of quality certification on the farming cooperative's profit hinges on three factors: the quality standard, the cost of certification, and the precision rate of government information, and the profit exhibits non‐monotonic relationship with any of these factors. The farming cooperative could become worse off with the government's free information provision, and a higher information precision rate could result in a down‐side jump for the farming cooperative's profit. In comparison to government information channel, the farming cooperative may choose to costly acquire the demand information by itself and controls the information precision rate. Our main results hold when the distributor can determine the retail price and discuss the possible signaling role of wholesale price under our game framework. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Substitution is a commonly adopted strategy for matching the demand mix by appropriately allocating the supplies. The recent development of information technology has allowed firms to easily swap products to meet consumers’ preferences. When formulating substitution policies, firms have to take into account the supply and demand conditions, as well as the cost and benefit of substitution. We formulate a dynamic model, in which the firm replenishes the product inventories from uncertain sources and dynamically allocates the available products to meet the uncertain demands with the flexibility of substitution. To address the analytical challenge associated with multi‐product management, we develop a heuristic algorithm that leverages the value of substitution, while allowing separability of future profit among the products. This heuristic algorithm iteratively solves a transportation problem in a network with the reverse Monge property. The application of the reverse Monge property allows us to deal with general substitution structures, which generalizes the commonly studied downward substitution models. Given the product inventories, the derived allocation policy is asymptotically optimal when the firm can frequently remix the products to fulfill the received demands. Through an extensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the heuristic policy yields good performance measured by the percentage profit gap from an upper bound problem. We also show that substitution can generate significant benefits when the supply capacities are moderate, the supply and demand uncertainties are high, or the replenishment cycle is short. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As interest in aluminum nitride (AlN), a high-performance ceramic, has been rapidly increasing, many researchers studied the possibilities of machining it. Since AlN is classified as a difficult-to-cut material, the electrical discharge machining (EDM) process using an assisting electrode is emerging as an effective machining method. Kerosene, as a dielectric fluid, plays an important role in forming a successive conductive carbon layer on the surface of the workpiece to induce and maintain discharge. Most previous methods used tubular electrodes to stably feed the dielectric fluids through their center hole. However, in the case of micro-EDM, the extremely small electrode diameter makes it difficult to fabricate a through-hole in the electrode, and a very narrow gap prevents the flow of dielectric fluid. In order to overcome dielectric fluid flow problems in micro-EDM, in this study, two kinds of flow-promoting methods are introduced: one is to use a D-shaped solid electrode to obtain a wider asymmetric flow channel, and the other is to use an O-shaped solid electrode with graphite-powder-mixed kerosene (GPMK) under a relatively wider discharge gap. Flow simulation results show that both methods promote kerosene flow, and the experimental results show similar results as well. When using the D-shaped section, the material removal rate increased, but increased tool wear was observed. In the case of GPMK, the metal removal rate increased 64%, and relative wear ratio decreased 73% compared to conventional methods. Through voltage scheduling, the problem of precision degradation that occurs during deep-hole drilling with the O-shaped solid electrode GPMK configuration was solved without sacrificing machinability.</jats:p>",

A oferta de procedimentos para DM foi obtida a partir do Sistema de Informações Ambulatoriais (SIA/SUS) e a demanda a partir do número de exames definidos no protocolo como necessários por ano, segundo categorias de risco da doença. A partir disso foi criado o indicador de razão entre oferta e demanda. A inovação que ora apresentamos consiste em analisar conjuntamente a demanda por cuidado ao diabético segundo parâmetros estabelecidos e a oferta de serviços de saúde. A conexão entre o protocolo de tratamento preconizado e a existência do serviço ofertado em relação da demanda de cuidado baseada na prevalência da doença disponibiliza uma ferramenta chave de monitoramento.

Inspired by the practice of closed-loop supply chain coordination, this paper attempts to investigate the supply chain operation strategies of different recycling modes and patent licensing strategies and consider the impact of government subsidies. We construct a multi-player game model of an original manufacturer, a remanufacturer, and a retailer under a waste product recycling mode, patent licensing strategy, and government subsidy system. We provide the operation strategies under different strategy combinations in the closed-loop supply chain, and then analyze their differences and the interests of various subjects. We further analyze the impact of government subsidies on the operation strategies of the supply chain. The results illustrate that when the original manufacturer adopts the fixed fee patent licensing strategy, the recycling price of waste products is higher. When the original manufacturer adopts the unit fee patent licensing strategy and the retailer and the remanufacturer participate in the recycling of waste products simultaneously, the original manufacturer will increase the unit patent licensing fee. When the remanufacturer recycles waste products alone, consumers can obtain greater unit income in the waste product recycling market. Different government subsidies have different effects on the wholesale price and the retail price of new products and remanufactured products.</jats:p>"

This requires a strong environmental commitment on the suppliers' side. Adopting the supplier perspective, this study employs regression analysis with bootstrapping procedures to examine a contingent causal process model of the influence that two major green supply chain management practices widely adopted by buying firms in their relationships with suppliers, t, environmental assessment and environmental collaboration, exert on supplier environmental commitment, and the moderating effects of supplier perceived relationship attractiveness and supplier perceived justice. Results from a survey of 237 Chinese suppliers across multiple industries reveal that, while environmental collaboration positively influences supplier environmental commitment, the impact of environmental assessment is not significant. However, our moderation analysis shows that supplier perceived relationship attractiveness has a positive moderating effect on the influence exerted on supplier environmental commitment by both environmental assessment and collaboration, and our moderated moderation analysis reveals that both the above moderating effects are in turn positively moderated by supplier perceived justice. Focusing on the role of suppliers' perceptions, the study sheds light on the psychological context of the suppliers' choice to commit to the environmental management initiatives of their buying counterparts.</jats:p>",

Among the contributions of this technique is the design of the pressure controller using the adaptive control, as well as the use of an artificial neural network for the construction of nonlinear models using inherent system parameters such as pressure, engine rotation frequency and control valve angle, with the purpose of estimating the flow. Among the various contributions of the research, we can highlight the suppression in the acquisition of physical flow meters, the elimination of physical installation and others. The validation was carried out through tests in an experimental bench located in the Laboratory of Energy and Hydraulic Efficiency in Sanitation of the Federal University of Paraiba.

This study fills this gap by analyzing the EEE of 30 provinces in China from 2012 to 2017 using data envelopment analysis and Malmquist index methods. The results show that the positive effect of China’s implementation of SSR has emerged. This positive effect is mainly reflected in the implementation of measures such as reducing overcapacity, which has promoted the technological innovation of enterprises. However, the low management level and resource-allocation efficiency hinder the further improvement of the implementation effect of the SSR, which should be paid special attention to in China’s future supply-side reform. In addition, we believe that in the context of China’s high-quality development and carbon neutrality goals, the SSR should be given more connotations, which are to increase the requirements for strengthening green and low-carbon development.</jats:p>"

With a granularity of 40 km 40 km the economy of scale has only a partial effect, leading to a limited reduction of the total cost of hydrogen production and distribution.

A competition experiment between Microcystis sp. and Cyclotella meneghiniana under limited phosphorus and sufficient nitrogen concentration was conducted to investigate the mechanism of dilution effect and verify the broad applicability of the simulation model. Experimental results revealed that there was no remarkable discrepancy in Microcystis sp. cell density among different dilution groups (p&amp;gt;0.05), while C. meneghiniana cell density was significantly different between groups (p&amp;lt;0.05). The accuracy of the simulation model under limited phosphorus as well as sufficient nitrogen concentration was verified by comparing the simulated value with experimental results.

Methods: The study used test results of 81 water supply stations collected from the Tien Giang Center for Disease Control in 2020 and compared these with the QCVN 02:2009/BYT. Results: 86.4% of stations had water quality that met QCVN 02:2009/BYT, 90.1% and 96.3% of samples met physicochemical and microbiological criteria.

Water supply stations with self-inspection of water quality, with correct collection of prescribed prices, with operating models of settling and filtering systems, had better water quality. Conclusions: Water supply facilities should perform self-inspection of water quality and need to have an annual plan for renovation and upgrading of the system, including the installation of settling and filtering systems. The water fee should be raised according to regulations to have reserve funds for investment in construction and repair of water supply systems when they are degraded.

To enhance the applicability of STSM, single regulation and joint regulation methods for the charging price strategy of charging stations are put up, and the mathematical model of joint regulation is focused on. First of all, a joint regulation mechanism is established, in which EVs are guided to charge off‐peak and off‐station through the joint regulation. Secondly, integrating charging fees, queuing costs, and transfer costs, the equivalent charging prices for EV users are put forward. Based on the difference of the equivalent charging prices, transfer probability model for EVs’ charging periods and charging stations is proposed. Furthermore, the overall objective of joint regulation is built based on the net income of all parties. And an optimization method for the joint regulation of charging prices is proposed. Then, regulation lifting ratio is put forward to reflect the superiority of joint regulation over single regulation. Based on this, an evaluation model for joint station diameter threshold is established. The practical result proves that through single regulation and joint regulation, approximately 200–500 additional EVs can be powered, which will result in significant savings in infrastructure construction and investment costs.</jats:p>",

N-heptane was used as a model fuel. The turbulent flow of gases was modeled on the basis of the RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes) approach. The combustion was simulated with the EDC (Eddy Dissipation Concept) model using a reduced chemical reaction mechanism. Calculation studies of the effect of steam on the processes occurring in the combustion chamber were carried out. Comparative analysis of the calculation results with experimental data showed good agreement in terms of the main integral parameters. The positive effect of the influence of steam injection into the active combustion zone of hydrocarbon fuel on the reduction of harmful emissions is shown.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the average annual temperature and precipitation in Anhui Province showed a significant increasing trend during 1961–2020, with warming and humidification. 1994 was the year of abrupt climate change in Anhui Province, and the temperature after the abrupt change was 2.10 times that before the abrupt change. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a synchronized resonance cycle with droughts and floods in Anhui Province at 5.8 a. The annual scale of ENSO events is an important theoretical support for regional drought and flood warnings. The chance of drought and flooding in Anhui Province is greater than 50% in the year of ENSO event or two years after the event, and the year of ENSO event or the year after is prone to drought and flooding, so we should strengthen the flood and drought warning, disaster prevention and mitigation.</jats:p>",

In arid regions, barchans (transverse dunes) develop under a unimodal wind regime, and are oriented perpendicular to the sand transport direction, whereas linear (longitudinal) dunes develop under a bimodal wind regime and are oriented parallel to the sand transport direction. However, field survey results cannot be explained solely by the wind because barchans and linear dunes can coexist under the same wind regime. Here, we investigated China’s Qaidam Basin, where barchans and linear dunes coexist. We measured dune morphology, analyzed wind data, and quantified the sand supply (equivalent sand thickness) to describe their development environment, and focused on the effect of sand supply to explore the combined effects of wind regime and sand supply on the coexistence of barchans and linear dunes. In our study area, barchans and linear dunes had low heights. The wind regime was narrowly bimodal, with low directional variability. The sand supply was limited (low equivalent sand thickness), but was greater for barchan chains than for barchans, and linear dunes had the smallest supply; the equivalent sand thickness in the linear dune areas was half that in barchan areas and one-quarter that in barchan chain areas. Except in the presence of topographical barriers and cohesive sediments, a unimodal or bimodal wind regime with an acute angle allows barchans and linear dunes to coexist under a low sand supply. The linear dunes and the barchans migrated along the resultant drift direction. Though we studied aeolian dunes, these findings will increase our understanding of these similar bedforms that develop in other planetary environments (e.g., Mars).</jats:p>"

This study explores the institutional, technical and economic sustainability of a piped drinking water system operating on Likoma Island in Lake Malawi. Data were collected through household surveys and an analysis of historical records. Proximity and accessibility analyses were also conducted for households (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 185) and their water sources. The results indicated that within 10 years after implementation of the system, 98% of the respondents had piped drinking water within 250 m of their households. Challenges to system sustainability unique to an island setting include the need for boat transportation, inconsistent electrical power supply and lack of island banking services. Factors contributing to broader system success include fishing households with cash income, limited dependence on communal taps, a strong mainland partner, tourism‐supported financial management, high payment rate amongst government institutions, system costs covered by pricing of water for customers and a manager with a high level of decision‐making authority. Opportunities to make the system more sustainable include reducing non‐revenue water losses, using drones or buying a dedicated boat for transport to the island and improving self‐sufficiency on the island to respond to equipment emergencies. Rural drinking water supplies in remote lake island communities must meet unique requirements for sustainable operation, and the institutional, technical and economic sustainability factors of Likoma Island illustrate a successful system likely to sustainably continue its operations into the future.</jats:p>",

The stochastic market demand is dependent on the carbon reduction level, advertisement for low‐carbon products and their interplay. The mean‐CVaR criterion is adopted to measure the risk‐averse retailer's objective. The Stackelberg equilibrium carbon reduction level, order quantity and advertising level are derived. We find that the manufacturer's investment in carbon reduction can encourage the retailer to put more effort into advertising and increase the order quantity. All of the carbon reduction levels, advertising levels, and order quantity decrease when the retailer becomes conservative. An option and cost‐sharing combined contract is proposed to coordinate the supply chain. We prove that if the trade‐off coefficient (the weight that the retailer puts on expected profit) is higher than a threshold, the supply chain can achieve coordination even though the retailer's degree of risk aversion is extremely high. If the trade‐off coefficient is below the threshold, the supply chain can be coordinated only if the retailer's degree of risk aversion is not very high. The retailer's risk attitude and option price play significant roles in the profit allocation of the supply chain under coordination. Our numerical examples show that the retailer benefits from a higher degree of risk aversion or a higher option price under coordination.</jats:p>",

In particular, a comparative analysis of their equilibrium outcomes was made thereafter. The MATLAB simulation found that the optimal emissions reductions under the three subsidy modes were even and positively correlated to low-carbon subsidies, which, however, negatively correlated to the prices of both product types. Higher subsidies drove up demand for low-carbon products and dragged down that for common goods.

To date, no histological comparison between both grafts has been conducted. We histologically assessed BMG and LMG harvested during urethral surgeries, aiming to compare graft properties and vascular support. We conducted a prospective single cohort study, including oral mucosa urethroplasty patients. During surgery, graft dimensions and donor sites were collected, and a 0.5 × 0.5 cm sample was obtained from the prepared graft. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were sliced at 4 micrometres (µm) and hematoxylin-eosin stained. Using a telepathology tool, all slides were digitalized and measured from 10× to 40× magnification. In each graft, global and individual layers thicknesses were assessed, including vascular density and area. Descriptive and comparative (parametrical and non-parametrical) statistical analysis occurred. We collected 57 grafts during 33 urethroplasties, with 30 BMG and 22 LMG, finally, included. The mean age was 56.6 (SD 15.2) years, and the mean graft length was 5.8 (SD 1.7) cm and the width was 1.7 (SD 0.4) cm. The median graft thickness was 1598.9 (IQR 1200–2100) µm, the mean epithelium layer was 510.2 (SD 223.7) µm, the median submucosa was 654 (IQR 378–943) µm. the median muscular was 477.6 (IQR 286–772) µm, the median vascular area was 5% (IQR 5–10), and the median adipose tissue area was 5% (IQR 0–20). LMG were significantly longer and narrower than BMG. Total graft thickness was similar between LMG and BMG, but the epithelium and submucosa layers were significantly thinner in LMG. The muscular layer was significantly thicker in LMG. Vascular density and vascular areas were not significantly different between both types of grafts. LMG showed significantly less adipose tissue compared with BMG. Our findings show LMG and BMG for urethroplasty surgeries share the same thickness and blood supply, despite having significantly different graft sizes as well as mucosal and submucosal layers thickness.</jats:p>"

Future runoff was simulated using the SWAT model, considering the Eta/HadGEM2-ES and Eta/MIROC5 climate models and the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. The crop irrigation requirement was simulated using the AquaCrop model. A model was created in STELLA software, where the water supply and demand data in the basin were entered, and the sustainability index (SI) was calculated, whose results were statistically analyzed through trend and correlation tests. HadGEM 8.5 was the most unsustainable scenario. MIROC 4.5 and MIROC 8.5 scenarios showed higher growth of unsustainable months over time. A trend of decreasing SI and increasing unsustainable months was observed in most scenarios. The results found can assist in the decision-making of water resource managers, to promote the mitigation of climate change effects in the basin.</jats:p>",

The various parameters have been calculated, taking into account all four types of weather conditions for New Delhi using computing code developed in MATLAB-2015a. All equations and required data have been fed to the computing code for evaluating different relevant parameters. It has been concluded that the value of all types of annual efficiencies, except annual electrical efficiency, diminishes with increase in the value of at a selected value of N until = 0.10 kg/s and then becomes almost constant. Optimal values of N from annual overall exergy efficiency and annual overall thermal efficiency viewpoints have been found as four and ten respectively.</jats:p>",

The experiment was designed to use conventional chemical analysis, combining the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) and nylon bag technology to assess the nutritional value and biodegradation characteristics of seed-used pumpkin byproducts. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the protein molecular structure properties of byproducts of seed-used pumpkin. In this study, we also applied correlation and regression analysis. The results showed that different byproducts of seed-used pumpkin had different in situ biodegradation, nutrient supplies, and spectral structures in the protein region. Among the byproducts of seed-used pumpkin, acid detergent-insoluble crude protein (ADICP) and neutral detergent-insoluble crude protein (NDICP) contents of the pumpkin seed coat were the highest, resulting in the lowest effective degradabilities (EDs) of dry matter and crude protein. The crude protein (CP) ED values were ranked as follows: pumpkin seed cake &gt; seed-used pumpkin flesh &gt; pumpkin seed coat. Significant differences were observed in the peak areas of amide I and amide II and the corresponding peak heights in the two peak areas in the molecular structure of the protein. The peak areas of amide I and amide II and the corresponding peak heights were at the highest levels for pumpkin seed cake, whereas there was no significant difference between the pumpkin seed coat and seed-used pumpkin flesh. Similarly, the peak heights of α-helices and β-sheets were highest for pumpkin seed cake. Correlation and regression results indicated that amide I and amide II area and height, α-helix and β-sheet heights, and area ratios of amide I: amide II, as well as the height ratios of amide I: amide II, and α-helices: β-sheets effectively estimated nutrient supply and that the height ratio of α-helices: β-sheets was mostly sensitive to biodegradation characteristics in different byproducts of seed-used pumpkin. There were significant differences in CP chemical composition and digestibility of different byproducts of seed-used pumpkin that were strongly related to the changes in protein molecular structures.</jats:p>"

Based on the three-level PSSC network structure composed of service providers, platform operators, and demand markets, this paper assumes that platform operators empower service providers to improve service quality, and PSSC members invest in data security risk control. Then, using variational inequality and equilibrium theory, a supply chain network equilibrium model considering data empowerment is constructed, and the equilibrium conditions of the whole network are obtained. Based on numerical examples, this paper analyzes the impact of the sensitivity of the demand market to service quality, the relative importance of service providers’ service quality improvement level, the data empowerment cost of PSSC members, and the data security risk control investment of PSSC members on the equilibrium state of the supply chain network. The results show the following: because the service quality is produced by the cooperation between service providers and platform operators, platform operators may have free-riding behavior and are only willing to invest a fixed data empowerment cost to ensure the essential service quality; data security risk control investment is an important factor affecting service sales; and when supply chain network members reduce data security risk control investment, consumers’ willingness to pay for services will be reduced, resulting in a decline in the overall profit of the supply chain network.</jats:p>"

The attainable speed of the energy transition is ultimately limited by the available energy to build the replacing renewable infrastructures. Decarbonizing the energy system by replacing dispatchable fossil with variable renewable power requires energy storage to match supply with demand. Current storage technologies are energetically expensive to build and operate, thus the demand for storage shapes the fastest possible transition and the probability to exceed 1.5 °C heating. This study explores and quantifies the effect of demanded storage and its technological progress on the fastest possible transition constrained only by energy. The simulation results using three exemplary storage technologies show that storage substantially delays the transition and increases the probability to exceed 1.5 °C heating. Technological progress, if materialized fast, can reduce energy costs of storage; however, storage demand remains a critical driver for climate risks. Consequently, minimizing storage demand through a supply-driven power system effectively reduces climate risks—a paradigm shift towards a solar-aligned “sunflower society”.</jats:p>",

To meet the increasing energy demand, global nations are looking for energy from renewable sources rather than non-renewable sources, to adhere with the sustainability principle. As energy from renewable sources is still in the experimental stage, there is a need to use available energy sources optimally. Considering this, the present study aims to identify, evaluate, and reveal the interrelationship among critical challenge factors in improving the heat rate performance of coal-fired thermal power plants. The study identifies twenty critical challenges through a comprehensive literature review. Then, to evaluate the identified critical challenges, the grey-DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used. For evaluating the challenges, this study conducts an empirical analysis in a thermal power plant in India. The findings reveal that air preheater leakage, coal flow balancing, and air heater air outlet temperature are the top three critical challenges hampering the thermal power plant’s performance. Additionally, fourteen challenges come under the cause group, while eight challenges come under the effect group. The findings of the study can assist industrial managers in overcoming problems in their thermal power plants. The results can also guide the development of a robust and reliable framework for mitigating these challenges.</jats:p>"

Commodity traders are key actors in efforts to eliminate deforestation—they are active in the regions where commodities are produced and represent a “pinch point” in global trade that provides a powerful lever for change. However, the procurement strategies of traders remain opaque. Here, we catalog traders’ sourcing across four sectors with high rates of commodity-driven deforestation: South American soy, cocoa from Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesian palm oil, and Brazilian live cattle exports. We show that traders often source more than 40% of commodities “indirectly” via local intermediaries and that indirect sourcing is a major blind spot for sustainable sourcing initiatives. To eliminate deforestation, indirect sourcing must be included in sectoral initiatives, and landscape or jurisdictional approaches, which internalize indirect sourcing, must be scaled up.</jats:p>",

In winter, cold snap leading to high mortality of this tropical species is a critical issue for the aquaculture industry in Taiwan. Under hypothermal stress, however, changes in energy supply for osmoregulation of this euryhaline species is intriguing. In this study, we used an antibody against glycogen phosphorylase (GP) to identify glycogen-rich (GR) cells distributed adjacent to the mitochondria-rich (MR) ionocytes in milkfish gills. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which plays a major role in energy supply, was also identified and localized in GR cells. Moreover, the expression of indicators of aerobic metabolism and energy production, citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX), were analyzed in gills of FW- and SW-acclimated milkfish to reveal different strategies of energy utilization under hypothermal stress. When exposed to a low-temperature environment, SW individuals used branchial glycogen and lactate to match the energy demands of aerobic metabolism in ionocytes, and elevated aerobic capacity to support and maintain normal functions in gills. However, branchial glycogen mainly localized in the GR cells of FW milkfish was not utilized under hypothermal stress. Meanwhile, a similar level of branchial COX activity and COXIV protein abundance at low temperatures between FW and SW milkfish indicated similar energy requirements in gills. This suggested that another source, but not branchial glycogen, maintained the energy demand in FW milkfish. The present study illustrated differential energy supply strategies in gills between SW- and FW-acclimated milkfish for osmoregulation under low temperatures.</jats:p>"

The flows in Hun River Basin, China are predicted using the trained hybrid network and are compared with the results from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results demonstrate the learning efficiency of the hybrid network is greatly affected by its structure and parameters, including the number of convolutional layers and LSTM cell layers, the step size of pooling and training data size. Further, the shortcut layer can effectively solve the diversity reduction problem in a deep network.

In view of the fact that the existing day-ahead optimal operation model ignores the uncertainties and fluctuations of renewable energies and loads, a two-stage energy management model is proposed for the sustainable wind-PV-hydrogen-storage microgrid based on receding horizon optimization to eliminate the adverse effects of their uncertainties and fluctuations. In the first stage, the day-ahead optimization is performed based on the predicted outpower of WT and PV, the predicted demands of power and hydrogen loads. In the second stage, the intra-day optimization is performed based on the actual data to trace the day-ahead operation schemes. Since the intra-day optimization can update the operation scheme based on the latest data of renewable energies and loads, the proposed two-stage management model is effective in eliminating the uncertain factors and maintaining the stability of the whole system. Simulations show that the proposed two-stage energy management model is robust and effective in coordinating the operation of the wind-PV-hydrogen-storage microgrid and eliminating the uncertainties and fluctuations of WT, PV and loads. In addition, the battery storage can reduce the operation cost, alleviate the fluctuations of the exchanged power with the power grid and improve the performance of the energy management model.</jats:p>"

Due to the lack of modern planting and breeding techniques for small-scale scattered farmers, it is difficult to obtain scale effects, and the benefit-cost ratio is generally low. Their own production, supply, and marketing integration organization can only enter the market separately, which is difficult to adapt to market needs, and often bear great market risks. In the circulation link, the agricultural product logistics management level in China is low and logistics losses are huge. This research attempts to conduct a theoretical analysis and discussion on the integration of the ecological agricultural product supply chain in China based on the enterprise theory. At the same time, we conduct an empirical analysis of the relationship between supply chain integration and performance from the perspective of logistics and build agricultural product supply chain integration with the company’s logistics capabilities as the center. We perform hypothesis model, collect data through survey methods, use quantitative analysis and path analysis methods to test the hypothesis model, explore the relationship between supply chain management and agricultural product logistics capabilities, and corporate competitiveness, to provide the empirical support for the introduction of supply chain management in the agriculture in China.</jats:p>",

However, research on how strategic partnerships affect enterprise performance remains controversial. To address this issue, based on the supply chain management practices of Chinese enterprises in the era of the digital economy, and according to resource dependence theory, social network theory, and transaction cost theory, a chain multiple intermediary model was constructed and 243 Chinese enterprises information was collected for an empirical test. The results show that strategic partnership has a significant direct positive impact on information sharing, supply chain flexibility, and enterprise performance. Information sharing has a significant direct positive impact on enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. Supply chain flexibility was also found to positively impact enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. The findings also showed that information sharing and supply chain flexibility play a chain mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. This study explores the effects of strategic partnership on enterprise performance, which provides an important supplement to theoretical studies of supply chain management. The results help provide targeted solutions on how to effectively implement supply chain management for enterprises in emerging and developing nations.</jats:p>"

The zooplankton biomass in summer exceeded the biomass in fall season in 1.3–2.1 times for the layer of 0–50 m and in 1.1–1.8 times for the layer of 0–200 m, mostly because of decreasing abundance of copepods and chaetognaths that was not compensated by slight increase of the euphausiids and amphipods biomass. Interannual variations were higher and reached 2–3 times and 4–5 times, respectively. Abnormal blooming of certain ecological groups of zooplankton (either warm-water or cold-water) occurred in the anomalous years. Species structure of zooplankton community varied in dependence on oceanographic conditions, generally toward higher abundance in warmer environments. In spite of considerable impact of thermal regime, this dependence was not close and even was absent in some cases that indicated a complex organization of zooplankton communities subjected to influence of many environmental factors. Mean total biomass of large-sized zooplankton and micronekton (prey for large-sized nekton) in the upper epipelagic layer of the western Bering Sea is estimated as 41 . 106 t in summer and 24 . 106 t in fall season, its total production as 101 . 106 t and 67 . 106 t, respectively. In summer, production of non-predatory zooplankton (phyto- and euryphages) prevailed over the predatory zooplankton production, with exception of 2009 and 2013. On the contrary, production of zoophages prevailed in autumn due to successive seasonal changes in the epipelagic plankton communities. These modern data on biomass and production of the zooplankton communities indicate significant reserves of food resources for fish and squids in the deep-water Commander Basin, western part of the Aleutian Basin, and in the area at Cape Navarin.</jats:p>"

Having done this in consideration, monitoring the concentration of Hg in the river is an important indicator of physical-chemical and microbiological quality of water. Thus, in this study, the Hg concentration was determined using a new spectrophotometric method in river water samples recovered from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Furthermore, the diversity and antimicrobial resistance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from these samples were also reported. A new ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometric method was validated and applied to quantify Hg in water and revealed high concentrations in the samples (0.13–0.35 μg·mL−1), above the limits established by Brazilian standards (0.002 μg·mL−1). Gram-negative bacteria (mainly Escherichia coli) were recovered in greater proportion (88.4%) from water samples with high mercury concentration and showed resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin. Our results highlighted that E. coli resistant to carbapenems, which are latest generation beta-lactams, were detected. In conclusion, the Hg levels are considerably high in river waters in Brazil, and these mercury-rich water sources are important reservoirs of multi-drug resistant bacteria.</jats:p>",

Among the industry’s biggest challenges are: salt remains excluded from the list of priority commodities of the government; the changes in weather patterns due to climate change which adversely impact the production cycle; prominence of traditional methods of production; and low productivity of local farms. While remote sensing technologies including geographic information system (GIS) mapping have been widely adopted for the improvement of agricultural productivity in the Philippines, use of such in research that focuses on salt production and supply chain is still very limited. GIS maps are perceived as effective information library and decision support tool that can help the supply chain of the neglected salt industry. This study focused on the mapping of salt farms and their supply chain actors from selected salt production sites in the Visayas and Mindanao islands. Eleven provinces were included in the surveys of market intermediaries and end-consumers who were traced from salt producers. Their geographic coordinates were recorded and satellite and Google Earth images of the supply chain actors were digitized in ArcGIS 10.5 software to generate the maps, physical characteristics of which were examined for possible patterns. Results show that in Mindanao, the market areas (or the salt traders) are concentrated in Zamboanga del Sur particularly in Aurora and Zamboanga City, but the producers are in Alubijid and El Salvador City, Misamis Oriental. In the Visayas, traders are more scattered and are greater in number than in Mindanao.</jats:p>",

However, many companies have not engaged in carbon emission reduction, and the market is under asymmetric competition. In this context, this article focuses on the asymmetric competition between manufacturers under the cap-and-trade regulation and compares different retail modes. At the same time, four models are constructed from two different perspectives: the short-term game and the long-term repeated game. The results show that the manufacturer’s optimal price increases with the commission coefficient when the carbon gap is significant in the short-term game, while the carbon emission reduction decreases with the coefficient. And the profits of the manufacturer who contributes to carbon emission reduction are more sensitive to changes in the commission coefficient. Under the reselling mode, the retailer’s participation in pricing will intensify supply chain competition. When the carbon gap is significant, carbon emission reduction will decrease with the increasing carbon trading price. By comparison, the carbon emission reduction level under the reselling mode is higher when the carbon gap is significant; when the commission coefficient is moderate, the retailer in the agency mode has higher profits. In the long-term game, the system is more likely to be in chaos when the manufacturer’s adjustment speed is too high. </jats:p>",

COVID-19 disrupted British Columbia’s illicit drug market. Concerns about overdose because of drug supply changes, and deepening socioeconomic marginalization, motivated participants to access no-cost prescription alternatives. Reliable access to prescription alternatives addressed overdose vulnerability by reducing engagement with the illicit drug market while allowing greater agency over drug use. Because prescriptions were primarily intended to manage withdrawal, participants supplemented with illicit drugs to experience enjoyment and manage pain. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. Providing prescription alternatives to illicit drugs is a critical harm reduction approach that reduces exposure to an increasingly toxic drug supply, yet further optimizations are needed.

Because traditional supply chain information systems have problems such as easy data tampering, low information transparency, and interaction delays, blockchain has been taken consideration into supply chain information sharing research. Furthermore, blockchain technology is expected to provide decentralized supply chain information sharing solutions to enhance security, availability, and transparency. However, with the in-depth study of the application of blockchain technology in supply chain information sharing, people have found that the data stored publicly in the blockchain are still threatened by privacy leakage. In addition, due to the openness and accessibility of the blockchain, the lack of fine-grained access control is also apparent. In order to improve the security of data, we propose a novel privacy-preserving multiauthority attribute-based access control scheme for secure blockchain-based information sharing in a supply chain. In this scheme, blockchain stores encrypted supply chain information on distributed nodes. Multiple attribute authorities manage different attributes of users to achieve fine-grained access control and flexible authorization. Even if some attribute authorities fail, the user’s private key will not be leaked. In user secret key generation, we adopt an anonymous key generation protocol to realize the secure distribution of user keys by the attribute authorities. Furthermore, in order to meet the protection of communication privacy between blockchain nodes, properties of policy hiding and identity hiding are considered. Finally, we design experiments to analyze the performance of our scheme, including secret key sizes and running time of encryption and decryption.</jats:p>",

This work developed a three‐step optimization approach integrating a geographical information system‐based mixed‐integer linear programming model to economically optimize the biofuel supply chain on the premise of meeting certain GHG emission criteria. The biomass supply grid cell was considered first, based on a maximum level of GHG emissions, prior to economic optimization. The optimization simultaneously considered dual‐feedstock sourcing, selection between distributed and centralized configurations, and the impact of maintaining SOC balance in agricultural soil on biomass availability. The applicability of the modeling approach was demonstrated through a case study that optimized a dual‐feedstock renewable jet fuel supply chain via a gasification‐Fischer<jats:italic>–</jats:italic>Tropsch (gasification‐FT) conversion pathway in 2050 under three biomass availability scenarios. The case study results show that the differences in procurement costs and GHG emissions between energy crops and agricultural residues have a large impact on the layout of the supply chain. The supply‐chain configuration tends to be more centralized with large‐scale biorefineries when a supply region has an intensive and centralized distribution of biomass resources. The cost‐supply curves demonstrated the technical potential of biofuels that could be obtained at a certain level of cost. Additionally, sensitivity analysis shows that the GHG emission credit from producing extra electricity during the gasification‐FT process will be significantly reduced with a rising share of renewable electricity generation in the future. © 2022 The Authors.

Air Diffusion Performance Indices (ADPI) of an industrial workshop area under different air supply angles (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90° in summer and 90° in winter) of the ceiling-mounted swirling diffusers were evaluated by on-site measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling. The measurement data was used to verify the CFD numerical model. The temperature and velocity field of the working area were simulated and analysed under seven operating conditions of swirling diffusers. The findings showed that in summer, the increase of the swirling air supply angle would increase the air velocity. When the air supply angle was larger than 75°, a draughty wind speed (&gt;0.3 m/s) in the local working area, was produced. When the air supply angle was 30°–75°, the indoor design comfortable temperature range (26°C–28°C) was produced. The ADPIs of the workshop were 100% with the air supply angles of 45° and 60° in summer and 90° in winter, respectively. The research findings should provide a reference for improving the airflow organization in the working area of a tall factory building. </jats:p>",

Past timber harvesting implied land transformation and woodland resources management. Therefore, relict charcoal kilns and historical documents of forest management are important sources of information about past woodland composition and structure. However, ancient charcoal kilns are poorly documented in temperate woodlands in the lowlands of western Europe, especially combined with historical written sources. In this study, charcoal production was investigated in an area in NE France, by combining charcoal and historical sources analysis, along with innovative dating methodologies. Thus, by using both radiocarbon and optically-stimulated luminescence dating, we showed that the activity lasted until recent times (19th–early 20th centuries) and Carpinus was the dominant taxon in charcoal assemblage. Moreover, kiln attributes seemed to be independent of topographical variables. Woodlands in this area were subject to a coppice-with-standards management, where small diameter wood was preferred to produce charcoal and large diameter stems, mainly Quercus and Fagus, were traded as timber. The dominance of Carpinus is rather uncommon in charcoal studies but supports the importance of Carpinus as fuelwood since the Middle Ages, as confirmed by many written sources.</jats:p>"

Despite the importance of food safety, little is known about the current state of food supply chain safety controls (FSCSC). Therefore, this study aims to identify and establish a conceptual model for FSCSC. To gain a preliminary grasp of the impetus behind the FSCSC, this study applied a comprehensive literature review to fully integrate the various elements that drive FSCSC. Relevant literature on food safety, food quality, and food safety control measures is being scrutinized. Regulation and legislation, traceability and trackability, technology, and human capital are recognized as important aspects to enhance FSCSC. All four main aspects provide a communication network that is capable of aiding food controllers to verify, identify, and isolate potential sources of contamination. Insights from this study could offer a better understanding of FSCSC and serve as a platform for future empirical research. This study proposed an alternative strategy to transform the current FSCSC. Hence, future studies could incorporate inquiry, in-depth evaluation, and panel interviews to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the general awareness of FSCSC processes.</jats:p>",

The NADP+/NADPH redox couple is essential for cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis. However, how the homeostasis of these two dinucleotides is integrated into chloroplast biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the important role of NADP+ supply for the biogenesis of PSI by examining the nad kinase 2 (nadk2) mutant in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which demonstrates disrupted synthesis of NADP+ from NAD+ in chloroplasts. Although the nadk2 mutant is highly sensitive to light, the reaction center of photosystem II (PSII) is only mildly and likely only secondarily affected compared to the wild-type. Our studies revealed that the primary limitation of photosynthetic electron transport, even at low light intensities, occurs at PSI rather than at PSII in the nadk2 mutant. Remarkably, this primarily impairs the de novo synthesis of the two PSI core subunits PsaA and PsaB, leading to the deficiency of the PSI complex in the nadk2 mutant. This study reveals an unexpected molecular link between NADK activity and mRNA translation of psaA/B in chloroplasts that may mediate a feedback mechanism to adjust de novo biosynthesis of the PSI complex in response to a variable NADPH demand. This adjustment may be important to protect PSI from photoinhibition under conditions that favor acceptor side limitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although construction and demolition waste (C&amp;D waste) recycling has been widely regarded as an effective way to save resources, its selection of recycling channels has received little attention. In order to improve the recycling efficiency of C&amp;D waste and promote the process of C&amp;D waste management, we innovatively propose a dual-channel recycling problem of C&amp;D waste from the perspective of supply-chain operation, aiming to study the impact of the selection of recycling channels and the government’s economic intervention on pricing decisions. Specifically, we build in this paper a three-echelon construction material supply chain including a construction contractor, a professional recycling agency, and a building materials manufacturer, considering two modes: the construction contractor does the recycling job alone (as the direct channel) and the construction contractor entrusts the recycling job to the professional recycling agency (as the indirect channel). We use game theory to analyze the optimal decision strategies of the members with or without governmental intervention and the equilibrium strategies are obtained. At the same time, taking Chongqing city as an example, we apply the model to carry out numerical simulation, and the results reveal that greater recycling costs of C&amp;D waste leads to lower profits for the members. When the market capacity of first-class renewable building materials increases, the recycler’s recycling cost of C&amp;D waste decreases, and the remanufacturing cost of recycled materials processed into first-class renewable building materials decreases, the supply-chain members will choose the indirect channel to perform the recycling job. In the case when government intervention exists, the recycling quantity of C&amp;D waste increases, the price of the final products decreases, and both the total profit of the system and the profit of the supply-chain members increase; there is a positive correlation with the government subsidies. The study provides some insights on managerial significance to C&amp;D waste recycling management.</jats:p>"

Together with functional fillers, these represent a next step for the generation of functional and active smart materials, compatible with additive manufacturing technologies. Herein, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) mixed with different amounts of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) up to 6 wt% in order to obtain UV‐curable piezoresistive and thermoresistive materials, is reported. It is shown that the addition of rGO to AESO hinders the curing process, but always maintains double bond conversions higher than 50%. Composites are characterized by a good dispersion of micrometric filler clusters. Further, the thermal stabilities are close to 300 °C and crosslinking degrees are above 1.75 mmol cm<jats:sup>–3</jats:sup>. The Young modulus of the composites decreases with the addition of the rGO fillers, in particular for the higher filler contents, and electrical conductivities up to 0.13 S m<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> are obtained for the composites with the highest rGO content.

The new crown epidemic, pesticide residues, insect pests, and heavy metal pollution have a certain security impact on the food supply chain. The rice supply chain is characterized by a long life cycle; complex roles in the main links; many types of hazards; and multidimensional, multisource, and heterogeneous information. To strengthen the rice supply chain’s supervision ability under the epidemic situation, a supervision cross-chain model suitable for the complicated data of the rice supply chain based on parallel blockchain theory and smart contract technology was built. Firstly, the data collected in the rice supply chain and different types of data stored in different parallel blockchains were analyzed. Secondly, based on data analysis, a collection/supervision cross-chain mechanism based on “hash lock + smart contract + relay chain”, a concurrency mechanism based on the K-means algorithm and a Bloom filter, and a consensus mechanism suitable for multichain consensus named the Supervision Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SPBFT) were proposed. Furthermore, a cross-chain model of rice supply chain supervision was constructed. Finally, theoretical verification and simulation experiments were used to analyze the operation process, safety, cross-chain efficiency, and scalability of the model. The results showed that the application of parallel blockchains and smart contracts to supervision of rice supply chain information improved the convenience and security of information interaction between various links in the rice supply chain, the storage cost of supply chain data and the high latency of interaction was reduced, and the refined management of the rice supply chain data and personnel was realized. This research applied new information technology to the coordination and resource sharing of the food supply chain, and provides ideas for the digital transformation of the food industry.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve the 6th goal of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), more efforts are being undertaken to secure drinking water quality. In this paper, the current status, challenges and opportunities of groundwater quality management and improvement in Sri Lanka were reviewed and discussed, based on previous studies. There are Ca-HCO3 type, Ca–Mg-HCO3 type and Na–SO4–Cl type groundwater dominated in the wet zone, intermediate and the dry zone, respectively. Elevated levels of hardness, fluoride, DOC, and alkalinity, and salinity are reported in the groundwater in the dry zone controlled by geology and arid climate. Although groundwater in some regions contain significant levels of nitrates, arsenic, cadmium and lead, the majority remain at acceptable levels for drinking purposes. As for treatment technologies, existing membrane-based drinking water treatment technologies such as RO (Reverse Osmosis) stations can produce safe and clean drinking water to the community, but this has still a limited coverage. To achieve a safe drinking water supply for all, especially in rural communities of Sri Lanka under the 6th goal of the UN SDG, more efforts in building up the infrastructure and man power are needed to monitor and assess groundwater quality regularly so as to develop management strategies. Research and development can be directed towards more cost-effective water treatment technologies.

To find out the mechanism of water hammer in the viscoelastic pipe of both elastic and viscous properties, an experiment was set up to study the direct water hammer generated by rapid closure of the downstream valve in the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) pipe, with six flow velocities in nearly 70 tests. The experimental results showed that the maximum water hammer pressure generated in the viscoelastic pipe in all flow velocities was (20% at most) greater than the traditional value of Joukowsky's formula. A faster closing time of the valve caused a higher water hammer pressure. The difference in water hammer pressure generated between the fastest and the slowest closing time of the valve was 14–17% at each flow velocity. Based on the relationship between the stress and strain of the pipe wall in the viscoelastic pipe, the reason that the water hammer characteristic in the viscoelastic pipeline was different from the traditional value was explained. The study provides a reference for the mechanism of transient flow in viscoelastic pipelines.</jats:p>",

Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are usually used as the main indicators. In recent years, nitrogen is widely used to prevent and extinguish the underground fires. It reduces the oxygen concentration in the fire area and can affect the indicator gases release. To study this effect, the samples of coal with a fraction of 1–3 mm, and the samples of coal dust with a particle size of 0.2–0.4 mm were used. Nitrogen with an admixture of oxygen was supplied to the heated samples. Studies showed that the carbon monoxide and hydrogen are released from the coal dust much more intensively than from the coal. Therefore, high concentrations of these indicator gases may point to the spontaneous combustion of the coal dust. As the proportion of oxygen in the mixture with nitrogen decreases, the release of carbon monoxide and hydrogen from the heated samples of coal and coal dust decreases. This can make it difficult to assess the state of spontaneous combustion foci in an inert environment.  To determine the coal temperature when nitrogen with different oxygen content is supplied, the ratio of carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentrations can be used. In the coal dust it turns out to be the same as in the coal only at 3 % oxygen content. With an increase in the oxygen concentration, this ratio for the coal dust changes significantly. This fact can be used for the identification of fire foci.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interest of consumers to acquire Tequila has caused an increase in its sales. As demand increases, the Tequila industry must obtain its raw material at a constant rate and agave farmers must be prepared to satisfy this supply chain. Because of this, modernization of the strategies used to ensure a planned, scheduled, timely, and predictable production will allow farmers to maintain the current demand for Tequila. This has been evidenced in official historical records from 1999 to 2020 where there is a fluctuation in the price of agave due to supply and demand. Given this scenario, this research shows the development of a multivariable predictive mathematical model that will permit the agave–Tequila production chain to work based on a smart implementation of planned actions to guarantee the agave supply to the Tequila industry. The proposed model has a goodness of fit (R = 0.8676; R¯2 = 0.8609; F(1,20) = 131.01 &gt; F0.01 (1,20) = 8.10) and demonstrates the impact on agave prices is due to several factors: Tequila exports (α = 0.50) &gt; agave plants harvested “jima” (α = 0.44) &gt; dollar exchange (α = 0.43) &gt; Tequila production (α = 0.06) &gt; annual accumulated precipitation (α = 0.05). Nevertheless, the price forecast can be influenced by climate change or economic crises that affect the supply chain. In conclusion, a prediction of agave price stabilization for five years is shown where authorized producers can evaluate future scenarios so that the agave supply chain can be guaranteed for Tequila production, facilitating the decision making regarding its raw material.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agroforestry systems hold potential for wood and tree biomass production without the need of felling trees. Branch wood harvesting provides access to considerable amounts of lignocellulosic biomass while leaving the tree standing. Aiming at alternatives for wood provision, we assessed the actual woody structure of a silvopastoral system in the African Savannah ecoregion, utilising terrestrial LiDAR technology and quantitative structure models to simulate branch removals and estimate harvesting yields. In addition, the stand structure and harvested wood were examined for the provision of four types of assortments meeting local needs, and operational metrics for each treatment were derived. The stand had large variability in woody structures. Branch harvesting interventions removed up to 18.2% of total stand volume, yielded 5.9 m3 ha−1 of branch wood, and delivered 2.54 m3 ha−1 of pole wood quality, retaining on average more than 75% of the original tree structures. Among the most intense simulations, a mean of 54.7 litres (L) of branch wood was provided per tree, or approximately 34.2 kg of fresh biomass. The choice of an ideal harvesting treatment is subject to practitioners’ interests, while the discussion on aspects of the operation, and stand and tree conditions after treatment, together with outputs, assist decision making. The partitioning of tree structures and branch removal simulations are tools to support the design of tending operations aiming for wood and tree biomass harvesting in agroforestry systems while retaining different functional roles of trees in situ.</jats:p>"

In practice, due to measurement uncertainty and riverbed erosion and deposition, river bathymetric errors are inevitable. Therefore, identifying major cross sections with large bathymetric errors is of great significance. In this study, forward and reverse flow routing models were developed and then applied to obtain two different water stages for a specific cross section, which were respectively propagated from the upstream and downstream boundaries. The spatial variation of differences between the two calculated water stages was compared to quantify the influence of bathymetric errors, and then used as an indicator for the location identification of the bathymetric errors. After being tested and verified in a hypothetical river case, the identification method was then applied to the Xunjiang River case. The results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the cross sections with large bathymetric errors, and the identification performance is related to the flow magnitude. The research is valuable and practical to the improvement of river bathymetric data and the accuracy of water flow simulation.</jats:p>",

In the last decades, the collapse of the traditional rural socioeconomic systems that once characterized the Mediterranean region, along with land-use changes, have created conflicts and additional driving factors for rural fires. Within Europe, Portugal is the most affected country by rural fires. This work intends to demonstrate the importance of recovering and valorizing residual agroforestry biomass to reduce rural fire risk in Portugal, and thus contributing to a fire resilient landscape. From the results of the known causes of fires in Portugal, it becomes very clear that it is crucial to educate people to end risky behaviors, such as the burning of agroforestry leftovers that causes 27% of fires in Portugal each year. The valorization of the existing energy potential in the lignocellulosic biomass of agroforestry residues favors the reduction of the probability of rural fires, this being the focus of the project BioAgroFloRes—Sustainable Supply Chain Model for Residual Agroforestry Biomass supported in a Web Platform—introduced and explained here.</jats:p>"

Soil water content of the two treatments was monitored at the interval of 10 days by the Time Domain Reflectometer probes which were installed in situ, and measured both at 14 and 33 cm soil layers. The data were evaluated by temporal stability methods and Spearman's correlation. Results showed that mulching with rice straw proved to be efficient in retaining the soil water at the 14 cm soil layer.

Therefore, according to the characteristics of attribute uncertainty and index weight subjectivity in agricultural drought risk assessment, an attribute interval identification model combined with grey relational analysis was established to evaluate agricultural drought risk. Firstly, the agricultural drought risk evaluation index system was established from four aspects: disaster, exposure, vulnerability and resistance. Then, the objective weights of the indicators were calculated using the grey relational method. Finally, the agricultural drought risk in Zhengzhou was evaluated by qualitative analysis and probabilistic analysis. Qualitative analysis results showed that the agricultural drought risk in Zhengzhou is at the level of moderate drought. The probability analysis showed that the probability of Zhengzhou City being in a moderate drought is 79.5%, and the probability of being in a severe drought is 20.5%. In addition, the superiority of the attribute interval identification model in agricultural drought risk assessment was further verified by comparative analysis. This research provides a new method for regional agricultural drought risk assessment. Furthermore, it can provide support for management departments to further understand the regional drought risk level and improve the efficiency of drought risk management.</jats:p>",

The use of carbon emission trading policies has been generally considered by the governments. Remanufacturing, as an effective way to reduce carbon emission, is incorporated together with the tool of carbon emission policy to construct a low-carbon supply chain in this paper. We analyze the carbon emission reduction and profit maximization problem among enterprises of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their outsourcing remanufacturers, integrating the impact of the carbon emission constraint policy and the carbon market. Considering consumer preferences on low-carbon products and recycling rates of waste products, we construct a Stackelberg game model (dominated by the OEM) and analyze the impact of a carbon emission constraint policy on sales price, volume, carbon emission, and revenue of new and remanufactured products in the supply chain system. The results suggest that the upper bound set by the government on carbon emission for enterprises positively affects sales volume of new products and negatively affects sales prices of both products. Moreover, the discount rate of carbon emission constraint negatively affects sales volume of new products and positively affects sales prices of both products. Notably, the carbon emission constraint policy has impacts on the production decisions of both manufacturers on an economic scale. When the upper bound of carbon emission is equal to a certain threshold, the OEM could obtain the greatest revenue. The results provide a new perspective for the government to attain the goal of carbon emission reduction and not sacrifice economic growth. Managers in outsourcing remanufacturers and OEMs could also be implicated from our results to collaborate in allocating remanufacturing orders to achieve win-win opportunities between them.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, it is imperative for oil supply chains to be on guard against all probable vulnerabilities and develop adequate protection mechanisms. This research study aims to identify the most important vulnerabilities for oil supply chains in the context of Pakistan, a developing country. Subsequently, these identified vulnerabilities were used to design a protection framework, embodying different supply chain capabilities. For this purpose, this study employs a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach. Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) has been used to prioritise vulnerabilities and Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (QFD) has been used to identify those capabilities that can ensure protection against these vulnerabilities. Results indicate that crude oil price instability, fuel price shocks, unpredictable demand, and information and communication disruptions are the most important and catastrophic vulnerabilities in the context of Pakistan’s oil industry. For mitigation of these vulnerabilities, oil supply chains need to incorporate real-time information sharing, visibility, e-procurement, traceability, and transparency as resilience measures. These recommendations are of considerable importance to Pakistan’s oil industry and policy-making authorities. Moreover, this study fulfils the research gap by focusing on enhancing the resilience of Pakistan’s oil supply chains, with the aid of MCDM techniques.</jats:p>",

The “layer of thymus-blood vessel-IPTG” (TBP layer) concept showed to be effective in preserving IPTG. The objective of this study was to identify the origin and course of blood supply to IPTG (IPBS) within the TBP layer and to take key points of operation during CND. Design. This is a retrospective control study. Participants. Patients who underwent thyroidectomy plus CND using the TBP layer concept and conventional technique between 2017 and 2019 were enrolled. Measurements. The origin and course of IPBS in relation to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and thymus and prevalence of hypoparathyroidism were detected. Results. A total of 71.3% of IPTGs (251 of 352) were supplied by ITA branches, defined as type A. Type A was further divided into Types A1 (branches of ITA, coursing laterally to the RLN (53.1%, 187 of 352)) and A2 (branches of ITA, traversing medially to the RLN (18.2%, 64 of 352)). Type A2 was more common on the right side than on the left side (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <a:mi>P</a:mi>\n                        <a:mo>&lt;</a:mo>\n                        <a:mn>0.001</a:mn>\n                     </a:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>). Fifty-five (15.6%) IPTG feeding vessels originated from the thymus or mediastinum. Nineteen (5.4%) IPTGs were supplied by branches of the superior thyroid artery. The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism decreased from 45.7% to 3.6% (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <c:mi>P</c:mi>\n                        <c:mo>&lt;</c:mo>\n                        <c:mn>0.001</c:mn>\n                     </c:math>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>), in the TBP layer group compared with the conventional technique group.

In order to integrate the distribution resources of the distribution system of the logistics industry and maximize the overall benefits of distribution, this paper designs an intelligent logistics agile distribution model and optimizes the distribution strategy. Firstly, this paper puts forward a rationalization evaluation system based on the established logistics agile distribution model. Make full use of the fuzzy subsets of each level to quantify the fuzzy indexes to evaluate, and then comprehensively clarify the index attributes through the fuzzy transformation criteria to obtain the evaluation results. Secondly, aiming at the networked agile distribution organization form, the scientific location mathematical model of agile distribution center and the path mathematical model of the agile distribution are established. Finally, the uncertain influence of many objective conditions on distribution agility has been analyzed, and the dynamic optimization model of an agile distribution path with the concept of time window under random demand is constructed. Through the experimental analysis, the rationalization evaluation strategy and index of verification test results show that the model has significant optimization advantages, which not only improve the rationality and economic benefits of distribution, but also meet the time requirements of all users.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study aimed to realize the relationship between supply chain management and operations performance in the industrial companies operating in Gaza Industrial City, according to SCOR model. The study employed the descriptive-analytical method, depending on a questionnaire as the key tool of the study. The questionnaire consists of six dimensions to measure the trends of employee’s in industrial companies. Due to the small size of the population (100 items) the study used the full population in its survey. The responsive percentage was 80% of the population. The study concludes number of results: (1) applying supply chain management was on average (4.28) with a relative weight (85.67%). (2) There is a statistically significant correlation between the dimensions of supply chain performance management attributes, represented in (reliability, responsiveness, agility, costs, and asset management) and the performance of operations in industrial companies. The degree of adoption of industrial companies to the previous dimensions as follows: \"Reliability\" have a relative weight (87.53%), \"Response\" with a relative weight (85.39%), \"flexibility\" with relative weight (86.21%), \"Cost\" with relative weight (85.65%), and \"Asset Management\" with a relative weight (83.56%). (3) The results also showed no significant difference at a level (0.05≥α) between the average responses of sample about supply chain management attributable to the variables (gender, education), while there is a significant difference attributable to the variables (years of service, job title). The recommendations from the study: the industrial companies should improve response time to meet customers’ demand, which will be reflected in maximizing operations performance efficiency. In addition, it is recommended that the industrial companies should enhance flexibility in the supply chain, which leads to rapid response for circumstances, opportunities, and threats in external environment, to enhance their competitiveness.</jats:p>\n                     \n                    <jats:p xml:lang=\"ar\">هدفت هذه الدراسة إلى التعرف على إدارة سلسلة التوريد وعلاقتها بأداء العمليات لدى الشركات الصناعية العاملة بمدينة غزة الصناعية وفق نموذجSCOR ، واستخدمت الدراسة المنهج الوصفي التحليلي، واعتمدت على الاستبانة كأداة رئيسية للدراسة مكونة من ستة محاور، تهدف لقياس اتجاهات العاملين في الشركات الصناعية، كما واعتمدت الدراسة علي أسلوب المسح الشامل في اختيار مفردات الدراسة، نظراً لصغر حجم مجتمع الدراسة، والذي بلغ (100) مفردة، وقد تم استرداد (80) مفردة، أي بنسبه (80%) من مجموع مفردات المجتمع الكلي للدراسة، وتوصلت الدراسة إلى مجموعة من النتائج أهمها: أن درجة تطبيق إدارة سلسلة التوريد في الشركات الصناعية العاملة بمدينة غزة الصناعية كانت بمتوسط حسابي (4.28) بوزن نسبي (85.67%)، كما وأظهرت النتائج وجود علاقة طردية ذات دلالة إحصائية بين أبعاد إدارة أداء سلسلة التوريد، والمتمثلة في (الموثوقية، الاستجابة، المرونة، التكلفة، إدارة الأصول) وأداء العمليات في الشركات الصناعية العاملة بمدينة غزة الصناعية، وكانت درجة تبني الشركات الصناعية العاملة في مدينة غزة الصناعية للأبعاد السابقة على النحو التالي: \"الموثوقية\" جاءت بوزن نسبي (87.53%)، \"الاستجابة\" جاءت بوزن نسبي (85.39%)، \"المرونة\" جاءت بوزن نسبي (86.21%)، فيما جاءت \"التكلفة\" بنسبة (85.65%)، \"إدارة الأصول\" جاءت بوزن نسبي (83.56%)، كما وأظهرت النتائج أيضاً عدم وجود فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية عند مستوى (0.05≥α) بين متوسطات استجابات أفراد عينة الدراسة حول إدارة سلسلة التوريد تعزى لكل من المتغيرات (النوع، المؤهل العلمي)، ووجود فروق بين المتغيرات (سنوات الخدمة، المسمى الوظيفي) لدى الشركات الصناعية العاملة بمدينة غزة الصناعية، وقد خرجت الدراسة بمجموعة من التوصيات أهمها: ضرورة قيام الشركات الصناعية محل الدراسة بتحسين سرعة الاستجابة لتلبه احتياجات العملاء مما ينعكس على تحسين كفاءة أداء عملياتها، كما أوصت الشركات الصناعية محل الدراسة بالسعي لزيادة درجة المرونة في سلسلة التوريد مما يؤدي إلى سرعة الاستجابة  للأحداث أو الفرص أو التهديدات في البيئة الخارجية مما يعزز من قدراتها التنافسية.</jats:p>",

The projected circuit uses a smaller number of transistors, such that power consumption and leakage currents are in prior limit. Mainly, the CMOS D Flip Flops are designed to use them in binary counters, shift registers, Analog and Digital circuit designs.
