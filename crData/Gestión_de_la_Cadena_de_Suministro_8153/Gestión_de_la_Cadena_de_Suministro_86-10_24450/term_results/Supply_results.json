This yearly survey asks educators from all the schools listed in SPE's Petroleum Engineering and Technology Schools book to tel 1 how many petroleum engineering undergraduates they have, how many graduates they had last year, what their ability to get jobs were, and what they predict their graduates' ability to find jobs will be in the future. For those graduates reporting jobs, the sector of the industry in which the jobs were found is also reported.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This year, 20 of the 50 schools we solicited returned the surveys. Exactly half of the surveys went to U. S. schools; 12 of those were returned. In addition, one of five schools listing petroleum engineering options returned the survey. Other sources of information were used whenever possible to fill information gaps. SPE's annual Petroleum Engineering and Technology School s directory, based on surveys conducted by the Education and Accreditation Committee, is the best source of annual information on the size of the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior classes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This year's survey showed that the petroleum engineering job market was the worst it has been since the SPE Manpower Committee began collecting statistics in 1978. Only 29 percent of graduates seeking a job reported finding a job by the time of graduation. About 69 percent of the jobs found were with major oil companies. All other sectors of the petroleum industry showed a greatly reduced on-campus recruitment. Major oil companies also reduced on-campus recruitment significantly, but to a much lesser extent than the independent producers, pipeline companies, service companies, drilling contractors, government, consultants and financial institutions.</jats:p>",

Outages are treated as the result of insufficient capacity, and outage costs are weighed against whatever outlays are necessary to bring new generation into the electrical system. Given the emphasis on long-run supply in the ultimate usefulness of these studies, research has focused to a remarkable degree on the cost of individual outage events (Sanghvi, 1982). The customer's long-run response to a change in reliability levels has rarely received much attention, and when it has been considered it has been treated as an analytically difficult or intractable problem. Our purpose is to show that the economics of long-run adjustments to a different level of reliability are in fact quite simple and easily incorporated into standard cost/benefit studies. </jats:p>",

Nutrient solutions in four combinations of high and low nitrate concentrations and high and low phosphate concentrations were used to grow four different groups of plants. During the development of the plants dry weights and total P contents were measured. It was concluded that P redistribution into reproductive organs was dependent on N supply and was a consequence of N redistribution. The ratio of N and P concentrations was not equal in several parts of the plant, and was not constant during the development. In different parts of a young plant the ratio increased. As soon as redistribution of N and P started the N/P ratio decreased. The minimum N/P ratio of a mature maize plant was about 3 for leaves and 1 or 2 for roots and stems.</jats:p>",
