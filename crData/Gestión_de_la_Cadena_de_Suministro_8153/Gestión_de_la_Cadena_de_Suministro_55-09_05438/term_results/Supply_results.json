For solutions with the same nickel‐iron ratio, toxicity symptoms increased with increase in the absolute amount of nickel.

In the absence of nickel, the iron content of the roots but not of the tops, increased with iron supply. In nickel‐toxic plants, the magnesium, calcium and phosphorus contents of the tops and the potassium, calcium and phosphorus contents of the roots were higher than in healthy plants, but the potassium content of the tops and the magnesium content of the roots were lower.</jats:p><jats:p>Similar results were found with tomato.</jats:p>",
