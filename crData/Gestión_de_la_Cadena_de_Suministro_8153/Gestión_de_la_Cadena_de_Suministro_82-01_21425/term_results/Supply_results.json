Neutrophil reserve depletion was investigated in groups of premature, 1-day-old and 1-, 2-, and 4-week-old rats by measuring: (1) the size of the neutrophil storage pool, and (2) the proportion of this pool which was released from the storage compartment when a weight-standardized release stimulus was applied. It was found that the premature rat has a small neutrophil storage pool containing 1.28 ± 0.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells/g body weight (x ± SE). This pool size increases to contain 4.35 ± 0.23 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells/g in the 4-week-olds (p &lt; 0.001). With a standard neutrophil storage pool release stimulus, the premature rats depleted 68 ± 4% of their neutrophil stores, vs. a depletion of only 13 ± 6% of the stores in the 4-week-olds (p &lt; 0.001). The small neutrophil reserve and the exaggerated release of stored neutrophils in neonatal animals are factors which predispose neonates to neutrophil reserve exhaustion during bacterial sepsis.</jats:p>"

On the soil used, increasing rates of selenium progressively depressed growth of clover and increased its selenium concentration; sulfur stimulated growth up to an addition of about 16 yg S/g and depressed the selenium concentration only when selenium was added. More sulfur was required to depress the selenium concentration to a threshold level, which was characteristic of a particular selenium application rate, at high initial selenium levels than at low. Clover growth was reduced when the sulfur to selenium ratio in the tops was less than 50: 1. Application rates greater than 0.025 �g Se/g soil (= 40 g/ha) produced young clover plants with excessive levels of selenium for consumption by stock. The safe rate for application to a mixed pasture is likely to be considerably less than that value. Field experiments confirmed that appreciable diminution of the selenium concentration in pasture as a result of sulfur addition occurred only when selenium was in plentiful supply. Grasses were much more affected than clovers. It is concluded that the negative interaction demonstrated between selenium and sulfur is of no practical significance when each is added at rates appropriate to the treatment of low sulfur-low selenium pastures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In neonatal rats, crushing or cutting the infraorbital nerve, the sensory nerve supply to the whiskers. has been found to prevent cortical barrel formation. However, both procedures are followed by regeneration of one-third to one-half of the nerve fibres and reinnervation of the whiskers. By counting fibres in individual whisker follicle nerves, it has been shown that 29–67% (mean 45%) of the myelinated fibres regenerate to the whiskers after a crush compared to 24–56% (mean 39%) after a cut. Further differences between the crush and cut lesions were indicated by studies on the time course of regeneration. Counts of the regenerating fibres at various ages as well as recordings of cortical evoked potentials in normal, nerve-crushed and nerve-cut animals showed that recovery was 3-4 days earlier in the nerve-crushed, compared with the nerve-cut animals. In normal and nerve-crushed animals the evoked potential was first detectable 2-3 days after birth while the response after nerve cut could not be recorded until day 7. Even after 60 days the amplitude of responses on both crushed and cut pathways was only about one-third of normal, while the latency was prolonged (normal 5.8±0.25 ms, crush 6.5±0.26 ms, cut 7.7±0.67 ms). Central changes occurring as a result of nerve cut or crush have been studied by microelectrode recordings from the trigeminal nucleus (the first synaptic level) and the somatosensory cortex. These also indicate clearly the greater severity of the cut lesion. Thus, in crushed animals, all levels of the trigeminal nucleus as well as the cortex show only minor modifications. The whiskers occupy the same total area and responses from all whiskers are present at their normal sites. However, after nerve cut, the responses from both the trigeminal nucleus and cortex show clear abnormalities. The total whisker area is reduced with a concomitant expansion of responses from the nose, check, lower jaw, and whiskers by the eye and ear. In addition, only one-third to one-half of the whiskers give responses. The site of these abnormalities is localized to the trigeminal nucleus since all whiskers show innervation in the peripheral nerve. It is suggested that the longer recovery time as well as the reduced accuracy of reinnervation may contribute to the poorer central recovery after a nerve cut.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study was performed to assess the relationship between coronary sinus blood flow (by thermodilution) and myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate‐systolic arterial pressure double product) during atrial pacing in patients with and without coronary artery disease. In 11 individuals with coronary artery disease, pacing was performed to ischemia, as reflected by electrocardiographic changes or lactate production; 8 patients without coronary artery disease served as controls. Coronary sinus blood flow (in ml/min) was similar for the two groups at rest. However, the increase in coronary blood flow from rest to peak pacing was less (P = 0.025) in those with coronary artery disease (50 ± 26 ml/min) than in controls (79 ± 26 ml/min). The ratio of coronary sinus blood flow to double product was the same at rest in both groups (11.1 ± 2.2 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> controls, 11.6 ± 2.7 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> coronary artery disease; NS). At peak pacing, it was unchanged in the controls (10.4 ± 2.0 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>) but fell in those with coronary artery disease (9.0 ± 2.5 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>; P = 0.002). The aortic‐coronary sinus oxygen content difference was similar at rest in both groups and did not change in response to pacing in either group. Thus, in response to augmented myocardial oxygen demand, patients without coronary artery disease have an appropriate increase in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply, while in those with coronary artery disease who develop ischemia the increment in myocardial blood flow (and oxygen supply) is inappropriately low.</jats:p>",

Radioactive phenylalanine was infused intravenously in such a way as to rapidly establish and maintain a trace concentration in arterial blood. The rat was decapitated after 1.5 min, the brain removed, frozen, and thin sections cut for quantitative autoradiography. The plasma concentrations of phenylalanine as well as other neutral amino acids that compete with phenylalanine for entry into brain were measured. Phenylalanine influx varied considerably between structures, ranging from 5 nmol.min-1.g-1 in the globus pallidus to 12 nmol.min-1.g-1 in the inferior colliculus. Anesthetics reduced phenylalanine influx, but this effect was primarily due to alterations in the circulating neutral amino acid pattern. The anesthetics had little, if any, direct effect on the neutral amino acid transport process itself.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effects of zinc supply on the distribution of zinc and dry weight among plant parts were examined during the first 55 days of vegetative development of Seaton Park subterranean clover grown in a zinc-deficient soil in a glasshouse. Symptoms of zinc deficiency first appeared in young trifoliate leaves. Zinc deficiency decreased the expansion of blades and petioles, delayed the development of leaves and lateral branches, depressed dry weights of roots and shoots, and increased the proportion of plant dry weight in roots and leaf blades. In each treatment and at each harvest, zinc concentrations varied widely amongst plant parts and with their physiological age. Plant parts also differed widely in the response of their dry matter and zinc concentrations to both zinc treatment and harvest time. It is suggested that these complex relationships explain why plant samples consisting of composite plant parts are not suitable for diagnosis of zinc deficiency. In the present experiment, zinc concentration in whole shoots was unsatisfactory for diagnosing zinc deficiency since concentrations were higher in young, zinc-deficient plants than in older, zinc-adequate plants. In young leaf blades of the same physiological age, zinc concentrations showed reasonably constant relationships with plant growth throughout the entire experiment. However, they varied two- to three-fold in leaves of different ages from the same plants. The results show the importance for diagnosis of zinc deficiency of selecting as a sample a single organ of defined physiological age. The youngest open leaf blade is recommended for diagnosis of zinc deficiency in subterranean clover.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of phosphorus on the relationship of zinc concentrations in various plant parts to yield of Seaton Park subterranean clover was examined. Plants were grown in a glasshouse at three levels of phosphorus (39, 65 and 130 mg phosphorus/pot; denoted P1, P2 and P3 respectively) and six levels of zinc added in factorial combination to a sand deficient in both phosphorus and zinc. At the lowest three levels of zinc supply, plants were severely to moderately deficient in zinc: in them, increasing levels of phosphorus depressed growth and induced high concentrations of phosphorus (&gt; 1 % DM) in several plant parts and symptoms of phosphorus toxicity in leaves. At the highest three levels of zinc supply, plants at P1 were phosphorus deficient: application of P2 and P3 increased growth and induced zinc deficiency primarily by diluting the available zinc. In addition, P3 appeared to depress slightly the zinc content of plant tops by another mechanism. In severely zinc-deficient plants, phosphorus supply changed the relationships between zinc concentrations in various plant parts and yield of whole tops, probably as the result of phosphorus toxicity. In the youngest open leaf blades, an asymptotic relationship at P1 changed at P2 and P3 to sigmoidal and to 'Piper-Steenbjerg' relationships respectively. These changes would not have invalidated the use of plant analysis for diagnosing zinc deficiency. In moderately zinc-deficient plants, phosphorus supply had little or no effect on the relationships of zinc concentration in plant parts to yield of shoots. As a result, critical concentrations in plant parts generally remained constant over the whole range of phosphorus supply. The data refute suggestions that high levels of phosphorus in plant parts inactivate the zinc within them, thus removing a potential problem in the use of plant analysis for diagnosing zinc deficiency in subterranean clover. The results confirm the previous suggestion that a concentration range of 12-14 �g zinc/g in the youngest, open leaf blade is critical for diagnosis of zinc deficiency in subterranean clover.</jats:p>"
