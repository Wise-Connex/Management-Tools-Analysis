Its total quantity is vast, and much of it raises major problems of availability. Legal deposit of many categories is very inadequate, and for this and other reasons bibliographic control is very poor. Most social science documents are not produced and supplied through normal publication and distribution channels, so that they are very difficult to identify and acquire; much of it can only be acquired locally. Many kinds of materials are also hard for libraries to record and store, and traditional methods are not appropriate or practicable. Improvement of availability must rest partly with local libraries and partly with the national library, which can encourage local collection, set standards, co‐ordinate activity, and aid bibliographic control.

The maintenance of such a collection presents special problems and the Division has a special section to deal with these. The general principles for selection depend upon the categories being acquired. British official publications published by HMSO are received on a subscription basis. Those not published by HMSO are either selected individually, or acquired under depository arrangements with the issuing Department. British local government publications are being acquired through a firm specializing in local government documentation. Foreign official publications are either acquired on demand, or obtained through back up libraries such as the Official Publications Library of the British Library Reference Division or via international interlibrary loan. There are special arrangements to acquire the output of particular inter‐governmental organizations such as OECD, FAO, Unesco, IAEA and the Division has been a main depository library for all EC publications since 1973. Thousands of official reports from the United States are acquired through agencies such as NTIS and ERIC. Recording and shelving of official publications vary according to the type of publication eg serial, monograph, microfiche etc. Some of the material acquired is indexed in the Division's publication British Reports, Translations and Theses and selected input is forwarded for inclusion in SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe).</jats:p>",

Data from lakes and reservoirs in the United States indicate a positive correlation between total phosphorus and total organic carbon measurements. In view of this correlation and results of controlled laboratory studies reported in the literature, nutrient enrichment is a significant factor contributing to organohalide problems in surface water supplies. Watershed management for control or reduction of phosphorus export is suggested as a potentially significant and cost‐effective means of dealing with organics‐related problems. Regionally calibrated empirical models can be used in conjunction with appropriate reservoir and watershed monitoring data to assess the extent, significance, and controllability of water quality problems related to phosphorus export and eutrophication.</jats:p>",

Plants from which all tillers were removed were grown at 21/10°C with a 14 h photoperiod. At flag leaf emergence, an additional light (15% above control) and two shading treatments (40 and 70% below control) were applied to the plants for an 8-day period, ending 6 days before anthesis. \n    The additional light and the 70% shade treatments had significant effects (+37%, -43% respectively), on the number of competent florets (as judged by anther appearance at anthesis) and subsequently similar effects on the number of kernels per spike at maturity. The changes in competent floret numbers were closely related to changes in spike dry weight at anthesis and in turn, during the treatment period. The heavy shading decreased grain yield significantly. \n    Within the spike, treatment effects on floret and kernel number were greater in basal spikelets than in distal and especially central spikelets, in both an absolute as well as relative sense. These effects were paralleled by greater changes in basal spikelet dry weight and water-soluble carbohydrate concentration. They may be related to the smaller size or later development of basal spikelets at the onset of treatment, and suggest that the base of the spike is normally a lower priority sink for assimilate at that time.</jats:p>"

Ryegrasses with high levels of infection with andophytic fungi carry fewer stem weevil eggs and larvae and consequently suffer less damage. Some ryegrasses with low levels of endophyte infection, such as 'Grasslands Ruanui', suffer more damage when grown with high inputs of nitrogen, while others with the genotype Lolium multiflorum x perenne L., such as 'Grasslands Manawa' are more susceptible than those with the genotype Lolium perenne L.

In particular the analysis focuses on the unvertainty as to whether agents perceive the supply shock to be permanent or not. I consider the role of sudden credible policies designed to improve productivity. The type of pricing rule adopted by agents in an uncertain environment is shown to play a central role in determining how domestic and international markets respond to supply shocks. For example if all prices are fully flexible, more credible supply side policy rules will induce less volatility in both nominal and real interest rates than less credible policy regimes. Also, credible policy rules will make both the exchange rate and nominal interest rate relatively more volatile under price countracts than under full price flexibility.</jats:p>"

The innervation of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter is still controversial. Six male patients with a sustained spinal cord lesion above D‐4 underwent electrophysiological evaluation of the reflex and direct evoked responses to stimulation of the pudendal nerve branches in the perineal region. Recording of the motor unit potentials was performed using a catheter‐mounted concentric needle introduced into the intrinsic external urethral sphincter transurethrally. The results of this study indicate that the pudendal nerve, i.e., somatic, plays an important role in the innervation of the intrinsic external urethral muscle. It does not, however, exclude the possibility that the autonomic nervous system also innervates this muscle.</jats:p>",

Verano were studied in two glasshouse experiments. Verano plants were grown in pots containing 1.6 kg soil and were watered daily to field capacity until early flowering (43 days after seedling emergence). From day 43 to day 116, the plants were watered every 1, 2, 3 or 4 days. Leaf water potential immediately before rewatering varied from c. -20 to -28 bars in the 4-day treatment. Yields of seed pods were 5.8, 4.6, 3.8 and 3.8 g in the I-, 2-, 3- and 4-day treatments respectively. Severe water stress greatly reduced inflorescence density, had lesser negative effects on frequency of blooming, floret number, seed setting and proportion of florets forming a lower (beakless) articulation, and increased individual pod weight. Watering treatment had transitory and inconsistent effects on hardseededness. Seed production of Verano plants grown after flowering under shades with 30,40 or 59 % transmission or no shade was reduced by low level of illuminance, mainly because of effects on floret number per inflorescence; the proportion of florets forming a lower articulation and individual pod weight (but not seed setting) was also reduced by shading. The seed moisture content at different harvest occasions appeared to influence hardseededness, but shading had no consistent effect.</jats:p>"

The cyclic compound MECAM [1,3,5-N.N'; N\"-tris-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-triamino-methylbenzene] and its N-methyl derivative Me3MECAM promoted growth, whereas the 2,3-dihydroxy-5-sulfonyl derivatives MECAMS and Me3MECAMS were inactive. The same results were obtained with TRIMCAM [1,3,5-tris(2,3-dihydroxybenzoylcarbamido)-benzene] and TRIMCAMS (the 2,3-dihydroxy-5-sulfonyl derivative of TRIMCAM). However, the sulfonic acid-containing linear compound LICAMS [1,5,10-N,N', N\"-tris(5-sulfo-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-triaza-decane] supported growth. In contrast, LIMCAMC, in which the sulfonyl groups at the five position of LICAMS are replaced by carboxyl groups at the four position, was inactive. The uptake of the active analogs required the functions specified by the fepB, fesB, and tonB genes. Surprisingly, growth promotion of mutants lacking the enterochelin receptor protein in the outer membrane was observed. Only MECAM protected cells against colicin B (which kills cells after entering at the enterochelin uptake sites) and transported Fe3+ at about half the enterochelin rate.</jats:p>",

The growth ofjuveniles during the same period was indexed by lower jaw length during winter. The reproduction of foxes in the study area was correlated with vole abundance. Fat deposits built up during autumn and were depleted during winter. Subadults had consistently smaller fat deposits than adults. There was no positive correlation between vole abundance and mean fat deposits in autumn or degree of depletion during winter. The mean amount of fat deposited during autumn was correlated with the frequency ofoccurrence offruit and berries in fox stomachs. The degree of depletion of fat deposits during winter was correlated with mean snow depth. It is hypothesized that the availability of fruit and berries (a major source of carbohydrates in the diet of foxes) determines the amount of fat reserves built up during autumn, whereas the energy requirement of moving in deep snow determines the degree of depletion during winter. Juvenile growth was correlated with vole abundance but growth later in life seemed to compensate for this variation.</jats:p>",

To determine how these increased O2 demands are met, the effects of stimulation of the ansa subclavia on regional arterial and venous O2 saturation, O2 extraction, blood flow, and O2 consumption were determined in the hearts of 16 pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs. Microspectrophotometric observations of small regional arteries and veins in quick-frozen hearts to determine regional O2 extraction were combined with regional blood flow measurements with radioactive microspheres to determine regional myocardial O2 consumption by the Fick principle. Ansa subclavia stimulation produced significant increases in maximum rate of pressure development, heart rate, and blood pressure. Under control conditions, venous O2 saturation was lower and O2 extraction higher in the subendocardial compared with the subepicardial region of the left ventricle. While sympathetic stimulation did not alter the mean O2 extraction or venous O2 saturation values, there were no longer significant subepicardial vs. subendocardial differences in these parameters. Flow and O2 consumption in these regions increased proportionally during stimulation. The ratio of O2 supply to O2 consumption was not significantly altered by ansa subclavia stimulation, indicating that sympathetic stimulation produced no adverse effect in either region. </jats:p>",

The phage caused a reversible depolarization of cell membrane, while phage ‘ghosts’ induced an irreversible depolarization. The phage infection was strictly dependent on <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> membrane potential value when phage/cell ratio was 5 and higher. When the ratio was close to 1, the decrease in the membrane potential up to – 100 mV caused practically no effect on the phage infection. The infection inhibition was observed when the membrane potential was lowered below this ‘threshold’ value. On the other hand, the decrease in the membrane potential caused no effect on the phage infection under conditions promoting a concomitant increase in the value of the transmembranous pH gradient. The phage DNA transfer through the membrane of ATPase‐deficient cells was reversibly inhibited by switching off the respiratory chain – the sole generator of a protonmotive force in these mutant cells. The membrane should be kept in the energized state during the phage DNA entrance into the cell. Adsorption of the phage on <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> was followed by the reversible release of the respiratory control. Thus the results presented here indicate the requirement of the electrochemical proton gradient across the plasma membrane for injection of phage T4 DNA into <jats:italic>E. coli.</jats:italic> They support the concept postulating an expenditure of host cell metabolic energy for phage T4 DNA transfer through the membrane.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Experiments with the composting of municipal sewage sludge were made to examine the effect of different bulking agents and of the oxygen supply on the process. The bulking agents have been chopped straw, milled bark and sawdust as organic materials and Styropor—foamed polystyrene as a synthetic material. The bulking agents have been dried at 105°C and then mixed with the same quantity of digested municipal sewage sludge. Because of the different water capacity of each material different structures were reached. i.e. the free air space in the mixture differed, because each material extracted a different quantity of water out of the sludge. This effect can be seen in Table 1, while a scheme of the experiment is given in Figures 1 and 2. </jats:p><jats:p> In a second run the oxygen content was changed from 21 Vol-% to 50 Vol-% in dry air at the same rate of 17 1/h for 3 min in each hour. In both runs the composting process was followed by measuring the temperatures and the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-rate in the exit air. For comparison two parameters have been calculated, the energy production and the carbon loss which are shown in Table 2. These results show that bark was the best bulking agent (2608 kJ and 45.4 g carbon loss), while the synthetic material produced almost no activity (326 kJ and 4.2 g carbon loss). The effect of the higher oxygen content can be seen by comparing the curves of the temperatures in Figs 3 and 4 showing the characteristic form. After reaching the maximum, the temperatures stayed for a longer time on a higher level during the second run, marking a higher activity of the process. The curves of the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-rate given in the Figs 5 and 6 show the same effect. </jats:p><jats:p> Overall it is evident, that the structure of the mixture, i.e. the bulking agent has a greater effect on the composting process than the increased oxygen content. </jats:p>",
