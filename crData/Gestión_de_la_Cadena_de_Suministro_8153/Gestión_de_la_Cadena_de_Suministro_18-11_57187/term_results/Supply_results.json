Although this subject has received attention in recent years, the relationship between analytical orientation and supply chain risk management is little explored. Thus, this research verifies the impact of analytical orientation over supply chain risk management. A questionnaire was applied with micro, small and medium-sized firms of Brazilian Southeast region, obtaining 111 responses. The structural equation modeling was used for analysis and the main conclusions indicate that analytical orientation has a strong and significant impact over supply chain risk management.

In this study, we use an inductive case‐based approach to build an understanding about the roles, approaches, and contextual factors that influence how service triads are controlled and coordinated. We collected and analyzed data from nine companies forming three service triads, each comprising a customer, a manufacturer of an asset, and a service supplier. We synthesized our findings in a theoretical framework, where we show that first, both, control<jats:italic>and</jats:italic>coordination, are present in service triads rather than just control as previously posited. Second, controlling and coordinating service triads is not a single actor's responsibility but rather a collective effort shared by two or three actors. Third, we uncovered four contingent factors that influence the dynamics of how service triads are controlled and coordinated: the customer's risk exposure due to the offering's failure, the substitutability of the offering, the contractual safeguards, and the relationship closeness.</jats:p>",

Assuming that analytical orientation is essential for supply chains to recover from interruptions, this theoretical essay aimed at proposing its inclusion in an initial supply chain resilience model, based on literature review.

Here, we deliver a theoretical analysis to quantitatively study the supply-demand regulation in photosynthesis. For this, we connect two previously developed models, one describing the PETC, originally developed to study non-photochemical quenching, and one providing a dynamic description of the photosynthetic carbon fixation in C3 plants, the CBB Cycle. The merged model explains how a tight regulation of supply and demand reactions leads to efficient carbon fixation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Watch the VIDEO. Recent European studies have shown that there are a growing number open access monograph publishers, many of which can be described as New University Presses (NUPs) or Academic-Led Publishing (ALP) initiatives, in addition to other small open access presses. The majority of these presses publish open access e-books and also print-on-demand copies for sale. Key studies have shown a positive impact on the usage and discovery of open access books. Despite this evidence, NUPs, ALPs and open access presses in general, have difficulty in accessing the library supply chain - the channels that library acquisition departments use to buy print and e-book content via approved library suppliers, such as Dawson, Askews, ProQuest and EBSCO. This was evidenced in a 2017 landscape report from Jisc, Changing publishing ecologies: A landscape study of new university presses and academic-led publishing. As part of the ALP interviews for the study Rupert Gatti of Open Book Publishers noted that it would be helpful to have a service that “looks at how to bring academic content into the catalogues and the digital learning environments of the universities and to allow universities to also relate back to the publisher, so that there is a flow of information going back both ways”.As such, the Jisc report made a number of recommendations, including best practice in metadata and support with distribution/dissemination. In order to take these recommendations further, Jisc held a community workshop in July 2018 to surface issues with key stakeholders for the following problem statement:“OA publishers have difficulty accessing the channels that library acquisition departments use to buy print and e-book content”.The workshop brought together experts from NUPs, ALPs, book suppliers and distributors, metadata suppliers, libraries and other experts in OA publishing to discuss the above statement. The core aim of the workshop was to allow the experts to share their experiences and knowledge in order to get a better understanding of the supply chain and to gain insight into the problem statement. These discussions highlighted four key areas, which the group agreed needed further development. These have been captured as a set of recommendations and suggestions for best practice.This paper will introduce the ideas behind the workshop, before detailing the outcomes of the discussion sessions, which featured four round table sessions led by a NUP, an ALP, a book supplier and a library. Finally the paper will outline the four areas surfaced in the roundtable sessions. These included two practical areas, the library supply chain and metadata and two aspirational areas, cultural change in the acquisition process and new forms of content.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A rotor supported by gas bearings vibrates within the clearance. If the static imbalance of the rotor is large, even if the rotation speed is low, large amplitude vibration is generated by the centrifugal force. This is a serious problem because the risk of bearing damage increases. In order to solve this problem, an externally pressurized gas journal bearing with asymmetrically arranged gas supply holes has been developed. This type of bearing has a large load capacity as compared with the conventional symmetric gas supply bearing because pressurized gases are supplied to the loaded and counter-loaded side bearing surfaces via asymmetrically arranged gas supply holes. The bearing has a new gas supply mechanism in which gas is supplied from the rotor through inherent orifices. The characteristics of the developed bearing are beneficial from the viewpoint of using the bearing in rotational-type vibration exciters. In other words, this rotor has a large static imbalance. Numerical calculations of the characteristics of this bearing were performed, and the resulting characteristics were compared with those of a conventional symmetric gas supply journal bearing. The bearing load capacity of the developed bearing is considerably larger than that of conventional symmetric type bearings. The load capacity increases owing to the asymmetry of the gas supply holes. In the controlled gas supply pressure condition, rotor radial vibration during rotation can theoretically be zero. A test rig and gas control system to realize vibration reduction was constructed. A rotational test under the gas pressure control condition was conducted using a large unbalanced rotor taking advantage of this property. The control program was constructed using matlab and simulink. The devices were driven by a digital signal processor. The magnitude of the unbalance of the rotor is 13.5 × 10−3 kg m. The bearing diameter and length were 60 and 120 mm, respectively. The rotational vibration amplitude decreased at a high rotational frequency under the proposed bearing configuration, although the amplitude increases monotonically with the frequency in the conventional bearing. When the gas supply pressure was controlled synchronously with the rotation frequency modulation of the large unbalanced rotor, the amplitude of the vibration amplitude was greatly reduced. The rotor of the test rig was safely supported by this bearing, and effective data for practical operation were obtained.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>It becomes evident today's Oil&amp;Gas projects in average have higher electrical power demand than years back. In most cases technical decisions are to simply increase current to compensate power needs. Design ratings for operating and short-circuit currents of medium-voltage switchgear on generator voltage level are limiting grid design. This is the case especially for power islands. Stepping up generator voltage can be a perfect solution in particular for power grids feeding extended oil fields.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Installing step-up transformers for each generator unit and working with a network voltage up to 33 kV or higher sometimes creates disposition to believe that this is a more expensive solution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A load-flow and short-circuit calculation for the main substation is required to properly size the switchgear and the other distribution equipment derived from planned grid arrangement and oil field process specific operation modes. It has also to be considered expected power supply quality, reliability and availability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A cost comparison will be based on total cost of ownership between the solution with main substation on generator voltage level of 11 kV and the solutions with step-up transformers up to 22 or up to 33 kV. This comparison will also include the additional heat losses of overhead lines or cables to and between the wellpads for a year of operation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>When using higher voltages, there should be no limitation with respect to grid design and grid operation. Generally, the voltage level has to be adequate for the supply purpose. A network should be designed to avoid use of current limiters. With proper voltage level selection the bus sectionalizers can remain in NC position. It is possible that generator units are operated that loss of one set can be compensated to avoid any interruption of power supply.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Power generation can be increased when feeding via transformers to higher voltage levels of switchgear. The Power Plant Switchgear will require only a reduced short-circuit level and lower design currents for busbars and feeders to achieve optimized grid design. Unit transformers between generators and switchgear will prevent any negative influence of ground faults from the grid to the generators. Also with respect to heat losses, maintenance, grid availability and reliability as well as aging the advantages are clearly on the higher voltage level. The required power grid will be assessed based on different voltage levels. The optimized solution for the oil field will be discussed in detail.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Solution approach with higher voltage levels and optimized grid design will have reserves to deliver additional electrical power for extensions and also for operation in depletion mode.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There are now oil fields which do not allow bridging distances between wellpads by means of overhead lines but by underground cabling because of environmental conditions. Considering this aspect in cost comparison between different grid designs and voltage levels the advantage for higher voltage levels with optimized grid design will be even clearer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain is a data management innovation that allows the linkage of successive records regarding a digital entity, and to store them into a shared, decentralized, distributed and retroactively unchangeable data structure. Each bit of information related to the recorded events contains the public key of the owner, therefore, the whole record is formed by a chain of transactions with blocks of information identifying where the transaction was generated from and its current destination  (Nakamoto, 2008). Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin, an online currency that was first introduced in 2009. The technology makes it possible to conduct business between members within the network without relying on third parties as guarantors to prove transaction integrity, thus increasing speed and reducing cost of transaction. Moreover, the transparency posed by the technology makes it possible to trace goods and services through all stages, making the technology a unique tool that can be assimilated by, for example, the Agro-food supply chain systems. Specifically, Blockchain is being tested in a pilot project in the UK meat (Beef) industry by the FSA (Food Standards Agency) and the slaughterhouses, with IBM Blockchain platform to ensure full transparency and compliance with regulations, (Evenstad, 2018). However, the uptake of Blockchain in the fresh produce (fresh and fresh, short-life processed fruit, vegetables, salads) supply chain is lagging, in the United Kingdom, and remains untested and limited to literature, models and specific case studies in the United States of America and France. The study aims at understanding how prepared stakeholders are in adopting Blockchain for their operations. An inductive qualitative method was employed through non-structured interviews with three companies and one consumer focus group. The interviews were guided by seven (7) open-ended questions, which were unstructured. The collected data was analyzed with axial coding through constant comparative methods. Seven (7) themes were identified as factors influencing the adoption of Blockchain in the fresh produce supply chain in the UK. These are, novelty of the technology, complexity of the fresh produce supply chain in UK, level of product transformation, technological compatibility with operations, cost and value, Customer (retailer) push for adoption, and public/consumers opinion. The adaptation of Blockchain by the current fresh produce supply chain in the UK and the EU at large will come about when concerns on Novelty, and complexity of supply chain systems are fully addressed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent advent of shale gas in the U.S. has redefined the economics of ethylene manufacturing globally, causing a shift towards low-cost U.S. production due to natural gas feedstock, while reinforcing the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels. At the same time, the global climate change crisis compels a transition to a low-carbon economy. These two influencing factors are complex, contested, and uncertain. This paper projects the United States’ (U.S.) future ethylene supply in the context of two megatrends: the natural gas surge and global climate change. The analysis models the future U.S. supply of ethylene in 2050 based on plausible socio-economic scenarios in response to climate change mitigation and adaptation pathways as well as a range of natural gas feedstock prices. This Vector Error Correction Model explores the relationships between these variables. The results show that ethylene supply increased in nearly all modeled scenarios. A combination of lower population growth, lower consumption, and higher natural gas prices reduced ethylene supply by 2050. In most cases, forecasted CO2 emissions from ethylene production rose. This is the first study to project future ethylene supply to go beyond the price of feedstocks and include socio-economic variables relevant to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</jats:p>"

Following a critical review of empirical data relating to the Supplier Codes of Conduct of the top 30 listed German companies (DAX30), recent examples of ‘home state’ legislation of CSR are assessed. The article shows that most of these laws are not very stringent. The article argues that a hybrid regulatory approach towards CSR in global supply chains is necessary.</jats:p>"

The advantage of the proposed fuzzy multicriteria analysis model is that it can overcome the limitations of the existing approaches in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The fuzzy multicriteria group decision-making model provides organizations with the ability to evaluate the performance of their IoT-based supply chains for improving their competitiveness.

This work aimed to study reactions of external breathing, blood circulation, blood and tissue respiration during ascending to mountain at various altitudes from 2100 m, 3500 m and 4200 m above sea level.To attain this goal, investigations were carried out to study changes in the functional respiratory system  (FRS) and body’s oxygen regimes (BOR) in the people who have been well adapted to hypoxia of varying origin – sportsmen (adapted to physical loads of varying intensity) and altitude climbers (sportsmen, whose professional activity takes place under low and at time very low partial oxygen pressure in the inhaled air).Twenty-eight sport women and high altitude female climbers underwent complex examinations under normoxy conditions prior to ascending mountains. Later analogous examinations were conducted at the beginning (on day 2-3) of the educational-training session at mid-altitude (Terskol, PreElbrus, 2100 m above sea level) on day 10 of their stay. Examinations were conducted at altitudes 3500 and 4200 above sea level.Transfer of essentially healthy people, who have not been adapted to hypoxic hypoxia typical for mountains at altitude 2100 m above sea level, caused health worsening of FRS and BOR  control. At altitude 4200 m above sea level even after 12 day acclimatization the indicators of external respiration were 2-2.5 times higher compared to same normoxy condition.After transfer to altitude 2100 m above sea level during first days of acclimatization it is desirable to reduce motor activity because under these conditions the state of the main oxygen-transport systems of the organism does not allow sustain work ability at normoxic level. It is desirable that such corrections be made individually with a consideration of data of prior stay at analogous altitude.</p>"

When integrating the demand and supply side into one framework, the mechanism for determining the market clearing price has been changed. This is due to the demand variations in the demand side in response to the market clearing price and the change of generation costs in the supply side from the demand variation. In order to find the best balance between the supply and demand under the demand response management scheme, this paper proposes a new integrated supply and demand coordination mechanism for the electricity market and smart pricing methods for generator and retailers. Another important contribution of this paper is to develop an efficient algorithm to find the match equilibrium between the demand and supply sides in the new proposed mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that the new mechanism can effectively handle unpredictable demand under dynamic retail pricing and support the ISO to dispatch the generation economically. It can also help in achieving the goals of dynamic pricing such as maximizing the profits for retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ROCOCO system (Kislitsyna and Nikolayev 2016) is designed to supply constants for Monte-Carlo calculations of both neutron fields and the gamma fields they generate. The initial database of nuclear data used in the system is the Russian national library of evaluated neutron data (ROSFOND) (Nikolayev 2006, Zabrodskaya et al. 2007, RUSFOND 2017). ROCOCO is specific in that it enables the estimator to optimize the level of detail when describing neutron cross-section energy dependences. Cross-sections of key fuel, structural and coolant materials can be described in such detail as the evaluated data permits; cross-sections of secondary nuclides (minor actinides, fission products, etc.) can be described in a 299-group BNAB approximation (Manturov et al. 1996) with regard for the resonance self-shielding by subgroup method or without regard for self-shielding altogether. The energy dependence of gamma rays is described in a 127-group P5 approximation (Koshcheyev et al. 2014). Optimizing the level of detail makes it possible to reduce to a great extent the counting time with no major effect on the result and its error. Where desired, in the process of calculating the energy release in neutron reactions or in gamma-quanta formation matrices, contributions from the decay of radionuclides formed in these reactions (with a half-life of less than three years) can be taken into account. The energy dependence of the elastic scattering anisotropy is described in detail, or in the event of a group or subgroup description of cross-sections, by defining 33 boundaries of 32 equiprobable cosine intervals of the scattering angle. The thermalization effects in calculations of neutron fields are taken into account either in an ideal gas approximation or using 72-group thermalization matrices built based on thermalization files contained (if any) in the ROSFOND library.</jats:p><jats:p>It should be noted that the system contains descriptions of detailed dependences of elastic scattering cross-sections and angular distributions on all multi-isotope elements; the relationship between the scattering angle and the energy loss in this case is determined with the use of the energy-dependent effective atomic weight.</jats:p><jats:p>The system’s programs are written in the FORTRAN language.

Based on Marx's anthropological insights into the concept of fetishism, it explores the political relationship between labour, subjectivity and commodities in supply chains capitalism. For this purpose, it empirically examines the materials of ethnographic research on the production of Italian companies that produce in an Eastern European country (Romania) and then sell mainly to countries in Western Europe. In this way, the spatial separation between the places where the investments are made (production) and those where profits are generated (market) becomes very clearcut, just like the alienating division between people and the products of their work. In the light of the Marxian analysis of the commodity form, this detachment will be analysed in a fragment of the productive, organisational and social mosaic of contemporary capitalism.</jats:p>",

Their increasing relevance in international business has led to a serious regulatory gap, especially in light of corporate involvement in human rights abuses, labour exploitation and environmental degradation. Alongside a number of international norms such as those expressed in the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, there has been a proliferation in domestic and international law of disclosure provisions, mandating greater transparency by companies in response to the problems caused by global supply chains. In this paper, however, it is argued that disclosure is not a sufficient answer to such problems. It is suggested that we should approach the problems with a different conceptualisation of supply chain structures. If we regard them as ‘global poverty chains’, such a perspective brings about a moral response — a recognition that we have a collective responsibility to eradicate the poverty and suffering caused by the chains. This response necessitates that transparency requirements be altered and accompanied by a regulatory framework that empowers victims of poverty to be able to escape it.</jats:p>"

Therefore, distribution prices are now disclosed and product information is shared with consumers. However, distribution channels are complex and supply chain management (SCM) is autonomously executed in each company. For this reason, it has been frequently pointed out that the distribution process is not transparent and the distribution margin is high. In this paper, we propose a system that guarantees the transparency of the product distribution structure by applying blockchain and smart contracts to the price-tracking portion of supply chain management systems. This approach allows companies to track their trades by enhancing transparency in the SCM, thereby discouraging companies from pursuing excessive profits. In addition, companies can cut management costs by automatically storing distribution details in a blockchain network and managing information more securely.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, suppliers’ behavior and green operations may influence manufacturers’ social image and operations. Thus, governance mechanisms for suppliers may impact the performance of EPR practices. Therefore, from the perspective of supply chain governance, this paper first studies the relationship of manufacturers’ EPR practices and operation performance and then introduces three types of supplier governance mechanisms (contract governance, relationship governance and equity governance) to explore the influences on manufacturers’ performance. Survey data collected from enterprises in the electronics industry in China show the relationship between manufacturers’ EPR practices and performance, as well as the effect of the three proposed governance mechanisms on the performance of EPR practices. The conclusions obtained in this study suggest that manufacturers’ EPR practices can significantly improve their environmental and market performances. At the same time, manufacturers can adjust their operation performance according to the choice of supplier governance mechanism, which is chosen based on the operation objectives of the enterprises. To be specific, if the enterprises want to obtain better environmental performance and improve their social image, they should choose a contract governance mechanism that explicitly stipulates the responsibility and obligation of the supplier. In addition, the three proposed governance mechanisms can improve the market performance of enterprises in EPR practices.</jats:p>"

Based on the independent integrated energy system, the thermal network interaction between different load characteristic regions is introduced, requiring a minimum thermal grid construction cost, CCHP investment operation cost and carbon emission tax as the comprehensive optimization targets, and making overall optimization to the configuration and operation of the multi-region integrated energy systems. This paper focuses on the planning of equipment capacity of multi-region integrated energy system based on a CCHP system and heat network. Combined with the above comprehensive target and heat network model, a mixed integer linear programming model for a multi-region CCHP system capacity collaborative optimization configuration is established. The integrated energy system, just a numerical model solved with the LINGO software, is presented. Taking a typical urban area in Shanghai as an example, the simulation results show that the integrated energy system with multi-zone heat-suply network interaction compared to the single area CCHP model improved the clean energy utilization of the system, rationally allocates equipment capacity, promotes the local consumption of distributed energy, and provides better overall system benefits.</jats:p>"

At any time, Halal integrity is not guaranteed and risks of becoming non-Halal is the major concern of all parties along the supply chain. To respond to Muslim consumers’ trust concerns in Halal food, many traceability systems were proposed in previous studies based on emerging technologies and  recommended to be incorporated into Halal food supply chains. Nevertheless, all of these systems are centralized, opaque and not enough transparent. To mitigate these problems, blockchain technology is introduced as a ground-breaking innovation with greater decentralization, visibility and transparency.

Multistage random sampling procedure was applied to select a total of 40 pork retailers from six towns. Structured questionnaire was used to collect information through face to face interview. Pork retailers were clustered into three categories as small scale (sell &lt;5kg pork per day), medium scale (sell 5-10kg pork per day) and large scale (sell &gt;10kg pork per day) based on quantities of pork selling per day. Collected data were analyzed using appropriate statistical procedures of SAS and SPSS software packages. The result showed that the quantity of pork products sold per day was too small. About 61.5, 15.4 and 23.1% of pork retailers were selling &lt;5, 5-10 and &gt;1 kg of pork products per day in small, medium and large scale retailers, respectively. In most cases, pork was sold in the form of mortadella, sausage and salami. In addition to pork  selling, almost all of the pork retailers were selling one or more other meat types such as beef, mutton, goat meat, fish and chicken. About 92.3% of the pork retailers were selling both beef and chicken meat, and 79.5, 48.7 and 10.3% of them were selling fish, mutton, and goat meat, respectively. The average price (followed by SE) of a kilo gram of pork was 162(6.3), 164(4.0) and 172(6.0) Ethiopian Birr (ranging 7.5 to 8 USD per kg of pork) in small, medium and large scale pork retailers, respectively. The presence of few pork consumers, lack of formal central markets and public complain against pork consumption were the major challenges observed in pig and pork marketing value chain. In concussion, the findings of this study will improve awareness on existing pork marketing systems in Ethiopia and provide valuable information that can support future interventions aiming to solve key challenges in the market value chain.</jats:p>"

A gas-supply system is characterised by continuous operation and a consequent need to achieve a high level of operating reliability and safety. Such a system has its unique aspects, with particular elements having their different functions while also simultaneously interacting in the context of the integral whole. In such circumstances, risk analysis can prove useful in planning activity to prevent damage, and also in the devising of rescue scenarios. Thus, the purpose of the analysis presented here has been to supply the information that is necessary in decision-making relating to risk reduction. One of the most comprehensive assessment methods is based on the expected value of gas shortage. Basic formulae with which to determine a generalised indicator of system reliability are also presented, with risk viewed as synonymous with the unreliability of gas supply. This paper then proposes a method by which an indicator of the expected efficiency of operation may also be determined as the quotient of chance and absolute risk. The thinking in this article has been developed on the basis of data from a real gas-supply system, while the computational methods deployed allowed applications to draw conclusions regarding possible modification of the expected gas shortages method.</jats:p>"

A Stackelberg model is adopted to investigate the forest scale and carbon emission reduction decisions of the supply chain. We design and analyze the carbon emission reduction cost-sharing (ERCS) mechanism and carbon sink cost-sharing (SCS) mechanism, respectively. The result shows that both contracts can help the wood forest product supply chain to achieve higher profits. The ERCS mechanism may encourage the manufacturer to increase emission reduction level and the forestry company to expand the forest scale. The SCS mechanism is beneficial to the expansion of carbon sink forests; however, it may lead to the manufacturer decreasing investment in carbon emission reduction measures.</jats:p>"

In this situation, however, designing efficient contracts for emission reducing while retaining appropriate supply-chain profit is a substantial but challenging problem. We therefore refine this from practice and consider a low-carbon supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to analyze in which conditions the system should outsource its carbon reduction efforts to an external expert firm under the assumption that consumers with a sense of social responsibility prefer low carbon products. In the decarbonization expert firm embedded supply chain, we examine the respective impacts of three cost-pooling schemes for emission reduction on supply chain performances. We find that the manufacturer-undertaking contract is the worst in terms of profit and carbon reduction level among the contracts being studied, while the retailer-undertaking contract yields the best outcome in terms of the profit and performs well in carbon reduction when the contractor has cost efficiency in carbon reduction, which is even better than the joint-undertaking contract in carbon reduction when the contractor is inefficient. The study shows the diversity of contracts on outsourcing carbon reduction significantly impacts the supply chain profitability, carbon reduction efficiency and sustainability of operations.</jats:p>"

Khususnya dalam agri- food supply chain (AFSC), kompleksitas pengelolaan risiko dan ketidakpastian meningkat karena karakteristik produk hasil pertanian yang mudah rusak, serta sifat produksinya yang sebagian besar didasarkan pada faktor cuaca dan proses biologi yang tidak terduga. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan upaya pengelolaan risiko yang menyajikan penilaian terhadap faktor-faktor yang dapat melemahkan daya saing dan kinerja AFSC. Penelitian ini mengintegrasikan kerangka pengukuran kinerja AFSC dan konsep Rapid Agricultural Supply Chain Risk Assessment, dengan memperhatikan aspek-aspek berkelanjutan yang meliputi aspek ekonomi (profit), sosial (people), dan lingkungan (planet). Kerangka teoritis yang dihasilkan diuji menggunakan Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Kuesioner diberikan kepada 193 petani tanaman pangan yang tersebar di sentra- sentra pertanian Kabupaten Paser dan PPU. Berdasarkan analisis model konstruk (outer model), seluruh indikator memenuhi convergent validity, kecuali indikator PR12 yang berkaitan dengan risiko regulasi hukum dan birokrasi. Oleh karena itu, indikator ini dikeluarkan dari konstruk model penelitian. Setelah semua indikator tervalidasi, selanjutnya dilakukan uji reliabilitas dengan melihat nilai composite reliability dari blok indikator yang mengukur setiap konstruk. Seluruh konstruk memiliki nilai di atas 0.7, sehingga semuanya dapat dikatakan reliabel. Adapun berdasarkan analisis model struktural (inner model), dapat disimpulkan bahwa pengelolaan risiko berpengaruh signifikan terhadap kinerja AFSC dan perspektif berkelanjutan. Akan tetapi, variabel perspektif berkelanjutan tidak berpengaruh signifikan terhadap kinerja AFSC.</jats:p>"

Information quality plays an important role in enhancing supply chain performance. The aim of this research was to explore the relationships between SCM-IT inhibitors, IT enablers, information sharing, and information quality in supply chain management. Data for 183 business units operating in Vlore, Albania during 2017 were analyzed. Direct and mediating or indirect effects were also analyzed. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), an advanced statistical technique with the help of Smart-PLS version 3.2.7. PLS algorithm was used to determine the factor loadings and path coefficients in the theoretical model. The study has concluded that SCM-IT inhibitors have a negative and significant effect on information quality; the mediation effect of information sharing was significant, the mediation effect of IT enablers was significant; however, the multiple mediation effects of IT enablers and information sharing was not significant. These findings are useful for top management and IT specialists of the business units, and also for information technology services and products providers.</jats:p>",

Membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Sorption studies were carried out to determine the degree of swelling of the MWCNT/PVA membranes into different types of salt solution. Pervaporation experiments were carried using the pristine and MWCNT loaded membranes. The effect of MWCNT concentration and salt concentration on the swelling, flux and salt rejection were investigated at the constant temperature of 40 °C. As a result, greater than 92% of rejections were obtained using all membrane. The highest flux was obtained using 0.3 wt% MWCNT loaded membrane with the highest rejection of 98.8%. SEM analysis confirmed that the excess amount of particles caused agglomeration and negatively affected the desalination performance.</jats:p>",

The primary outcome was the expected number of accepted HIV+ donations per million units of donated blood.

The current strategy was superior when the MSM deferral question yielded &amp;lt;0.8% false negative rate; at higher rates, the risk-based strategy is superior.

We found that the firm needed changes in its business model, which brought new participants into the business ecosystem and changed their respective positions. We further identified three types of supply chain localisations in cross-border e-commerce for export markets (sales, warehousing, and R&amp;D localisation), which the company’s establishment of overseas warehouses enabled. The three localisation strategies serve as the driving force and the main business model innovation in cross-border e-commerce. This study contributes to the supply chain innovation literature by proposing that overseas warehouses, bonded warehouses, and supply chain finance are capabilities that form part of the business model innovation in cross-border e-commerce.</jats:p>"

For the manufacturers in question, one of their entrepreneurial risks is to incur lower than expected sales because of adverse weather conditions. The variability of weather conditions is expected to continue to rise because of climate change. Manufacturers can choose to do nothing and suffer the financial consequences, or transfer the weather risk partly or wholly to others. This paper presents an approach to transfer weather risks to risk takers and reduce sales volatility using weather index‐based financial instruments. In our approach, the risk of adverse weather conditions is calculated on the basis of adverse conditions observed in the past. We do not use forecasts of weather conditions. We illustrate our action design with case studies of three companies: a company manufacturing automotive replacement parts, a clothing company and a company producing of sunscreen products. We demonstrate its efficiency in reducing cash‐flow uncertainty and potential losses caused by adverse weather, and in influencing sales to the next tier.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A cadeia produtiva para reparo de automóveis envolve em geral uma seguradora, que arcará com os custos de reparo, a montadora do veículo que é responsável por prover as peças de reposição originais e uma oficina reparadora que realiza o conserto do veículo. Neste processo, a entrega das peças para substituição representa grande parcela do custo e do tempo de permanência do veículo em reparação na oficina, convergindo para a satisfação ou não do cliente final. A substituição de peças representa para uma seguradora 70% do montante gasto para o conserto do automóvel e tal indicador mostra a importância de se estudar este componente no processo de recuperação do bem. O processo de entrega das peças às oficinas varia de acordo com o país e sua legislação, com a seguradora e montadora do veículo. O acompanhamento da logística de entrega de peças também deve ser parte integrante da operação de uma seguradora que se utiliza do fornecimento de peças para reparação de seus veículos segurados e terceiros, uma vez que, este monitoramento pode reduzir significativamente o tempo de reparo dos veículos, contribuindo diretamente para a redução de seus custos. A decisão pela compra através de fornecedores locais ou interestaduais tem total impacto no tempo de entrega da peça e seu custo de comercialização. O fornecimento de peça é um processo que apresenta diversos gap´s em sua cadeia de suprimentos. Diversos destes problemas ocorrem durante a compra de peças automotivas, desde a sua localização para aquisição até a logística de entrega, problemas estes que acabam por impactar no tempo de reparação veicular. Algumas montadoras de veículos que possuem operação nacional não possuem uma forma proativa de gestão desta cadeia de suprimentos, e desconhecem por muitas vezes os impactos negativos que isto traz ao atendimento ao cliente e imagem da marca. O trabalho retrata a importância da gestão da cadeia produtiva de compra e distribuição de peças e o impacto no processo de reparação veicular.  O objetivo do trabalho é avaliar a correlação entre as deficiências no processo de logística e compra de peças com o tempo de permanência do veículo na oficina. No primeiro artigo, realizou-se a investigação das formas de gestão da cadeia produtiva de compra e distribuição de auto-peças, além de propor uma forma de gestão que vise a redução no tempo de entrega da peça. No segundo artigo, realizou-se a investigação das formas de logística e os impactos no tempo de entrega de peças quando a compra do produto é feita de forma interestadual. &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The tasks of the work consist in a review of European experience in this field, analysis of the relevant Ukrainian legislation, and determining directions for its improvement. The methods of research include the study of literary, statistical and other data, analysis of regulatory acts. It is shown that lately there have been stable negative trends in the district heating (DH) sector of Ukraine, while the state policy in this area is now uncertain. At present, in the country there are virtually no national and regional strategic documents that contribute to the long-term planning of district heating. The working Concept of implementation of the state policy in the field of heat supply has a number of shortcomings and cannot be a sufficient basis for the implementation of planning at the national level. City heat supply schemes, which are the only regional-level document in the field of heat supply, are not binding for realization and do not take into account the targets of relevant national-level documents. Normative legal acts of Ukraine that regulate relations in the field of heat supply, require considerable revision and introduction of the norms that establish the procedure for the implementation of long-term planning in the DH sector. It is advisable to keep district heating in Ukraine and develop efficient DH systems with the aim to provide the population of the country with reliable and high-quality heat supply. The first steps in this direction should include the development of the Heat Supply Strategy by 2035, implementation of the zoning principle while developing heat supply schemes and making the schemes mandatory for implementation. In addition, it is necessary to ensure the consistency of the target indicators included in the regional (city) heat supply schemes with the corresponding national targets.</jats:p>"

As part of United States refusal to supply law the courts developed the essential facilities doctrine. This requires the owner of a facility which is essential to rivals to provide access to that facility. Courts, in particular the United States Supreme Court, have cast doubt on the doctrine and cut back on liability for unilateral refusals to supply. Conversely New Zealand (and Australian) courts have increased liability for refusals to supply. One case, Commerce Commission v Bay of Plenty Electricity Ltd suggested New Zealand has its own essential facilities doctrine. This article discusses and analyses refusals to supply both legally and economically. It compares United States and Australasian law and shows how New Zealand law is tougher on refusals to supply. It argues that New Zealand has its own version of the essential facilities doctrine – albeit for different reasons than the Bay of Plenty Electricity Court suggested. It shows that sound reasons justify this stance.</jats:p>"

The objects of research were natural geothermal water. In this paper, the fitness of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method for iodine determination in water with higher temperatures was tested and selected methodological problems were discussed. Basic method parameters (precision, accuracy, linearity, uncertainty) were determined. Calculated statistical parameters of the validated method fulfil the assumed criteria. The received results (correlation coefficient equal to 0.999) show that the linearity of the ICP-MS method is good. The accuracy was expressed as recovery (R) and according to the literature is at an acceptable level. The results of precision assessments (RSD) also correspond to the literature data.</jats:p>",

Data were obtained from secondary sources. Descriptive statistics and generalized method of moment (GMM) were used. Nigeria’s self-food supply was slightly above 50% while the rest of the consumption depended on importation. The welfare measure to farmers was relatively poor and not good enough to motivate them. There was a positive and significant relationship between export and agricultural protection. A significant and positive relationship also exists between farmer-welfare and protection in the sector.</jats:p>"

Many organizations in Malaysia such as AACE Technologies Sdn.

This study introduces a wudhu system that can reduce the amount of water usage during wudhu ritual consistently by limiting around 1 litre per consumer. Generally, there were seven (7) parts that have been used in this project such as 1 litre of container, magnet, float, valve push button, washer and cap. These designs did not utilize any electronic devices. Using these parts, 2 experiments were conducted namely the current wudhu system and the upgraded wudhu system by 10 (Muslims) respectively. The result of this project confirmed that using the Upgraded Wudhu System with amount of water limited to 1 litre per consumer was better than the current wudhu system by ten times.  </jats:p>"

Information was obtained on the parameters of fuel cycle, design and materials of reactor cores, thermodynamic characteristics of coolants of the primary cooling circuit for reactor facilities of different types. Mathematical models of fuel cycles of the cores of reactors of ABV, KLT-40S, RITM-200M, UNITERM, SVBR-10 and SVBR-100 types were developed.

Parental origin effects are mediated by education, but endogamy curtails economic activity regardless of educational attainment. The findings are robust for married women. Findings for women in cohabiting unions are more heterogeneous, however: cohabitation appears to mute some of the relationship between parental origin culture and women’s economic behavior. In particular, the negative relationship between endogamy and women’s labor supply does not hold for women in cohabiting unions.</jats:p>",

Data were obtained from secondary sources. Descriptive statistics and generalized method of moment (GMM) were used. Nigeria’s self-food supply was slightly above 50% while the rest of the consumption depended on importation. The welfare measure to farmers was relatively poor and not good enough to motivate them. There was a positive and significant relationship between export and agricultural protection.

Austria is a mountainous and highly developed central Western European country with a landscaping dominated by Alps and forests. The forest area is nearly half (48%) of the full total section of the country which percentage is growing (Fachzeitschrift LÃ¤ndlicher Raum, Austrian government). Small level family still dominates the range, although the importance of the primary sector is declining, it is relevant to the management of the landscaping and the ecosystem. In Austria, almost all the farms are family held however in the context of the paper, private farms are also considered irrespective of the house size and activities. In Austria, around 50% of the forest area belongs to private holdings. Holdings significantly less than 50 ha accounts for 32% (Fachzeitschrift LÃ¤ndlicher Raum, Austrian government), the task is to increase services when coping with private small-scale forestry. Whereas holdings bigger than 500 ha show a usage rate of 104.9% of the increment (Timber production), the utilization for holdings below 200 ha amounted to only 72% of the increment (Fachzeitschrift LÃ¤ndlicher Raum, Austrian government). Demographic and monetary improvements increase deforestation threatens the ecosystems routine. Hence, UN Sustainable Development Goal 15, goals 15.1 and 15.4, which list forest area as a percentage of total land area and the conservation of ecosystems are goals in forestry that play a s stringent role in Austria, especially in rural, mountainous areas.</jats:p>"

In this paper an optimization model for a wild biomass supply chain is presented. The model was developed to identify the optimal organization of the supply network that minimizes the cost of supplying the feedstock. It was applied to a case study on a B. aegyptiaca seed supply chain in Burkina Faso. Considering different means of transport and different pre-processing locations, the results show that in contexts such as Burkina Faso’s, the most efficient option for the supply of B. aegyptiaca seeds is using animal drawn carts to transport the biomass from the harvest sites to the collection points. Feedstock pre-processing should take place before transport and an improvement in pre-processing operations by mechanical de-hulling could help reduce the cost price of the seeds. The results also show that more than 35% of the cost price of B. aegyptiaca seed is accounted for by transport costs. Pre-processing, handling, and storage costs account for about 50% of the cost of the seeds.</jats:p>"

In today’s dynamic and uncertain business environment, all firms in the supply network aims to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The findings show that CPs play a moderating effect on the relationship between innovation and SSN. Whenever government authorities and institutions pressurize firms for minimizing pollution levels, we see a trend of increased innovations in the form of new product developments, usage of eco-friendly raw material and application of eco-friendly technology which ultimately minimizes the carbon footprint. Through such initiatives steel and engineering firms conform to the government norms and regulations. However, innovations are possible through collaboration with specialist suppliers and sub-suppliers by adopting a common standard across the supply network. Through this overall process of innovation, the focal firm and sub-suppliers linked in the network will benefit and ultimately achieve a competitive edge. Therefore, firms can experience multiple benefits in terms of lower development costs, lower project cycle completion time, improvement in design for re-manufacturability, low downtime, low supply risks, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, sustainable development.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The study is unique from dual perspective – both in terms of scope and contribution to supply chain management literature.

Unpacking what supply chain initiatives exist in scholarly publications is relevant since scholarly ideas often shape institutional and policy directions and negotiations in the agricultural sector interventions. Using subjective criteria, sourcing, screening and selection of documents, and conducting qualitative analysis and validation were done. In exploring this discourse, we observe the emergence of a variety of overarching initiatives – development of short food supply chains, supply chain partnership, and supply chain integration.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In steep headwater reaches, episodic mass movements can deliver large volumes\nof sediment to fluvial channels. If these inputs of sediment occur with a\nhigh frequency and magnitude, the capacity of the stream to rework the\nsupplied material can be exceeded for a significant amount of time. To study\nthe equilibrium conditions in a channel following different episodic sediment\nsupply regimes (defined by grain size distribution, frequency, and magnitude\nof events), we simulate sediment transport through an idealized reach with\nour numerical 1-D model “BESMo” (Bedload Scenario Model). The model\nperforms well in replicating flume experiments of a similar scope (where\nsediment was fed constantly, in one, two, or four pulses) and allowed the\nexploration of alternative event sequences. We show that in these\nexperiments, the order of events is not important in the long term, as the\nchannel quickly recovers even from high magnitude events. In longer\nequilibrium simulations, we imposed different supply regimes on a channel,\nwhich after some time leads to an adjustment of slope, grain size, and\nsediment transport that is in equilibrium with the respective forcing\nconditions. We observe two modes of channel adjustment to episodic sediment\nsupply. (1) High-frequency supply regimes lead to equilibrium slopes and\narmouring ratios that are like conditions in constant-feed simulations. In\nthese cases, the period between pulses is shorter than a “fluvial evacuation\ntime”, which we approximate as the time it takes to export a pulse of\nsediment under average transport conditions. (2) In low-frequency regimes the\npulse period (i.e., recurrence interval) exceeds the “fluvial evacuation\ntime”, leading to higher armouring ratios due to the longer exposure of the\nbed surface to flow. If the grain size distribution of the bed is fine and\narmouring weak, the model predicts a decrease in the average channel slope.\nThe ratio between the “fluvial evacuation time” and the pulse period\nconstitutes a threshold that can help to quantify how a system responds to\nepisodic disturbances.\n                    </jats:p>"

Consumers is only away from its requirements by just a click and the goods will be delivered at his door steps. What can be more beneficial than saving time and money without wandering in the market in search of a right product in reasonable price. In todayâ€™s world digital marketing has totally changed the buying behaviour pattern of the consumers. Now-a-days consumers donâ€™t want to go physically to purchase the products. They just purchase the products through one click on their laptop or mobile. Same things is happening in perishable goods (fruits and vegetables). Now in India mostly in metropolitan citites people purchase fruits and vegetables by using e-commerce websites. Digital marketing has changed the buying behaviour pattern of the consumers. In present era if urban consumers wants to purchase fruits and vegetables they use search engine and search for the best deal. Digital marketing play an important role over there. The e-commerce companies of perishable goods (fruits and vegetables) compete to each for best search engine optimization result. Every company want to display its website on the top of the first page of google, bing and yahoo search engine. The supply chain management also play an important role for these e-commerce companies. The supply chain management should be based on least possible time to deliver the products to the ultimate customers. Consumers want products as soon as possible. This is the main reason that there is a very high competetion among the service providers. This research papers is based on interconnection among the digital marketing and supply chain management of e-commerce companies (fruits and vegetables). Digital marketing helps the companies to bring the consumers on the portal of the company and supply chain management helps to satisfy the consumers because as the customer uses the online portal for a hazzel free and time saving process for which they are paying through their pocket. Therefore it is must to have an intergration among the digital marketing and supply chain management of e-commerce company for the perishable goods (fruits and vegetables).</jats:p>"

The main differences are related to the configuration of the resonant tank structure. In this paper, LCCT topology is proposed, while main aim is focused on the application of the modular architecture of power supply (MAPS) systems. Initially, principal analysis is given which describes basic features and components selection of LCCT resonant converter. After principal analysis, the application is oriented for above mentioned modular architecture of power supply, where more than one LCCT converter operated simultaneously is considered. The main asset within the presented system investigation is the proposal for the control strategy of the modular power supply system. Instead of the requirement on the most efficient operation within the whole operational power range of MAPS, the proposal for control strategy is given, while it is expected that each module of MAPS will be loaded evenly. The control strategy is based on the digital control, whereby sequential switching of the individual power stages is autonomous based on the information’s of the actual power load. Presented solution gives improvements of the parameters where extended range of input voltage, extended range of output power, flat characteristic of efficiency, and lower ripple current and/or voltage will be required.</jats:p>"

Several new contributing factors, such as costs related to material handling, raw material inventory and worker training have been included in the objective function and constraint equations to make the model more realistic.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimization of the autonomous wind-diesel plants composition and of their power for guaranteed energy supply, despite the long history of research, the diversity of approaches and methods, is an urgent problem. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the wind energy characteristics is proposed to shape an autonomous power system for a guaranteed power supply with predominance wind energy. The analysis was carried out on the basis of wind speed measurements in the south of the European part of Russia during 8 months at different heights with a discreteness of 10 minutes. As a result, we have obtained a sequence of average daily wind speeds and the sequences constructed by arbitrary variations in the distribution of average daily wind speeds in this interval. These sequences have been used to calculate energy balances in systems (wind turbines + diesel generator + consumer with constant and limited daily energy demand) and (wind turbines + diesel generator + consumer with constant and limited daily energy demand + energy storage). In order to maximize the use of wind energy, the wind turbine integrally for the period in question is assumed to produce the required amount of energy. For the generality of consideration, we have introduced the relative values of the required energy, relative energy produced by the wind turbine and the diesel generator and relative storage capacity by normalizing them to the swept area of the wind wheel. The paper shows the effect of the average wind speed over the period on the energy characteristics of the system (wind turbine + diesel generator + consumer). It was found that the wind turbine energy produced, wind turbine energy used by the consumer, fuel consumption, and fuel economy depend (close to cubic dependence) upon the specified average wind speed. It was found that, for the same system with a limited amount of required energy and high average wind speed over the period, the wind turbines with lower generator power and smaller wind wheel radius use wind energy more efficiently than the wind turbines with higher generator power and larger wind wheel radius at less average wind speed. For the system (wind turbine + diesel generator + energy storage + consumer) with increasing average speed for a given amount of energy required, which in general is covered by the energy production of wind turbines for the period, the maximum size capacity of the storage device decreases. With decreasing the energy storage capacity, the influence of the random nature of the change in wind speed decreases, and at some values of the relative capacity, it can be neglected.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The government subsidy, collection mode, and power structure not only bring about a big challenge for the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management but also affect both the customer and the environment. This paper considers a CLSC consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, where the manufacturer sells the new and remanufactured products through the retailer to the customer and he obtains a low carbon subsidy allocated by the government for each unit remanufactured product. Three different collection modes, viz., manufacturer collection, retailer collection, and dual collection, can be chosen from collecting the used products. In addition, three different power structures, i.e., Manufacturer Stackelberg, Vertical Nash, and Retailer Stackelberg, are considered in this paper. Based on the game theory approach, the optimal pricing and recycling policies of the CLSC members are derived under nine different scenarios. Then, we compare the derived results to explore the impacts of the low carbon subsidy, collection mode, and power structure on the CLSC from the perspectives of the customer, the environment, the manufacturer, and the retailer. It is shown that a high low carbon subsidy will lead to heightened market demand, improved environment performance, and increased members' profits. A balanced supply chain power relationship will benefit the customer and the environment, and in contrast, an imbalanced supply chain power relationship will benefit the manufacturer and the retailer. We derive the value range of the competing intensity for which it is beneficial to build dual collection channels based on these above perspectives.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the choice of using AM as a spare parts supply strategy over traditional inventory is a rising decision faced by manufacturers and requires quantitative analysis for their AM-or-stock decisions. The purpose of this paper is to develop a quantitative performance model for a generic powder bed fusion AM system in a spare parts supply chain, thus providing insights into this less-explored area in the literature.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>In this study, analysis based on a discrete event simulation was carried out for the use of AM in replacement of traditional warehouse inventory for an on-demand spare parts supply system.

Using this model, the impact of both spare parts demand characteristics (e.g. part size attributes, demand rates) and the AM operations characteristics (e.g. machine size and postpone strategy) on the performance of using AM to supply spare parts was studied.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The simulation results show that in many cases the AM operation is not as cost competitive compared to the traditional warehouse-based spare parts supply operation, and that the spare parts size characteristics could significantly affect the overall performance of the AM operations.

To do so, we exploit within‐individual variation in access to full‐time schools and a rotating panel of households that contains 12 years of individual‐level data on labor outcomes and sociodemographic characteristics. Results from long‐difference models show that extending the school day increases mothers' labor supply, increasing LFP by 5.5 percentage points and the number of weekly hours worked by 1.8. Moreover, these increases are accompanied by a raise in monthly earnings. (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> I25, J13, J22)</jats:p>",

For reason that the insulation of linear induction motor has enough margin, only small adjustment of motor is needed to adapt the doubled voltage.\r\nConclusion: To calculate the performance of low-speed maglev while using 3000 V DC, a T-model circuit of single-sided linear induction motor is built, and the result shows that the maximum running speed could be increased to over 160 km/h. This scheme provides a promising way for speed increasing, and it’s a simple and economical approach to enhance the competitiveness of low-speed maglev.</jats:p>"

Four different data set were comparatively analyzed from interviews with the Municipal Water Engineer (MWE), Ward Health Officer (WHO), 3 Mtaa leaders from 3 informal settlements, interviews with 43 informal water sellers from three informal settlements, including a survey of (n = 292) clients in three informal settlements. It was realized that though informal water suppliers are sociocultural capable of providing flexible and gender-sensitive water supply services, households have unsustainable access to improved water due to the financial, hydro-technical, institutional and organizational in capacities of the informal water sellers coupled with the low financial abilities of low-income earning households to continuously purchase water for domestic activities. It was observed that informal settlements&amp;rsquo; dwellers are less likely to meet their water supply needs in the near future if their income status together with the financial, hydro-technical, organizational and institutional capacities of the informal water sellers are not improved.</jats:p>"

As the focus of the research, domestic water supply is studied. Conventionally, villagers harvest rainwater into big reservoirs that later on were demolished for house renovation after the agricultural compensation for the coal plant construction. Since the establishment of the Thai Binh 1 Thermal plant, locals are recommended not to drink raining water because of potential negative impacts of coal ash on human health. Findings of the research indicate that local households have been provided with tap water service since 2014 by the Chieu River water plant of the local authority. However, doubts on the low tap water quality and its unstable frequency, rainwater returns to be the preferable choice for their domestic water supply. There is a regular check on water affirmed by the engineer from Chieu River plant. Nevertheless, for confidentiality, it was not allowed to publish regardless of the request to have evidence on qualified tap water. This is considered as the violation of the right to information and the participation in environmental decision making of the villagers. For certain disadvantages of water situation, local people have adaptation by buying reverse osmosis(RO)water filters(wealthier family only)and need to pay for water consumption expense with the low quality received. Study on domestic water is a study on human well-being, human rights and state obligation to ensure the water sanitation, the accessibility, and affordability to people. The role of the Vietnamese government is analyzed in addressing these potential impacts caused by the coal plant project towards an adequate standard of living and the highest attainable standard of health in Chi Thien. The thesis is social research using qualitative research methodology of in-depth interviews and referral samples to approach the topic and elicit reliable information, particularly on opinions and hands-on experiences of villagers.</jats:p>"

With the rise in wage volatility, our general equilibrium incomplete markets model generates a 2.7 hours increase in the hours differential whereas it increased by 1.4 hours in the data.

After a first round with the experts, a table that tried to capture the causal relationship among variables and their influence in Brazilian ocean freight was developed. In a second round of interviews, the final table was submitted to the judgment of the experts. Considering the experts’ opinion on the trade routes studied, it was noticed that the relationship between supply and demand with ocean freight is the variable that influences freight rates in Brazil’s trade the most. Other variables such as vessels capacity, operating costs and competitors are among the variables that experts have identified as those that most contribute in Brazilian ocean freight oscillation.</jats:p>"

(2) Is it beneficial if the focal firm represents a large portion of business for customers and suppliers? And, (3) is balanced portfolio dependence helpful to a focal firm? The extant literature, drawing insights from the logics of power and embeddedness, is divided on these questions. We utilize a secondary data set of focal firms (post‐IPO) and their portfolios of relationships with customers and suppliers to explain where each theoretical perspective applies to the management of supply chain portfolios.</jats:p>",

This trend has resulted in an intense debate on which services should be guaranteed and the equity and efficiency criteria that should be applied in their provision. The move to privatize the potable water supply in one of the main international tourist destinations—the Costa Brava (Spain)—can be included within this context. Our aim is to identify and characterize the main water governance systems on the Costa Brava in order to explore the different forms of water supply governance. To this end, an analysis has been carried out to explain the different interrelations between the expansion of tourism and the management of water supply infrastructures. The insufficient technical and financial resources of local and regional governments encourage the entry of private initiatives. In this process, we must also take into account the consolidation of a larger customer market linked to tourism development. Our main conclusion is that water governance models in coastal tourist destinations such as these are determined not only by territorial needs and the lack of technical capacity, but also by the emergence of business opportunities in the private sector.</jats:p>"

The findings indicate that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among sectoral natural gas demand, sectoral income and various fuel prices. The results also indicate that most price elasticities are smaller relative to developed countries; the effect of fuel prices on natural gas demand is partly offset by the government regulation. In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, China’s natural gas demand will reach 340 bcm and 528 bcm and its foreign dependence will reach 27.9% and 43.2% in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The forecast and discussion in this paper provide important insights into China’s energy policy design and pricing mechanism reform, and into the potential impact of China’s growing natural gas demand on global energy market dynamics. </jats:p>",

To implement the balance between power supply and demand by utilising demand‐side schedulable resources, a bi‐level system is established and a bi‐level programming between independent system operator (ISO) and load aggregator (LA) is proposed in this study. LA in the lower level integrates decentralised schedulable resources and makes bidding plans by adopting the improved step‐wise bidding method in view of its risk attitudes, realising the unification of low risk and high profit. ISO in the upper level introduces the chance‐constrained programming method to make risk–benefit coordinated decisions considering uncertainties on the basic of bidding information and power supply–demand prediction.

The present study aimed to explore the demand and supply side barriers that limit the uptake of nutrition services among pregnant women from the rural communities of the Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia. A community-based qualitative study was conducted in December through January 2017. A total of 90 key informant in-depth interviews and 14 focus group discussions were undertaken. Study participants were purposively selected for specific characteristics, along with health professionals deployed at various levels of the health system, including health posts, health centers, woreda health offices, and the regional health bureau. Study participants were asked to identify the barriers and implementation challenges that limit access to nutrition services for pregnant women. Participants’ responses were transcribed verbatim, without editing the grammar, to avoid losing meaning. The data were imported to ATLAS.ti 7 (qualitative data analysis software) for coding and analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. The study findings indicated that the dietary quality of pregnant women in the study area remains poor and in some cases, poorer quality than pre-pregnancy. Across study sites, heavy workloads, food taboos and avoidances, low husband support, lack of economic resources, lack of awareness, low educational level of women, poor dietary habits, increased expenditure for cultural and religious festivities, “dependency syndrome”, low physical access to health facilities, poorly equipped health facilities, focus on child health and nutrition, poor coordination among nutrition specific and sensitive sectors, and limited sources of nutrition information were identified as the demand and supply side barriers limiting the uptake of nutrition services during pregnancy. In conclusion, the community would benefit from improved social behavior change communication on nutrition during pregnancy and multi-sectoral coordination among nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive sectors.</jats:p>"

Accommodation‐dominated sequences are problematic to define rigorously, but are commonly interpreted from outcrop and subsurface data. In contrast, supply‐dominated sequences are much less commonly identified. We employ numerical stratigraphic forward modelling to compare stratal geometries forced by cyclic changes in relative sea level with stratal geometries forced by sediment discharge and water discharge changes. Our quantitative results suggest that both relative sea‐level oscillations and variations in sediment/water discharge ratio are able to form sequence‐bounding unconformities independently, confirming previous qualitative sequences definitions. In some of the experiments, the two types of sequence share several characteristics, such as an absence of coastal‐plain topset deposits and stratal offlap, something typically interpreted as the result of falling relative sea level. However, the stratal geometries differ when variations in amplitude and frequency of relative sea‐level change, sediment/water discharge ratio, transport diffusion coefficient and initial bathymetry are applied. We propose that the supply‐dominated sequences could be recognised in outcrop or in the subsurface if the observations of stratal offlap and the absence of coastal‐plain topset can be made without any strong evidence of relative sea‐level fall (e.g. descending shoreline trajectory). These quantitative results suggest that both supply‐dominated and accommodation‐dominated sequences are likely to occur in the ancient record, as a consequence of multiple, possibly complex, controls.</jats:p>",

Thus, South Korea electricity authorities demand information about the value of improved power supply reliability for the manufacturing sector to implement them in planning electricity supply. This article aims to measure the value using a specific case of South Korean manufacturing firms. The choice experiment (CE) approach is adopted for this purpose. A nationwide CE survey of 1148 manufacturing firms was undertaken. The firms revealed statistically significant willingness to pay for a decrease in the duration of interruption, avoiding interruption during daytime (9 a.m. to 6 p.m.) rather than off-daytime (6 p.m. to 9 a.m.), and preventing interruption during weekdays rather than weekend. For example, they accepted a 0.02% increase in the electricity bill for reducing one minute of interruption during electricity outage, a 2.98% increase in the electricity bill to avoid interruption during the daytime rather than off-daytime, and a 1.60% increase in electricity bill for preventing interruption during weekdays rather than weekends. However, they put no importance on the season of interruption. These results can be useful for policy-making and decision-making regarding improving electricity supply reliability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most communities are structured not by a single process but by some combination of top–down, bottom–up and supply–side (i.e. juvenile recruitment) factors. However, establishing how multiple processes interact remains a fundamental challenge. For example, the recruitment, growth, and mortality of estuarine species can vary along the steep and numerous environmental and biological gradients typical of these habitats, but the relative importance of those gradients is generally unknown. We took a novel approach to this question by coupling long‐term field observations of the Olympia oyster <jats:italic>Ostrea lurida</jats:italic> in a central California estuary with a state–space integral projection model. This approach revealed that the most parsimonious description of oyster population dynamics involved spatial variation in growth and adult mortality – but not juvenile mortality – as well as spatiotemporal variation in recruitment. These patterns match the available short‐term estimates of each of those processes from field studies, and reveal a synthetic view of oyster population dynamics. Larval recruitment has an interannual ‘boom and bust’ pattern, and during good recruitment years most larvae settle in the inner bay where water residence time is highest. Adult oyster mortality is also highest in the inner bay, where several invasive predators are abundant and lowest in the mid‐bay, where oyster growth is greatest (due to bottom–up factors), likely leading to a size refuge from native predators. Surprisingly, juvenile mortality was constant across the bay, possibly because of a lack of size refuge from native and invasive predators. Our research approach represents an important advance in disentangling the contributions of spatio–temporal variation in top–down, bottom–up and supply–side forces to the dynamics of populations with open recruitment.</jats:p>",

The study is based on some simulation work which is done by the software tool developed in the research work in “The 11th Five-year plan” of China.\r\nResults: The calculation results indicate that, from the point of view of top speed, that say 200 km/h, the structure of the new concept could meet the requirement of the medium speed system, but further studies are demanded for the engineering application.\r\nConclusion: The advantage of this structure is to reduce the demand for the capacity of the inverters and eliminate the requirements for the cable lines and the stator switches. However, the disadvantage is also explicit. The structure is more complex than its high speed peer, and thus need more complex control strategies. And the structure is more fixed and thus maybe need more invest at the beginning of an engineering project.</jats:p>"

Exploring\nsusceptibility of PWSS to such perturbations requires detailed knowledge of\nsupply system structure and operation. The physical structure of the\ndistribution system (i.e., pipeline connections) and basic information on\nsources are documented for most industrialized metropolises. Yet, most\ninformation on PWSS function comes from hydrodynamic models that are seldom\nvalidated using observational data. In developing regions, the issue may be\nexasperated as information regarding the physical structure of the PWSS may\nbe incorrect, incomplete, undocumented, or difficult to obtain in many\ncities. Here, we present a novel application of stable isotopes in water\n(SIW) to quantify the contribution of different water sources, identify\nstatic and dynamic regions (e.g., regions supplied chiefly by one\nsource vs. those experiencing active mixing between multiple sources), and\nreconstruct basic flow patterns in a large and complex PWSS. Our analysis,\nbased on a Bayesian mixing model framework, uses basic information on the SIW\nand production volumes of sources but requires no information on pipeline\nconnections in the system. Our work highlights the ability of stable isotopes\nin water to analyze PWSS and document aspects of supply system structure and\noperation that can otherwise be challenging to observe. This method could\nallow water managers to document spatiotemporal variation in flow patterns\nwithin PWSS, validate hydrodynamic model results, track pathways of\ncontaminant propagation, optimize water supply operation, and help monitor\nand enforce water rights.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Drinking water supply and sewerage system designing and reconstruction projects are being extensively conducted in Azerbaijan Republic. During implementation of such projects, collecting large amount of information about the area and detailed investigations are crucial. Joint use of the aerospace monitoring and GIS play an essential role for the studies of the impact of environmental factors, development of the analytical information systems and others, while achieving the reliable performance of the existing and designed major water supply pipelines, as well as construction and exploitation of the technical installations. With our participation the GIS has been created in “Azersu” OJSC that includes systematic database of the drinking water supply and sewerage system, and rain water networks to carry out necessary geo information analysis. The system software was developed based on “Microstation” platform, which identifies the coordinate system and cartographic projection along with the geo-referencing through direct connection to Google Earth platform. Should be mentioned that, in the country, specifically in large cities (i.e. Baku, Ganja, Sumqait, etc.,) drinking water supply pipelines cross regions with different physico-geographical conditions, geo-morphological compositions and seismotectonics. Therefore, constant control of the plan-height positioning, geodetic measurements for the detailed examination of the dynamics, repetition of the geodetic measurements for certain time intervals, or in other words regular monitoring is very important. During geodetic monitoring using the GIS has special significance. Given that, collecting geodetic monitoring measurements of the main pipelines on the same coordinate system and processing these data on a single GIS system allows the implementation of overall assessment of plan-height state of major pipes.\n                    </jats:p>"

Methods  Three sampling stations were stablished in each reservoir. Samples of water and periphyton were collected during the dry (August 2013) and the rainy periods (January 2014), while the sediment was sampled only during the dry period. Water abiotic limnological variables were determined and quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed after the oxidation of diatom samples.  Results  Both reservoirs presented low values of electrical conductivity, pH and nutrients. The diatom community was represented by 30 taxa distributed in 20 genera. The diatom diversity was higher in the plankton, with three exclusive species. All taxa collected from the surface sediments also occurred in the plankton. The periphyton was represented by six taxa that were exclusive to this habitat.  Conclusion  Our results indicated that the environmental variables were responsible for the limnological changes in the two reservoirs. In the studied reservoirs, the species composition of diatoms differed slightly between the plankton and the surface sediments, while we found a different community in the periphyton, with the presence of exclusive species. The two climatic periods showed differences in the abundance of species, but no considerable differences in the species composition between the two reservoirs were observed.</jats:p>"

However, microbial nitrogen transformation dynamics in urban rivers with different dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions are still unclear. This study investigated the effects of DO concentration changes (anaerobic to aerobic) in overlying water on nitrogen-cycling gene abundance in incubation conditions using sediment from a typical urban river in the Yangtze River Delta. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results revealed that the abundances of the nitrification gene amoA, denitrification gene nirS/K, norB, nosZ, and anammox gene hzo increased by one to two orders of magnitude from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) predominated the ammonium oxidation microbial populations, about tenfold more than the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) populations. Significant correlations were found among the abundances of AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirS, nirK, and hzo genes, implying a close coupling of aerobic ammonium oxidation (AAO), denitrification, and anammox processes at the molecular level. Moreover, the nitrogen transformation rates were calculated using a box model linking the measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen species. The contribution of anammox to N2 production was 85% under saturated treatment, and the AAO rate was significantly positive correlated to the anammox rate. Our results suggested that coupled AAO and anammox might be the dominant pathway for reactive nitrogen removal in urban rivers with elevated DO levels.</jats:p>",

It also has direct impacts to supply chain itself, so it required to recognize the supply chain performance position. The objectives of this research were to evaluate performance, added value, and develop sustainability improvement strategies to increase performance of palm oil supply chain at X Co. Palm oil supply chain’s performance measurement was obtained by SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) approach. It showed the performance level of plantation was above average (91.24%) and manufacture was at average (86.19%). Added value ratio was measured by using modified Hayami method. It showedthat the added valued of plantation and manufacture were 21.86% and 37.55% respectively. ANP (Analytical Network Process) method with BOCR (benefit, opportunity, cost, and risk) analysis was used in selecting sustainability improvement strategies to increase performance of palm oil supply chain, the weighting results showed that production plan’s improvement was the highest.</jats:p>",

It can improve the performance of a battery bank by creating new batteries that allow for greater storage or by developing a management energy system. This article shows the development of a power supply management system based on fuzzy logic for an electric vehicle, in order to minimize the total energy consumption and optimize the battery bank. The experimental result is shown using the fuzzy controller under standard operating conditions. An increase in battery performance and overall performance of energy consumption is shown. Speed signals acquired show improvements in some dynamic, such as overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error parameters.

The tables were compiled for the Czech Republic for 2014. The compilation procedure followed was described in detail so that it can serve as a source of inspiration and a benchmark for other researchers and/or statisticians. The major shortcoming of the PSUTs is that not all needed data were readily available in physical units and required estimations based on proxies. Some parts of the tables are therefore burdened with a degree of uncertainty. In order to address the price inhomogeneity of sectoral prices for commodity outputs, imports, and exports, which tends to be typical for monetary supply and use tables (MSUTs), the PSUTs and MSUTs were further used for the calculation of raw material equivalents of import, exports, and raw material input (RMI) and raw material consumption (RMC) indicators. A comparison of results showed that the total indicators do not differ that much: the largest difference of 5% was recorded for raw material equivalents of exports, while RMC, for instance, remained nearly the same. However, we still argue for the use of PSUTs for the calculation of raw material equivalents, as changes in total volume of the indicators were accompanied with changes in their material structure. This can have significant consequences for the assessment of environmental impacts related to material consumption, as environmental impacts are very material specific.</jats:p>",

Physicochemical and bacteriological analysis of water samples were carried out using standard methods, an antibiotic susceptibility test was investigated using the standard disc diffusion method and plasmid analysis of MAR isolates was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The physicochemical parameters analyzed were within WHO recommendations except for pH and potassium while the water samples did not conform to the WHO bacteriological recommendations for drinking water. A total of 272 E. coli were isolated and identified, among which 150 isolates were non-sorbitol fermenters (NSF) and taken as presumptive E. coli O157. MAR to three and more classes of antibiotics used were observed among these NSF with high MAR-Index, &amp;gt;0.2. Plasmid analysis of selected 15 isolates among the MAR NSF showed that their resistance to antibiotics was likely plasmid-mediated as they carry one to two plasmids on them. The study revealed that the water samples from Ado-Ekiti metropolis are unsafe for consumption.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to propose a comprehensive model of supply chain risk management (SCRM) in the product life cycle (PLC) and the operational process cycle (OPC). To decrease the risks in a fuzzy environment, the model considers the organizational performance factors (OPF) and the risk operational practices (ROP).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weights of the relationships between the PLC, OPC and OPF in the hierarchical structure of the decision problem. In addition, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is employed to recognize the priority of ROPs in dealing with the performance factors.

The construction of a low-carbon economy city gathering supply chain is one of the main ways to reduce greenhouse gases. This paper uses the concept of carbon footprint, takes a certain urban agglomeration as the research object, and applies the greenhouse gas emission of energy petrochemical product structure into consideration according to the principles of economic, social and environmental sustainable development, together with constructing the LCA-SEM supply chain optimization model. Taking the minimum net carbon emission of energy and petrochemical product structure in low-carbon economy urban agglomeration area as the optimization goal, combined with the optimization index analysis of energy and petrochemical product structure index system, the research conclusions show that the low-carbon supply chain plays a key role in the environment in terms of five supply chain links: energy petrochemical raw material production, energy and petrochemical raw material transportation, energy and petrochemical production, energy and petrochemical product storage, as well as energy petrochemical transportation. The list of environmental burdens À(X) on the contribution of greenhouse gases to global warming optimization model shows that the urban agglomeration area and the “core area” energy consumption carbon sink area bears a significantly positive correlation with both of the regional carbon intensity and energy intensity of different energy land.</jats:p>",

Sustainability requirements for ship investment lead to the complexity of influence factors and the decision making process. The uncertain linguistic assessment features a large amount of ambiguity and subjectivity, while the scoring evaluation features high precision and distinct gradations. This paper constructs a criteria system in the green supply chain and proposes a dual group decision fusing mechanism for integrating the linguistic variable and scoring evaluation into a unified evaluation term. A hierarchical cloud of linguistic variable terms is constructed based on scoring via a reverse cloud generator, and then, the ship investment linguistic terms are transformed into prospect values. In addition, the consistency and investment selection performance are measured after aggregating the individual decision matrices for group decision making. The empirical research results on the selection of dry bulk carriers for investment show that dual group decision fusing mechanisms could effectively improve the consistency, decision making efficiency, and accuracy of dry bulk ship investment choices and reduce the cost of feedback adjustment for group decisions. In comparison with the trapezoidal fuzzy and fuzzy TOPSIS methods of group decision making, the proposed method performs better when there are a large number of alternatives.</jats:p>"

Data were obtained from secondary sources. Descriptive statistics and generalized method of moment (GMM) were used. Nigeria’s self-food supply was slightly above 50% while the rest of the consumption depended on importation. The welfare measure to farmers was relatively poor and not good enough to motivate them. There was a positive and significant relationship between export and agricultural protection.

These comprise proteins, phospholipids and carbohydrates, alone or in combination, and play roles in optimising food appearance, texture and mouthfeel, delivering or disguising flavours and achieving palatable low‐fat foods. Their presence in the food supply is common, but not “ubiquitous” as frequently stated. Strict regulations limit the amount added to foods, but the lack of established methodologies to measure the actual food content of these diverse compounds limits our knowledge of consumption. Emulsifiers and thickeners have effects on the gut microbiota, mucosal barrier and inflammatory pathways, and can induce disease in experimental models. However, differentiating pharmacological from physiological effects and translating findings in experimental animals to humans raise uncertainties about the relevance of such effects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>There is limited evidence to directly link emulsifiers and thickeners to human disease, but multiple potential pathogenic mechanisms.

We study the consequences of one of the largest supply disruptions to date to abusable opioids—the introduction of an abuse-deterrent version of OxyContin in 2010. Supply-side interventions that limit access to opioids may have the unintended consequence of increasing use of substitute drugs, including heroin. Exploiting cross-state variation in OxyContin exposure, we find that states with the highest initial rates of OxyContin misuse experienced the largest increases in heroin deaths. Our results imply that the recent heroin epidemic is largely due to the reformulation of OxyContin. (JEL I12, I18) </jats:p>",

The temporary decomposition of the tasks of management of electric networks of railways and the methodology of the organization of intelligent electric power traction networks are proposed. The methods for registering primary information monitoring parameters of normal and emergency modes of electric networks based on the use of mathematical tools of differential transformations and the presentation of data in the form of T-spectra are developed. On the basis of the system-wide principle of a single information space and the results of experimental studies, the architecture of the computer environment is studied, which reflects the range of possibilities for intellectualizing the traction network based on the characteristics of electricity supply to railways, taking into account restrictions and specificity of consumption. And at its base, modern computer-intelligent technologies have been created for managing energy saving in the process of power supply to railways at the level of traction substations, power supply distances and the upper level of the railway as a whole. The possibilities of the proposed structure of the intellectual traction electric network of Ukrzaliznytsia developed as a result of the mutual integration of the topology of the traction network of power supply and architecture of the computer environment, which is the infrastructure for managing power supply for railway transport, as well as the possibility of integrating real-time monitoring, state, optimization of consumption and management of energy saving in the process during the maintenance of electricity for traction at all levels of management of the railway in market conditions</jats:p>",

The results show that the type of employment available in non‐MAs is more conducive to employment tenure. During the study period, married female graduates attained longer employment in full‐time specialized and technical jobs, such as teaching, in non‐MAs. In MAs, a larger proportion of married female graduates worked in clerical jobs, sales, or in specialized and technical jobs (e.g. doctors or uncategorized jobs), which have lower job continuity than teaching jobs. This study concludes, therefore, that employment composition is at least one of the determinants of the lower employment rate of married female graduates in MAs.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Governments and enterprises should assume the social responsibility to conserve the environment. Under the background of carbon emission constraint, this article investigates the optimal decisions of closed-loop supply chains in the context of social responsibility, explores the impacts of constraints of carbon emissions and corporate social responsibility on recycling and remanufacturing decisions, and introduces the model of maximizing social welfare for further comparison and analysis. The results show that the coefficient of remanufacturing and emission reduction and the coefficient of government reward and punishment are inversely proportional to recycling rates and the total carbon emissions. Governments should formulate rational carbon emission caps for enterprises with different coefficients of remanufacturing and emission reduction. Additionally, corporate social responsibility has a positive effect on recycling rates, and a rise in its strength can lead to a fall in carbon emissions per unit product. In terms of product recycling and profit sources, the model of maximizing social welfare is superior to that of maximizing the manufacturer’s total profits, which provides new managerial insights for decision-makers.</jats:p>"

This article investigates the economic perspective, by calculating and comparing the energy system life cycle cost (LCC) for the two solutions in areas with detached houses. The LCC is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation, where all input data is varied according to predefined probability distributions. In addition to the parameter variations, 16 different scenarios are evaluated regarding the main fuel for the DH, the percentage of combined heat and power (CHP), the DH temperature level, and the type of electrical backup power. Although HP is the case with the lowest LCC for most of the scenarios, there are alternatives for each scenario in which either HP or DH has the lowest LCC. In alternative scenarios with additional electricity transmission costs, and a marginal cost perspective regarding the CHP investment, DH has the lowest LCC overall, taking into account all scenarios. The study concludes that the decision based on energy system economy on whether DH should expand into areas with detached houses must take local conditions into consideration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wind power belongs to sustainable and clean energy sources which play a vital role of reducing environment pollution and addressing energy crisis. However, wind power outputs are quite difficult to predict because they are derived from wind speeds, which vary irregularly and greatly all the time. The uncertainty of wind power causes variation of the variables of power grids, which threatens the power grids’ operating security. Therefore, it is significant to provide the accurate ranges of power grids’ variables, which can be used by the operators to guarantee the power grid’s operating security. To achieve this goal, the present paper puts forward the interval power flow with wind farms model, where the generation power outputs of wind farms are expressed by intervals and three types of control modes are considered for imitating the operation features of wind farms. To solve the proposed model, the affine arithmetic-based method and optimizing-scenarios method are modified and employed, where three types of constraints of wind control modes are considered in their solution process. The former expresses the interval variables as affine arithmetic forms, and constructs optimization models to contract the affine arithmetic forms to obtain the accurate intervals of power flow variables. The latter regards active power outputs of the wind farms as variables, which vary in their corresponding intervals, and accordingly builds the minimum and maximum programming models for estimating the intervals of the power flow variables. The proposed methods are applied to two case studies, where the acquired results are compared with those acquired by the Monte Carlo simulation, which is a traditional method for handling interval uncertainty. The simulation results validate the advantages, effectiveness and the applicability of the two methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Efficient and reliable power supply has been considered as the fundamentality of applying monitoring equipment overhead high‐voltage power line (HVPL). Several kinds of energy harvesting devices are investigated and compared. A new power supply scheme, which integrates the online energy harvesting device and the wireless power transfer (WPT) system, is presented. Optimisation design of online energy harvesting device is analysed emphatically by taking both HVPL insulation distance and wireless power supply efficiency into account. For further increasing the harvested energy from power lines, this study discusses the design of specific device structure and the accurate calculation of maximum output power. It is found that essential parameters and exciting current angle contribute to more extracting energy. Meanwhile, in order to expand the transmitting distance with high efficiency, the WPT system with double relay coils is selected. The charging threshold voltage of the load can be further optimised under different transmitting distances by adopting an AC–DC voltage‐doubling rectifier circuit. Simulation and experimental studies show that when the transmitting distance is &gt;1 m, the monitoring equipment can also be charged in a reliable way, which also verifies the correctness and feasibility of the system.</jats:p>",

Our analysis shows that rural Western China has a more severe problem of “ceaseless toil” compared to the rest of the country. We find that NRPS improves the “ceaseless toil” situation of the Chinese rural elderly especially in Western China.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: It has been estimated that 100million Nigerians still lack basic sanitation facilities and 63 million also do not have access to portable drinking water and as many as 80% of all diseases worldwide are related to unsafe water as well as poor environmental hygiene. Most infectious, diseases are caused by living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasitic worms, and a disease is transmitted by the passing of these organisms from one person's body to another or through intermediate hosts. The World Bank reports that 30% of the total disease burden in developing countries results from contamination at the household level and that 75% of life years lost within this 30% are due to lack of good water supply and sanitation and the prevalence of risky hygiene behaviour. This study aimed to assess the sources of water supply, sanitation facilities and hygiene practices in oil producing communities in Central Senatorial District of Bayelsa State.  Materials and method: The study designs adopted for this research work were quantitative analysis and descriptive research method. The study population covered all housing units in the randomly selected communities in the central senatorial district of Bayelsa state. The 400 sample size for housing units was determined using the Taro Yamane formula, and systematic sampling method was used with a sampling interval of three. A 26-item administered closed-ended structured questionnaire was used. Data was collected from 296 out of 400 questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics with frequency counts and simple percentages using SPSS.  Results: The result identified multiple sources of water supply which includes rain, river/stream, pipe borne, borehole and hand-dug well with borehole being the major source (91%). The major toilet facility used was the flush toilet (45%) and majority of residents clean their toilet once weekly (60%), however, about half of the residents (51%) practice unsafe excreta disposal. Hygiene practices such as bathing occurred among all resident at least once daily and hand washing was frequent after toilet visit (73%) but not before eating (35%).  Conclusion: Water supply was seen to be relatively adequate, but its quality was poor, necessitating treatment. Unsafe excreta disposal is still widely practiced. Critical hand washing practice was still poor amongst residents. The State and Local Government including Oil companies in oil producing communities in Central Senatorial District should provide adequate portable water and sanitation facilities in public places with hygiene enlightenment campaign.</jats:p>"

The overarching aim is to derive institutional and policy lessons for the agribusiness sector, especially among the least developed economies. The focus is to better understand the range of supply chain initiatives prevalent in literature and how they fit into the developing nations contexts. Unpacking what supply chain initiatives exist in scholarly publications is relevant since scholarly ideas often shape institutional and policy directions and negotiations in the agricultural sector interventions. Using subjective criteria, sourcing, screening and selection of documents, and conducting qualitative analysis and validation were done. In exploring this discourse, we observe the emergence of a variety of overarching initiatives – development of short food supply chains, supply chain partnership, and supply chain integration. Findings from the study suggest that there is a need for some level of coordination of processes and activities within and between agribusiness firms in the supply chain, in order to build a stronger agribusiness subsector.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a two-year field trial, the effect of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilization was investigated on grain yield, grain quality parameters, formation of acrylamide (AA), and the precursor free asparagine (Asn) in organically and conventionally produced winter wheat cultivars. In both production systems, different types, amounts, and temporal distributions of N were tested. The the effect of S fertilizer types and amounts on free Asn was only tested in the conventional farming system. Within both cropping systems, grain yield and baking quality were significantly influenced by N treatment while the effect on free Asn was only minor. Especially within the organic farming system, increasing N fertilization levels did not increase free Asn significantly. A slight trend of increasing free Asn levels with an intensified N supply was observed, especially in the presence of crude protein contents of 14% or higher. However, only N amounts of 180 kg N ha−1 or higher increased the probability of high free Asn contents considerably, while N supply below that amount led to free Asn values similar to the unfertilized controls. The results indicated that good baking quality can be achieved without significantly increasing free Asn levels. In addition, cultivars affected the levels of free Asn significantly. Compared to cv. Bussard and Naturastar, cv. Capo exhibited the lowest AA formation potential at an N supply of 180 kg N ha−1 while simultaneously reaching a crude protein content &gt; 15% (conventional) and &gt; 12% (organic). Thus, it seems that cultivars differ in their ability to store and incorporate free Asn into proteins. Over all trials, a relation of free Asn and AA was shown by R2 = 0.77, while a relation of free Asn and protein was only R2 = 0.36. Thus, lowering free Asn by adjusting N treatments should not necessarily affect baking quality. S fertilization within conventional farming did not change the free Asn amount or crude protein significantly, probably due to the fact that soil was not sulfate-deficient. In summary, it was evident that free Asn amounts in wheat varied widely both within cultivars and between cropping systems. In order to clearly unravel genotypic differences and their interaction with environmental factors and especially N fertilization, further research is needed.</jats:p>"

Additionally, we examine an incentive mechanism based on governmental subsidies to eliminate free riding and motivate co-investment. Furthermore, a case study and numerical examples are provided for illustration and simulation purposes, leading to several countermeasures and suggestions. Our analytical results show that the strategic choice of low carbon investment is correlated with profit growth coefficients, investment costs and profits from free riding. Investment costs have more significant impacts than other factors on evolutionarily stable strategies, while profit growth coefficients are more important at initial stages in the evolutionary process. The incentive mechanism based on governmental subsidies is an effective solution to motivate co-investment, and governments should take some measures to improve the assess accuracy and supervisory efficiency of investment strategy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research highlights: Interaction effects of coniferous on deciduous species have been investigated before the background of climate change. Background and objectives: The cultivation of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in mixed stands has currently received attention, since the future performance of beech in mid-European forest monocultures in a changing climate is under debate. We investigated water relations and nitrogen (N) nutrition of beech in monocultures and mixed with silver-fir (Abies alba Mill.) in the Black Forest at different environmental conditions, and in the Croatian Velebit at the southern distribution limit of beech, over a seasonal course at sufficient water availability. Material and methods: Water relations were analyzed via δ13C signatures, as integrative measures of water supply assuming that photosynthesis processes were not impaired. N nutrition was characterized by N partitioning between soluble N fractions and structural N. Results: In the relatively wet year 2016, water relations of beech leaves, fir needles and roots differed by season, but generally not between beech monocultures and mixed cultivation. At all sites, previous and current year fir needles revealed significantly lower total N contents over the entire season than beech leaves. Fir fine roots exhibited higher or similar amounts of total N compared to needles. Correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship of leaf and root δ13C signatures with soil parameters at the mixed beech stands, but not at pure beech stands. While glutamine (Gln) uptake capacity of beech roots was strongly related to soil N in the monoculture beech stands, arginine (Arg) uptake capacities of beech roots were strongly related to soil N in mixed stands. Conclusions: Leaf N contents indicated a facilitative effect of silver-fir on beech on sites where soil total N concentrations where low, but an indication of competition effect where it was high. This improvement could be partially attributed to protein contents, but not to differences in uptake capacity of an individual N source. From these results it is concluded that despite similar performance of beech trees at the three field sites investigated, the association with silver-fir mediated interactive effects between species association, climate and soil parameters even at sufficient water supply.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of the implementation of corporate social responsibility activities on the reorganization of vertical relationships within food supply chains. Applying content analysis techniques to the Global Reporting Initiative reports, we collected qualitative data on investments in environmentally friendly options, the adoption of standards, stakeholder engagement, information searches, impact‐monitoring activities, and chain coordination to transform it into quali‐quantitative data. We find that the variables affecting chain coordination relate to the presence of sourcing standards, effort in discussing with chain partners ways to prevent and manage chain environmental impacts, and costs related to stakeholder feedback collection. The results of the analysis confirm corporate social responsibility as a strategic tool to improve supply chain relationships through an augmented vertical coordination and to integrate environmental policy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous studies suggest that the placental supply of nutrients to the fetus adapts according to fetal demand. However, the signaling events underlying placental adaptations remain largely unknown. Earlier work in mice has revealed that loss of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α impairs feto-placental growth but placental nutrient supply is adaptively increased. Here we explore the role of p110α in the epiblast-derived (fetal) and trophoblast lineages of the conceptus in relation to feto-placental growth and placental development and transfer function. Using conditional gene manipulations to knock-down p110α either by ∼50% or ∼100% in the fetal lineages and/or trophoblast, this study shows that p110α in the fetus is essential for prenatal development and a major regulator of placental phenotype in mice. Complete loss of fetal p110α caused embryonic death, whilst heterozygous loss resulted in fetal growth restriction and impaired placental formation and nutrient transport. Loss of trophoblast p110α also resulted in abnormal placental development, although fetuses were viable. However, in response to complete loss of trophoblast p110α, the placenta failed to transport sufficient amino acid to match fetal demands for growth. Using RNA-seq, we identified several genes downstream of p110α in the trophoblast that are important in adapting placental phenotype to support fetal growth. Further work using CRISPR/Cas9 genome targeting showed that loss of p110α differentially affects the expression of genes in trophoblast and embryonic stem cells. Our findings thus reveal important, but distinct roles for p110α signaling in the different compartments of the conceptus, which control fetal resource acquisition and ultimately affect healthy growth.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>One Sentence Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Fetal and trophoblast p110α modify resource allocation</jats:p></jats:sec>"

The objective of this study is to provide useful information for practical applications to solve the taste and odor problem during algal blooms in Lake Taihu. Results showed that the conventional treatment removed 38–59% and 36–64% of 2-MIB and geosmin, respectively, with ozone dosage from 0 to 1.0 mg/L. In particular, the increase in ozone concentration promoted the removal of 2-MIB/geosmin by sand filtration, meanwhile lowering the odorant removal efficiency by GAC filtration, with the key reason being the higher biomass produced in the sand filter through the strengthening effect of the ozonation. The organics with higher molecular weight (MW) showed the most significant decline in the pre-ozonation process with 1.0 mg/L ozone dosage, resulting in an enhanced removal efficiency of 2-MIB/geosmin by pre-ozonation. With ozone dosage of 1.0 mg/L, geosmin and 2-MIB in the treated water were 0.1 and 3.85 ng/L, respectively, which were below their odor threshold concentrations (OTCs) with the preliminary concentration of ∼200 ng/L of 2-MIB/geosmin.</jats:p>",

In this context, to identify the risk of fires and explosions quantitatively, a fire and explosion risk analysis (FERA) was carried out for the LNGCs. This paper, as a part of the FERA, presents the results of a preliminary investigation on the effect of introducing the highly pressured fuel gas system into LNGCs on the fire and explosion risk especially in the cargo compressor room. This study is conducted in a comparative way considering the risk contribution of each parameter that could impact on the fire and explosion risk. The effect of the highly pressured fuel gas is indirectly taken into account by the change of the initial leak rate in the system. To identify effects of the considered parameters quantitatively, dozens of simulations for the selected gas dispersion, explosion, and fire scenarios were carried out using FLACS and KFX. Based on the simulation results, it is concluded that, in case of the LNGCs, the effects of the initial large leak rate due to the high pressure in the fuel gas pipes on the fire and explosion risk are not significant compared with the effects of other parameters such as leak amount, leak location, and leak direction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The large scale of construction in mega projects leads to significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts; thus, the projects should also exhibit greater social responsibility. Adopting green supply chain management in the construction process is an important way to realize the goal of sustainable development of mega projects. Because the green supply chain behavior during construction is mainly demonstrated by contractors, it is especially important to study the evolutionary trend of their behavior. Thus, to explore the cooperative relationship among contractors, this paper considers a lengthy construction period, multi-agent participation dynamics, and opportunistic behavior—all are key features of mega projects—and establishes an evolutionary game model. Specifically, a replicator dynamic equation is used to describe the long-term effects of the contractor’s decisions. Equilibrium determinants are then analyzed and simulated. The results show that the initial probabilities of the two types of contractors (main contractor and subcontractor) demonstrating opportunistic behaviors have a significant effect on the direction of evolution of the mega project. The main contractor, who dominates the subsidy allocation by the government and project owner, should pay attention to maintaining a balance in the income distribution between him or her and the subcontractor. Additionally, there is an optimal distribution coefficient for the subsidy that minimizes the overall probability of opportunistic behavior. This paper provides a point of reference for the decisions of the main contractor and the subcontractor in the green supply chain of mega projects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The historical division of water management into different sectors, with financially and technologically driven decision processes, makes taking a more holistic approach to finding sustainable solutions for urban water management difficult. Here, a planning framework for Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) that evolved during a two-year study evaluating alternative strategies for dual water supply within a local government context is described. The planning framework was developed to overcome the obstacles that surfaced over the course of the study. It provides a structured approach to strategic decision making that integrates triple bottom line (TBL), multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and participatory decision making into an exploration of water supply alternatives. TBL assured stakeholders that the decisions considered the financial, social, and environmental performance. MCDA provided visibility into the benefits and trade-offs of the alternatives by providing a quantitative method for comparing alternatives that incorporates incommensurate performance indicators and priorities of multiple stakeholders. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses addressed concerns regarding decision risk and improved transparency into inputs driving uncertainty in the analysis. Finally, a flexible participatory process helped to circumvent socio-institutional barriers by adapting the methodology and increasing cooperation among stakeholders and multidisciplinary experts. The resulting collaborative, risk-informed, TBL-MCDA (CRTM) planning framework helps to refine the feasible set of alternatives by providing more transparency into the drivers, technologies, and stakeholders influencing the decision. The planning framework increased the number of participants that were involved in the study, increased interaction between participants, changed the structure of the decision problem, increased the number of performance indicators considered, and improved stakeholder cooperation in the decision process.</jats:p>"

However, existing chipless RFID tags consume considerable tag area and manufacturing time/cost because of complex fabrication process (e.g., requiring removing or shorting some resonators on the tag substrate to encode data). Worse still, their identifiers (IDs) are deterministic, clonable, and small in terms of bitwidth. To address these shortcomings and help preserve the cold chain for commodities (e.g., vaccines, pharmaceuticals, etc.) sensitive to temperature, we develop a novel unclonable environmentally sensitive chipless RFID (UCR) tag that intrinsically generates a unique ID from both manufacturing variations and ambient temperature variation. A UCR tag consists of two parts: (i) a certain number of concentric ring slot resonators integrated on a certain laminate (e.g., TACONIC TLX-0), whose resonance frequencies rely on geometric parameters of slot resonators and dielectric constant of substrate material that are sensitive to manufacturing variations, and (ii) a stand-alone circular ring slot resonator integrated on a particular substrate (e.g., grease) that will be melted at a high temperature, whose resonance frequency relies on geometric parameters of slot resonator, dielectric constant of substrate material, and ambient temperature. UCR tags have the capability to track commodities and their temperatures in the supply chain. The area of UCR tag is comparable to regular quick response (QR) code. Experimental results based on UCR tag prototypes have verified their uniqueness and reliability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, sustainable supply chains that balance economic development and the environment have become an inevitable focus for many businesses and industries. Supply chain finance as the core driving force for supply chain development, plays a vital role in resolving any financing difficulties that exist in many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the upstream and downstream of the supply chain. However, most SME supply chain financing assessments currently use economic indicators as the sole measure of the evaluation system and rarely consider sustainability. While existing supply chain financing decision-making systems can resolve SME financing problems to some extent, the one-sided pursuit of maximum economic benefits is contrary to sustainable development and does not assist financial institutions in avoiding finance risks. Therefore, this paper, based on the theory of the triple bottom line (economy, environment, and society) from a sustainable development perspective, innovatively proposes an SME financing evaluation model for supply chain finance that applies a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method combined with Topsis. Additionally, at the end, an example is given to demonstrate model validity and evaluate the best possible SME financing model for financial institutions.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we consider the facility location problem, in order to reduce the total costs and CO2 emissions under an uncertain demand and emission rate. Particularly, we are more interested in the risk-averse method for providing more reliable solutions. To do this, we employ a coherent risk measure, conditional value-at-risk, to represent the underlying risk of uncertain demand and CO2 emission rate. The resulting optimization problem is a 0-1 mixed integer bi-objective programming, which is challenging to solve. We develop an improved reformulation-linearization technique, based on decomposed piecewise McCormick envelopes, to generate lower bounds efficiently. We show that the proposed risk-averse model can generate a more reliable solution than the risk-neutral model, both in reducing penalty costs and CO2 emissions. Moreover, the proposed algorithm outperforms and classic reformulation-linearization technique in convergence rate and gaps. Numerical experiments based on random data and a ‘real’ case are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and algorithm.</jats:p>"

The balance between sustainability and local economic benefits is critical to rural tourism development in developing countries. Incorporating the theories of green supply chain and front–back stage decoupling, this paper proposes a new model of green tourism supply chain for rural tourism to relieve the dilemma between economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Back-stage functions have been decoupled from individual rural tourism service units to form shared service centers, which centralize the provision of back-stage functions and generate an independent tier of suppliers in the green Tourism Supply Chain (TSC). Field practice experiences relating to green TSC construction and operation are also discussed. The new structure of green supply chain shows positive environmental and economic effects of rural tourism. It increases the tourism business efficiency without sacrificing the local environment. The paper intends to present a new perspective and explores a new research path to green supply chain research in tourism and other service industries which have been previously limited in manufacturing framework and provide some insights into tourism destination practice.</jats:p>"

Coarse sediment flux has been shown to promote terrestrial bedrock incision via abrasion in rivers, but similar processes in submarine canyons have yet to be systematically documented. We use repeat bathymetry, provenance analysis, wave modeling, and channel network analysis to show that longshore sheltering and wave focusing by the Delgada submarine canyon induce sediment accumulation and elevated wave shear stresses in its headwall region that frequently mobilize coarse bed material. These mobilizations scour bedrock in the headwall and generate abrasive turbidity currents that work to carve the canyon's active channel into bedrock. These findings highlight an important positive feedback between submarine canyons, waves, and sediment supply and suggest that submarine canyons adjacent to wave‐dominated, coarse sediment‐rich coastlines <jats:italic>seek the shoreline</jats:italic> through headward incision.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Diesel–Brayton combined cycle engine was proposed previously to achieve the goal of lower fuel consumption, higher power density and good startup performance under low-temperature conditions. The prototype engine was designed and tested based on an off-the-shelf gas turbine and a diesel engine. To achieve a more compact and lighter design, the air supply system was designed based on the centrifugal compressor of the gas turbine. In the coupling operation mode aiming to generate the maximum power, a large amount of compressed air must be extracted into the diesel engine. The present paper presents the design methodology of the compact air supply system. The bleeding slot configuration was selected based on a parametric study and proven by systematic experiments. Three-dimensional simulations were conducted to investigate the performance and flow field of the compressor. Backflow appeared in several passages of the axial diffuser caused by air bleeding, which further distorted the air flow in the combustion chamber. Such distortion may cause compressor and combustion instabilities. In the future, the combustion chamber and the axial diffuser must be designed in combination with an air bleeding system to improve the engine performance. </jats:p>",

Curbing the trade in these so-called conflict resources is, therefore, part of the European Union’s conflict management policies. The article explores the EU’s policies in this field and asks, specifically, why the EU is using supply chain due-diligence measures to achieve this goal. The author argues that they are the response to enforcement problems of most existing multilateral and unilateral sanction regimes because of state weakness in the targeted regions. This approach results from a broader idea from the EU that transparency can improve resource governance and, therefore, safeguard both its political and economic interests in conflict zones, such as the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, when the issue becomes specific—as in the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation—translating this idea into concrete policies becomes more contentious as the EU institutions set different priorities for the final policy design. </jats:p>",

Electrosorption kinetics were performed to verify desalination of the saline solutions over time. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the microstructure of the biomorphic carbon is composed of porous microchannels with diameters of around 300 mm, which allowed both fluid flow and ion retention. The kinetics of the electrosorption presented excellent results concerning desalination of highly concentrated solutions using low voltages.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although carbon mitigation in power industry is attracting more and more attention around the world, the large scale application of carbon capture technology is obstructed because of the enormous energy consumption and huge capital investment required. In this study, an integrated system with power generation, CO2 capture and heat supply are proposed, which adopts three measures to reutilize the waste heat released from the CO2 capture process, including extracted steam recirculation, a CO2 Rankine cycle and a radiant floor heat subsystem. Amongst these measures, the radiant floor heat subsystem can efficiently reuse the relatively low temperature waste energy in the absorbent cooler. Through thermodynamic analysis, it is determined that the power output of the new integrated system is 19.48 MW higher compared with the decarbonization Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant without system integration. On the other hand, 247.59 MW of heat can be recovered through the radiant floor heat subsystem, leading to an improved overall energy efficiency of 73.6%. In terms of the economic performance, the integration requires only 2.6% more capital investment than a decarbonization NGCC power plant without system integration and obtains extra revenue of 3.40 $/MWh from the simultaneous heat supply, which reduces the cost of CO2 avoided by 22.3%. The results prove the economic and efficiency potential of a NGCC power plant integrated with carbon capture, which may promote the industrial demonstration of carbon capture theology.</jats:p>"

To gain more exact results, we adopt interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets to express the fuzziness of multi-criteria. Fuzzy Choquet integral model is developed to explain correlations of multi-criteria and calculate the evaluation results of each expert.

The Indian Ocean offers a unique positive temperature and nutrient supply relationship to test these hypotheses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines manufacturers' carbon emission reduction level and retailers' low‐carbon promotion effort in a low‐carbon closed‐loop supply chain (CLSC), in which a manufacturer directly collects the used‐products from consumers. Considering both the carbon emission reduction level and low‐carbon promotion effort depending on the market demands, this study investigates the optimal decisions and performances of CLSC under four different game structures, that is, one non‐cooperative structure and three cooperative structures. In the non‐cooperative structure, the manufacturer controls the carbon emission level, the collection level as well as the wholesale price, while the retailer controls the low‐carbon promotion effort and retail price. The cooperative structures consist of one‐way and two‐way cooperation. In one‐way cooperative structure, the manufacturer shares only a part of retailer's low‐carbon promotion cost. In two‐way cooperative structure, the retailer shares partial manufacturer's carbon emission reduction cost or collection cost based on the one‐way cooperative structure. It shows that the two‐way cooperative structure of the co‐op promotion and carbon emission reduction is the optimal in pricing decisions and carbon emission reduction level, as well as two‐way cooperative structure of the co‐op promotion and collection is the optimal in the collection effort. Under lower the consumer's low‐carbon preferences, the retailer agrees to share the manufacturer's collection cost. When the consumer's low‐carbon preferences are higher, the retailer agrees to share the manufacturer's carbon emission reduction cost. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 143–153, 2019</jats:p>",

Using data of Fujian tea business as an example, customer sources showed a typical clustered pattern overall that could be classified into several hot areas. The distribution of customer sources is dynamic along with time. These hot areas spread from coastal cities to inland cities, ranging from urban to suburban. Meanwhile, it showed a relatively irregular distribution in suburban areas with aggregation distribution near urban areas. This study applied GIS spatio-temporal analysis technology to the analysis of an enterprise supply chain, synthesizing both spatial and temporal information and successfully integrating business with geography.</jats:p>",

The proposed architecture is a hybrid framework integrated with conventional alternating current (AC) power distribution system, DC power distribution and WPT system. The applied AC and DC hybrid power distribution system has higher conversion efficiency than a single AC power system, which indicates that the former is becoming an important trend of building power distribution. In addition, the results of experimental test in a case study suggest that the proposed architecture can provide fine service for efficient application of renewable energy and regeneration energy in building. The obtained results also can serve as a foundation to promote the development of building power distribution system and related practical application in building.</jats:p>"

Soil texture, film hole diameter and water depth are the dominant influencing factors. Philip infiltration model was used to fit the simulated results of the dominant influencing factors. For the same soil, the sorptivity (s) is a power function relationship with film hole diameter, while the steady infiltration rate (a) is a power function relationship with film hole diameter and water depth. On that basis, the calculation formulas for predicting s and a were established, and a simplified film hole infiltration model including the film hole diameter and water depth was proposed. The effectiveness of the model was verified by laboratory experiments and literature data. The predicted values of the model were in good agreement with the experimental observations. The model parameters can be determined only by a set of film hole infiltration experiment, which simplifies the experimental design and can be used as a tool for irrigation engineers or farmers to estimate cumulative infiltration.</jats:p>",

Through a phase-inversion process, the poly(MMA-co-AMPS) were fully dispersed in the PVDF membrane. The properties of membrane including the surface and cross-section morphology, surface wettability and fouling resistance under different pH solutions were investigated. Compared to the unmodified PVDF membranes, the contact angles of modified PVDF membranes decreased from 80.6° to 71.6°, and the pure water flux increased from 54 to 71 L·m−2·h−1. In addition, the hybrid PVDF membrane containing 0.5 wt% copolymers demonstrated an larger permeability, better fouling resistance and higher recovery ratio via pure water backlashing, when it was compared with the other blend membranes, and the virgin one in the cyclic test of anti-fouling. The modified membranes with the copolymers possessed an outstanding performance and may be used for further water treatment applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In spring, transition from a total mixed ration (TMR) to pasture requires rumen adaptions for the cow. It had been shown that transition period does not necessarily mean an increased risk for subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). After adaption to pasture, however, supplying low amounts of concentrate did indicate increased risk, but caused no adverse effects on rumen morphology and absorption capacity. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of transition, and how a supply of 4.5 kg dry matter concentrate·cow−1   ·   day−1 during fulltime grazing influenced different rumen parameters. During a 12-week trial eleven rumen-cannulated dairy cows were observed during transition from confinement to pasture (PG; n = 6) and compared to cows fed TMR indoors (CG; n = 5). The CG stayed on a TMR based ration (35% corn silage, 35% grass silage, 30% concentrate; dry matter basis), whereas the PG slowly switched to a pasture-based ration (week 0 and 1 = TMR, week 2 = TMR and 3 h pasture·day−1, week 3 and 4 = TMR and 12 h pasture·day−1, and week 5 to 11 = pasture combined with 4.5 kg DM concentrate   ·   cow−1·day−1). Papillae surface area decreased during transition and increased again during fulltime grazing, while the fractional absorption rate of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was not influenced. This suggests only a limited effect of papillae surface area on VFA absorption rate. Feeding changes resulted in different fermentation profiles of VFA. Changing ratio of starch to sugar during transition to fulltime grazing plus concentrate supply did not lead to lower rumen pH. In conclusion, the concentrate supply combined with high fermentable grass during fulltime grazing increased papillae surface area but did not affect absorption rate or rumen pH, so that risk for SARA was not increased.</jats:p>"

To guide management that seeks to promote multiple services, we investigated the relationships between 12 stand-level forest attributes, including structure, composition, heterogeneity and plant diversity, plus 4 environmental factors, and proxies for 14 ecosystem services in 150 temperate forest plots. Our results show that forest attributes are the best predictors of most ecosystem services and are also good predictors of several synergies and trade-offs between services. Environmental factors also play an important role, mostly in combination with forest attributes. Our study suggests that managing forests to increase structural heterogeneity, maintain large trees, and canopy gaps would promote the supply of multiple ecosystem services. These results highlight the potential for forest management to encourage multifunctional forests and suggest that a coordinated landscape-scale strategy could help to mitigate trade-offs in human-dominated landscapes.</jats:p>"

This paper aims to identify the various risk sources that cause supply chain risks to occur in the Malaysian manufacturing industry. In addition, the type and frequency of supply chain risks and discussing the best approach to reduce these risks in the context of the manufacturing industry. A survey method was adopted using a questionnaire to collect the necessary information in order to achieve the aim and objectives of this study. Information was collected from several manufacturing sectors in Malaysia, namely; the automotive, electronics and food sectors. The respondents were people having practical knowledge of risk management, including supply chain managers and supervisors. The survey results were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The analysis of the results indicated that the primary source that led to the occurrence of supply chain risks was mainly due to the delay in responding to the risks. The associated risks that often occur in the manufacturing industry were also identified, namely, changes in customer demand and increasing raw material prices. In addressing these risks, it was found that communication and the exchange of information were the most important practices and initiatives to help reduce the occurrence of supply chain risks. Accordingly, this study is considered as a pilot study given the small number of respondents. Thus, it can be used as a preliminary guideline for future research work.</jats:p>"

Baijiu is one of the world’s oldest distilled alcoholic beverages and plays a significant role in Chinese culture and Chinese people’s daily life. As the production and consumption of Baijiu have a significant influence on the economic, environmental, and social performance of supply chain management, sustainable supply chain network design decisions are critical to the long-term success of the industry. In concert with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is a growing demand for a sustainable Baijiu industry. Therefore, this paper constructs and optimizes a network decision-support model for a sustainable Baijiu industry network design. To achieve this, the Baijiu supply chain is examined and a model is proposed for a design that encompasses economic (costs), environmental (carbon emissions), and social (local employment and regional per capita GDP) dimensions. R language programming is then applied to solve the model. A case example indicated that S1 was the optimal decision for reducing costs, S2 was the optimal solution for minimizing carbon emissions, and S3 was the best for maximizing the social impact. Considering the situation of the Baijiu industry and the focal enterprise, it was concluded that S1 would be the best solution for the case company. And the results verified the effectiveness of the framework. This paper develops a systematic and effective approach that decision-makers can use to conduct sustainable network design for Baijiu enterprises.</jats:p>",
