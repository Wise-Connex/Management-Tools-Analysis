The distance of a farmer's field from the outlet of the supply channel, size of the farm, number of intervening farmers, social characteristics, and possession of wells for supplymneting the canal water were the key variables determining the canal water supply at the farm level. Among the variables, direct distance and lateral distances of the supply channel in the head and middle portions and direct, lateral, and sublateral distances in the tail portion markedly influenced the stress days and yield of paddy crops. The buildup of stress days was higher at the direct distance category. The results indicated that under the current method of allocating water to only half of the command area in each year and with the consequent water distribution problems, changes in the system of water distribution below the outlet would have more significant impacts on farm level water supply in the Lower Bhavani Project than changes above the outlet. However, the methods suggested to improve the system performance indicated that changes above the outlet were also necessary for improving the system's overall performance.</jats:p>",

The data include satellite (LANDSAT) imagery, field verification and near-synoptic surveys of specific areas and integrated, longer-term, surveys of the Channel. The information is used to identify areas of high turbidity, which relate to tidal and wave resuspension of the mobile sediments within the Estuary and Channel system. Thematic maps produced from the satellite imagery are comparable directly with the survey results and are combined with them, through a radiance/log<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> concentration relationship. Derived estimates of material present within the waters of the Channel range from 4.5 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> t to 13.4 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> t. Fluvial contributions are estimated to be of the order of 1.6 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> t/yr. Other evidence is available for the supply of material from the Celtic Sea. Isopleths of suspended sediment concentration are used to infer residual water and fine-grained sediment transport directions; these are compared with a more general model, which includes observed and predicted near-bed sand transport directions.Key words: Bristol Channel, Severn Estuary, suspended sediment, satellite imagery, sediment budget, sediment transport, residual water movement </jats:p>",

The ports studied are distributed throughout the tropics from South America to Indonesia and the factors affecting sediment supply and distribution either directly or indirectly have been summarized. In spite of local variations, the similarity of many features suggests the existence of a common mechanism of sediment transport.Twenty months of field measurements at one of the ports demonstrated that turbidity in the water column is low from surface to 0.15 m above the bed. These measurements, together with those from flume tests on the behavior of local mud in currents, indicated that siltation is not solely due to deposition of silt suspended in the main body of flow. Further wave flume tests showed that under certain conditions, a shallow, highly turbid layer forms on the bed, capable of being transported by weak tidal currents without significant vertical mixing. Supplementation of field measurements of water movement with more detailed hydraulic model measurements permitted the formulation of a siltation mechanism.Appraisal of results suggests the most important immediate source of the silt to be the shallow coastal mud banks. Waves produce the turbid, near-bed layer which is transported by littoral currents into port approach channels for redistribution by the prevailing residual current, itself a function of fluvial/tidal interaction.Key words: siltation, dredging, silt movement, flocculation, waves, tides, river flow, residual currents </jats:p>",

In two of four mapped hydrologic zones, ground water in storage will be allowed to be mined to exhaustion in 100 years (40 years in urban areas). Elsewhere, the policy is for a steady state with use balanced by recharge. Equations to determine storage or recharge can be solved using site specific data or regional estimates of hydrologic conditions. Substantial reductions in the lot size requirements are allowed if water conservation convenants are adopted. Public acceptance indicates that the policy successfully integrates technical and political concerns. It is simple to administer, yet reflects widely expressed public goals and values.</jats:p>",

Compared with the dynamics of a stable giraffe population in Nairobi National Park, the sub‐adult components of the Serengeti regional populations are larger and juvenile growth rates marginally faster: calving intervals are shorter and the age of first conception younger, resulting in higher fecundities per adult female: calf survival rates are higher and adult mortalities lower.
