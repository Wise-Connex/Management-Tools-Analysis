It is demonstrated that if there is a marginal increase in the capital income tax rate, the tax burden is shared in some proportion by both capital and labor, with capital's share of the tax burden increasing with increasing elasticity of labor supply. This is in contrast with earlier results that showed that the elasticity of labor supply has no effect on the long-run incidence of a factor tax. </jats:p>",

Based on household survey data, it shows that rural water policies have not kept pace with the rapid economic development in this region and that in the absence of adequate public investment households find private sector alternatives to meet their water needs, often at high economic and environmental cost. Using the contingent valuation method for benefit estimation, it is also shown that household willingness to pay for reliable improved services is much higher than assumed. In fact, full cost recovery is quite feasible in many areas of the Punjab. It is recommended that rural water sector strategy be changed from a centralized, supply‐oriented focus to a decentralized, demand‐oriented policy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Current evolutionary theories do not adequately address the question of how the human brain evolved to be larger and more sophisticated than that of other primates. The human brain/body weight ratio is 4–5 times higher than in primates and, relative to the rest of the body, requires up to 10 times as much energy as in other land-based mammals. Human brain evolution must therefore have required a stable food supply providing a reliable source of both high dietary energy and a cluster of ‘brain-specific’ nutrients over a long period of time. These nutrient and energy requirements are available in the marine and shore-based food chain but are difficult if not impossible to obtain in the terrestrial food chain. We suggest that marine and estuarine ecosystems provided hominids with the appropriate stimulus to develop a relatively large brain. This occurred in conjunction with the evolution of other uniquely human features, particularly relative hairlessness, bipedalism and abundant neonatal subcutaneous fat. Invertebrates, molluscs, small or slow-moving fish, and marine algae would have provided a stable, abundant supply of energy, long chain polyunsaturates and other nutrients essential for the brain and would have done so with comparatively little mammalian competition. The land-water interface would thus have allowed the hominid brain to develop sufficient neurological complexity to enable sophisticated tool and behaviour patterns to evolve in humans as a· natural sequel to such a biochemical and environmental stimulus. </jats:p>",

The first approach distinguished between bearing and non-bearing phases of a tree life and directly estimated the number of non-bearing trees. The second focused on indirect estimating of the non-bearing tree number from changes in production. This approach relaxed the assumption of maintaining maximum yields for infinite period as used in earlier studies. Empirical applications used two data sets from the pecan industry. The comparison of empirical results suggested that the first method was more accurate than the alternative approach in predicting the number of newly planted trees over an extended period of time.

It is shown that such behavior can dramatically affect the terms and conditions under which water service is offered to the public. A water supply system based on limited numbers of public taps, relatively few house connections, and water vendors can generate substantial monopoly rents that can be appropriated by both public and private agents. Most professionals involved with water supply projects in developing countries typically assume that the objective of municipal water authorities is to serve the public interest. In fact, agents involved in the water delivery system may pursue strategies designed for private gain, which can have important and pervasive implications for how a water system is actually designed and operated. Proposals to change the technical, engineering aspects of a water distribution system can thus threaten the interests of powerful groups. Effective public policy and donor involvement in the water sector must be based on an understanding of the structure of water markets and the political power supporting existing institutional arrangements.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large quantities of financial and human resources have been devoted to improving rural water supplies in developing countries over the past two decades. Many projects have been successful, but many have failed to meet the needs of the intended beneficiaries. Evidence of the failures lies in the unused and poorly maintained systems that are scattered throughout rural areas of the developing world. The current situation in water supply in rural Kerala, India, reflects this general observation and can be described as a “low‐level equilibrium trap.” Water systems provide a low level of service with few yard taps. The monthly tariff for water from household connections is low. With few connectors and low tariffs, little revenue is generated beyond subsidies provided by the government. The water authority can afford to maintain the system up to a level at which the reliability of service is low, forcing consumers to supplement piped water from traditional sources. This study analyzes contingent valuation data collected in three areas of Kerala to evaluate the possibility of lifting the system out of this trap. The analysis shows that by making a few critical policy changes, encouraging private connections and financing those connections through higher tariffs, the system can ratchet up to a “high‐level equilibrium” in which there are many connectors, monthly revenues are greatly increased, and consumer welfare improves. Such a system would be better financed, making it possible to improve the reliability and quality of the service.</jats:p>",

Kittiwakes in Shetland generally feed their young almost entirely on sandeels, and fisheries data indicated that stocks of sandeels in Shetland waters were at least ten times higher in 1991 than in 1990. Fledging success of Kittiwakes was nil in 1990 and 68% of eggs laid in 1991, although clutch‐size and hatching success were no different between years. Post‐hatching foraging trips in 1991 were of comparable duration to those recorded at other colonies in conditions of good food supply (2–3 h), while trips recorded during incubation or post‐hatching in 1990 were approximately three times longer on average than at corresponding stages of the breeding season in 1991. Radio‐tracking data indicated that adults generally stayed within 5 km of the colony in 1991 but flew more than 40 km from the colony on each trip in 1990. Eggs were apparently not left unattended in either year, despite the fact that this required adults to incubate for periods in excess of 44 h in 1990. The extent to which adults were able to increase trip durations, foraging ranges and incubation shift lengths between years, while maintaining hatching success, indicates the degree to which Kittiwakes are normally buffered against adverse feeding conditions during incubation. Reduced nest attendance and lower body‐condition of adults post‐hatching in 1990, in conjunction with complete post‐hatching breeding failure, indicate that adults were beyond the limits of their buffering capacity during chick‐rearing in 1990.</jats:p>",

Interviews were conducted with 508 HIV‐seropositive blood donors from May 1, 1988, to August 31, 1989 (Phase 1), and with 472 donors from January 1, 1990, to May 31, 1991 (Phase 2), at 20 blood centers. From Phase 1 to Phase 2, the overall HIV prevalence decreased from 0.021 to 0.018 percent (p &lt; 0.001). HIV risk factors among HIV‐1‐seropositive donors were similar during both study phases. Eleven percent of the men and 56 percent of the women reported as their only risk that they had a heterosexual partner who was at increased risk for HIV or was known to have HIV. These percentages were similar during both study periods. During Phase 2, 13 percent of the men and 17 percent of the women with heterosexual transmission risk had a positive serologic test for syphilis, hepatitis B core antibody, or hepatitis C antibody. Among HIV‐ 1‐seropositive donors reporting heterosexual risk, the median numbers of previous‐year and lifetime sex partners for men were 2 and 30, respectively; for women, those numbers were 1 and 7, respectively. Thirty‐one percent of the men and 6 percent of the women reporting heterosexual transmission risk also reported having had syphilis or gonorrhea within 3 years of donation. It is concluded that the impact of heterosexual transmission of HIV infection on transfusion safety is not worsening at this time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</jats:p>",

The seedlings, when supplied with excess iron (up to 1.0 m<jats:italic>M</jats:italic>) and low light (40 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), did not suffer any loss of photosynthesis; further, the typical symptoms of iron toxicity, as shown in the leaves grown in sunlight at <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 450 W/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> on an average, were not seen in those. Nonetheless, excess iron supply resulted in a marked increase in photosensitivity of the low light‐adapted seedlings. A large portion of iron accumulated in chloroplasts by the supply of excess iron was found to be incorporated into thylakoids as nonheme iron (NHI), which acts as a potent sensitizer, photogenerating singlet oxygen (<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). The generation rate of <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from thylakoids linearly increased with increasing content of NHI; this was in parallel with the NHI content dependence of photoinactivation rates of photosynthetic electron transport and key enzymes of the Calvin cycle in chloroplasts.

The difference in <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>CO <jats:sub>2</jats:sub> output between CL and UL increased transiently after the meal, indicating an increase in decarboxylation relative to total oxidation of leucine. In conclusion: (1) metabolic leucine utilization after overnight fasting depends on the level of chronic protein supply and stage of development of the animal, (2) metabolic leucine utilization after feeding depends primarily on the level of acute protein supply, (3) the transient increase in non-protein label retention suggests a temporal oversupply ofleucine relative to the actual metabolic state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> ; This article is a broad and introductory overview of personnel supply/demand issues in special education. One premise is that matters of quality (competence, qualifications) interlock with matters of quantity (numbers) of personnel, and that many variables affect both personnel quality and quantity. Selected intervening variables are reviewed. We suggest that many complications in personnel supplyldemand are of relatively recent origin, and, thus, traditional policies and strategies for the development, recruitment, and retention of personnel may no longer be sufficient. Although national aggregate data are presented in order to clarify the status of special education supply/demand, it is emphasized that these problems are much more relevant as local issues than as statistical issues, and that shortages and causative factors occur in widely varying dimensions and degrees across states and districts. It is, therefore, recommended that supply/demand imbalances should be more clearly understood and cooperatively addressed at the local level, which is where these problems originate and where they can be solved. In order to plan solutions, however, it is necessary to achieve a vision of the directions special education should be taking as the 20th century draws to a close. </jats:p>",
