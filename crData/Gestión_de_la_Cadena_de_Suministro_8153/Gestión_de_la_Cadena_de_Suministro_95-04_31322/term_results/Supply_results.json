This article presents a model that elucidates that role of supply response in agricultural price bargaining when no overt action is taken to limit quantity and participation in the cartel is voluntary. Free-riding, for example, is seen as having a dual nature: it undermines the cartel's influence at the negotiating table but it enhances the cartel's ability to sustain a negotiated price increase by attenuating supply response. That price bargaining can result in significant transfers from processors to producers when demand is inelastic and supply is uncontrolled is highlighted in the empirical application.</jats:p>",

This is especially true in the case of Zambian maize production. Maize is the most important crop grown in Zambia. It accounts for more than 80% of the value of marketed food crops, is heavily relied on for subsistence consumption, and is a staple food in the diet of all Zambian citizens. This paper analyzes the aggregate price response of maize supply in Zambia using a dynamic regression analysis. As a result, short, intermediate and long‐run multipliers/elasticities are measured which can be used to analyze the effect of future price policy changes.</jats:p><jats:p>It was found that a second‐order rational distributed lag model best fits the available data. Estimates of short‐run elasticities of supply for maize and fertilizer prices are 0.54 and –0.48, respectively. The corresponding estimated long‐run elasticities are 1.57 and – 1.44.</jats:p>",

We trace this development to the increased import volumes that have followed the 1986 collapse in the world oil price, and argue that concerns over the source of oil are of primary importance only in situations where physical availability is likely problematic. As the conception of security of supply is broadened, a distinction between random and strategic shocks is useful. Supply-side considerations, such as stockpiles, seem apt only to address the consequences of random shocks. As time horizons lengthen, supply-side measures lose their effectiveness, and demand-side considerations emerge as possible means of dampening the macroeconomic effects of future strategic shocks. Implementation remains an unresolved issue: the expected costs and benefits of specific interventions must still be compared. </jats:p>",

However, a sufficient quantity and an excellent quality of drinking water in the future can only be guaranteed through more integrated management of water resources. Artificial recharge of groundwater plays a key role in this approach. It includes the infiltration of treated surface water in a direct coordination to water catchment facilities. Investigations show, that other possibilities are: i) the reuse of sewage water, although there are still unsolved judicial issues, and ii) the use of stormwater. For both, an advanced treatment is necessary to meet the stringent quality requirements. Thus, the treatment is shifted more towards the sources of pollution, that means from the treatment of surface water to wastewater and stormwater to obtain an optimum water resource protection. Furthermore, the water is partly returned to the water cycle in order for it to remain within the region. Treated surface water, advanced treated wastewater, purified stormwater and treated weakly polluted combined wastewater from the combined system constitute favourable sources, in combination, for the replenishment of groundwater. Former wastewater irrigation fields in the area could be used. This also prevents re-dissolution of heavy metals in the polluted soil of the wastewater irrigation fields into the groundwater.</jats:p>",

The simplified model was used for slot and tooth shapes and sizes design optimisation, air‐gap width optimisation with reaching the maximal possible torque. Now we are going to verify these results and compare them to our latest ones. The comparison will be made by showing the magnetic field layout in the motor (with different current supply) in different stator‐rotor position. We will present tables and figures of some important variables, necessary for torque computation. We will compare these variables in the simplified and in the real motor. Then, on the base of the magnetic field solution, we will show the possible ways of rotor torque computation.</jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that these declines followed decreasing nutrient supply and increasing nutrient limitation in older forests. Single-tree fertilization plots in 28 stands were used to test for nutrient limitation with stand age and density. Younger stands (&lt;40 year old) had higher net nitrification and mineralization. These stands showed no significant response to fertilization in either needle fascicle weight or basal area growth. All older age-classes responded strongly in both fascicle weight and basal area growth. Foliar analysis indicated that N, P, and K all limited growth in older stands, but basal area increments indicated maximum responses to N alone. We conclude that increasing nutrient limitation in older stands probably accounts for at least part of the decline in stand leaf area and growth. Such declines may be responsive to a range of management activities that improve or impair stand nutrition. </jats:p>",

The cumulative ozone exposures were 1–5 x (1992) and 1–7 x (1993) higher than ambient levels. In these experiments no significant differences between the clones were found in their response to each treatment. Ozone exposure reduced the mean leaf size and the leaf area, accelerated autumn yellowing and loss of leaves, and increased the palisade layer thickness. High nitrogen availability increased the height growth, the mean leaf size, the leaf area, the shoot/root ratio, the leaf water content and the stem dry weight, but decreased the number of leaves and the leaf dry mass per area, and retarded autumn senescence of leaves. It also reduced the leaf and palisade layer thickness and increased the intercellular space of the palisade layer. Significant interactions between ozone and nitrogen supply were found as an increase in leaf biomass production, root dry weight and spongy intercellular space, and as a decrease in leaf loss, yellowing of leaves and palisade layer thickness. The results suggest that sufficient nitrogen supply can confer the birch with greater resistance to ozone.</jats:p>",

The proposed converter is shown to be useful for electroluminescent lamps (EL). The proposed converter has a novel configuration of ac‐ac conversion characterized by the parallel power stage of several SC transformers with 1 : 1 ratio and the unique driving method of switches. The basic operation is described that an ac input voltage is sampled into<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>charge‐transfer capacitors by the input‐side switches, and each sampled voltage is selected to the output port by the output‐side switches with an arbitrary frequency. Since the ac input voltage need not convert once to a dc form, the power stage is simple and the efficiency is high. A prototype circuit using five charge‐transfer capacitors (the total capacitance: 149 μ<jats:italic>F</jats:italic>) shows experimentally that it can convert a commercial line voltage (100 V/60 Hz) to a quasi‐sinusoidal wave (400 Hz) with a high efficiency (more than 85 percent) and lighten an EL (size: 1 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) effectively. The proposed converter can normally supply a power even to an inductive load without a spike noise. The inductance of the smoothing coil can be reduced 1/484 in comparison with the case of a conventional converter with a rectangular output.</jats:p>",

Despite the arid climate, water use has increased rapidly, first in the form of irrigation, and more recently the use in cities. This has caused extensive development of local water resources and overdraft of ground water basins in some areas. It is difficult to implement new local supplies and importation projects due to a myriad of environmental and legal constraints and a general shortage of public funds.

However, the incidence of neurological injury in infants surviving cardiac surgery remains considerable. These neurological sequelae are attributable at least in part to hypoxia‐ischemia/reperfusion, which inevitably accompanies infant heart surgery with deep hypothermia, cardiopulmonary bypass, and circulatory arrest. To begin to identify mechanisms of brain injury during infant cardiac surgery, we used near‐infrared spectroscopy to study the relationship between cerebral intravascular (hemoglobin) and mitochondrial (cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) oxygenation in 63 infants (aged 1 day to 9 months) undergoing deep hypothermic repair of congenital heart defects, throughout the intraoperative period. Moreover, we assessed the effect of postnatal age on these changes. The cerebral concentration of oxidized cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> decreased from the onset of deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, despite apparent abundant intravascular oxygenation manifested by a simultaneous increase in the cerebral concentration of oxyhemoglobin. During this interval infants older than 2 weeks had a greater decrease in oxidized cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> than did infants 2 weeks old or younger. During deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, cerebral levels of oxidized cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> remained depressed while those of oxyhemoglobin declined. With reperfusion following circulatory arrest, the recovery of oxidized cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> was delayed, despite a rapid recovery of intravascular oxygenation (HbO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). After rewarming and 60 minutes of reperfusion, only 46% of infants recovered to the baseline level of cerebral oxidized cytochrome <jats:italic>aa</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. These findings demonstrate a paradoxical dissociation of changes in intravascular and mitochondrial oxygenation during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass; a pronounced decrease of mitochondrial oxygenation is established during induction of hypothermia and a delay in recovery of mitochondrial oxygenation occurs following circulatory arrest. These effects were more pronounced in infants older than 2 weeks than in younger infants. The data suggest potentially deleterious impairments of intrinsic mitochondrial function or of delivery of intravascular oxygen to the mitochondrion or both, effects previously undetected and apparently influenced by cerebral maturation.</jats:p>",
