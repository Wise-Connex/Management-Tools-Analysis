If the production of infrastructure is characterized by decreasing returns to scale, this will cause the price of developable land to increase. The conditions under which an upward‐sloping supply curve for housing will result are discussed. Using cross‐sectional data for U.S. cities from 1973 to 1982, it is shown that land prices fail to increase with the quantity of construction and that the price elasticity of the supply of housing is infinite.</jats:p>",

Glucagon was administered in doses of 1 and 5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1. During glucagon infusion, hepatic arterial blood flow substantially increased, splenic and pancreatic blood flows increased moderately, while stomach and intestinal blood flows, as well as portal blood flow did not change significantly. Shunting of both 9- and 15-micron spheres through preportal tissues did not change significantly. Oxygen content in arterial or portal venous blood did not change significantly, while it increased in hepatic venous blood by 30%. There were no differences in the effects between the doses of glucagon administered. There was no correlation found between changes in hepatic oxygen supply and cardiac output or blood pressure. The changes observed during glucagon administration resulted in an increase in oxygen delivery to the liver and hepatic oxygen supply-uptake ratio. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Oscillatory behavior of smooth muscle, including arterial smooth muscle, has been identified in many preparations. In this study we have extended observations on vasomotion of the renal blood supply in humans by assessing the response to norepinephrine or angiotensin II infused directly into the renal artery in doses sufficient to reduce renal blood flow by 25-33% but not influence blood pressure. In placebo-treated patients, renal blood flow and the indexes of vasomotion determined by an estimation of power spectral density of xenon transit through the human kidney did not change. Norepinephrine induced a striking increase in the amplitude but not the cycle length of oscillatory activity, whereas angiotensin (despite a somewhat larger reduction in renal blood flow) induced only a modest change in amplitude. The phasic response to norepinephrine infused continuously makes it unnecessary to invoke phasic norepinephrine release in the response to maneuvers that increase sympathetic nervous system activity. Moreover, oscillatory activity reflects phenomena that may be related to but are not dependent on changes in mean renal blood flow. The results of this study may provide insight into the pathogenesis of the increase in vasomotion evident in the renal blood supply of some patients with essential hypertension. </jats:p>",
