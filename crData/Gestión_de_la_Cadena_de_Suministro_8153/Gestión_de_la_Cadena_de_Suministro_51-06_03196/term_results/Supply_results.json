      "abstract": "<jats:p> Here is a brief summary of the 1951 study of teacher supply and demand, an investigation conducted annually under the sponsorship of the National Commis sion on Teacher Education and Profes sional Standards. It provides a background against which trends may be seen, com parisons may be made, progress meas ured, and a sharper view of unsolved problems obtained. Not only professional workers in all aspects of teacher educa tion, but teachers throughout the nation, students in the various stages of prepara tion, and those yet to choose teaching as an occupation need information of the kind revealed by this type of inquiry. Mr. Maul, the director, serves as Research As sociate of the National Commission. He is on leave of absence from his adminis trative duties at State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas, for full-time service at the National Education Association head- quarters. </jats:p><jats:p> Copies of the complete 36-page report containing state-by-state figures on supply, demand, preparation of elementary-school teachers, and live births may be obtained froan the office of the Commission, 1201 Sixteenth Street, Northwest, Washington 6, D. C., for $1.00 each. </jats:p>",
