Using a conceptual theory‐building approach and drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory, this research identifies four mediating effects through which suppliers’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content>s affect buyers’ economic performance. The four mediating factors are purchasing costs, supply chain sustainability risk costs, cooperation benefits, and benefits stemming from spillovers of a supplier's self‐promotion.

The study also suggests that the anticipation of performance effects which are salient to the buyer triggers efforts to improve the supplier's <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content>s. This research makes several contributions. First, the study identifies and analyzes the causal pathways through which a supplier's <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content>s influence buyers’ performance, thus contributing to the development of sustainable supply chain management theory. Second, the study helps buyers make better decisions about their suppliers. Finally, the study provides a conceptual platform for improved dialogue between stakeholders and buyers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Empirical evidence shows that investments in sustainable supply chain management can improve economic‐based performance. Thus, based on standard economic theory, rational business decision makers should and will implement sustainable supply chain management practices. However, through inductive research methods, we uncovered an intriguing theme that runs counter to both the existing empirical evidence and such economic‐based assumptions. We find that managers operating in firms without exemplary sustainable supply chain management practices face immense hurdles in developing a business case for implementing sustainability initiatives. Despite the lack of such practices—and in tension with the prevailing empirical evidence and theory—the firms within which these managers operate were performing well on economic‐based performance metrics. Departing from the neoclassical economic theory of the firm, we apply the Behavioral Theory of the Firm's theoretical assumptions to findings which suggest four segments of managers in non‐exemplary firms who vary based primarily on how they perceive strategic vulnerability, evaluate choices, and utilize sustainability knowledge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain engineering requires a design that possesses the flexibility of a complex adaptive system, consisting of interlinking architecture, with external dimensions and system germane internal elements. The aim of this paper is to critically analyse the key supply chain concepts and approaches, to assess the fit between the research literature and the practical issues of supply chain architecture, design and engineering. The objective is to develop a methodology for strategy engineering, which could be used by practitioners when integrating supply chain architecture and design. Taxonomic scheme is applied to consider criteria for strategy architecture, hierarchical strategy integration design, strategy engineering, and integration of supply chain as a conceptual system. The results from this paper derived with the findings that the relationship between supply chain architecture, design and engineering is weak, and challenges remain in the process of adapting and aligning operations. This paper derived with a novel approach for addressing these obstacles, through a conceptual framework diagram and a new methodology, based on the taxonomic scheme. The novelty that derives from this paper is an engineering design methodology for integrating supply chain architecture and design, with criteria that enable decomposing and building a green-field (new and non-existent) supply chain as a system. The taxonomic scheme revealed a number of tools and mechanism, which enabled the development of a new methodology for engineering integrated architecture and design. The review derived with improvements to current and existing theories for analysing interdependencies within and between their individual contexts. This issue is addressed with a hierarchical method for network design, applied for building and combining the integration criteria. The resulting methodology is field tested through a case study with the slate mining industry in North Wales. DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p52-66URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p52-66</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a new mathematical model is developed to optimize replenishment policies and inventory costs of a two-echelon supply chain system of kerosene product under demand uncertainty. The system consists of a fuel depot at the upper echelon and four petrol stations at the lower echelon. The petrol stations face stochastic stationary demand where inventory replenishment periods are uniformly fixed over the echelons. Adopting a Markov decision process approach, the states of a Markov chain represent possible states of demand for the inventory item. The replenishment cost, holding cost and shortage costs are combined with demand and inventory positions in order to generate the inventory cost matrix over the echelons. The matrix represents the long run measure of performance for the decision problem. The objective is to determine in each echelon of the planning horizon an optimal replenishment policy so that the long run inventory costs are minimized for a given state of demand. Using weekly equal intervals, the decisions of when to replenish additional units are made using dynamic programming over a finite period planning horizon. A numerical example demonstrates the existence of an optimal state-dependent replenishment policy and inventory costs over the echelons. DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p67-76URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p67-76</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study takes a conceptual theory building approach to develop a framework for managing supplier sustainability risk—the adverse impact on a buying organization from a supplier's social or environmental misconduct. Using anecdotal evidence and the literature, we present four distinct risk management strategies that supply managers adopt: risk avoidance, monitoring‐based risk mitigation, collaboration‐based risk mitigation, and risk acceptance. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, we study how the interactions of two key risk management predictors—that is, the supply managers’ perceived risk and the buyer–supplier dependence structure—affect supply managers’ strategy choice. Specifically, we propose that a collaborative‐based mitigation strategy, involving direct interaction and solution development with the suppliers, is selected by supply managers in a high perceived risk‐buyer dominant context. In a low perceived risk‐buyer dominant context, however, a monitoring‐based mitigation strategy is preferred. When the buyer and the supplier are not dependent on each other and there is a low perceived risk, the supply managers accept the risk by taking no actions, whereas in a high perceived risk‐independent context the supply managers would avoid the risk by terminating the relationship with the supplier. We conclude the study by describing the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study as well as the avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper to identify key organisational factors to building resiliency in supply chain, and to understand how these factors can influence the development or enhancement of the supply chain resilience. To do so, a multiple case study was performed in different supply chains to validate organisational factors identified on the literature. As a result, ten organisational factors (five internal and four external) were highlighted and propositions were developed after the cross-case discussion to affirm the influence of them in building or enhancing supply chain resilience. DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p77-95URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p77-95</jats:p>"

The research gaps include the research findings and results on the relationship between supply chain strategies and firm performance that have been contradicting and no attempt to clear the contradictions; biased and unbalanced analysis of the different measures of firm performance, and failure to use weighted scores to measure firm performance. Resource-Based View guided this study. A sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) firms was drawn using proportionate sampling from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. The response rate was seventy-five (75) percent. The correlation analysis and regression analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The study findings indicate that Supply chain strategies are useful predictors of the firm’s performance as supply chain strategies explain 76.7 % of the changes in the firm’s performance.DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p1-22 URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p1-22</jats:p>"

The increase of competitiveness and need of quick responses to the costumers implies the use of efficient management techniques. The control theory, particularly MPC, has been successfully used as a supply chain management tool. MPC is able to deal with dynamic interactions between the partners and to globally optimize the supply chain performance in the presence of disturbances. However, as far as is authors’ knowledge, there are no applications of this methodology in the forest-based supply chains. This work proposes a control architecture to improve the performance of the forest supply chain. The controller is based on prediction models which are able to simulate the system and deal with disturbances.Main results: The preliminary results enable to evaluate the impacts of disturbances in the supply chain. Thus, it is possible to react beforehand, controlling the schedules and tasks’ allocation, or alert the planning level in order to generate a new plan.Research highlights:   Overview of MPC applications in supply chains; forest-based supply chain description; case study presentation: wood biomass supply chain for energy production; MPC architecture proposal to decrease the operation times.Keywords: biomass; forest; Model Predictive Control; planning; supply chain.</jats:p>"

Scholars argue that commitment of employees is crucial to enhance the implementation of these initiatives. Drawing from intra‐organizational influence theory, this study examines how managers who champion these initiatives can gain employee affective commitment within a social network context. Prior research has investigated influence behavior by an individual (an agent) within the organization to gain the commitment of another individual (a target), by focusing on this agent–target dyad. Our research extends this single dyadic agent–target perspective, by investigating influence attempts within a more realistic, multi‐dyadic context in which influence attempts by multiple agents are possible and in fact likely, and in which an actor can be both an agent and a target. We identify a 90‐actor social network, resulting in 273 influence attempts surrounding the implementation of an environmental <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SCM</jats:styled-content> initiative at a large, multinational corporation, and investigate how the affective commitment of actors in this network is achieved. Based on the analysis of a generalized linear mixed model, the results suggest that if agents want to create a high level of target commitment, then consultation and to a lesser degree inspirational appeals seem to be key, while tactics such as rational persuasion, ingratiation, legitimating, and coalition are not related to affective commitment, within the context of a social network where multiple agents often attempt to influence a target.</jats:p>",

A metodologia consistiu de levantamento bibliográfico e análise documental de leis, decretos, portarias, regulamentos e relatórios de órgãos oficiais. O estudo indicou a tendência de fortalecimento do atendimento no campo da Educação Profissional (EP) das Instituições do Sistema S, mediante a venda de cursos ao governo, em sua quase totalidade de treinamento profissional de nível básico. Os dados analisados evidenciaram que a expansão da oferta de EP nestas instituições, sobretudo no Senai, ocorre mediante as transferências de recursos públicos via Bolsa Formação do Pronatec. Ao mesmo tempo, verificou-se que os cursos de formação profissional de nível técnico, articulados ao Ensino Médio, predominam na Rede Federal, a qual capta quantidade ínfima dos recursos do programa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cannabis is the most prolifically used illicit drug in Australia, however, there is a gap in our understanding concerning the social interactions and friendships formed around its supply and use. The authors recruited cannabis users aged between 18 and 30 years throughout Australia, to explore the impact of supply routes on young users and their perceived notions of drug dealing in order to provide valuable insight into the influence that reciprocal relationships have on young people’s access to cannabis. Findings reveal that the supply of cannabis revolves around pre-existing connections and relationships formed through associates known to be able to readily source cannabis. It was found that motivations for proffering cannabis in a shared environment were related more to developing social capital than to generating financial gain. Given this, often those involved in supply do not perceive that they are breaking the law or that they are ‘dealers’. This social supply market appears to be built on trust and social interactions and, as such, presents several challenges to law enforcement. It is suggested that there would be benefit in providing targeted education campaigns to combat social supply dealing among young adults.</jats:p>"

There are ways to mitigate the effect by adopting strategies with short- and long-term results. Water pressure management (PM) is one of the most efficient and effective NRW reduction strategies. To calculate pressure management of economic level of leakage (ELL), several steps have to be taken, such as full water costing, calculation of economic benefits and losses of PM interventions and definition of the related investment's break-even point. In this paper, the results of these three procedures required to define the ELL level are analyzed, in order to present the way they are linked together. The water distribution system of Kozani city (in Northern Greece) is used as the case study network. The results of both the net present values PM implementation results and the investment's break-even estimation are analyzed.</jats:p>",

The article examines the extent to which European policymakers have succeeded in building up governance capacity, and what the facilitating and impeding factors were that have shaped the governance mix. The conceptual framework differentiates between orders of governance in the multilevel context, and between policy modes involving hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings and varying actor constellations. The article finds that governance capacity has emerged where second order governance (institutional and procedural rules) is concerned, while first order governance (the concrete policy process) remains the remit of national and private actors. This becomes even more obvious once the interaction between policy modes is taken into account: governance networks enhance governance capacity in the area of competition policy and agency governance; self-regulation by industry constitutes a fall-back option in case of insufficient governance capacity on cross-border issues; soft governance helps to bridge multiple policy areas and levels of governance. The article concludes that second order governance may prove effective where it combines with hierarchy but that it may fail to overcome both trade-offs between contradicting goals and resistance at lower levels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the world's first land-based desalination plant was established in Australia in 1903, brackish groundwater and seawater desalination became a common water supply technology in many countries around the world. Desalination has proven as a reliable technology in times of drought and/or water scarcity, while in some countries it is an indispensable water supply source on a regular basis. This paper compares and evaluates major desalination leaders in the world (USA, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Australia, and China) with the aim of pointing out similarities and differences that made each of them successful. It also depicts a comprehensive picture of developments, trends and experiences in desalination at the global scale. Establishing desalination plants and ensuring their successful operation is a complex and multifaceted process dependent on capital and operational costs, production capacity, water salinity, geographical location, socio-economic and environmental conditions, and many other factors. The country specific comparison presented in this paper emphasizes the importance of regional planning for successful and sustainable desalination processes in the long term.</jats:p>",

Logistics management has significant impacts on various aspects of supply chains such as response time, total supply chain cost, sourcing risk, customer service, security, etc. The results show that 3PL services vary based on industry served, region served, and asset ownership structure. Over the years logistics services providers have served more industry sectors, became asset light, and provided broader services. Two of the five service categories, technology services and special services, have been evolved and expanded rapidly. The development has strengthened the capabilities of the logistics service providers and sustained the growth of the industry.DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p23-35URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p23-35</jats:p>"

However, despite the benefits stemming from enhanced information corroboration and expertise spillover, CSRSCPAs face the challenge of potential information collusion. It finds that the CSRSCPA has a negative effect on discretionary accruals. Hence, this study looks at supply chain CPAs in the context of the company’s CSR performance to find out the impact of the company’s financial statements. In addition, the results of this study indicate that both a positive earnings quality and a positive public response ensue when the Big 4 audit firms audit CSR companies. Our results show that market participants highly value Big 4 supply chain CPAs with industry experience and that these impressions extend to their evaluation of clients. The inclusion of different supply chain streams reveal that upstream CSRSCPA are more likely than middlestream and downstream CSRSCPA to receive favorable reactions from market participants. This is an indication that market participants are impressed by the specific expertise and knowledge of these professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The results of a novel model experimental approach via sample data ordering unveil considerable heterogeneity across different wage groups. Yet, surprisingly constant wage elasticity estimates are maintained within certain wage groups over time. In addition to those constant wage elasticity estimates, we find that the composition of working women into different wage groups has changed considerably, resulting in shrinking wage elasticity estimates at the aggregate level. These findings would be impossible to obtain had we not dismantled and discarded the instrumental variable estimation route.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the supply management of a primary input, where this input gives rise to multiple products in fixed proportions. My objective is twofold. First, I study fixed proportions technology under demand uncertainty in comparison with the flexible and dedicated technologies. I show that fixed proportions technology has a cost-pooling value over dedicated technology, which is larger than the capacity-pooling value of flexible technology over dedicated technology. I identify the critical role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which decreases in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value increases in demand correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability. However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted as a response to a change in the business environment should differ depending on the contract type. My results have implications about the new product strategy and the procurement contract choice of the processors in the agricultural industries. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

One of more important issues of every distribution centre, i.e. portions of deliveries smaller than truck capacity for particular consumers, is also discussed. This problem was formulated for the first time in dairy industry, therefore, it was called milk runs. Moreover, the authors of this paper presented the outcome analysis of survey carried out among construction engineers and managers. This study aimed at determining organizational principles for logistic centre working with CSC framework. The mathematical model depicting milk runs deliveries with overtime consideration, done for many construction sites within a distribution centre is presented hereunder. This model may be potentially used to optimize distribution centres working within cluster supply chain framework.</jats:p>"

Complex adaptive systems literature is reviewed, and the world aluminum production system described. This includes identification of system elements, their relationships, interactions, and developments. Analysis in terms of how this production system exhibits complex adaptive systemic behavior across the supply chain is provided. The decentralized behavior of the overall primary aluminum system provides understanding of how individual agents, be they multinational firms, individual governments, or cartels are unable to totally control the system in the long run.</jats:p>",

The left and right internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) along with their collateral branches also serve as a source of NCCMBF-a feature seen in other mammals. Under certain circumstances the ITAs have a high potential for developing collateral branches. In the case of severe Leriche syndrome or with chronic obstruction of the abdominal aorta, the ITAs can serve as the main or even sole source of blood supply to the lower limbs. It is also possible for the ITAs to develop angiographically visible branches that directly connect with the coronary arteries. In ischemic conditions there is a functional, ischemia-reducing extracardiac coronary artery supply via natural ipsilateral ITA anastomosis. To date we know little about NCCMBF and its potential benefits in clinical applications, which makes this a challenging and intriguing field of research.

Three DM techniques (i.e. model tree, artificial neural network, and radial basis function) were employed to develop a WQEMD based on watershed characteristics (e.g. hydrology, geology, and land usage). To represent watershed characteristics, three cases and ten scenarios were considered. The three cases were defined as (1) the size (area) allocation of sub-watersheds, (2) the watershed imperviousness ratio, and (3) the combination of the area and imperviousness ratio. The ten scenarios were composed of the following parameters; impervious, pervious, land usage, rainfall, slope. The best WQEMDs were subsequently developed using statistics (correlation coefficient, mean-absolute error, root mean-squared error, and root relative-squared error). In addition, the WQEMDs developed were then verified using the Geum-Sum-Youngsan River watershed. The percentage difference of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorus (T-P) were 30.6%, 23.44%, and 2.79%, respectively. The results show that a WQEMD developed in this way is effective and can be used in place of a physical watershed model and is useful to aid in determining areas having the best potential for successful remediation.</jats:p>",

To improve the adaptivity of drinking water treatment and stabilize the quality of treated water, a raw water quality assessment method, which is based upon the support vector machine (SVM), is developed in this study. Compared to existing raw water quality assessment methods, the assessment method studied herein is oriented to drinking water treatment and can directly be used for the control of the chemical (alum and ozone) dosing process. To this end, based upon the productive experiences and the analysis of the operating data of water supply, a raw water quality assessment standard oriented to drinking water treatment is proposed. A raw water quality model is set up to assess the raw water quality based upon the SVM technique. Based upon the raw water quality assessment results, a feedforward–feedback control scheme has been designed for the chemical dosing process control of drinking water treatment. Thus, the chemical dosage can be adjusted in time to cope with raw water quality variations and hence, the quality of the treated water is stabilized. Experimental results demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the proposed method of raw water quality assessment and the feedforward–feedback control scheme.</jats:p>",

The effect of ambient temperature on the ability of the BSF to remove microbes from water is unclear. Model filters were distributed among different temperature-controlled laboratories and dosed daily with surface water amended with sewage. Comparison of the total coliform and Escherichia coli counts in the influent versus effluent revealed an immediate drop in the removal efficiencies of filters held in colder rooms. This performance difference, however, became less pronounced over the course of the experiment until no significant performance difference was detected between filters regardless of their ambient temperature, perhaps due to microbial adaptation within the BSFs. Subsequently, two-thirds of the filters were exposed to freezing temperatures, thawed, and re-tested for microbial removal. All filters exposed to freezing temperatures showed significant drops in microbial removal compared to control filters. Filters exposed to the most extreme temperatures showed the greatest drop in performance.</jats:p>",

The present approach of dividing water distribution systems lacks an assessment index and is characterized by a low degree of automation. With the building of a mathematical model, this paper introduces two indicators – pressure limitation and pressure variation – to enable the automatic division of the water supply pipe network. It prioritizes economic index as the objective function in the evaluation of the division of water distribution systems in hilly areas, and then selects the optimal division scheme by generic algorithm in a large number of candidates. The SY terrain in YW City China is used for verification.

This concern was already present in Norris and Lovenduski's (1995) original model, which called for a deeper examination of the “interaction effects” between “supply” and “demand.” In engaging with this call, I argue that the constraining effects of supply are reinforced not only by the demands of party selectors, but also by the everyday (gendered) functioning of political parties, which helps us understand the differential chances of women and men eventually becoming candidates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain contracts, such as the markdown money policy (MMP), are commonly adopted in the fashion industry. In this paper, we explore how fashion companies can use MMP to enhance economic sustainability from the cross-cultural perspective. We conduct case studies on two fashion firms (suppliers), one from China and one from U.S.A., that are adopting MMP in their respective supply chains. Via semi-structured interviews with staff members and some public data searching of the target companies, we find that the cultural factors, such as power distance and collectivism/individualism, affect contract selection, contract management, supplier–retailer leadership, and supplier–retailer relationship. We use the Hofstede’s national cultural dimensions theory to explain our insights. Specifically, in China, a country with a relatively high degree of power distance and collectivism, the companies tend to care more about the group interest and loyalty. The Chinese fashion companies are more willing to play the leading role in managing the relationships with their retailers, and offer MMP to them. In the U.S.A., a country with a relatively low degree of power distance and individualism, the companies are more likely to emphasize their own interest in trading. In fact, we find that American fashion suppliers tend to bargain with their retailers, and they are less willing to proactively provide the markdown money as a sponsor. Finally, managerial implications are provided, and several future challenges on MMP are examined.</jats:p>"

Firms need to acquire or exchange resources with their supplier or buyer partners to stay at the leading edge of technology. Cooperation between buyers and suppliers is important and power is the mechanism that can explain the cooperative behaviors. This study aims to investigate how the power structure between the buyer and supplier influences the extent of suppliers’ cooperative behaviors, and the effects of these on buyer satisfaction with the buyer-supplier relationship. Opinions from firms in semiconductor manufacturing supply chain were used to investigate the proposed model. It is found that mutual interdependence between a supplier and its buyer can enhance cooperative behaviors and power asymmetry hurt firms’ investment in cooperative behaviors. Suggestions are then provided to semiconductor supply chain members based on the findings of this work.</jats:p>"

The method is dedicated to the development of schedules of product flows through particular production plants (links in supply chains) and between individual plants. Each module of the developed system refers to a separate production plant. The organization of product flow through production lines covers different types of production routes and different configurations of production systems. At the first level of the method, preliminary production schedules are developed for each plant within the supply chain. The second level of the method is dedicated to the development of delivery schedules of components and semi-finished products to these plants. The determined delivery times of components to the individual production plants constitute data for the third level of the method. At this lowest level, detailed schedules of product flow through production lines with the producers of complex goods are developed. Linear mathematical models have been built for each level of the method. In the developed method, optimization take place in the developed method in the scale of the entire supply chain (cost reduction), as well as in the scale of its links (production lines for which manufacturing schedules are built with various criteria taken into consideration). The computational experiments used for verification of the method have been included.</jats:p>",

Further, supply chain innovation helps a firm to sustain its position in the market place through generation and launching of new products and services. Accordingly, the influence of supply chain innovation on firm performance is also investigated.

Presently it is the state capital of Himachal Pradesh. Total water demand (2014) is 58.46 million litres per day (MLD) against system capacity of 54.54 MLD. The present deficit of 3.92 MLD (2014) may amplify to 59.01 MLD in 2051. Resource assessment in the related watersheds namely, Ashwani, Nauti, Giri and Pabbar accomplished using remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) based Arc-SWAT hydrological model. Average annual precipitation in all watersheds for 26 years (1984–2010) is about 1,005 mm, out of which about 34% flows as runoff, 8% as groundwater and about 58% as evapotranspiration. Being ungauged watersheds, water balance equation considered as the validation criteria, coefficient of correlation ‘R’ between observed rainfall and simulated runoff varies from 0.94–0.96. Results further validated through actual measurement of inflow in lean period in one of the major sources, i.e. Giri River, which has shown very good correlation (R = 0.95) between simulated and observed stream flow. The study establishes that existing sources are not sustainable. IWMP suggests, source augmentation coupled with rainwater harvesting and reuse of wastewater as long-term strategic measures.</jats:p>",

This is against the backdrop of the critical roles play by the migrants infilling the farm labour supply deficit; which is occasioned by high rural-urban drift (annual estimate is 37%). Data for the study were obtained from a sample survey of 766 rural migrants drawn from 81 communities in Southwestern Nigeria via a multistage sampling technique. The result shows that the migrants were from within and outside the country. About 76% of the migrants worked as farm labourers in the receiving community while wage employment accounted for about 80% of total employment. The logistic regression estimates reveal that, among other factors, previous migration efforts, household’ and community’ socio-economic and development statuses reduce the odds in favor of migrants’ willingness to settle in the receiving rural community.\n\t</jats:p>",

CTM has raised significant interest of both researchers and practitioners. Sharing information is the most basic form of coordination in supply chains to integrate CTM models at strategic, tactical, and operational levels. However, little has been known about the state of the art of CTM models. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the current state of CTM models. The overview of the CTM models is organized by classifying the previous literatures on different collaborative structures and different levels of planning. This paper also presents the relevant solution techniques used for each planning level. A review on the current state of CTM models concludes by highlighting the unaddressed areas or the gaps existing in the current literatures and by suggesting directions for future research in CTM. DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p96-119URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p96-119</jats:p>"

Numerous sources of scientific literature on the subject propose that namely dynamic capabilities have become one of the most important players in this global competition game. The analysis carried out, revealed that concepts of organizational dynamic capabilities and supply chain are closely related and affected by one another. This paper proposes a universal model of impact of dynamic capabilities of organizations on changes in the stages of supply chain. The main purpose of the article is to complete a theoretical analysis of supply chain and dynamic capabilities, to create and to verify theoretical model, seeking to identify which organizational dynamic capabilities impact the changes on the stages of supply chain mostly. While carrying out the research the following general research methods have been employed: systematic, comparative and logical analysis of the scientific literature, modeling, focus group, survey (questionnaire interview), grouping and detailing. The core results of the study could be revealed as following: the impact of dynamic capabilities on changes in the stages of supply chain of the examined companies is mostly influenced by: prevailing teamwork and leadership culture; strict regulation of labour relationships and duties, which implies poor significance of sensing and integrating; miscommunication between organization units, the problem of asymmetric information, surplus administrative procedures and other.</jats:p>",

The gap between the demand and supply of natural gas, domestically, and China’s high dependence on foreign sources, highlights the importance of ensuring a secure system for supplying natural gas in the country. This study applied ecological network analysis, a powerful systems-oriented method, to simulate interactions between different nodes of the natural gas supply system and to evaluate the system’s security level. Two network models were constructed at the regional and national layers, respectively, by dividing external natural gas suppliers into multiple regions and countries. These models were used to evaluate the overall security level and related characteristics of China’s natural gas supply system from 2000 to 2012. The results showed stable improvement in the system’s security during this period. With the exceptions of some specific indicators (e.g., the mutualism index (MI)), analyses of network information and structure yielded the mostly similar results for the two models. In conclusion, a regional layer (RL) network model is considered more economical than a national layer (NL) model for evaluating the overall security of China’s natural gas supply system, especially when available data are limited.</jats:p>"

The author further investigated the existence of a link between institutional quality and factors of production. The results show that capital, entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment are the major determinants of production of tradable goods in COMESA. In exception of Mauritius and Namibia (currently no longer a member) the rest of COMESA member states have very poor institutional quality. This affects their ability to attract foreign direct investment hence production of tradable goods. Voice and accountability, government effectiveness, rule of law and political stability play a major role in increasing production of tradable goods in COMESA. Foreign direct investment is affected by voice and accountability, rule of law and political stability than any other factors. Availability of raw material is affected by government effectiveness, regulatory quality, political stability, voice and accountability and control of corruption. Capital is very sensitive to issues of voice and accountability and control of corruption and regulatory quality.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban water managers around the world are adopting decentralized water supply systems, often in combination with centralized systems. While increasing demand for water arising from population growth is one of the primary reasons for this increased adoption of alternative technologies, factors such as climate change, increased frequency of extreme weather events and rapid urbanization also contribute to an increased rate of adoption of these technologies. This combination of centralized-decentralized water systems approach is referred to as “hybrid water supply systems” and is based on the premise that the provision of alternative water sources at local scales can both extend the capacity of existing centralized water supply infrastructures, and improve resilience to variable climatic conditions. It is important to understand, however, that decentralized water production and reuse may change the flow and composition of wastewater and stormwater, thereby potentially also having negative impacts on its effectiveness and performance. This paper describes a framework to assess the interactions between decentralized water supply systems and existing centralized water servicing approaches using several analytical tools, including water balance modelling, contaminant balance modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis. The framework enables the evaluation of impacts due to change in quantity and quality of wastewater and stormwater on the existing centralized system arising from the implementation of hybrid water supply systems. The framework consists of two parts: (1) Physical system analysis for various potential scenarios and (2) Ranking of Scenarios. This paper includes the demonstration of the first part of the framework for an area of Melbourne, Australia by comparing centralized water supply scenario with a combination of centralized water supply and reuse of treated waste water supply scenario.</jats:p>"

The results demonstrated that when DO was sufficient (about 8 mg · L−1), ammonia, iron and manganese could be completely removed. When DO decreased from 6.5 to 4 mg · L−1, the concentration of ammonia in the effluent increased accordingly, though iron and manganese were removed efficiently. When DO was as low as 3 mg · L−1, only iron was removed, whereas most of the ammonia and manganese still existed in the effluent. In addition, the oxidizing rates of the pollutants were not affected significantly with DO decrease. Turbidity removal in the biofilter was also investigated, and the results demonstrated that the turbidity decreased to less than 0.5 NTU at 0.4 m depth of the filter.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Poor cost recovery, owing to inherent problems associated with intermittent water service, is common in the majority of towns and cities in India. The water supply in twin cities of Hubli–Dharwad, located in North Karnataka, India, was characterized by several issues such as water losses, poor service delivery, low cost recovery and low investments. Provision of water service to the twin cities was the responsibility of the Hubli–Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) until 2003. The municipal revenues were affected by the large gap between revenue and expenditure on account of poor performance of the water division of the corporation, which further impeded the efforts to improve water service. In 2003, due to deteriorating performance with regard to water supply, the Government of Karnataka transferred the responsibility for maintenance of the water service to the Karnataka Urban Water Supply &amp; Drainage Board (KUWS&amp;DB). The KUWS&amp;DB along with the HDMC adopted a multi-pronged strategy to improve cost recovery. The sustained efforts for over a decade (2003–2013) led to a gradual increase in full cost recovery from about 12% in 2003 to 47% in 2013. This study examines the impact of the multi-pronged approach adopted for improving cost recovery in water supply in the twin cities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Syngenta’s European seed business relies on Syngenta’s supply chain to supply seed products to various European markets, which generated more than $1.2 billion in revenues in 2013. The seed supply chain is, however, exposed to a high level of uncertainty on both the demand and supply sides. Determining optimal production volumes in a highly volatile environment and more than a year prior to the sales period is a complex business decision that can significantly affect the company’s profitability through lost sales and unsold supply. To better handle the production-volume planning, Syngenta developed a planning tool that determines optimal production volumes by considering the various levels of uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss this tool, its impact, and integration into Syngenta’s planning process and technical design. In 2013, its first year in use, the production optimization tool avoided approximately $1.5 million in supply discards and led Syngenta to revise its approach to handling uncertainty in its supply-chain planning. </jats:p>",

To date, the phenomenon of ‘private education for the poor’ has been principally studied in Asian and African countries, where the deficit of state educational supply has given rise to a multiplicity of private education undertakings of diverse nature. Using official statistical data, this article explores and describes the structure of private education supply in areas of low socioeconomic status in Buenos Aires and assesses the extent to which the category of low-fee private school (LFPS) contributes to understanding this phenomenon. Our analysis reveals a great heterogeneity in this sector of private education in Buenos Aires with regard to financing structures, monthly fees, and the legal forms in which schools operate. We also find the presence of a significant religious component. We suggest the possibility that private provision has helped to mitigate coverage imbalances at a 'micro-local' level in some of the studied areas. Our comparative approach evidences that the notion of LFPS provides a more normative than descriptive view, limiting the perception of a phenomenon that is actually much broader, multifaceted and dynamic.</jats:p>"

In most rural areas of developing countries including Nigeria water supplies are not commensurate with demand leading to a shortfall in water use and many people suffer from this scenario. This research investigated the factors responsible for rural residential water supply shortage in Southeastern Nigeria. Data were collected through the use of four mixed but complimentary methods namely questionnaire survey, interviews, focus group discussions and secondary data sources. The data generated were analyzed through the use of descriptive and inferential statistical tools. Principal Component Analysis was employed to combine the variables accounting for water supply shortage into a few underlying dimensions. The results indicated that physical environment and inadequate water supply infrastructure; socio-economic and geographical location; management and socio-cultural problems are responsible for water supply shortage in the area. Residential water supply can be sustainable in the area by regulating the influence of these factors impacting on water supply as well as lessen the implications of water deficiency. The research concludes that the process of water supply development should be stepwise in accordance with the participatory and managerial capacity of communities.</jats:p>",

The associated consequences bring new challenges to the ESP development concept, increasing ESP exposure to free gas and power requirements. Therefore, operating and maximizing production of Al Khalij field requires not only integrated thermo-hydraulic fluid modeling from reservoir to surface, but also ESP gas handling and power supply managements. Integrated modeling is a cross-functioning simulation, monitoring and decision tool capturing the interactions from reservoir to surface facilities and from today to the end of field life. This paper describes the associated benefits of an innovative Al Khalij field Integrated Asset Model embedded into live data environment and performing production optimization accounting for ESP gas handling (gas volume factor and minimum bottom-hole pressure) and power supply management constraints (ESP motor, variable speed drive and wells and platforms transformers). As for any Integrated Asset Model, the reservoir, the wells, and the network thermo-hydraulic behaviors have been calibrated on the production data. The reliability of the well models to reproduce the measured production data has been demonstrated and is described in this paper. It has even proven capability to detect abnormal hydraulic and electrical behavior of the ESP motor and/or the pump. In the Integrated Asset Model, the intensity and voltage values are calculated at the ESP motor, the variable speed drive and the wells and platforms transformers levels. The electrical load based on these equipments design is used through an innovative workflow to constraint the field production optimization together with the free gas management constraints. The Integrated Asset Model has then been embedded into a live data environment of the field (DOF) for monitoring and automated models management and is used to further optimize the production including ESP free gas and power supply managements, and to anticipate on future debottlenecks.</jats:p>",

Boron, one of these chemicals which is considered as a threatening compound and is difficult to eliminate from water. The purpose of the research is to study the major role of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) process which can contribute to the removal of this inorganic element from brackish water. For this reason, two RO and two NF membranes have been used to reduce boron and total salinity of brackish water. Since boron is a problematic compound, its elimination would also not be easy. To optimize these removal rates, two solutions based on the change of the chemical state of boron in water, either by varying the pH solution or by a complexation reaction, have been proposed in this work. Obtained results show that for both solutions, the boron removal percentage has clearly improved and reached 95% for the first case and 70% for the second.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Concepts like supply chain network complexity, interdependence and risk assessment have been prominently discussed directly and indirectly in management literature over past decades and plenty of frameworks and conceptual prescriptive research works have been published contributing towards building the body of knowledge. However previous studies often lacked quantification of the findings. Consequently, the need for suitable scales becomes prominent for measuring those constructs to empirically support the conceptualized relationships. This paper expands the understanding of supply chain network complexity (SCNC) and also highlights its implications on interdependence (ID) between the actors and risk assessment (RAS) in transaction relationships. In doing so, SCNC and RAS are operationalized to understand how SCNC affects interdependence and risk assessment between the actors in the supply chain network. The contribution of this study lies in developing and validating multi-item scales for these constructs and empirically establishing the hypothesized relationships in the Indian context based on firm data collected using survey–based questionnaire. The methodology followed included structural equation modeling. The study findings indicate that SCNC had significant relationship with interdependence, which in turn significantly affected risk assessment. This study carries both academic and managerial implications and provides an empirically supported framework linking network complexity with the two key variables (ID and RAS), playing crucial roles in managerial decision making. This study contributes to the body of knowledge and aims at guiding managers in better understanding transaction relationships.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article will show which legal measures could lead to more sound use of phosphorus, and which might not. From the perspective of natural science, there are varying accounts as to how long phosphorus will still be available. It is, however, undisputed that phosphorus is a finite resource with vital importance to humankind. It is also certain that overusing phosphorus causes environmental damage further increased by permanent application. In this context, the usage of phosphorus from stocks contaminated by heavy metals might increasingly become an issue. Regulatory policy incentives are required towards establishing more sound phosphorus use with increased focus on recycling. So far, phosphorus has involved tentative proclamations rather than legally binding measures. However, classical regulatory measures directed at single actions – the command-and-control approach – will not suffice in addressing resource and environmental problems, as phosphorus problems are more appropriately viewed as quantity problems. Additional economic instruments are needed in order to avoid enforcement deficits, rebound and shifting effects, and to promote recycling while decreasing phosphorus consumption. These economic instruments would also help in addressing several environmental problems regarding land use, resources, biodiversity loss and climate change all at once.</jats:p>",

The success of monetary policy in achieving its objectives depends on the degree of controllability of M1 and M2 by Bangladesh Bank. This paper empirically examines the money supply process on the basis by the mainstream of Post-liberalization period covering the sample period of 1972/73-2009/10. It also Examine how M1 and M2 will be affected by the Speed of adjustment that is equal to the difference between deposit interest rate and nominal interest rate. The money supply function for Bangladesh has been empirically tested by using annual time series data. We have found that remittance is the most significant factor that highly influenced on narrow and broad money supply in Bangladesh.\r\nJEL Code: E31, E43, E51, E52</jats:p>"

However, there is a lack of theoretical definitions and field studies that explain this phenomenon in depth. Thus, this study aims to characterize the level of cross-integration, the factors that generate it and the impacts on organizational performance. For this, interviews with managers of Operations, R&amp;D and Marketing/Commercial areas, from two multinational companies based in Minas Gerais were performed. The results indicate that the level of integration can be analyzed as a combination of three factors: 1) absence of overlapping of perceptions about integration factors over the processes, balance between formality and informality, and absence of manifest conflicts of interest. This is a setting that provides a deeper definition than those obtained in the studied literature, which basically present integration mechanisms, without detailing how these should be applied in order to generate higher levels of integration. DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p36-51URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p36-51</jats:p>"

Fifteen runs were conducted in triplicate using a full-scale BSF with a pore volume of 19.6 L, and the performance of the filter was assessed by monitoring total coliforms, Escherichia coli and turbidity of the effluent. Results showed that there was a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of filtered water when the pause time was increased from 12 to 36 h, while it deteriorated as charge volume was increased from 10 to 30 L. The effluent microbiological quality was unaffected by changes in the influent turbidity in the range of 10–50 NTU. Further, effluent turbidity was not significantly affected by the changes in any of the operating parameters, and it remained below 1.5 NTU in all the runs. At optimum conditions of pause time 23 h, charge volume 19.4 L and influent turbidity 32 NTU, bacterial removal exceeded 99.4%. The results show that charging of the filter with about one pore volume of water once a day would be the ideal operating strategy for a BSF.</jats:p>",

Actions on climate change launched by government have become a national consensus to various countries, while actions by private sectors, establishment and operation of relevant market mechanisms are also an important approach to address climate change through global cooperation. We have undertaken the construction of international or regional carbon market, clean energy quota market, Energy Management Contracting (EMC) and other market mechanisms, laying a solid foundation for further exploring market mechanism that enhances international climate governance, which also illustrates the significance of market mechanism to international community. New market mechanisms continue to be explored in market activities, and green supply chain management is one of them. Green supply chain management refers to the monitoring and management of impact on environment in the processes of acquisition, transportation, and storage of raw materials, distribution and utilization of products, and disposal of waste products while considering the impact of production processes on environment as well. Green supply chain management, as a market-based mean which balances climate environmental performance and economic benefits, will enable enterprises to include the influence of whole process of production on the climate and environment into decision-making process, launch green monitoring to the whole production cycle of product, so as to realize green and low-carbon development of enterprises. Green supply chain management not only has direct influence on enterprises to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction, but also has positive meaning to industrial transformation and upgrading, high-end development of manufacturing industry, and promoting the construction of ecological civilization, which accords with economic and industrial development of China in the future, worth being explored and practiced as a new market mechanism. </jats:p>",

The article shows that Vietnam ‘delivers’ rationalised development policy to international donors through its system of state administration and planning, the implementation of target‐oriented planning and the role of statistics in the policy process.

Here, the contribution of soil sources to river bed sediments has been quantified in Emu Creek, a headwater catchment in south eastern Queensland, Australia. Soil samples were collected from the eight major rock types present in the catchment and were related to river bed sediments collected from eight sites along the main channel. Geochemistry, as characterized by 39 elemental concentrations, was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Three particle size fractions were examined, &lt;10, 10–63 and 63–212 µm, with the three resultant mixing models showing divergent results. We conclude that the results of sediment mixing models based on the analysis of one grain size should not be assumed to apply across the entire particle size range of transported sediment, emphasizing the need to match the size fraction used in tracing studies to that size fraction of interest in downstream sinks. Furthermore, we present results highlighting the control transport distance plays in source dominance, with this particularly evident in the coarser fraction, where local sources dominate over more distant sources.

This study is based on a comprehensive set of cross-sectional data collected from 950 farmers from all four major provinces in Pakistan. The empirical analysis indicated that farmers with a water-scarcity problem have lower yield and household income, and are food insecure. Poverty levels were higher: in the range of 7–12% for a household facing a water-scarcity problem. The policy implications of the study are that the public and private sector in Pakistan needs to invest in irrigation water management to maintain the productivity of cereal crops which is important for household food security and poverty reduction.</jats:p>",

Advanced oxidation processes, such as the ferrous iron (Fe2+)-activated persulfate process, have been proven to be effective for organic pollutants. However, few studies have focused on the effects of coexisting ions on the degradation of aniline. In this study, the degradation efficiency of aniline and the effects of common inorganic ions (CO32−, PO43−, HCO3−, SO42−, NO3−, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) on aniline degradation were examined. Under the optimum operating conditions, 86.33% aniline degradation (C0 = 11 mmol/L) was observed within 60 min. The effects of cations on aniline degradation were negligible. Anions decreased the removal efficiency of aniline because of the radicals generated by the reaction between sulfate radical or hydroxyl radical and these anions. As the concentrations of PO43−, CO32−, SO42−, HCO3−, and NO3− increased from 0 mmol/L to 5 mmol/L, the removal efficiency of aniline decreased to 19.72%, 24.56%, 66.76%, 68.76%, and 82.42%, respectively. The order of inhibitory effects was PO43− &amp;gt; CO32− &amp;gt; &amp;gt;SO42− &amp;gt; HCO3− &amp;gt; &amp;gt;NO3−.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has appeared to be important in business practices in order to survive in the competition. Sustainable performance assessment, that includes economic, social, and environmental aspects need to be given due attention by the business players in order to understand the position of the company so that it can fulfill customer satisfaction. In this research, each of the aspects is measured using different methods. The Economic performance assessment is represented using the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model that helps in measuring the success of a supply chain operation. It uses 15 indicators deemed relevant in the Make-to-Stock production typology that is distributed into five performance attributes. The economic assessment is then obtained through these performance attributes that result in 97.5% in agility, 92% in cost, 78.2% in reliability, 72% in asset management, and 40.67% in responsiveness. Meanwhile, the social performance assessment is directed at employee's welfare. Questionnaires are distributed to 30 employees to measure company's commitment to address their social issues. It results in a perfect score as 100% in fair salary, annual allowance, and training, while health insurance and safety equipment only cover 70% and 30%, respectively. The environmental aspect is noticed on the wastewater management, since it mainly contributes for company's waste. The assessment lies on the liquid contamination test and is compared to the maximum standard level, set by the government. Environmental assessment shows 76.8% in acidity, 71.93% in Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), 33.15% in temperature, and 0% in both Total Suspended Solid (TSS) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). While this research is focusing on improving the performance in the supply chain process (Economic aspect), which is the worst assessment in the economic aspect, which is responsiveness, it is selected to be improved to reach an optimum performance. Therefore, the operation-overlapping approach is applied in the scheduling of the production process to improve company’s responsiveness, which is from 40.67% to 60.67%.</jats:p>"

The firm can choose to sell products separately and/or through a bundle. We find that the impact of limited supply on a firm's bundling decision depends on the correlation between the consumer valuations of the two products as well as the symmetry level of the two products in terms of their attractiveness (how much they are valued by consumers). When the valuation correlation is high and the symmetry level of the two products is low, limited supply can drive bundling. When the valuation correlation is low or the symmetry level is high, limited supply can drive no bundling. When the attractiveness of both products are low or the valuation correlation is very high, limited supply has no impact on a firm's bundling decision: The firm should not bundle for all supply levels. </jats:p><jats:p> This study offers a new driver for product bundling: the limited supply of a product. The existing bundling literature suggests that a firm should bundle symmetric products that have a low consumer valuation correlation, when bundling is driven by consumer valuation heterogeneity reduction. In contrast, when bundling is driven by limited supply, a firm should bundle asymmetric products with a high consumer valuation correlation. The benefit of supply‐driven bundling depends on the severity of supply limitation. When supply limitation is moderate, bundling creates value by expanding the market of the less attractive product. When supply limitation is severe, bundling enables a firm to extract a higher margin from the less attractive product. </jats:p>",

Tarnów agglomeration is supplied with water from extensively exploited surface and groundwater intakes located at the confluence of the rivers Dunajec and Biała. Groundwater intakes capture water from the Quaternary aquifer, which is recharged by rainfall and direct infiltration from the rivers and irrigation ditches. Hydrogeological conditions occurring within the area under consideration were mapped by using a single-layer numerical model in Processing Modflow software. After calibrating the simulation model, a simulation-optimization approach was developed with the aim of aiding the process of searching for the best scheme of exploitation of groundwater intake. The unit response matrix method was used to connect the simulation model with the optimization procedure. In the optimization task the objective functions concerning the total volume of groundwater intake discharge and infiltration amount from the River Dunajec or irrigation ditches were applied. Several constraints concerned both the maximum and minimum capacity of individual wells and the entire intake, as well as desirable or undesirable drawdown values in selected control points and control areas. Finally, twelve variants of optimization tasks, for different boundary conditions and different objective functions, were solved and optimal schemes of well discharge distribution within the intake were calculated. The results of optimization show that, depending on the intended objective and the constraints imposed, the best exploitation scenario under the given conditions may be found.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Iran, like many parts of the world, suffers from water scarcity and is located in one of the most arid regions. This is not only due to the low rates of precipitation received, but also due to the increase in demand on water resources for municipal, agricultural, and industrial uses. Wastewater reuse has proven to be effective and successful in creating a new and reliable water supply. Also, it can meet environmental needs, sustainable development, and a viable economy. There are two strategies for reuse implementation: (1) a future oriented approach allows structured planning within a broader wastewater management master plan and gives the greatest flexibility for reuse; (2) the available effluent quality from existing treatment plants defines the possible reuse option. According to the present situation in Iran, the second strategy is more reliable in preserving the country from absolute scarcity in future. Thus, the objective of this article is to understand the hidden comprehensive potential of reuse in three major categories: agricultural, industrial, and municipal uses, according to the improvement in the Falkenmark indicator.</jats:p>",

However, many studies conducted in Tamil Nadu, have pointed out several issues such as inadequacy of crop loan amount owing to lower scale of finance and minimum focus on long term agricultural advances that are hampering the banking services directed towards agricultural development. In order to address these issues, an attempt was made in the present study to assess the causes for and consequences of credit gap in the disbursement of short term / crop loan to the sample farm households; Results of the study indicated that the credit gap I (Credit requirement - Scale of finance) and Credit Gap-II (Credit Requirement - Credit Sanctioned) per ha of paddy were lesser in ST borrower farms, which indicted that though the scale of finance for paddy has been fixed at higher level, i.e., well above the credit requirement, the actual credit disbursement was far lesser than the credit requirement. The working capital, in general, enhances the productivity of the crop and the external financial assistance could help farmers in purchasing the necessary farm inputs in adequate quantities and thereby the farm productivity could be improved. But the scale finance itself was far lesser than the working capital required for cultivating paddy in all categories of farms and this resulted in the wider credit gaps in the different farm categories.\n</jats:p>"

Existing literature has demonstrated the potential for diminishing returns to the breadth of relationships but less attention has been paid to the depth of relationships. We combine resource based theory with social capital perspectives to consider the depth of vertical inter‐firm relationships and their impact on innovation for a focal firm. Using multivariate analysis to examine supplier‐led and user‐led innovation across firms in UK manufacturing, we find that embedded relationships in either direction correlate with both product and/or process innovation. However, with further depth of embeddedness, simultaneous and varied effects on product and process innovations occur. Our findings suggest that managers need to understand the unique dynamics of relationship depth (in addition to breadth) upon product and process innovation otherwise the focal firm may waste managerial effort and resources in relationship building.</jats:p>",

The removal of these protozoans and the adaptation of existing protocols are essential for supplying drinking water to developing countries. Considering this, the aim of this study is to evaluate, on a bench level, the removal of Giardia spp. cysts and of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts from water with high turbidity, using polyaluminium chloride as a coagulant. Filtration using mixed cellulose ester membranes, followed, or not, by purification through immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was used for detecting protozoans. By evaluating the adopted protocol, without using IMS, retrievals of 80% of cysts and 5% of oocysts were obtained, whereas by using IMS, recoveries of 31.5% of cysts and 5.75% of oocysts were reached. When analyzing the coagulant performance, a dosage of 65 mg L−1 showed contamination from protozoans in all the samples of filtered water. A dosage of 25 mg L−1 presented protozoans in 50% of the filtered water samples. The results showed an improved performance for the 25 mg L−1 dosage; therefore, the control of coagulation and adaptation of detection protocols must be evaluated according to the features of raw water and availability of local resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To achieve a more realistic understanding of how the supply chain's components interact, it is helpful to consider the operational limitations of the underlying supply chain while analyzing cooperative advertising. This paper studies cooperative advertising in a manufacturer–retailer supply chain under the practical operational assumption that the manufacturer's production capacity is limited. The retailer advertises locally, and the manufacturer advertises in national media and supports part of the retailer's promotional costs. Equilibria are determined under two different scenarios. In the first scenario, both retailer and manufacturer move simultaneously, while in the second scenario, they move sequentially, with the manufacturer being the leader. The sales function is a bivariate version of the diminishing returns response function. When the production capacity is unlimited, several important properties can be proven, which cannot be shown analytically for the existing sales functions. Considering the production‐capacity constraint leads to new managerial insights into cooperative advertising. For example, only if the production capacity is large enough, both manufacturer and retailer are better off under the second scenario than the first scenario. In other words, the sequential move is not necessarily Pareto‐improving when the production capacity is limited. It is also observed that, under the first scenario, there are multiple equilibria whenever the production capacity is not too high. Under the second scenario, the manufacturer supports the retailer only when the retailer's margin is relatively small compared to the manufacturer's margin and production capacity.</jats:p>",

While making banknote supply decisions to Sub‐Branches (SBs), the management of RB must achieve two goals simultaneously: (i) guarantee that each SB has sufficient inventories of all denominations of banknotes to satisfy the demands from all commercial banks within its service area, and (ii) control the annual spending on this banknote supply operation. Due to security concerns, the following methods are implemented in the process of transporting banknotes: (i) the capacity of a cash truck is limited by the total face value (instead of the physical space) of banknotes, and (ii) empty decoy trucks are deployed along with the trucks filled with banknotes. After deriving a polynomial‐time strategy to guarantee an optimal solution for the special Bin‐Packing Problem faced in this study, we provide an exact formulation for the RB's supply planning problem. We also propose several polynomial‐time algorithms for deriving either optimal or near‐optimal solutions for the problem under different settings. Using the weekly demand data obtained from the central bank, we verify the performance of our algorithms, and analyze the impacts of changes in these features and in the fleet capacity on the total cost incurred by an RB under various scenarios. </jats:p>",

At each station, there is an infinite queue of customers that have to undergo a preparation phase before being served. This model is connected to layered queueing networks, to an extension of polling systems and surprisingly to random graphs. We are interested in the waiting time of the server. For the case where the server polls the stations cyclically, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a limiting waiting-time distribution and we study the tail behavior of the stationary waiting time. Furthermore, assuming that preparation times are exponentially distributed, we describe in depth the resulting Markov chain. We also investigate a model variation where the server does not necessarily poll the stations in a cyclic order, but always serves the customer with the earliest completed preparation phase. We show that the mean waiting time under this dynamic allocation never exceeds that of the cyclic case, but that the waiting-time distributions corresponding to both cases are not necessarily stochastically ordered. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results investigating and comparing the effect of the system's parameters to the performance of the server for both models.</jats:p>",

Each module has 3 floating and independently configurable output voltages. In LUCIFER, the AC/DC + DC/DC stages are combined into a commercial medium-power AC/DC source. At the outputs of both setups, we introduced filters with the aim of lowering the noise and to protect the following stages from high voltage spikes that can be generated by the energy stored in the cables after the release of accidental short circuits. Output noise is very low, as required: in the 100 MHz bandwidth the RMS level is about 37 μVRMS (CUORE setup) and 90 μVRMS (LUCIFER setup) at a load of 7 A, with a negligible dependence on the load current. Even more importantly, high frequency switching disturbances are almost completely suppressed. The efficiency of both systems is above 85%.

Patenting activity is analyzed — including inventive activity by country and technology, international diffusion of such water-related technologies, and international collaboration in technology development. Three results stand out from our analysis. First, although inventive activity in water-related technologies has been increasing over the last two decades, this growth has been disproportionately concentrated on supply-side technologies. Second, whilst 80% of water-related invention occurs worldwide in countries with low or moderate water scarcity, several countries with absolute or chronic water scarcity are relatively specialized in water efficiency technologies. Finally, although we observe a positive association between water scarcity and local filings of water patents, some countries with high water availability, in particular Switzerland or Norway, nevertheless appear as significant markets for water-efficiency technologies. This suggests that drivers other than local demand, like regulation and social and cultural factors, play a role in explaining the global flows of technologies. </jats:p>",

Unlike a rectifier, an inverter with a high-power electronic oscillator is able to convert direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC) in different forms. Regarding this point, the current paper presents an analysis and design of fuzzy logic control (FLC) applied to an inverter of a single-phase voltage source using LC filter and voltage sensor. Also, three modes of inverter voltage non-linear control (back-stepping, sliding and fuzzy modes) have been simulated and compared. The results of simulation indicated that the suggested FLC could attenuate and reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) under linear loading conditions.</jats:p>"

A range of strategies are available to reduce the generation of waste by industry and households, and to select waste treatment approaches that minimize environmental harm. However, evaluating these strategies requires reliable and detailed data on waste production and treatment. Unfortunately, published Australian waste data are typically highly aggregated, published by a variety of entities in different formats, and do not form a complete time‐series. We demonstrate a technique for constructing a multi‐regional waste supply‐use (MRWSU) framework for Australia using information from numerous waste data sources. This is the first MRWSU framework to be constructed (to the authors' knowledge) and the first sub‐national waste input‐output framework to be constructed for Australia. We construct the framework using the Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab), a cloud‐hosted computational platform for building Australian multi‐regional input‐output tables. The structure of the framework complies with the System of Environmental‐Economic Accounting (SEEA). We demonstrate the use of the MRWSU framework by calculating waste footprints that enumerate the full supply chain waste production for Australian consumers.</jats:p>",

Positioned in an environment of high market competition and narrow profit margins, the company strives for operational excellence, aimed at inventory reduction and increased service level. This supply chain includes several plants and has recently been through the deployment of an APS to support its S&amp;OP process. The research has identified the main benefits of the APS: greater confidence and accuracy in planning, and better balancing of inventory throughout the supply chain. The deployment project went through specific difficulties that delayed its schedule. The study reinforces the importance of fully support from senior managers and the commitment of the planning staff to meet the challenges of customization and integration of the new system.</jats:p>"

Water treatment technologies using membrane filtration for virus removal are becoming increasingly important. However, experiments to test removal of NVs from water have been hampered because NVs do not grow in cell culture or in small-animal models and therefore cannot be easily artificially propagated. Expression of the NV genome in a baculovirus-silkworm expression system has produced recombinant NV virus-like particles (rNV-VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to native NV. Here, we characterized these rNV-VLPs and evaluated their potential use in assessing NV removal. Electron microscopic analysis and peptide mass fingerprinting showed that the rNV-VLPs were morphologically identical to native NV. In addition, surface charge and particle size distribution, which are important factors for explaining virus particle behavior during membrane filtration, were successfully evaluated by using rNV-VLPs. The rNV-VLPs were easy to quantify with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, they remained stable for several days at 4 °C after dilution in river water, and they were easy to concentrate with the ultrafiltration entrapment method used. Thus, rNV-VLPs can be used to facilitate our understanding of the behavior of NVs during membrane filtration processes.</jats:p>",

Recently, various Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) models, which opened the “black box” of conventional DEA, were developed and applied to evaluate the complex SC with a multilayer network structure. However, most of them are input or output oriented models which cannot take into consideration the nonproportional changes of inputs and outputs simultaneously. This paper extends the Slack-based measure (SBM) model to a nonradial, nonoriented network model named as U-NSBM with the presence of undesirable outputs in the SC. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model in quantifying the efficiency and ranking the supply chain performance. By comparing with the CCR and U-SBM models, it is shown that the proposed model has higher distinguishing ability and gives feasible solution in the presence of undesirable outputs. Meanwhile, it provides more insights for decision makers about the source of inefficiency as well as the guidance to improve the SC performance. </jats:p>",

As such, recycled water, if used for irrigation over a long period of time may increase the root zone salinity. However, the phenomenon depends on variability of climatic condition and soil characteristics. In this study, a salt transport model, HYDRUS 1D, was used to predict long-term salt accumulation in two paddocks containing loamy sand and loam soil. The paddocks are located within Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury campus. Impact of rainfall on salt accumulation was studied with the data from the Global Climate Model for the years 2021–2040. The long-term (20 years) salt accumulation showed a cyclical pattern because of variation in rainfall and evapotranspiration. It was found that soil water electrical conductivity (ECSW) was 24% higher in loam soil paddock compared with that of loamy sand. Amount of leachate in the loamy sand paddock was 27% more than the amount leached from that of loam, which may pose a salinity risk to the groundwater if there is a perched aquifer in the field at a depth &amp;lt;1 m. Results from this study indicate that salt accumulation depends on soil type which seems to be more pronounced under low rainfall condition.</jats:p>",

This results in poor performance and negative impacts on the organization. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrates how the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) managed to substantially improve its fleet management through the introduction of an Internal Leasing Program (ILP), in which headquarters procures vehicles and leases them to field offices. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper develops a framework for fleet management based on a longitudinal case study with UNHCR.

The introduction of the ILP positively impacted fleet management at UNHCR by reducing fleet size, average age of fleet and procurement costs. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper provides fleet managers with a tool for analyzing their fleet.

Women and men as the users of water resources need to be involved in the management of water resource. This can effectively be done with proper strategies to mainstream gender in all the management undertaking at the community level. This study sought to investigate on the participation of men and women and strategies to enhance gender mainstreaming in the management of water resources at the Bridge Water Project which had drilled 123 boreholes for use in households, learning and religious institutions in Kakamega County. The study was a case study guided by the equity theory developed by John Stacy Adams in 1963. 10% samples of 13 out of the 123 committees that manage the boreholes were randomly selected as respondents to the study. They include 5 household committees, 6 learning and 2 committees from religious institutions.Â  Key informants were heads of selected institutions and the chief of the location where the study was undertaken. The instruments used to collect data were Questionnaires, Focused Group Discussion, Interview Schedule and Observation. Data collected was cross-tabulated for qualitative analysis. The study established that women were discriminated against in terms of participation in management committees despite the fact that they were the main water users. On the basis of strategies, the study identified training and awareness creation on the need for gender equity, dissemination of the affirmative action policy, empowerment and mobilization of women to seek management positions and engagement of a gender expert to guide gender mainstreaming in the management of the project as strategies to enhance gender mainstreaming in the management of the Bridge Water Supply Project.</jats:p>"

In  India,  projects  undertaken  by government  were  largely  planned  and  designed  by  departmental  planners  and  engineers. However,   after   globalization,   projects   have   increased   in   number   resulting   in   design outsourcing, but with attendant challenges. The paper is aimed at identifying and analysing factors in the design development phase that can have impact on project success. 30 factors related to design development were identified through two separate brainstorming sessions. A questionnaire  was  then  administered  to  determine  importance  ranking  of  these  factors. Relative importance index (RII) was used to prioritise these factors. Top ten factors in design development  identified  using  RII  include  structural  design  parameters,  soil  investigations, design quality control, topographic survey, and architectural design parameters. The results can help firms improve their design development practices by prioritising activities that could have more impact on project performance.</jats:p>"

However,   despite advancement in seismic design methods and legislative frameworks, building owners are found unwilling  or  lack  motivation  to  adopt  adequate  mitigation  measures  that  will  reduce  their vulnerability to earthquake disasters. Various theories and empirical findings have been used to  explain  the  adoption  of  protective  behaviours  including  seismic mitigation  decisions,  but their application has been inadequate to enhance building owners’ protective decisions. A holistic framework that incorporates the motivational orientations of decision-making, coupled with the social, cultural, economic, regulatory, institutional and political realms of earthquake risk  mitigation  to  enhance  building  owners’  decisions  to  voluntarily  implement  adequate mitigation measures, is proposed. This framework attempts to address any multi-disciplinary barriers that exist in earthquake disaster management, by ensuring that stakeholders involved in seismic mitigation decisions work together to foster seismic rehabilitation of EPBs, as well as  illuminate  strategies that will initiate, promote and sustain the adoption of long-term earthquake mitigation.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this research employs factor analysis approach to synthetically evaluate the weight measurements of random Taiwanese interviewees and significantly further applies fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis method to testify measured results of factor analysis approach to successfully institute the most reliably evaluated model in order to induce the most influenced financial determinants for effectually minimizing the negative financial influences. Consequently, sale forecast accuracy of forecasting financial assessed factor, inventory-sales days of delivery financial assessed factor, and supplier’s material delivered on-time rate of electronic-transaction financial assessed factor are the most influenced financial determinants. The most valuable contribution of this research is to academically resupply research gap as well as empirically provide handy recommendations for relative manufacturing industrialists in this contemporarily complex, higher comparative, and lower profit era. </jats:p>",

We describe this new responsibility as the double agency role. We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first‐tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in‐depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second‐tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first‐tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first‐tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple‐bottom‐line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi‐tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The proportion of dependent persons (requiring care) in the population continues to increase. The number of people aged 80 and above (in 2013 – 1.48 million) will double by 2050 and reach 3.54 million. The research objective was to gain knowledge on the supply and demand of different institutionalized forms of care services from the healthcare system perspective.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Material and methods: &lt;/b&gt; A computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) survey was carried out on a Poland-wide quota sample of health care and nursing centres operating within the healthcare system. The respondent group consisted of 96 directors of health care facilities.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt; In the opinion of more than a half of surveyed directors, supply of health care and nursing centres in their region is insufficient in terms of the needs of both patients and elderly people. In the context of patients, the deficit is observed primarily in health care and treatment centres, long-term nursing care and health care institutions, whereas for the elderly people the main concern is availability of nursing care, day care or social aid centres. More than half of surveyed institutions admit patients requiring care on an ongoing basis; however, in the case of health care and treatment centres more than a year-long waiting time proved to be a frequent phenomenon. In the opinion of the surveyed directors, the key factors influencing the number of available places and waiting time are insufficient financing and personnel deficit.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt;: Introduction of multiple changes to the operation of the care system in Poland is necessary in order to improve its availability, effectiveness and quality. Achievement of this objective requires implementation of a cohesive and integrated system dedicated to monitoring and diagnosing both the supply and demand for different forms of care.</jats:p>",

Results showed efficient TTHMs and HA removal by GAC while a sand column showed little effect for TTHMs but was significant for total organic carbon (TOC) removal.

Furthermore, in rural areas many people use water from individual systems they have developed with their investments, often without external support. This phenomenon has been called Self-supply. Self-supply ranges from simple to complex systems and different water sources. Water quality varies, from achieving World Health Organization (WHO) standards (0 CFU/100 ml) to systems that provide water posing high risks to human health. While most studies in Self-supply have been developed in Africa, little is known in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This research explores Self-supply in a rural microcatchment in Colombia (LAC). Data was collected through household and drinking water surveys and analysed. Results showed that 40% of households used Self-supply systems taking water from springs and brooks. Thermotolerant Coliforms were below 50 CFU/100 ml, both in dry and rainy season, and between 5 to 7% of samples achieved the WHO standard. These results suggest that Self-supply has potential to offer safe drinking water, provided improvements on source protection and institutional support. Therefore, Self-supply could contribute to address “unfinished business”, including ensuring access for the hardest-to-reach people, as stated in the post-2015 development agenda.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The extent to which individual agricultural commodity supply chain interventions can achieve scale, and environmental or social objectives, depends in part on the ways in which those interventions interact with other interventions. We use a case-study of the new Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) cattle certification program in Brazil to explore the different ways in which governance interventions interact. We examine the broad landscape of policies and programs that affect sustainability in the cattle supply chain in Brazil, and assess whether such interventions support or constrain the scaling up of the SAN cattle program. We conducted semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from government, private sector, and civil society organizations. We found that multiple interventions are acting in a complementary manner to enhance sustainability and therefore enable the scaling up of the SAN program, by aiding compliance with environmental laws, adoption of good production practices, and improved monitoring. At the same time, limited development, implementation, and complementarity of some interventions could be antagonistic to the SAN program's expansion because they maintain a context in which many actors operate far below the sustainability criteria required by the program. Our holistic approach enables us to identify specific gaps in the complex landscape of governance interventions in Brazil. Greater strategic complementarity and coordination between interventions may catalyze a more coherent and effective pathway to reduced deforestation and enhanced sustainability. </jats:p>",

Events occurring with increasing frequency, such as substandard water quality in residential taps, red water, and black water, reveal the deterioration of the chemical stability of a drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Pipes in the DWDS serving City S, located in eastern China, were sampled to analyze the concentration and distribution of pollutants in pipe-scale of pipes of different materials, ages and diameters, and the factors (such as materials, age, and diameter) influencing the accumulation of pollutants were also investigated. The quantity of pipe-scale in the most commonly used gray cast iron pipe and ductile cast iron pipe (DN150) was 151.5–195.0 g·m−1 and 7.1–29.4 g·m−1, respectively. The concentration of heavy metals in pipe-scale was positively correlated with the quantity of pipe-scale (R2 = 0.874); the sequence of concentration of metals was Fe &amp;gt; Al &amp;gt; Mn, Zn &amp;gt; Pb, Cu &amp;gt; Cr, Cd. Galvanized steel pipe, with the highest degree of corrosion, had the highest concentration of heavy metals in pipe-scale. The morphology and composition of pipe-scale were substantially influenced by pipe material and age. For example, in the oldest galvanized steel pipe-scale, there was not only a large number of iron compounds but also some zinc composite oxides. In addition to hydrocarbons produced by microbial metabolism, there were microalgae metabolites and exogenous contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The concentrations of microbial metabolites increased with increasing service time.</jats:p>",

The species is also known to be suitable for plywood, packing case, toys and short-fibred pulp. Therefore, mass production of high quality planting material of N. cadamba is important to support plantation program of this species. Here we presented mass production of N. cadamba through tissue culture techniques. Nodal segments derived from in vitro germinated seeds were used and induced direct organogenesis to produce shoots and roots using MS media (1962) and plant growth regulators (BAP and IBA) that are relatively cheaper than previously used methods. The tissue culture technique of N. cadamba developed may help in ensuring supply of planting materials that are feasible for commercial plantation purposes.</jats:p>"

In open-ocean regions, as is the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), pelagic production is the main source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and is affected by dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) concentrations. Changes in pelagic production under nutrient amendments were shown to also modify DOM quantity and quality. However, little information is available about the effects of nutrient variability on chromophoric (CDOM) and fluorescent (FDOM) DOM dynamics. Here we present results from two mesocosm experiments (\"Varied P\" and \"Varied N\") conducted with a natural plankton community from the ETNA, where the effects of DIP and DIN supply on DOM optical properties were studied. CDOM accumulated proportionally to phytoplankton biomass during the experiments. Spectral slope (S) decreased over time indicating accumulation of high molecular weight DOM. In Varied N, an additional CDOM portion, as a result of bacterial DOM reworking, was determined. It increased the CDOM fraction in DOC proportionally to the supplied DIN. The humic-like FDOM component (Comp.1) was produced by bacteria proportionally to DIN supply. The protein-like FDOM component (Comp.2) was released irrespectively to phytoplankton or bacterial biomass, but depended on DIP and DIN concentrations. Under high DIN supply, Comp.2 was removed by bacterial reworking, leading to an accumulation of humic-like Comp.1. No influence of nutrient availability on amino acid-like FDOM component in peptide form (Comp.3) was observed. Comp.3 potentially acted as an intermediate product during formation or degradation of Comp.2. Our findings suggest that changes in nutrient concentrations may lead to substantial responses in the quantity and quality of optically active DOM and, therefore, might bias results of the applied in situ optical techniques for an estimation of DOC concentrations in open-ocean regions.\n                    </jats:p>"

With the help of domestic and international databases from 2000 to 2012, a simultaneous equations model was built capturing behavioral and technical variables influencing supply and demand. The most important relationships among variables were price of the product and disposable income for the demand and use of fertilizers and exchange rate for the supply. This work gives the insight, from the economic point of view, that building a model including the right key variables will give a sense of the general structure of a market and the changes in stability due to a sanitary threat</jats:p>",

Long‐duration SHO surfaces are even more challenging due to material instability and easy contamination by organic pollutants in dry conditions. To overcome these difficulties we design a simple approach via self‐supplying of low surface tension chemicals to nanoparticles to fabricate multifunctional SHO heterostructures. The method herein features room temperature, rapid processing, with environment‐friendly raw materials.

Amended soil concentrations were also determined. <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic> responded strongly and positively in its growth to Mg, but less to K; <jats:italic>Tetraberlinia</jats:italic> responded weakly to both. Added Mg led to strongly increased Mg concentration for <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic> while added K changed that concentration only slightly; <jats:italic>Tetraberlinia</jats:italic> strongly increased its concentration of K with added K, but only somewhat its Mg concentration with added Mg. Additions of Mg and K had small but important antagonistic effects. <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic> is Mg‐demanding and apparently Mg‐limited in Korup soil; <jats:italic>Tetraberlinia</jats:italic>, whilst K‐demanding, appeared not to be K‐limited (for growth). Added K enhanced plant P concentrations of both species. Extra applied Mg may also be alleviating soil aluminum toxicity, and hence improving growth indirectly and especially to the benefit of <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic>. Mg appears to be essential for <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic> seedling growth and its low soil availability in grove soils at Korup may be an important contributing factor to its poor recruitment. <jats:italic>Microberlinia</jats:italic> is highly shade‐intolerant and strongly light‐responding, whilst <jats:italic>Tetraberlinia</jats:italic> is more shade‐tolerant and moderately light‐responding, which affords an interesting contrast with respect to their differing responses to Mg supply. The study revealed novel aspects of functional traits and likely niche‐partitioning among ectomycorrhizal caesalps in African rain forests. Identifying the direct and interacting indirect effects of essential elements on tropical tree seedling growth presents a considerable challenge due the complex nexus of causes involved.</jats:p>",

The supplier's imperfect knowledge about the buyer's cost is denoted by a subjective distribution. By assuming that the distribution is uniform, we first derive the explicit expressions of the optimal equilibrium outcomes of two contract formats offered by the supplier, the simple price‐only contract and sophisticated menu of contracts, respectively. Based on the optimal results, we continue to investigate how the supplier's expected profit varies with the level of information asymmetry, which is measured by the variance of the supplier's subjective distribution. Our findings indicate that the supplier's expected profits initially decrease and then increase as the supplier's knowledge of the buyer's cost becomes increasingly uncertain. That is, if the supplier could choose the level of information asymmetry, she would prefer a symmetric case (with the variance being zero) or a totally asymmetric case (with the variance being as high as possible). Numerical experiments demonstrate that our result still holds when we take into account such distributions as a truncated gamma and normal, and a fixed support of the distribution function instead of a moving support.</jats:p>",

The present study is a continuation of previous work by the same authors for the half-space [1]. The presented Figures display the process of propagation and reflection of the coupled nonlinear thermoelastic waves in the slab. They also show the effects of volume force and heat supply on the distributions of the mechanical displacements and temperature inside the medium. The propagation of beats provides evidence for sufficiently large time values.  </jats:p>"

The velocity control of the flocculated water at the entrance (Ve) of the contact zone of DAF units is important because the degree of agitation in this region may affect the size of the flocs and the efficiency of the flotation process. This article shows the results of an experimental study conducted to verify the influence of Ve (and its associated average velocity gradient, Ge) on the performance of a DAF pilot plant (DAFPP) fed with synthetic water. Two different coagulation conditions of the same raw synthetic water were tested, and 11 assays with different Ve values for each condition were performed. The floc size distribution curves regarding two limit situations, the lowest and the highest Ve values, were obtained by using an appropriate image analysis method. The best results were obtained for Ve values ranging from 125 to180 m·h−1, and for Ve values outside this range, the decrease in DAFPP performance was not as substantial as expected.</jats:p>",

Pour cela, en République démocratique du Congo, le projet Makala a cartographié les arbres et les ressources forestières du bas- sin d’approvisionnement en bois-énergie de Kinshasa et a essayé de prédire son évolu- tion future. La carte a été réalisée à quatre périodes (1984, 2001, 2006 et 2012) avec une mosaïque de quatre images Landsat. L’estimation de la biomasse aérienne a été faite en 2012, par l’inventaire forestier de 317 parcelles (4 337 arbres de 44 espèces) dans les quatre types de couverture végétale, sur le plateau Batéké. Entre 2000 et 2012, le volume moyen de bois-énergie a chuté de plus de 50 % et les stocks de carbone de 75 % en 28 ans. La réduction drastique du couvert forestier, la baisse significative des périodes de jachère, l’augmentation des surfaces de savane, le déclin des stocks de biomasse et de carbone, constituent des signaux particulièrement forts. Mais ces premières estimations sont dérivées des données d’un petit échantillon, extrapolées au bassin d’approvisionnement. Il serait très utile d’augmenter l’échantillonnage, pour approcher des valeurs plus justes et concrètes. L’expérience du projet Makala montre clairement que l’analyse de l’évo- lution de la couverture végétale permet de comprendre et de documenter l’organisa- tion spatiale et les mécanismes de la dégra- dation des forêts. Mais seules une politique consciente et une gestion durable des terres des communautés, combinées avec une réintroduction des arbres dans les terres agricoles, peuvent initier un processus de restauration durable.</jats:p>"

Labile organic matter (OM) fractions containing C and N are readily metabolized by soil microorganisms, which leads to N mineralization and contributes to the soil N supply to crops. The objective of this study was to identify labile OM fractions that could be indicators of the soil N supply by evaluating the relationship between the soil N supply, the C and N concentrations, and C/N ratios of water extractable OM, hot‐water extractable OM, particulate OM, microbial biomass, and salt extractable OM. Labile OM fractions were measured before planting spring wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) in fertilized soils and the soil N supply was determined from the wheat N uptake and soil mineral N concentration after 6 weeks. Prior to the study, fertilized sandy loam and silty clay soils received three annual applications of 90 kg available N (ha · y)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> from mineral fertilizer, liquid dairy cattle manure, liquid swine manure or solid poultry litter, and there was a zero‐N control. Water extractable organic N was the only labile OM fraction to be affected by fertilization in both soil types (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). Across both test soils, the soil N supply was significantly correlated with the particulate OM N (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.87, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), the particulate OM C (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.83, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), and hot‐water extractable organic N (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.81, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). We conclude that pre‐planting concentrations of particulate OM and hot‐water extractable organic N could be early season indicators of the soil N supply in fertilized soils of the Saint Lawrence River Lowlands in Quebec, Canada. The suitability of these pre‐planting indicators to predict the soil N supply under field conditions and in fertilized soils from other regions remains to be determined.</jats:p>",

We examine the supply chains of the Australian tropical rock lobster fishery (TRL) and southern rock lobster fishery (SRL), with similar destination markets but different catch methods and fishing communities. A boat‐to‐market analysis allows for comparison and illustration of the effects of single supply‐chain aspects. We used life cycle assessment to provide an overview of the environmental footprint, expressed as global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand, for two lobster products: live animals and frozen tails. The export phase contributed 44% and 56% of GWP of live‐weight lobster for SRL and TRL, respectively. The SRL fishery currently produces 68% of the combined 1,806.7 tonnes of lobster product and 78% of the combined global warming for the two fisheries over the whole supply chain. We develop climate adaptation options that: (1) reduce the overall footprint; (2) consider alternative supply‐chain strategies (e.g., reduce cost); and (3) predicted impact of future climate change. Adaptation options include: more direct export routes and change in the export transport mode. Value adding and product differentiation, which can level out seasonality and thus spread risk, is likely to become increasingly important for both increases and decreases in predicted climate‐induced abundance of fish species.</jats:p>",

We realize hydricity by judiciously integrating solar water power cycle, solar thermal hydrogen production techniques, and turbine-based hydrogen power cycle and by suitably improving each one for compatibility and beneficial interaction. The proposed hydricity concept presents a potential breakthrough solution for continuous and efficient power supply and also an exciting opportunity to envision and create a sustainable economy to meet all the human needs—namely, food, chemicals, transportation, heating, and electricity.</jats:p>",

In this study, glass packaging involved lower depletion of total polyphenol content and better preservation of the α‐tocopherol content in olive pulp than plastic pouches during the processing.

While often transformed by the same oncogenes, B-cell and myeloid leukemias markedly differ in biological and clinical characteristics. Our metabolic analyses revealed that B-cell-unlike myeloid-leukemia cells are massively restricted in their glycolytic capacity. Low glycolytic reserves in B cells resulted in a state of chronic energy depletion and engaged the energy sensor LKB1-AMPK. Myeloid cells strongly activated glucose transport through insulin receptor (INSR)-AKT signaling and lacked activity of LKB1-AMPK, reflecting energy abundance. Conversely, B-cells lacked INSR-AKT signaling and were critically dependent on LKB1-AMPK-mediated glucose uptake. Cre-mediated deletion of Lkb1 caused acute glycolytic exhaustion and cell death in B-lineage but increased glycolysis, energy levels and proliferation in myeloid leukemia. C/EBPa-mediated conversion of B-cell into myeloid identity reversed the detrimental effects of Lkb1-deletion and restored glycolysis, energy levels and survival of B→myeloid reprogrammed cells. In &gt;80% of B-lineage leukemia cases, we found genetic lesions of transcription factors (e.g. deletion of PAX5, IKZF1, rearrangement of MLL) that caused a B→myeloid lineage shift. While previously of unknown functional significance, these lesions relieved B-cell-specific transcriptional repression of molecules that mediate glucose uptake and utilization (INSR, GLUT1, HK2, G6PD) and amplified glycolytic energy supply for transforming oncogenes. Likewise, glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1)-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake and glycolysis was strictly dependent on a B-lymphoid transcriptional program. B→myeloid lineage conversion abolished NR3C1 expression and activity, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the empiric finding that glucocorticoids are highly active in the treatment of B-cell-but not myeloid malignancies. In conclusion, B-cell-specific restriction of glycolytic energy supply represents a previously unrecognized metabolic barrier against malignant transformation and reveals LKB1-AMPK as a novel target for the treatment of human B-lineage leukemia.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

We overcame the limitation by exploiting the data redundancy of memory hierarchy. For example, cache coherence states and several layers of cache organization naturally expose the existence of redundancy within cache blocks. If blocks have redundant copies, their V\n            <jats:sup>\n              <jats:italic>CCMIN</jats:italic>\n            </jats:sup>\n            can be lowered; although more faults can occur in the blocks, they can be efficiently detected by simple error detection codes and recovered by reloading the redundant copies.

Especially for the personnel engaged in complicated physical labor such as tunnel construction, high altitude can cause a series of adverse physiological reactions, which may result in multiple high-altitude diseases and even death in severe cases. Artificial oxygen supply is required to ensure health and safety of construction personnel in hypoxic environments. However, there are no provisions for oxygen supply standard for tunnel construction personnel in high-altitude areas in current tunnel construction specifications. As a result, this paper has theoretically studied the impacts of high-altitude environment on human bodies, analyzed the relationship between labor intensity and oxygen consumption in high-altitude areas and determined the critical oxygen-supply altitude values for tunnel construction based on two different standard evaluation systems, i.e., variation of air density and equivalent PIO2. In addition, it has finally determined the oxygen supply standard for construction personnel in high-altitude areas based on the relationship between construction labor intensity and oxygen consumption.</jats:p>"
