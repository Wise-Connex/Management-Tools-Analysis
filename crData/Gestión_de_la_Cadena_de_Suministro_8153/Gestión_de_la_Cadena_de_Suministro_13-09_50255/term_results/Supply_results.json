Such a limitation has hindered the application of LP for the design of looped water supply networks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Located in a semi-arid region in the south and east of the country, the Moroccan oases are characterized by severe aridity and scarcity of water resources. However, the ancestral populations have shown a major form of adaptation to aridity constraints through the development of knowledge and heuristic expertise on a traditional water supply system called ‘Khettara’. Currently, the effects of climate change on the one hand and the deep social, cultural and economic transformations on the other, have caused the productivity of traditional agriculture to no longer match population needs with progressive vanishing of Khettara as its consequence. A diagnostic study of the situation of oases conducted in the south of Morocco makes it possible to address the socio-economic, environmental and cultural aspects by developing and using a specific methodology to assess fragile ecosystems (DPSIR: Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response). The main aim of the present work is to provide a methodology allowing the formulation of the required knowledge for the mobilization of traditional water resources techniques such as Khettaras, in order to maintain the national heritage of oases. The modeling formalism of UML (Unified Modeling Language) is borrowed from information technology for the purpose of standardization. The developed methodology enhances these traditional water supply systems by combining traditional and modern techniques to increase their performance in terms of reduced maintenance costs and increased productivity. The developed methodology has been applied to a real case characterized by extreme aridity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article evaluates the technical risks faced by Dubai based large and medium size logistics supply chain companies (LSCC). Middle East is attempting to turn itself into a multimodal trans-shipment hub for transport, as manufactured goods production has moved from West to East. Thus Dubai port has become the hub, as great freight volumes now transit this region, which has created demand for additional warehousing facilities. As supply chains have lengthened, logistics executives are increasingly responsible for anticipating and eliminating a greater number of risks. The stakes are high: in the past five years, nearly three-fourths of companies experienced significant disruptions. Also the topic is very important in current context; however, there does not seem to be much work done in this area in Dubai, a place which is dominated by the LSCC. The findings are based on risk identification and risk analysis through exploratory and empirical survey using a sample size of 50 questionnaires, 7 in-depth interviews and a focus group meeting with senior supply chain executives. The study provides insights into the applicability of technical risks faced by logistics supply chain, Dubai, with respect to severity, degree, speed, amount of forewarning associated and duration of each risk. Findings from this research will prove useful to management researchers and practitioners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a general perception that Mexico's insertion in global supply chains has been mostly in assembly operations and that efforts should be made to incorporate additional domestic value in the international production networks in which the country participates. To examine this issue properly one needs to have a measure of the share of domestic value added that is effectively embodied in Mexico's exports. We analyze firm-level data from the IMMEX census which covers all the firms that benefit from the Maquiladora and the PITEX programs. We find that the share of domestic value added as a proportion of the firm's exports has been declining in the last 6 years. We show that the decline is not the result of market share re-allocations; that it persists after controlling for price changes and that is observed across firms of all sizes. The results suggest that more segments of the supply chains are generally not moving into Mexico and that on the contrary there is a trend of falling domestic value added. This result contrasts with that of other countries engaged in similar export processing activities, like China.</jats:p>"

This is misleading because it is in fact a later reconstruction, based on a presumption of the superiority of the Phillips curve, of a well-developed theoretical outlook. That outlook saw the problems of inflation and unemployment as substantially separate ones. The theory of wage determination, in particular, was intensively studied with little reference to the level of unemployment and understood with little regard to the marginal product of labor. Contact with that vision was lost as econometric and other work on the Phillips curve developed, and this explains the later failure to appreciate the ideas of the 1950s. It is suggested that the older ideas are worth revisiting not just for their historical interest, but also on their merits.</p>",

This study provides a new approach for estimating groundwater sustainability in fractured rock that entails synthesis of pre-existing well data into a comprehensive database that permits defining bedrock groundwater drainage basins and flow for use in estimating recharge and usage. The method was tested in the Coventry Quadrangle, Connecticut and entailed the use of more than 2,500 wells. Groundwater recharge and usage were estimated for each drainage basin and the sustainability of each basin was determined by taking the difference between these estimates. Additionally, temporal analysis of well parameters indicated a decrease in well yield by approximately 20% and the depth to water declined. The method demonstrated here provides a means to allow the consideration of groundwater sustainability in land use planning and decision-making.</jats:p>",

It reported findings from a research on gravel supply studies in the study area. Major gravel pits, together with their perceived technical characteristics in the states were identified through a structured questionnaire designed to solicit response from truck drivers and association of gravel suppliers. Based on this, factors affecting gravel supply and usage were measured by random variables devised for the purpose. The observed outcomes of the variables from the survey carried out constituted the research data. The collated data was analyzed based on quantitative method through the use of simple percentage method of data analysis. The paper posits that geological location of Lagos state is responsible for the absence of any gravel pit in the state, hence the prohibitive cost of gravel in the state when compared to other states in the zone. In all the states, more than 99% of gravel suppliers attribute transport as a major factor affecting the cost of gravels. The technical characteristics of gravels from South-western Nigeria are also perceived to be good in construction, though these assertions need to be empirically proved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biofuel industry has attracted much attention due to its potential to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to the renewable energy. The high levels of uncertainty in feedstock yield, market prices, production costs, and many other parameters are among the major challenges in this industry. This challenge has created an ongoing interest on studies considering different aspects of uncertainty in investment decisions of the biofuel industry. This study aims to determine the optimal design of supply chain for biofuel refineries in order to maximize annual profit considering uncertainties in fuel market price, feedstock yield, and logistic costs. In order to deal with the stochastic nature of parameters in the biofuel supply chain, we develop two-stage stochastic programming models in which Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is utilized as a risk measure to control the amount of shortage in demand zones. Two different approaches including the expected value and CVaR of the profit are considered as the objective function. We apply these models and compare the results for a case study of the biomass supply chain network in the state of Iowa to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the presented models.</jats:p>",

The dynamic model describes an interaction among economic growth, time, gender, income, and wealth distribution. Our investigation differs from traditional growth and distribution related studies, in that we propose an alternative approach to consumer behavior. We simulate the 3-group model to provide insights into the complexity of growth, income, and wealth distribution with a gender division of labor. Further, we are able to gain a better understanding of dynamic interactions among economic growth, income and wealth distribution, and female labor participation. For instance, our comparative dynamic analysis demonstrates that either a rise in female education or the propensity to work of any one group will increase the female labor participation within that group but that such a change has weak effects on the female labor participation within all other groups.</jats:p>"

These species occur at low concentrations, but have been determined to have high cytotoxicity and mutagenicity and therefore may represent a human health hazard. Advanced oxidation/reduction processes (AO/RPs) which utilize free radical reactions are new alternatives to degrade these species. This study reports the absolute bimolecular reaction rate constants for 12 haloacetamides with •OH radical and hydrated electron. The •OH radical reaction rates varied from 5.18 × 107 to 1.14 × 1010 M−1 s−1, and hydrated electron reaction rates varied from 5.00 × 109 to 3.64 × 1010 M−1 s−1. Results obtained using an ion chromatograph indicated that ARPs are suitable for dehaloliazation of haloacetamides. These data are required for both evaluating AO/RPs for the destruction of these compounds and for studies of their fate and transport in surface waters where radical chemistry may be important in assessing their lifetime.</jats:p>",

The induced behavioral change from conservation measures is found to be of a permanent nature and the unit consumption to be in long-term descent. This in turn may call for a paradigm change in pricing and capacity planning for utilities. The ever-declining per capita consumption alters many commonly acknowledged norms for utilities, in particular for fast growing ones that may have taken on additional financial leverage to support previously anticipated growth. If not managed properly, the full cost recovery mechanism of pricing may force those utilities into an unsustainable future of ever-decreasing total demand and ever-increasing cash flow shortfall. Collection of more detailed water demand data in a timely fashion may prove to be a necessary exercise for sound management of median to large water utilities.</jats:p>",

The results highlight the sensitivity of key performance indicators to a range of future conditions relative to current conditions. The concept of future proofing is introduced and three strategies compared to design/re-design and operate the network, building in varying degrees of adaptive capacity to deliver solutions that are feasible under both today's and tomorrow's conditions. The key findings are that, without any intervention, all solutions are feasible when demand is equal to or less than the design case while resilience of the system improves for small decrease in demand, major reduction in demand shows a big improvement in water quality. Three future proofing strategies, namely operation, designed in operation and multistage design and operation show great potential to create flexibility that allows for operational diversity in the short term while trying to achieve long-term goals. The multistage design and operation strategy is able to outperform the other two strategies considering reduction in cost and improvement in performance of the system.</jats:p>",

In order to impart an antimicrobial function, the native biopolymer was quaternized and the trimethyl biopolymeric derivative (TMB) was analysed physically, chemically and for flocculating properties. The quaternized biopolymer was evaluated for antimicrobial effects against four strains of Salmonella namely, S. typhimurium ATCC 23564, MTCC 1251, MTCC 98 and S. typhi MTCC 733. TMB did not differ significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in either chemical and physical properties or flocculating ability when compared to its native counterpart. TMB completely inactivated Salmonella (60 μg/mL, at ambient temperature) within 60 min of exposure. Cell injury and death were evidenced by rapid increase in electrical conductivity in the media and release of intracellular alkaline phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases indicating permeation of cells. Electron micrographs revealed grossly altered morphology suggesting damage to the cell membranes as a possible reason for inactivation. The results of this study suggest a potential application of the developed biocidal bioflocculant for water treatment.</jats:p>",

This contribution investigates the relationships between diet and agricultural production, the resulting mass flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, their impact on the aquatic environment, the agricultural area requirements and emissions of nitrogen to the atmosphere in a clearly defined region. The combination of material flow analysis, nutrient emission model and statistical input data determines the reference state. By changing some input data (changing diet) several independent processes change. Thus the impacts of changing nutrition patterns can be investigated for a well-defined region. According to diet recommendations a scenario was developed and impacts on resources and environment drawn. Application of the method to Austria shows a 30% reduction of agricultural land requirements for food production by changing nutritional habits to a healthy balanced diet. Nitrogen export via rivers would be decreased by 11%. The diet change would also result in a reduced fertilizer input by 6% to agriculture, which is relevant especially for the limited resource phosphorus.</jats:p>",

Not only were cisterns used to store rainfall runoff they were also used to store aqueduct water to allow for seasonal variations in the supply. Cisterns during ancient times ranged from the construction of irregular shaped holes (tanks) dug out of sand and loose rock, and then lined with plaster (stucco) water proofing, to the construction of rather sophisticated structures such as those built by the Romans and Byzantines. The primary objective herein is to provide a review of the use of cisterns by ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean region, and to relate the use of these cisterns to water resources sustainability of the past and the present, outlining the lessons learned.</jats:p>",

This study estimates the impact of managerial incentives upon efficiency using a stochastic frontier production function with revenue water as the output. The empirical analysis utilises unbalanced panelled data consisting of revenue water, connections, operating expenditure, water delivered and staff, from Uganda's 19 National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) sub-utilities for a 9-year period, 2002–2010. The inefficiency effects are modelled as a function of utility-specific variables: service coverage, level of financial incentives, target difficulty, and year of observation. While financial incentives and increased service coverage improve efficiency, targets (such as the reduction of non-revenue water) that are perceived as excessive by employees may reduce it. The findings suggest some policy implications: utility managers in the public water sector need to incorporate monetary incentives and increase service coverage to reduce non-revenue water. However, targets need to be set with great care and with transparency.</jats:p>",

Various conventional methods are applied for removal of fluoride and iron but, in recent days owing to increasing eco-friendly alternatives like synthetic polymer resins are being considered. The study was focused on using polystyrene (PS) beads packed media for defluoridation and deironing of water. The removal efficiency of fluoride and iron by polystyrene beads (diameter 1.5, 4 and 8 mm) were determined for 1, 2, 3 and 4 L/min flow rates. For maximum flow rate 8 mm PS beads were efficient in reducing fluoride and iron by 94 and 90% respectively. Polystyrene beads proved to be efficient in removal of fluoride and iron.</jats:p>",

A correct characterization of GW is important to assess its potential for a direct reuse or, if not possible, to make a correct definition of a feasible and cost-effective treatment system. This article aims to contribute to the characterization of GW produced in washbasins and showers in domestic and public buildings. A compilation of several works on GW collection and sampling produced by the authors is presented. Samples were taken from GW produced in showers and washbasins in households, changing rooms and in a restaurant.

On the other hand, parks, recreation grounds, gardens, green roofs and in general ‘green infrastructure’, provide a range of (urban) ecosystem services (including quality of life and aesthetics) and could also be thought of as inter alia contributors to the mitigation of floods, droughts, noise, air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, improvement of biodiversity, amenity values and human health. Currently, these ‘blue’ and ‘green’ assets/infrastructure are planned to operate as two separate systems despite the obvious interactions between them (for example, low runoff coefficient of green areas resulting in reduction of stormwater flows, and irrigation of green areas by potable water in increasing pressure on water supply systems). This study explores the prospects of a more integrated ‘blue-green’ approach – tested at the scale of a household. Specifically, UWOT (the Urban Water Optioneering Tool) was extended and used to assess the potential benefits of a scheme that employed locally treated greywater along with harvested rainwater for irrigating a green roof. The results of the simulations indicated that the blue-green approach combined the benefits of both ‘green’ and ‘blue’ technologies/services and at the same time minimised the disadvantages of each when installed separately.</jats:p>",

Under typical operating conditions of these processes, most of the parent compound oxidized is expected to lead to the formation of transformation products (TPs). For a target ozone exposure, the resulting hydroxyl radical exposure depends on the water matrix or process chosen (e.g. peroxone) which in turn may influence the degradation pathway and the TPs formed. This study was undertaken to examine the expected impact that varying ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures may have on TP formation from the oxidation of PhACs during typical drinking water ozonation. Two representative PhACs were selected for the study. Carbamazepine was chosen to represent PhACs with a fast reaction rate with ozone (kO3 &amp;gt; 104 M−1 s−1) and bezafibrate was chosen to represent PhACs with a slow to moderate reaction rate with ozone (kO3 &amp;lt; 104 M−1 s−1). The results show that under varying ozone and hydroxyl exposure scenarios examined, the major oxidation pathway for the parent compound was dominated by reaction with ozone for carbamazepine while for bezafibrate it varied.</jats:p>",

Compared to peat FA, the river FA had lower biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). We observed a tendency for correlation between change of Gibbs free energy of adsorption and BDOC value. A chlorination dose of 1.4 mg L−1 did not change FA biodegradability and adsorbability. ClO2 treatment produced similar results; ClO2 had a stronger oxidizing influence on FA with low BDOC than on FA with high BDOC. In general, the oxidative effect of O3 was greater than Cl2 or ClO2 and the oxidative effect of ClO2 was greater than Cl2. Qi–Schideman and modified Freundlich equations well described all isotherms of FA on activated carbon F300. The content of low-adsorbed substances in peat FA decreased in the sequence: initial solution – Cl2 – ClO2 – O3. A similar difference was also seen with BDOC content in FA solutions. For peat FA with high BDOC content, the low-adsorbed fraction transformed to a strong-adsorbed fraction. Chlorination and chlorine dioxide treatment decreased low-adsorbed fraction absorbability, although ozone treatment increased it, which corresponded with a change in BDOC and a change in Gibbs free energy of adsorption. Chlorination and ClO2 treatment increased the non-adsorbable fraction, and ozonation substantially decreased the non-adsorbable part of the FA. Treatment by chlorine and ozone increased the concentration range of the strong-adsorbed fraction; chlorine dioxide did not significantly influence this fraction.</jats:p>",

Object-Z is an extension to the Z language to facilitate specification in an object-oriented style. First, we informally describe the syntax and semantics of Object-Z, highlighting those features that facilitate decomposing a large system into a collection of underlying objects and thus separating concerns. Then, we demonstrate the use of Object-Z by presenting a case study of a petrol supply system, illustrating how the system runs by communicating the constituent objects. Finally, we discuss several issues we encountered in this exercise, which may serve as feedback to the development of Object-Z.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine how different characteristics of product demand and market impact the relative sales volume in the forward and spot markets for a commodity whose aggregate demand is uncertain. In a setting where either the forward contracts are binding quantity commitments between buyers and suppliers or the forward production takes place before the uncertainty in demand is resolved, we find that a combination of factors that include market concentration, demand risk, and price elasticity of demand will determine whether a commodity will be sold mainly through forward contracts or in the spot market. Previous findings in the literature show that when participants are risk neutral, the ratio of forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone; also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. These findings hold under the assumption that demand is either deterministic or, if demand is uncertain, all production takes place after uncertainty is fully resolved and production plans can be altered instantaneously and costlessly. In our setting, however, we find that even a low level of demand risk can reverse the nature of supply in a highly competitive (low concentration) market, by shifting it from predominantly forward-driven to predominantly spot-driven supply. In markets with high concentration, the price elasticity of demand will determine whether the supply will be predominantly spot-driven or forward-driven. Our analysis suggests various new hypotheses on the structure of supply in commodity markets. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management. </jats:p>",

End-use studies provide information on water consumption and its influencing factors. However the availability of such detailed data is very limited. The research project carried out was based on total daily water consumption collected from 12 Austrian water supply areas for periods covering up to 10 years. The general data were complemented with high resolution measurements (ranging from day to 10 second intervals) of household consumption of residential buildings, semi-detached houses, single family homes, and weekend cottages as well as with meteorological data and comprehensive socio-economic and personal information. The major factors influencing residential household consumption are: demographic dynamics; age distribution; household size/family size; living conditions; and regional economic development. In the short term, water consumption is influenced by temperature, precipitation, day of the week and time. For residential consumption, these last parameters were found to be the main causes for the existing peak demands. Modernisation will lead to a further decrease of the indoor per capita water demand. The outdoor demand and its peaks are expected to increase due to climate change.</jats:p>",

We present a method for reducing the system to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials. Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Gérard P.

To assess the impact of clay particles in source water on Cryptosporidium removal efficiency by granular filtration, this study investigated the co-transport of Cryptosporidium-sized microspheres and kaolinite particles in sand columns. To investigate the influence of clay load on microsphere transport and deposition, varying influent kaolinite concentrations (0–106particles/mL) and microsphere concentrations (102–106microspheres/mL) were tested. The spatial distribution of retained microspheres was examined subsequent to experiments via filter coring. Results demonstrate that increasing the influent microsphere concentration impaired filter performance due to a blocking mechanism whereby previously retained particles repel incoming particles. In contrast, when the particulate load was dominated by kaolinite (for an equivalent particulate load), filter performance improved as a result of filter ripening whereby previously deposited particles act as additional collectors. Thus, microsphere-kaolinite interactions proved to be favorable although both particles possessed negative zeta potentials in the tested conditions. This study demonstrates that granular filter performance is vulnerable to peak events of microbial contamination. Conversely, Cryptosporidium-sized microsphere removal by granular filtration is enhanced in the presence of kaolinite in source water.</jats:p>",

The optimization model is used to guide the decisions toward an optimal allocation of resources given the realistic supply chain representation given by the simulation. Thus, the proposed approach provides a more realistic solution compared to a stand‐alone optimization model, often a simplified representation of the actual system, by making use of the simulation model, which captures the detailed dynamic behavior of the system. A multiobjective problem has been formulated by taking into consideration the environmental impact of supply chain operations. The proposed framework has been applied to small‐scale case studies to study the effectiveness of the approach for such problems. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 59: 4612–4626, 2013</jats:p>",

The results proved that oilseed rape had high fertilizer (N+PK) demand. In the experiments, N = 210 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> +PK proved to be the optimal fertilizer dose. The yield-increasing effect of fertilization was 800 to 1300 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, depending on the year. The maximum yield (5000 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was obtained in the year with least infection. The excellent natural nutrient-providing ability of chernozem soil was confirmed by the high yield level (3000–4200 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) of the control treatment (N = 0 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> +PK). The results showed that the specific fertilizer utilization efficiency of oilseed rape decreased if the dose of N+PK fertilizer was increased (being 19–27 kg/1 kg NPK in the control treatment and 11–12 kg/1 kg NPK in the N = 210 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> +PK treatment). On the other hand, fertilization improved the water utilization from 4–8 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water to 11–14 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water. The results of these studies confirmed that hybrid rape had excellent adaptability to the sowing time.

The key role in the arrangement of logistics is played by supply processes: ordering, purchase, delivery, and storage of material and technical resources (goods). The Complexity and multiplicity of implementing the logistics process assume the use of economic-mathematical modeling, as an efficient tool for supporting decisions, which ensures the selection of the most favorable supply options. This paper provides a dynamic model of optimized supply (at decentralized procurement of material and technical resources), which describes the possible options of arranging the logistics of organizational units of the armed forces. The criterion of global optimization is represented by a normalized performance indicator characterizing the level of provision of organizational units with material and technical resources. The proposed economic-mathematical model is an efficient tool for supporting decisions taken by logistics-management divisions of organizational units of armed forces - at multiple options of implementing the logistic processes and limited financial resources, which allows optimizing the level of provision of organizational units with required material and technical resources (for the entire planning period of supply, regarding change of needs, scope of funds allocated for logistics and logistic costs accompanying the supply process).

Performance testing data for novel devices are not publicly available and there has been no systematic attempt to independently verify manufacturer effectiveness claims. We purchased three gravity-driven HWT devices available on the Indian market to evaluate their performance in reducing bacteria, viruses, and protozoan surrogates in the laboratory according to World Health Organization testing protocols. Results indicated that technologies were moderately effective in reducing Escherichia coli (1.6–2.9 log10) and MS2 (1.4–2.8 log10), and less effective against Bacillus subtilis spores (0.73–2.2 log10) and 3 μm microspheres (0.33–0.56 log10), as means over the testing period (750–4,000 l). Effectiveness declined sharply over the duration of testing for each device, suggesting that the manufacturer-specified effective lifespans were overestimated for all devices. Moderate variability was observed across challenge conditions intended to represent actual use conditions, but performance was not significantly different between challenge waters or ambient testing temperature. Our results suggest that these novel devices do not meet international minimum performance recommendations and that manufacturer effectiveness claims are misleading.

In the full-scale plant, the ozone exposure was determined at different temperatures and ozone doses, and an empirical relation between ozone exposure, ozone dose and temperature was derived. Based on the results, the optimum ozone dose required to obtain a Log 2 removal of viruses and a Log 1 removal of Giardia was determined as a function of temperature. Bromate formation was found to be dependent on the ozone dose rather than on the CT value. Therefore, an empirical relation between bromate formation, ozone dose and temperature was established.

Heat treatment (24 h) reduced the pure water permeability from 4.1 to 2.8 L/m2hbar but improved conductivity rejection from 95.5 to 97.0%. As a result, a correlation was observed between changes in the two parameters. Marginal changes in the membrane surface characteristics (i.e. zeta potential, hydrophobicity, chemistry and roughness) were observed as a result of heat treatment. Heat treatment significantly improved the fouling resistance property of the RO membrane. When the secondary effluent was filtrated at an elevated permeated flux, the virgin RO membrane exhibited 30% flux decline while the heat-treated membrane showed only 12% flux decline. This is possibly because heat treatment resulted in a denser cross-linked active skin layer, thus reducing the blockage caused by small organic foulants.</jats:p>",

Additionally, collecting and storing runoff via RWH systems can potentially provide water quality benefits due to physical and chemical processes that occur within the storage tank. This study quantified the water quality improvement provided by storing rooftop runoff via RWH systems at four sites in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Roof runoff and extraction spigot samples were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), nitrogen species and total phosphorus. Roof concentrations were significantly greater than spigot concentrations for all constituents except TSS, indicating the ability of RWH systems to significantly lower nutrient concentrations of incoming roof runoff. Lack of significant TSS reduction was likely attributable to low, ‘irreducible’ concentrations of TSS in the roof runoff. The use of additional filtration components prior to the extraction spigot could aid in lowering spigot TSS concentrations. The findings presented herein contend that stormwater benefits associated with RWH are not only limited to hydrologic mitigation, but also include reductions in concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus species. Thus, it is recommended that pollutant removal credit be assigned to these systems when used as stormwater control measures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are typical chlorination disinfection by-products in drinking water. Apart from natural organic matter, synthetic organic compounds in raw water contribute to HAAs due to their high frequency of detection in raw water and high reactive activities with chlorine. Formation characteristics of HAAs from synthetic organic compounds were investigated using seven phenols as models in the chlorination process. Two HAAs, trihaloacetic acid (TCAA) and dihaloacetic acid (DCAA), were generated and TCAA was the main product. The molar yields of HAAs varied between 0.087 mol/(mol phenol) from resorcinol to 0.251 mol/(mol phenol) from 2,4,6-trichlorophenol at pH 7.0. Phenols having para- or ortho-substituent groups were found to have higher reactive activities than those having meta-substituent groups in forming HAAs. HAA formation potential (HAAFP) of raw water was significantly enhanced with spiked phenols. These results indicate that synthetic organic compounds in raw water have high activities in yielding HAAs, and more research should be focused on their behaviors in drinking water disinfection.</jats:p>",

Several frequency selection circuits are then used to separate individual signals in different frequency band from the high-voltage signal. Finally, these signals are rectified and filtered respectively to obtain multiple channel DC voltages. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is analyzed theoretically and verified by simulation.

The capabilities of the proposed technique are demonstrated on a real-life problem, the water distribution system of the town of Sopron, Hungary. Nine test cases were defined which represent different initial water level scenarios, thus the new application was easy to compare to a former developed genetic algorithm and to some world-leading optimization solvers which are available on the NEOS Server. The benefits and drawbacks of these deterministic and heuristic methods are highlighted.</jats:p>",

A three-phase,  four-leg DG grid-interfacing converter based on the improved structure  of a Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC, including a series  converter and a parallel converter) is adopted, and improved indirect  and direct control strategies are proposed. It can be observed that  these strategies effectively compensate for voltage sags, voltage swells  and voltage distortion, as well as voltage power quality problems  resulting from the nonlinear and unbalanced  loads in a micro-grid.  While solving the coupling interference from series–parallel,  the  grid-interfacing converter can achieve proper load power sharing in a  micro-grid.  In particular, an improved minimum-energy compensation  method is proposed that can overcome the conventional compensation  algorithm defects, ensure the load voltage’s phase angle stability,  improve the voltage compensating ability and range, reduce the capacity  and cost of converters, and reduce the shock of micro-grid switching  between grid-connected mode and islanded mode. Moreover, the  advantages/disadvantages and application situation of the two improved  control strategies are analyzed.

Rice paddy fields are traditionally seen in East and South-East Asia, particularly in areas that have a considerable seasonal variation in rainfall resulting in flooding and drought. One of the advantages of these fields in East Asia is that the period of rainfall is similar to the period of the water demand of the rice paddy. In this study, the water management functions of rice paddy are evaluated using rainfall–storage–discharge (RSD) modeling. The RSD system is a type of onsite structure used for rainwater management. In this study, the area of the rice paddy is assumed to be 10,000 m2, and the rice paddy is considered to perform the storage and catchment functions of a rainwater harvesting system. The RSD system can be used for analyzing the outflow rate according to the rice paddy area and the peak outflow curves for a 100-year period; further, the effectiveness of the RSD system in reducing the final water discharge rate through a rice paddy is evaluated.</jats:p>",

Barcelona provides a useful illustration of how such a modern system came into being in a particularly dynamic southern European setting. Despite being Spain's leading industrial centre, the driving force behind the introduction of its new water supply system did not come from an industrial imperative but rather from the city's expansion plan, approved in 1859, which gave rise to a proliferation of private initiatives. Later, decisive changes around the turn of the twentieth century led to a concentration of water companies, sewer renewal projects and the entry of water into the domestic sphere, and the extension of the water supply to people's homes. The development of a modern water supply system in Barcelona, however, required a period of a hundred years – from 1867, when the first steam-powered pumping station was built, to 1967, when the water from the Ter River transfer reached the city, allowing new consumption patterns to spread rapidly.</jats:p>",

Consequently, the prediction of the removal of contaminants in the treatment and supply chain of drinking water is of great interest. By collecting and processing existing chemical properties of contaminants, QSARs (quantitative structure-activity relationships) for typical removal parameters can be constructed. Depending on the definition of the predicted endpoint, QSARs are (1) embedded in a process model suite, where they serve to predict a model parameter and the total, hybrid model predicts a removal rate or (2) used to directly predict, e.g., the removal rate, or a rejection coefficient for membrane systems. The different types of resulting prediction models, ranging from mechanistic (causal) to empirical (data-based), allow for hypothesis testing of current physico-chemical mechanisms and interactions between the contaminant, the type of water and the materials or energy (e.g. UV light) of the removal barrier. Two case studies illustrate this viewpoint and also pinpoint that, firstly, QSAR development, validation and residual analysis stress the linkage between the QSAR endpoints and process model predictions, and secondly, they lay bare the need to share data, algorithms and models.</jats:p>",

Several photovoltaic (PV) technologies exist, which cause various pathways to produce electricity from solar energy. This paper evaluates the competition between three influential solar technologies based on photovoltaic technique to find the optimal pathways for satisfying the electricity demand: (1) multicrystalline silicon; (2) copper, indium, gallium, and selenium (CIGS); and (3) multijunction. Besides the technical factors, there are other effective parameters such as cost, operability, feasibility, and capacity that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as optimal and viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, a generic optimization-based model was developed for the long-range energy planning and design of future electricity supply system from solar energy. By applying dynamic programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying the optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives. The features and capabilities of the model were shown through application to Iran as a case study.</jats:p>",

The salt extracts showed higher activity compared to that of water extract in most of the samples tested. The coagulation activity was stable after incubation at 95 °C for 5 hours implying heat resistance. A protein profile analysis showed major protein bands with a molecular weight around 6.5 and 9 kDa.

This analysis helps to obtain actual performance of the water distribution network damaged by seismic waves, without the usual need to handle negative nodal pressures generated from demand driven simulation method. Pressure performance indicator and the total leakage of the network are used as indicators to show the hydraulic performance of the system. Comparison of the damages from different seismic scenarios and the hydraulic indicators of the network, illustrate the probable condition of the water distribution network after the earthquake.

One component of the lifelong education concept is Vocational Education and Training (VET), aimed at closing the gap between workers’ skills and qualification and changing demand in labour markets. Although local partnerships seem to be an adequate tool to implement VET strategies, some authors identify obstacles that can be attributed to bad practices. Thus, more evidence is needed to support the idea that local development and public-private partnerships are optimal organisational environments for the design and implementation of VET strategies and actions at local and sub-regional levels.

The main limitation of the schemes is seen in their large spatial scale, which is determined by the available environmental monitoring data. The meso-scale catchments are usually ungauged, which does not allow monitoring and management of water quality on the respective scale and thus they are not included in the schemes. This can have severe consequences, if the catchment is used for drinking water supply (DWS) from surface waters. This is shown in the example of the Nytva river basin, where raw water is extracted from the eutrophic Nytva reservoir for DWS. The solution of the problem is seen in the application of structured water quality mitigation measures, included in the basin management plan. A method to develop such a plan is presented here. The preliminary results of system screening (identification of problems and drivers) and material flow analysis (MFA) have shown that the reservoir is hypertrophic and the probable drivers are emissions from cattle breading, point sources and erosion from arable land. Apart from first measurements, soft factors and the problem of eutrophication identification are discussed, pointing out the need for further studies with regard to eutrophication in the reservoir and the analysis of stakeholders and material flow.</jats:p>",

It is a dual-input converter and mainly contains a PV energy source, a wind turbine energy source, a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) forward converter, and a current-doubler rectifier. The proposed power supply system has the following advantages: (1) PV-arrays and wind-energy sources can alternatively deliver power to the load during climate or season alteration; (2) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) can be accomplished for both different kinds of renewable-energy sources; (3) ZVS and synchronous rectification techniques for the active switches of the forward converter are embedded so as to reduce switching and conducting losses; and (4) electricity isolation is naturally obtained. To achieve an optimally dynamic response and to increase control flexibility, a digital signal processor (DSP) is investigated and presented to implement MPPT algorithm and power regulating scheme. Finally, a 240 W prototype power supply system with ZVS and current-doubler features to deal with PV power and wind energy is built and implemented. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance and the feasibility of the proposed power supply system.</jats:p>"

Three hydrophilic polymers were synthesized based on a N-vinylformamide (NVF) structure cross-linked with divinylbenzene (DVB): p(NVF-co-DVB), p(VAm-co-DVB), and, after reaction with glutaraldehyde (GA), p(VAm-co-DVB)GA. The physicochemical characteristics of the resulting polymers were determined by measuring element content, specific surface area, total pore volume and the positive zeta potential of the surface. All the tested polymers showed more than 99.5% adsorption of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in aqueous solution during 15 min of incubation. Desorption of MC-LR from the complexes formed with polymers depended on the type of polymer and the solvent and ranged from 0 to 22.8%. The yield from application of a field of acoustic waves to methanol solution freed from the MC-LR–p(NVF-co-DVB) complex was 25.1% MC-LR. These results suggest the occurrence of strong bonds in the complex, bonds formed through physical interaction between the negative resultant charge of the MC-LR molecule and the positive charge of the polymer surface. The MC-LR adsorption capacity of the polymer depended on the dose of the toxin: 99.5% at a MC-LR: polymer ratio of 1:1,000 (w/w) and 98.6% at a 1:100 ratio.</jats:p>",

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a powerful technique that potentially permits to reach this goal, but some aspects as, for instance, food product composition (e.g. moisture content, salt or sugar content) and some peculiarities of the production environment (high moisture, high/low temperatures, metallic structures) have prevented, so far, its application in food sector. In the food industry, composition and shape of items are much less regular than in other commodities sectors. In addition, a wide variety of packaging, composed by different materials, is employed. As material, size and shape of items to which the tag should be attached strongly influence the minimum power requested for tag functioning, performance improvements can be achieved only selecting suitable RF identifier for the specific combination of food product and packaging. When dealing with logistics units, the dynamic reading of a vast number of tags originates simultaneous broadcasting of signals (tag-to-tag collisions) that could affect reading rates and the overall reliability of the identification procedure. This paper reports the results of an extensive analysis of the reading performance of UHF RFID systems for multiple dynamic electronic identification of food packed products in controlled conditions. Products were considered singularly or arranged on a logistics pallet. The effects on reading rate and reading zone of different factors, among which the type of product, the number and position of antennas, the field polarization, the reader RF power output, the interrogation protocol configuration as well as the transit speed, the number of tags and their interactions were analysed and compared.</jats:p>"

Leaf growth and leaf area expansion were effectively increased at middle and late maize growth stages under limited water supply and the maximum leaf area was maintained at early grain filling to middle filling. In addition, dry matter accumulation of maize in reproductive organs may be promoted by limited water supply. Finally, limited water supply also had great effect on net assimilation rate of maize and the maximum was maintained at six-leaf to twelve-leaf, followed by heading to silking.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid sand filtration (RSF) is an economical way to treat anoxic groundwater around the world. It consists of groundwater aeration followed by passage through a sand filter. The oxidation and removal of ferrous iron, which is commonly found in anoxic groundwaters, is often believed to be a fully physicochemical process. However, persistently low temperatures in RSF across Denmark may negatively affect the kinetics of chemical oxidation. The slower chemical oxidation of ferrous iron may increase the chances for iron bioconversion by neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), which are found naturally in many environments. In this study, we used a combination of a cultivation-based opposing gradient enrichment technique and 16S rRNA gene targeted molecular tools to isolate, quantify and identify FeOB from a RSF. The microscopic quantification of selectively enriched FeOB cells revealed that in RSF, neutrophilic iron oxidizers were present at the level of up to 7 × 105 cells g−1 sediment. The spatial abundance and diversity of FeOB inferred by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting differed greatly both between and within individual sand filters. The results suggest a larger than assumed role of FeOB in iron removal at waterworks using RSF technologies.</jats:p>",

The search of better routines for water pumping stations with both starting and stopping of pumps or use of variable speed devices has become increasingly common, and the motivation of this search is found in the need for energy saving. But the task is arduous and becomes fertile field for the application of modern techniques and robust optimization. Noteworthy are currently those that seek their inspiration in nature systems, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, which is based on intelligence of groups, such as schools of fish or swarms of bee.

Interestingly, our results show that only when the initial carbon emissions level of the product is less than a certain threshold, as consumers environmental awareness increasing, the amount of carbon emissions per unit of output produced will decrease.

The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes Water Safety Plans (WSPs) as the most effective means of consistently ensuring the safety of a drinking-water supply. Although health benefits of WSP implementation have been shown, there is a lack of information relating water supplier characteristics to expected costs. Costing practices were adapted from food quality management studies and applied to six water suppliers from the Western Pacific Region, as designated by WHO. The explanation building procedure was used to develop understanding of relationships between drinking-water supply agency (DWSA) characteristics and WSP implementation costs. The results indicate that costs associated with WSP implementation are expected to be low for developed DWSAs; however, for developing DWSAs, there is high variability in costs which indicates further research may not improve generalized WSP cost estimations. Furthermore, developing DWSAs experience large and highly variable capital and operational monitoring costs. The capital and operational monitoring improvements are necessary to achieving a safe water supply and may require ongoing financial and technical resources to execute.</jats:p>",

The resistivity inverse model showed that the freshwater zone is extremely clear. Chemical analyses of the groundwater samples obtained from seven boreholes from 2010 to 2013 were studied. The total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity were represented as being less than 500 mg/L and 600 μmhos/cm, respectively, and freshwater was therefore indicated.

In the present study, the fluoride content was chemically analysed and integrated with geochemical model WATEQ4F sampled from Allahabad district, Northern India, with other water quality parameters. Geospatial technique was employed to depict the spatial distribution of fluoride concentrations, over this plain, normalized with WHO (World Health Organization) and BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) standards represented in the form of spatially interpolated maps. Hydro-geological conditions, such as weathering, geochemical reactions, alkaline nature of water, ion-exchange and high variability in temperature range, were taken into account in describing the geo or anthropogenic contributions to fluoride in groundwater. A large database of available ancillary information on related factors, such as soil properties, geological settings and climatic and topographical information, on a local scale, were also taken into account to rationalize the results. The analysis implies that post-monsoon samples have elevated concentration of fluoride compared with the pre-monsoon samples, with several zones found severely contaminated with fluoride as compared with the set standards in both seasons. The correlation analysis revealed a high correlation of fluoride, with fluorite mineral saturation index, followed by calcite and magnesite, indicating that these minerals could be used as geochemical indicators for fluoride contaminated areas.</jats:p>",

As all components are built into the model of the TPS accelerator, we can build accurately a model of the powersupply cabling project. For example, we can check the position for every cable. We also canestimate every length and the total cable length for purchase and budget control. As we can evaluate the conditions for every power cable to lay the cable tray from the power supply to the magnets, we can lay every cable to follow the sequence in the cable tray. We thereby convert the drawing of the two-dimensional construction graph when we design the finished three-dimensional cabling simulation model.

Disinfection results showed biologically-synthesized silver nanoparticles (referred to hereafter as ‘bio-AgNPs’) had the best disinfection performance, 10 mg/L of which was able to inactivate all the E. coli in 1 min (&amp;gt;6 log removals) and achieved 4 log removals of MS2 coliphage. Bio-AgNPs were therefore selected for further study in terms of effects of the concentration and contact time as well as the impacts of environmental conditions on the viral inactivation. Given the viral inactivation profile of bio-AgNPs shown in this study, it could be concluded that viral inactivation by bio-AgNPs could be inhibited by total organic carbon (TOC) (10 mg/L as humic acid) and chloride ion (5 mg/L) to a large extent while Ca2+/Mg2+/ionic strength only had minor effects on the viral inactivation at high concentrations (188 mg/L as CaCO3 of hardness or 5.6 mM of ionic strength, respectively).

Such concerns were dramatically highlighted in January 2012 when water in the Boesmanspruit Dam, which supplies the town of Carolina with potable water, underwent rapid deterioration following a large rainstorm event. A sudden drop in pH to 3.7, accompanied by elevated levels of iron, aluminium, manganese and sulphate rendered the water toxic and unsuitable for use. The problem remained unresolved for 7 months, provoking community protests and eventually court action against the Department of Water Affairs. Although evidence pointed to coal mining as the source of contamination, it was unclear how the dam became polluted so rapidly. We investigated the events surrounding the contamination of Carolina’s water supply, in an attempt to identify a possible cause and to assess whether the event has relevance for other dams in the Vaal River system. Chemical analyses of water samples revealed that the pollution originated from the Witrandspruit subcatchment where seepage from coal mines had accumulated in a wetland upstream of the dam. During an unusually heavy downpour, ponds holding polluted run-off from coal handling facilities overtopped and flushed the contents of the wetland into the Boesmanspruit Dam. While a recurrence of the event at Carolina is possible, major dams in the upper Vaal River catchment are unlikely to experience a similar catastrophic event. In the long term, pollution of these dams is likely to proceed gradually, as is currently occurring at the Middelburg and Witbank Dams.</jats:p>"

In an effort to address the current arsenic drinking water requirements in Hungary, life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology was applied on two example arsenic removal technologies, coagulation-filtration and adsorption, from cradle to grave. A distribution of 500 m3/day was assumed, along with a range of possible operation boundary conditions modelled solely for As treatment. Nine out of 10 considered impact categories tended to favour coagulation-filtration, however realistic variations in water chemistry and product characteristics led to some overlap of their environmental impact. Unlike other studies on water systems, electricity did not have a large direct impact; this was due to the focussed nature of this study on individual treatment technologies rather than an entire water supply system. Regeneration of the adsorption technology filter material was also observed to require nearly the same mass of materials for one regeneration as what was needed to support the coagulation-filtration technology for an entire year. Hazardous waste was surprisingly not reduced for adsorption compared to coagulation-filtration due to prefiltration requirements and an extra regeneration, even though adsorption shifts some of the environmental burden to the production phase. Additionally, cost analysis observes that coagulation-filtration is the cheaper of the two technologies; its highest cost is that of waste disposal, while the highest single expense modelled is that of the adsorption media cost.</jats:p>",

Here we investigated the efficacy of electrochemical disinfection for inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores – a model microorganism of highly resistant pathogens. The effect of electrochemical disinfection with TinO2n−1 ceramic electrodes which generate active chlorine from chloride in situ, was compared to the traditional chlorination in which active chlorine was produced from addition of sodium hypochlorite. Research was performed on a batch scale with a synthetic buffered drinking water containing 35.5 mg/l of chloride ions. Spore viability was analysed with both cultivation and cell potential for dividing (direct viable count method). The results showed that at similar residual disinfectant concentrations x contact time (CT value), electrochemical disinfection was over three times more effective in neutralizing both cultivable B. subtilis spores and those with cell potential for dividing than traditional chlorination. As in chlorination, electrochemical disinfection was shown to be water-pH dependent and the lowest CT value of 112 mg/l min−1 (2-log removal) was obtained at pH 6. The lowest efficiency for both techniques was observed at pH 8. In conclusion, electrochemical disinfection is a viable in situ method even at low levels of chlorides in drinking water and appears to be more effective than simple chlorination with the addition of the active chlorine species when highly resistant microbial forms are analysed, however, to apply the technology on a large scale additional studies on potential formation of disinfection by-products must be performed.</jats:p>",

Using a large database of a full-scale water treatment plant in Brazil, two of the turbidity removal-based models returned 1–3 log unit removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts and median values of Cryptosporidium annual infection risk estimates of approximately 10−2pppy (per person per year). The other model based on turbidity removal and the empirical model resulted, respectively, in 2–3.5 and 0–4 log removal of Cryptosporidium oocysts and corresponding infection risk estimates around 10−2pppy, close therefore to the health-based targets of the WHO guidelines for drinking water.

Along with iron oxides, organic compounds are well established as predominant constituents of LD. Even so, the composition and role of the latter remain unknown. Since microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are components of iron-rich flocs from many freshwater environments, the presence of EPS in LD was investigated. This was confirmed by the systematic occurrence of polysaccharides and proteins in LD samples. In addition, microscopic observations and measurements of LD water contents showed that, like their freshwater counterparts, LD have a hydrogel floc nature and fractal morphology.

Experiments were carried out with focus on the degradation efficiency of CNBs at different reaction pH values, water matrices and repeated uses, as well as the possible catalytic mechanism. Regardless of the water matrix, the results showed that the catalytic ozonation had considerably higher degradation efficiency of CNBs than the single ozonation process at the same ozone dose. The change of pH had an obvious effect on the removal efficiency of CNBs, which suggested that the aluminum silicate catalyst was more appropriate for application in the neutral pH condition. Ozonation processes in the presence of the aluminum silicate were significantly influenced by tert-butyl alcohol, which confirmed that the aluminum silicate catalytic ozonation followed a hydroxyl radical-type mechanism.</jats:p>",

Depending on the water utility and the local circumstances, each one of these components can adopt a larger or smaller importance. Obviously, accurate estimates of apparent losses components can be an invaluable tool for water utilities managers who, by having this information, will know how to make more profitable investments. Strangely enough, however, until now there has not been published a standard methodology that provides adequate guidelines to conduct a proper evaluation of water meter inaccuracies. The most probable reason is the complexity underlying this calculation, which involves the use of many parameters that are hardly understood. The lack of a standard methodology to calculate water meter inaccuracies can lead to different results, even in the case of analysing the same set of data. Consequently, water companies cannot compare their figures on metering errors with other utilities since they may have been obtained by applying different methodologies and might not be directly comparable. Taking this into consideration, this paper tries to define a basic methodology to calculate water meter inaccuracies.</jats:p>",

The pilot scale results showed the potential for efficient arsenic removal from spiked solutions (with As in the range of 50–85 μg/L) depending on the process conditions (flow and applied current). In the waterworks where the system was implemented for a period of 14 months, there was a relationship where the higher applied current from the iron generator resulted in a better quality of water produced. The long period of use also helped to determine a proper iron dosage (the Fe/As ratio 68 mg/mg) and identify carbonate scale formation in the electrochemical process. The electrolytic dissolution of the Fe was found to be a practical method for iron dosing; however more work has to be done on process improvement and optimization that will focus on the Fe anode geometry.</jats:p>",

While Sri Lanka has established close economic ties with India in general, the FTA (2000) has led to a ‘zero’-tariff regime covering a bulk of their bilateral trade. However, there is no evidence to support the popular perceptions about the deeper integration of Sri Lanka into Indian supply chains. While the expansion of Sri Lanka’s trade with India under the FTA has revealed peculiar outcomes, the ‘old-style’ trade integration between the two countries has remained virtually unchanged. Trade and growth patterns in both Sri Lanka and India are different from the experience of East and South-east Asian countries which created opportunities to accommodate globalized supply chains of fragmented manufacturing processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new technology based on acoustic waves is developed to monitor the state of sand filters used in drinking water treatment. Changes in the sand filter, due to the removal of suspended particles from the water and their accumulation in the pores, result in an increase of the bulk density and acoustic speed of the granular material. Consequently, the reflected acoustic response changes as the filter is in use. To monitor these changes, an instrument composed of an omnidirectional transmitter and an array of hydrophones was built. With frequencies ranging between 10 and 110 kHz, high resolution is achieved in the vertical direction enabling the detectability of clogged layers with a minimum thickness of 1 cm. The novel instrument is tested by conducting a monitoring experiment in a filter used in practice. A 2D scan over a part of the filter was performed and repeated every 2 hours over a period of 10 days. An analysis of the data revealed a local increase of the reflected acoustic response with increasing filter run time. The changes in acoustic signal are mainly observed at the upper 5 cm of the sand bed. It is also clear that the filter bed is slowly compacting as a function of time. The total compaction after a period of 10 days reached 3.5 cm. The filter bed is expanded again during the cleaning procedure. Once the procedure is completed, the upper 30 cm of the filter becomes more transparent, showing small accumulations of material at greater depth. The observed changes in the filter bed demonstrate the potential of this acoustic-based tool to monitor the state of rapid sand filters and optimise their performance. The new tool can be used to evaluate the cleaning procedure and is valuable in detecting lateral variations in the filter bed. These variations may indicate local clogging that needs to be removed effectively to avoid deterioration of the overall performance in the long term. This type of information is difficult to obtain from the monitoring techniques currently used in drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Woody Biomasses (from agriculture and forestry activities) are among the most promising renewable energy sources. Current literature describes woody biomass feedstock supply chains supporting biofuels and utilities industries: the potentially productive land area overheads required for biomass production may results in a complex logistic within the whole chain. Its effective enhancement requires significant changes in the logistics environment of energy plants for sustainable energy production and the sequence-dependent procurement chains for biomasses furthermore complicate these changes. According to this, optimizing harvesting and supplying operations turns out to be strategic within the framework of the current energy policy. In this work we present a case study carried out monitoring 57 short rotation forestry (SRF) production sites placed in Emilia Romagna Region, Northern Italy, all supplying the harvested biomass to the same biomass power plant placed in the province of Ravenna (Italy). The overall average yield of these sites was 55 t/ha, the site surfaces ranged from 0.3 to 20 hectares and the distance from the power plant ranged between 8.2 to 102 km with one production site only within 10 km from the power plant. Harvest and transport costs were calculated according to two different harvesting scenarios: i) single phase harvesting (one cutting/chopping machine + tractors and trailers); ii) double phase harvesting (cutting/mowing machine followed after 80 days by chopping machine + tractors and trailers). Results show that, according to the first scenario, at increasing distances overall harvesting and transport costs ranged from 8.9 to 21.0 ± 1.3 􀀍/t (average ± standard deviation), while, with reference to the second scenario, they increased from 10.3 to 23.8 ± 1.5 􀀍/t with the transportation costs accounting from 16 to almost 70% of the total costs.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that whether a firm benefits from its power depends on the expected demand model but not on demand shock model. A firm benefits from its power only for linear but not for constant elasticity expected demand. The impact of power structure on supply chain efficiency depends on the models of both expected demand and demand shock. With additive shock, supply chain efficiency is highest (lowest) when neither firm dominates for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With multiplicative shock, the supply chain efficiency is highest with a power retailer (manufacturer) for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. The manufacturer always benefits from a reduction in demand uncertainty. However, the retailer loses (benefits) from demand uncertainty reduction for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With a power retailer, the retail price is always on the higher end for linear expected demand, and the customer service level is the lowest for constant elasticity expected demand. Consequently, consumers do not necessarily benefit from a power retailer. </jats:p>",

The paper presents a primary segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PS-PMLSM), which can solve the problems of the long stroke linear motor in excessive power dissipation, the difficulties of power supply. According to the motor structure characteristics and application background, the paper proposes four feasible strategies--a single inverter series alternating power supply (SISAP), a single inverter parallel alternating power supply (SIPAP), dual inverters alternating power supply (DIAP) and inter-segment optimal power supply (ISOP). Firstly, the article makes studies on those strategies from the economic cost, energy efficiency, the complexity of switching among the segments and the convenience of algorithm application by calculation and simulation. Secondly, the mathematics model of the motor and control system model is deduced from different strategies, respectively. Then, the available control method is derived from the analysis of these models and the motion characteristics. Finally, effects of performance are comparatively analyzed through the simulation.</jats:p>"

The first part of the study aimed at evaluating the influence of the biofilm on permeate flux quality and quantity with regard to Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) degradation. In addition, two types of biological pre-treatments were evaluated: slow sand filtration and packed bed bio-reactor, compared to a control (no treatment). Biofilm formation helped to decrease the AOC content of permeate water, compared to the influent. Both pre-treatments additionally reduced the AOC level in the permeate and thus increased its biological stability, however none of the systems were able to guarantee microbiologically stable water. Removal of AOC before the GDM filtration reduced the biofilm growth potential, which in turn influenced its physical structure and enhanced the permeation rates. Influence of inorganic particle removal by pre-sedimentation and its effect on biofilm structure were also studied. Pre-sedimentation of particle populations selected fine and homogeneous particle fractions, which led to the formation of a homogeneous biofilm structure characterised by an increased hydraulic resistance. This was clearly visible between horizontally and vertically installed membranes where the latter ones had a significantly reduced flux despite lower deposited particle mass. The presence of larger, heterogeneous particle fractions counterbalanced the negative effects of the fine particles, which overall resulted in enhanced permeation rates.</jats:p>",

We develop an enhanced myopic two‐stage approach for this problem. The first stage determines the production plan and uses a heuristic, and the second stage determines the warehouse allocation plan and uses a non‐linear optimization model. This two‐stage approach is repeated every period and incorporates look‐ahead features to improve its performance in future periods. We validate our model using actual data from one factory at Amy's Kitchen and compare the performance of our model to that of the actual operation. We find that our model significantly reduces both inventory levels and stockouts relative to those of the actual operation. In addition, we identify a lower bound on the total costs for all feasible solutions to the problem and measure the effectiveness of our model against this lower bound. We perform sensitivity analysis on some key parameters and assumptions of our modeling approach. </jats:p>",

It adds to profitability, competitive ability, service optimization, market diversification, etc. This article investigates the role of inventory management in fostering small firms’ growth. The research framework and hypotheses were examined by the empirical analysis of primary data collected from 44 functional manufacturing units sub-divided into ten lines of operation in district Udhampur, in Jammu &amp; Kashmir (J&amp;K). Validity and reliability of the scales in the construct were assessed through Bartlett’s Test of Sphercity (BTS) and Cronbach-alpha test. The results of regression model and analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that proper inventory management leads to economy and efficiency, nurtures competitive ability and paves way for cost reduction. Further results divulged that managers of different age group don’t significantly differ with regard to inventory control techniques. To promote inventory management, integrated strategic planning encompassing logistics, promotional-mix, technological capabilities and industrial promotion campaigns by government are needed. </jats:p>",

Firstly, an equivalent load model of the back-stage in the RSW inverter power supply is established, thus the real load of this PFC circuit can be archived. Then, the 3-phase 4-wire VIENNA rectifier PFC circuit is analyzed with the simulation software of Pspice. Finally, an experimental circuit power of 3kW is designed.

The groundwater was collected at a depth of 200 m in the plateau region, in Central Mexico, (As 134 μg L−1, Fe 0.3 mg L−1, Cd 0.7 mg L−1, Na 58 mg L−1, pH 6.8). The influence of current density (J) and mean linear flow rate (u) on As removal was analyzed. EC revealed that u of 0.91 cm s−1 (which gives a retention time of 53.4 s) at J of 6 and 8 mA cm−2 yielded samples that met the Mexican standard for arsenic (≤25 μg L−1). EC at 10 mA cm−2 did not improve results any further owing to massive generation of gases and anode passivation. The partial EC removal of arsenic can be attributed to the mixture of HAsO2, H3AsO3 and HAsO42−. HAsO42− is more susceptible to removal by adsorption on Al(OH)3 and Al2O3 flocs. The best EC result was obtained at 6 mA cm−2 and 0.91 cm s−1, with energy consumption of 0.89 kWh m−3, which decreased arsenic from 134 to 14 μg L−1.</jats:p>",

In this study, rainfall–antecedent soil moisture condition–runoff relationships and the potential efficiency of RCs are presented. Rainfall and runoff data monitored at research sites in Merredin and Mount Barker are used to determine this relationship. Two antecedent moisture criteria; Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) and Average Antecedent Precipitation (AAP) are used to analyse the relationship between previous rainfall and soil moisture for each RC. Monitored results show that AMC is not that suitable to show the relationship between rainfall and antecedent soil moisture condition of the RC in the dryland of Western Australia and it is recommended to use AAP to determine this relationship.</jats:p>",

It differs from existing approaches in the incorporation of the entire IAM process into a single organised framework, with an integrated, long-term vision of the urban water network – looking at the infrastructure as a system, and not as a mere sum of individual assets.

The present study aims to investigate the factors that may influence the extraction efficiency during HNM analysis by LLE method, and as a result develop a more sensitive extraction method for HNM determination. Results showed that the dose of sodium sulfate exerted the most significant influence, followed by copper sulfate, while the pH and manual shaking times have little effect. Under the suitable conditions (for extracting HNMs in 45 mL water: pH = 3.5–5, CuSO4 = 1.0 g, Na2SO4 = 6 g, shaking times = 120–180), the correlation coefficients (r) of the calibration curves for nine HNMs were all more than 0.9925. The method detection limit (MDL) ranged from 0.017 to 0.217 μg L−1 with an average of 0.076 μg L−1, which was dominantly lower than the method reported. The recovery (spiked blank samples: 98–108%; spiked tap water: 81–120%) and precision (relative standard deviation: 0.46–6.72) also showed good reliability and reproducibility of the method. Finally, the developed method was applied to the determination of HNMs in real water samples.</jats:p>",

IHSS NOM water exposed to UV irradiation or chlor(am)ine alone was also evaluated. Both chlor(am)ine alone and UV/chlor(am)ine exposure showed similar chlor(am)ine demand and fluorescence spectra. UV irradiation and UV/chlorine exposure diminished the fluorescence intensity of IHSS NOM water, while UV/chloramine exposure resulted in increased fluorescence intensity. When compared with the results obtained following chlor(am)ination alone, IHSS NOM water showed decreased chlorine decay and increased chloramine decay after UV irradiation/chlor(am)ination. Additionally, IHSS NOM water exposed to UV/chloramine and chloramine showed less disinfection by-product (DBP) formation than water subjected to UV/chlorine and chlorine. Overall, these findings indicate that UV irradiation degrades NOM molecules to low-molecular-weight fractions, facilitating the subsequent reaction with chlor-(am)ine. However, chlorine and chloramine play different roles in the reaction. Chlorine degradation and substitution dominates the process of UV/chlorine exposure, while chloramine substitution is the major reaction during UV/chloramine exposure.</jats:p>",

Understanding the mechanisms of fouling, control, and cleaning are important in order to resolve fouling problems. In this paper, the effect of cell viability on biofouling was studied via a feed water analysis and membrane autopsy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was used as the model bacteria. Biofouling tests were divided into two parts: live cells and dead cells (autoclaved cells). The feed water was periodically collected every 3 h to analyze the total direct counts (TDCs), heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs), and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). A membrane autopsy was performed to characterize the fouled membrane through TDCs and EPS. When dead cells were inoculated into the feed water, low concentrations of TDCs and EPS were measured in both the feed water and fouled membrane. As a result, it was determined that initial flux decline by biofouling can be reduced if feedwater is disinfected before the reverse osmosis process.</jats:p>",

Granulation with organic binder usually causes a great loss of adsorption capacity due to the active sites of the adsorbent being extensively occupied by the organic binder. Using inorganic sol as a binder is expected to have a potential for reducing the loss of adsorption capacity. In this paper, aluminium, zirconium, titanium and silica sol were employed as binders for Fe-Al-Ce nano-adsorbent granulation. The nano-adsorbent was mixed with sol and dried to form lumps, then calcinated and ground into powder. The morphology, adsorption capacity and structure of the compound powder were analysed. As an optimization, aluminium sol was selected as a binder in the granulation of Fe-Al-Ce nano-adsorbent using extrusion method. The effects of sol on the adsorbent and the granule structure were characterized. The granules showed a high adsorption capacity, reaching over 90% capacity of Fe-Al-Ce nano-adsorbent, much higher than that of using acrylic-styrene copolymer latex as a binder in our previous research. It is inferred that aluminium sol is a suitable binder which does no damage to the active hydroxyl group of Fe-Al-Ce adsorbent.</jats:p>",

According to FI values, fouling was caused by NOM in two steps: a fast fouling process followed by a slow one. FI of the fast stage (FIF) was much greater than that of the slow one (FIS), showing the initial interaction would play a significant role in the fouling process over a short time. The results of mass balance suggested that a small fraction of DOC was responsible for membrane fouling caused by adsorption. Furthermore, both hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction between NOM and the membrane determined the fouling behavior. Only a portion of foulants was removed after hydraulic washing. The sequence of NOM causing irreversible fouling was BSA &amp;gt; HA &amp;gt; SA, and the sequence of irreversible fouling after alkaline cleaning was SA &amp;gt; BSA &amp;gt; HA. The variations of FI values were consistent with the results of mass balances and flux recovery, which confirmed the FI was a simple and effective tool to describe the membrane fouling process.</jats:p>",

The urban design concept for this 35 ha area follows a high quality approach to develop a carbon-neutral, attractive neighbourhood for approx. 2,000 inhabitants abundant with green space and urban water. HAMBURG WASSER, Hamburg's water supply and wastewater utility, is rethinking the way of wastewater management by implementing an integrated concept for decentralised wastewater treatment and energy production – the so-called HAMBURG WATER Cycle® (HWC) – in this new residential area, based on source control of wastewater. Stormwater, greywater and blackwater are collected separately and then treated separately on site in Jenfelder Au. The realisation of the HWC will be the hitherto largest demonstration of a resource oriented sanitation concept working with vacuum technology for the collection of concentrated blackwater. This concept intends to establish synergy between wastewater management, waste management and energy production, and contributes to an improved local natural water cycle.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that the spatial distribution of BI-indicated water quality has roughly the same pattern as that shown by BiI, but the pollution level using BI was, on average, greater than that by BiI; the northern plain area has a degraded water quality (ranging from ‘α-mesosaprobic’ to ‘α-polysaprobic’ in a wet season) while the southern mountain area and the southern part of the East Line of the South–North Water Transfer Project has a better water quality (‘β-mesosaprobic’). Water quality is worse in the dry season than in the wet season. We concluded that zoobenthos and zooplankton are more reliable indicators of water quality; biological indices are more sensitive to water quality but less reliable than BiI.

All the well water and surface water samples exceeded the WHO permitted levels for total coliforms and faecal coliforms. Bacteriological identification using biochemical tests and api 20E identification tests revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in all water sources tested. Bottled water mainly contained three Enterobacter species, while well water samples showed the broadest spectrum of bacteria including eleven coliform species belonging to the genera Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Kluyvera, Pantoea, Rautella, and 10 non-coliform species in the genera Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Salmonella and Acinetobacter. Surface waters contained seven coliform species belonging to the genera Klebsiella, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Rautella and Serratia, and eight non-coliform species in the genera Pseudomonas, Aeromonas and Acinetobacter. Detection of higher bacteriological counts and identification of potentially pathogenic bacteria in different source waters suggest a potential health risk of the water sources used in Sri Lanka.</jats:p>",

The study area is primarily, an agricultural and commercial area with prospects of becoming a big town with attendant water supply problems. The study identified viable sources for sustainable community based water supply with the objectives to determine hydraulic parameters of the existing streams. The method used to measure the stream hydraulic parameters was Current Meter Discharge Method. The mean dry weather widths are: Okada Stream (3.6m and 10.2m at narrow and upstream sections); Iguedo and Okhai Streams (10.6m and 2.8m at typical upstream sections respectively). The corresponding stream stages and discharges are: Okada (0.57m; 100,656m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day); Iguedo (1.23m; 117,590m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day) and Okhai (0.21m; 8,294m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day). From the obtained, and plotted data, the derived stream stage-discharge equations of the form Q = CH<jats:sup>n </jats:sup>are: Q = 1.543H<jats:sup>0.5 </jats:sup>for Okada Stream; Q = 1.062H<jats:sup>1.2 </jats:sup> for Iguedo Stream; and Q = 0.1334H<jats:sup>0.21</jats:sup> for Okhai Stream. This study established only 1-year hydrological frequency. A 5-year or 10-year return period is needed for greater risks from probable worst condition scenarios. The recorded maximum combined discharge was 552,441m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day in September 2011 and minimum flow was 226,540m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day in January 2012. The reliable yield is estimated at 103,886m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day and maximum allowable abstraction is 81,455m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/day.

Four out of five European citizens live in urban areas and the quality of life is greatly influenced by the urban environment. Here, gardens, parks and green open spaces improve air quality and reduce the impact of stormwater events by reducing the value of the runoff coefficient; they offer lower temperatures in hot urban islands and represent habitats for biodiversity. Gardens in many cities, such as our case study of Coimbra, were initially built for decorative, architectural, and leisure purposes, or with specific academic goals in mind, but their size or urban relevance often made them important factors in city planning and resources' sustainability, as well as for the wellbeing of their citizens. Sustainable water management in urban areas involves promoting rational water use, and also the identification of strategic reserves to deal with droughts when they occur. By improving the management of the urban water cycle as a whole a more efficient use of resources can be achieved, providing not only economic benefits but also improving social and environmental outcomes. Because water is a limited and scarce resource it must be used in gardens in an efficient and sustainable way. For this reason grasses, trees, shrubs and flower beds must be provided only with enough water to satisfy their needs. Using the Landscape Coefficient Formula, the amount of water needed for irrigation can be expressed as a percentage of reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The value of evapotranspiration should be adjusted to best meet the water demands of a given assortment of plant species. In this paper we present a study performed at the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra (BGUC). Monthly and annual levels of precipitation were evaluated along with the air temperature and evapotranspiration to determine the climatological water balance through water shortages and surpluses. The results were compared with the levels of water consumption (from the water supply and spring water collector) and the efficiency of irrigation was assessed, adjusted for plant type, enabling the identification of procedures and opportunities to maximize the efficient use and sustainable management of water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Despite the efforts made towards the Millennium Development Goals targets during the last decade, improved access to water supply or basic sanitation still remains unavailable for millions of people across the world. This paper proposes a set of models that use 25 key variables and country profiles from the WatSan4Dev data set involving water supply and sanitation (Dondeynaz et al., 2012). This paper suggests the use of Bayesian network modelling methods because they are more easily adapted to deal with non-normal distributions, and integrate a qualitative approach for data analysis. They also offer the advantage of integrating preliminary knowledge into the probabilistic models. The statistical performance of the proposed models ranges between 20 and 5% error rates, which are very satisfactory taking into account the strong heterogeneity of variables. Probabilistic scenarios run from the models allow an assessment of the relationships between human development, external support, governance aspects, economic activities and water supply and sanitation (WSS) access.  According to models proposed in this paper, gaining a strong poverty reduction will require the WSS access to reach 75–76% through: (1) the management of ongoing urbanisation processes to avoid slums development; and (2) the improvement of health care, for instance for children.  Improving governance, such as institutional efficiency, capacities to make and apply rules, or control of corruption is positively associated with WSS sustainable development. The first condition for an increment of the HDP (human development and poverty) remains of course an improvement of the economic conditions with higher household incomes.  Moreover, a significant country commitment to the environment, associated with civil society freedom of expression constitutes a favourable setting for sustainable WSS services delivery. Intensive agriculture using irrigation practises also appears as a mean for sustainable WSS thanks to multi-uses and complementarities. With a WSS sector organised at national level, irrigation practices can support the structuring and efficiency of the agriculture sector. It may then induce rural development in areas where WSS access often is set back compared to urban areas1. External financial support, called Official Development Assistance (ODA CI), plays a role in WSS improvement but comes last in the sensitivity analyses of models. An overall 47% of the Official Development Assistance goes first to poor countries, and is associated to governance aspects: (1) political stability and (2) country commitment to the environment and civil society degree of freedom. These governance aspects constitute a good framework for aid implementation in recipient countries.  Modelling is run with the five groups of countries as defined in Dondeynaz et al. (2012). Models for profile 4 (essential external support) and profile 5 (primary material consumption) are specifically detailed and analysed in this paper. For countries in profile 4, fighting against water scarcity and progressing desertification should be the priority. However, for countries in profile 5, efforts should first concentrate on consolidation of political stability while supporting diversification of the economic activities. Nevertheless, for both profiles, reduction of poverty should remain the first priority as previously indicated.  1 JMP statistics, 2004 http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/table/, last access: 22 July 2013.\n                    </jats:p>"

The results indicated that 46 of 142 DWTPs in Japan had experienced off-flavor problems in a recent 5-year period. Cyanobacteria such as Anabaena spp., which produce musty/earthy odors, are the most common microorganisms that were presumed by DWTPs to be responsible for producing off-flavor compounds. Other microorganisms, such as diatoms, chrysophytes, and actinomycetes, are also involved in producing off-flavors. To eliminate off-flavor compounds, most facilities use powdered activated carbon treatment, which greatly increases operational costs. In addition, an interview survey targeting one typical DWTP affected by off-flavor problems was performed to investigate operational costs increased by off-flavor problems and the effects of water temperature on the occurrence of off-flavors. The operational costs when an off-flavor problem occurred were 2.9 times those when the problem did not occur, mainly due to the cost of powdered activated carbon. Therefore, off-flavors are a very serious problem in water treatment systems in Japan. The interview survey suggested that water temperature would be one of the important factors influencing the occurrence of off-flavor compounds in water sources.</jats:p>",

In advanced water treatment plants using ozonation and biological activated carbon (BAC), BAC plays the most important role in reducing assimilable organic carbon (AOC). Therefore, we analyzed the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and AOC by full-scale BAC filters with different operational periods. Seasonal variation in AOC in raw water was wide, with a maximum of 306 μg acetate-C/L in November, and ozonation increased AOC. Nonetheless, BAC filters that had operated for 6 years produced water with lower AOC than ones with shorter operational periods, although they released a small amount of aromatic DOM. A diagram was constructed to derive the required levels of residual chlorine for no bacterial regrowth at various AOC levels of BAC effluents, which were linked with the operational periods of BAC filters and AOC in the ozonation effluents. Although BAC filters operated for longer than 100 weeks can effectively reduce AOC, lowering AOC levels in the ozonation effluent was indispensable for preventing bacterial regrowth in the water supply network at lower levels of residual chlorine than at present.</jats:p>",

Some classical DC/DC converters are presented and analyzed for pointing out their advantages and drawbacks. Besides, an original system based on a push-pull converter associated with a dynamic modulation control is chosen. The main advantage is the possibility to control the delivered electric power in a wide range from very low level to high level of voltage within the same basic architecture. It can reduce the switching power losses and increase the power conversion efficiency. This paper proposed a new control scheme of the DC/DC converter and DC/AC inverter. The suggested system consists of a high efficiency DC/DC converter and a singlephase DC/AC inverter has been simulated using Matlab/Simulink and designed basing on the DSP TMS320F28027. Both results show high performances of the DC link and AC load voltages, when load changes from zero to rated. The performance of the proposed system has been verified through a 1kW prototype of the system for a 50 Hz/220-230 VAC load sourcing by two series connected batteries of 12V. The proposed DC/DC converter achieves a high efficiency of 93.0%. The system including the DC/DC converter and DC/AC inverter achieves an efficiency of 91.2% and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of AC load voltage reached 1.9%.</jats:p>"

When first proposed, PODDS featured an unvalidated means by which material regeneration on pipe walls could be simulated. Field and laboratory studies of material regeneration have yielded data that suggest that the PODDS formulations incorrectly model these processes. A new model is proposed to overcome this shortcoming. It tracks the relative amount of discolouration material that is bound to the pipe wall over time at each of a number of shear strengths. The model formulations and a mass transport model have been encoded as software, which has been used to verify the model's constructs and undertake sensitivity analyses. The new formulations for regeneration are conceptually consistent with field and laboratory observed data and have potential value in the proactive management of water distribution systems, such as evaluating change in discolouration risk and planning timely interventions.</jats:p>",

Hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling species were extracted from two pilot UF membrane systems operated in parallel with lake water as the feed. Two membrane cleaning protocols, hydraulic- and chemical-based (NaOCl and citric acid) cleaning, were considered. Colloidal/particulate matter together with protein-like and metal species in water appeared to contribute to the formation of a hydraulically removable fouling layer on the membranes. Hydraulically irreversible fouling, in contrast, was impacted considerably by humic substances (HS) and protein-like matter. The formation of an irreversible fouling layer was also likely influenced by interactions between the colloidal/particulate matter and metal species together with HS and protein-like matter. LC–OCD analysis revealed the presence of predominant levels of lower molecular weight HS-like matter – compared to the HS-like matter commonly present in lake water – in the citric acid extracted foulant fraction. The permeability loss due to hydraulically irreversible UF fouling was considerably greater than the permeability loss due to hydraulically reversible UF fouling. A permanent permeability loss (∼25–35% of the initial permeability) was present even after the application of considerably strong chemical cleaning protocols on both pilot systems. This study indicated that the fluorescence EEM approach can be applied for monitoring and characterization of membrane cleaning procedures and as a potential diagnostic tool for assessing the effectiveness of hydraulic- and chemical-based cleaning protocols employed in UF drinking water treatment operations using rapid off-line measurements. On the other hand, since the LC–OCD analysis technique is a comparatively time consuming method, it may be used for verification of the fluorescence EEM-based results of the foulant fractions.</jats:p>",

Due to experienced droughts and population growth in the city, interbasin water transfer from Melen Watershed was considered as the most feasible alternative to supply water that can compensate for water demand in the future. This decision changed the beneficial use of the Melen Watershed from irrigation water supply to drinking water supply and necessitated extensive pollution prevention measures to comply with the new water quality requirements. A Watershed Protection Action Plan was developed for the sustainable management of Melen Watershed. The action plan included measures concerning wastewater management, diffuse pollution management, solid waste management and water quality monitoring. In this paper, proposed protection actions in the plan are provided together with the activities realized so far. In addition, the changes made by the authorities during implementation of the plan are presented. The proposed Watershed Protection Action Plan as approved by the government is one of the first examples in Turkey, where watershed-based planning of water resources is implemented instead of administrative boundary-based management.</jats:p>",

Forty-nine water samples from a public building were analyzed by a culture method (BCYE agar) and a specific semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The first 30 analyses using plate counts were positive in 28% of hot water and 8% of cold water samples. The analysis by PCR, obtained within 24 h of collection, revealed the presence of DNA in 100 and 54% respectively. Only four PCR results coincided with the cultures. A second survey (19 samples) was performed 1 year later. Semi-nested PCR revealed that 53% of the samples were positive; however, plate counts yielded no positive results. The 16S rRNA sequence comparison between the first and second samplings showed 100% homology. In conclusion, the study of the design of the building's water system, the use of a fast screening semi-nested PCR and a culture method for the detection of Legionella allowed accurate assessment of the contamination, thus contributing to the early implementation of measures to eliminate the presence of the bacteria in water systems and consequently reduce a latent public health risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In West African countries, the objective of producer insertion in competitive markets is often associated with the need to modernize and mechanize production processes, i.e., replace labour by machines. This excludes traditional producers who can barely comply with the economic criteria but who must remain competitive to generate higher incomes. The challenge is to improve the efficiency of traditional methods in supply chains rather than imposing modern technologies that producers hardly adopt. Moreover, West African populations suffer from not having cheap and available energy sources. They, therefore, have to be imaginative for more efficient energy use in order to improve the productivity and quality of their products and support sustainable rural development and incomes. Building on the case study of the shea butter supply chain in Burkina Faso, this article proposes an original approach consisting of improved energy use for a more competitive and sustainable activity. The traditional butter production process consumes a great deal of energy from firewood and generates a lot of organic waste that could be used as an energy source. We examined the feasibility of using alternative energy techniques that could be taken on board as they are simple and designed from local resources, whilst using by-products from the shea butter production chain as biofuels to partially replace firewood. We showed that using alternative energy techniques, taken one by one or combined, can lead to lower energy use and thereby increase women's incomes, whilst helping to conserve forests.</jats:p>",

The generally applied jar test procedure can be time consuming and this prompted investigations for capacity to test waters more rapidly, for a range of treatment conditions and raw water qualities. The aim of the study reported here was to develop a rapid procedure for determination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance (254 nm/cm) for a range of treatment conditions (coagulant dose and pH). Using a previously established predictive model (mEnCo) for coagulant determination, several coagulant doses were then predicted for application in a modified jar test protocol. Best fitted and predicted data using the exponential decay function compared with data from a 6× jar test procedure were obtained using three doses, 0.5× EnCD, EnCD and a VHD (≥2× EnCD). It is proposed that this procedure may be used to more rapidly determine treatment efficiency based on the removal of organics compared with traditionally applied jar tests.</jats:p>",

In this regard, energy demands of the developed countries and the world intensifies on the energy resources of Eurasia Region, especially Caspian Region. The main factor of the energy demand isn't the supply of energy for the least possible cost but the transfer of the needed energy via secure gas pipes so that the national economies can continue producing. Russia is the most important supplier of natural gas for European countries. Eurasian regian and the Caspian Basin countries have become strategic actors in the energy market because of their rich natural gas reserves. Russia's cutting off natural gas to Europe across Ukraine upon the crisis with this country has caused a deep concern. European Union wishes to support security projects for supply synchronically of different countries into which Ukraine and Belarus -those it uses as transit for gas transfer- aren't included because of political and economical reasons to meet its energy demand. In this respect, Turkey plays a key role in supplying energy from this region to minimize the risks of energy supply security.  Turkey is located in the center of a geopolitical region which produces oil and natural gas. But it can't make use of its potential. Turkey has to create opportunities to play an active role in various energy projects and pipeline routes. This is an analysis of TANAP project's impacts on European Union's energy supply security, Azerbaijan, Turkey and other countries of the region.  </jats:p>",

Raw water turbidity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were varied in the ranges of 20–210 NTU and 3.0–8.5 mg/L respectively. The hybrid pilot-scale CMF (Pilot-CMF) operational parameters were optimized with the aid of jar-tests and laboratory-scale CMF (Lab-CMF) operations. The systems were operated with various polyaluminum chloride dosages and filtration cycle times. Pilot-CMF provided excellent steady turbidity removal compared to the conventional water treatment process. DOC removal percentages of Pilot-CMF and the conventional process at the BWTP were 49% and 30% respectively. With different coagulant dosages, unique patterns in transmembrane pressure (TMP) variations were observed. The daily TMP increment under low turbidity conditions was 0.08 kPa/day. During rainy periods (turbidity over 100 NTU) the TMP increment reached 0.79 kPa/day. However, once the turbidity of raw water reaches normal conditions (30–60 NTU at the BWTP) the Pilot-CMF system recovers the TMP increment due to efficient backwashing.</jats:p>",

The goal of this paper is to propose a new approach to designing a simulation model by reducing its complexity. According to the theory of constraints, a reduced model is built using bottlenecks and a neural network exclusively. This paper focuses on one step of the network model design: determining the structure of the network. This task may be performed by using the constructive or pruning approaches. The main contribution of this paper is twofold; it first proposes a new pruning algorithm based on an analysis of the variance of the sensitivity of all parameters of the network and then uses this algorithm to reduce the simulation model of a sawmill supply chain. In the first step, the proposed pruning algorithm is tested with two simulation examples and compared with three classical pruning algorithms from the literature. In the second step, these four algorithms are used to determine the optimal structure of the network used for the complexity-reduction design procedure of the simulation model of a sawmill supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Researchers and practitioners frequently point to inventory as a necessary component of an effective supply chain strategy. However, an undisciplined or ineffective approach to inventory can have a detrimental impact on an organization and its entire supply chain. When making inventory decisions, firms must ensure that the selected approach “fits” the overall supply chain strategy. While such an assertion seems intuitive, there is a need for empirical validation. We seek to contribute to this important body of research by investigating the impact of improved strategic alignment of inventory on resiliency and continuity. More specifically, we investigate the impact of improved strategic fit by comparing two distinct approaches to inventory management within a service parts environment. We hypothesize that a well‐aligned approach to inventory management can enhance continuity and resiliency. We test these hypotheses via a longitudinal field study involving 10 United States Air Force (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USAF</jats:styled-content>) locations and two years of data (approximately 650,000 inventory transactions). Results from nine test locations and one control location suggest that a well‐aligned approach to inventory management is indeed effective in improving continuity and resiliency, thus enhancing service‐based strategies—in this case, the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USAF</jats:styled-content>'s ability to be mission‐capable. While the results of the study are derived from the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USAF</jats:styled-content>, we believe the implications provide broader insight into the use of inventory as a means of realizing a strategic fit.</jats:p>",

The experimental factors controlling the resin synthesis were investigated and the obtained resin was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The adsorption of manganese as Mn(II) was firstly demonstrated in distilled water solution. The subjected parameters studied for Mn(II) removal by using the resin were the effects of contact time, an initial Mn(II) concentration and the resin dose. The Mn(II) adsorption preceded very fast, and within 3 min the amount of adsorbed Mn(II) for three different initial manganese concentrations (5, 10, and 20 mg/L) approached 60–76% of the maximal uptake potential under the equilibrium conditions. The pseudo second-order equation explained the kinetic data well and the obtained adsorption isotherm data fitted the Langmuir isotherm model which gave high Langmuir capacity (15.54 mg/g) value. The mean adsorption energy (11.04 kJ/mol) computed from the Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm suggested the ion exchange mechanism for Mn(II) adsorption. Results of the resin application for treatment of natural ground water samples (Bani Mor and El-Fath areas, Assiut, Egypt) showed that reducing the Mn(II) level to minimum and the complete removal depended on the resin dose.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study aimed to highlight the more accurate endospore indicator for water treatment monitoring and to select an efficient filtration system in order to detect low amounts of endospores from large volumes. The performance of two different ultrafiltration modules was assessed with two filtration configurations (tangential and dead-end). The Hemoflow™ and the Dizzer® filters present recovery yields of 73% and 77% for 100-liter samples of drinking and sand filtered water, respectively. Both systems enabled detection of endospores at a concentration level of 100 spores in 100 liters, by analyzing the totality of the volume, whereas the standard method did not highlight the presence of spores, analyzing only 100 mL subsamples. In addition, experiments on a sand filtration pilot confirmed that the concentration calculation using the standard method is not reliable, due to extrapolation from the small volumes analyzed. This study highlights that the collection of large volumes using a fieldable dead-end hollow-fiber ultrafiltration system in association with the detection of anaerobic sulfite-reducing spore-forming bacteria is an effective way to monitor drinking water production.</jats:p>",

This mud supply by the world’s largest river reflects sediment sourcing from the Andes, weathering in a tropical–equatorial climate and the extremely high water discharge (\n            <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic>\n            173 000 m\n            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>\n            s\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            ). Amazon mud forms an estuarine mega-turbidity maximum on the shelf that feeds the growth of a subaqueous delta. About 15–20% of this mud forms coastal banks that migrate towards the mouth of the Orinoco, which has constructed a large subaerial delta. This muddy coast exhibits interspersed beaches and cheniers constructed from sand supplied by the smaller rivers and by the Orinoco, and is characterized by extremely large spatio-temporal geomorphic variability resulting from intense wave-reworking of the migrating banks, mangrove colonization and destruction, and erosion in interbank areas. These dynamic processes also drive important biogeochemical recycling, enhancing coastal productivity while efficiently remineralizing organic matter and promoting authigenic mineral formation. This muddy coast is being impacted by human-induced changes, in Guyana in particular. The Amazon–Orinoco coast provides an analogue for muddy, wave-dominated shorefaces in the geological record.\n          </jats:p>",

Solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with electro-spray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) was applied to detect various antibiotics simultaneously. Three groups of antibiotics, i.e. sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, were detected in the source water. The gross concentrations of them in the lake are up to 471, 23.4 and 1,039 ng/L, respectively. The conventional and O3-BAC processes could remove 78.9, 62.4 and 70.2% of them, respectively. Among the antibiotics, tetracyclines could be effectively removed by ozonation, while fluoroquinolones could be removed by the coagulation–sedimentation process. BAC could not degrade fluoroquinolones but enabled the reduction of the other two antibiotics. In addition, O3-BAC was an effective technology for the removal of bulk organic matter. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), UV254 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the effluent of the up-flow BAC process were 2.31 mg/L, 0.034 cm−1 and 1.76 mg/L, respectively, with the corresponding removal rates of 45.1, 67.3 and 65.1%, respectively.

Compared to GaAs NWs grown using the conventional MBE method, the length and diameter of the GaAs NWs grown with an alternating supply of Ga and As were longer and narrower. In addition, the formation of polycrystals on the substrate was decreased, and it was possible to grow the GaAs NWs at a lower temperature using the alternating method. Furthermore, an increase in the formation of twin boundaries (TBs) in the GaAs NWs was observed. The effect of using an alternating supply of Ga and As on the shape and formation of TBs is also discussed. (© 2013 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

Even though the quantities of radioactive material in rain were relatively low, people were concerned about the drinking water. Therefore, there is a need to know the removal efficiency of the unit process of water treatment and to prepare a safety plan to protect the public's health from radioactive materials. In this study, the laboratory scale removal rates were estimated for the coagulation/flocculation, adsorption, and ion exchange processes. The reference standard materials which are stable elements, Cesium-133 (Cs-133) and Iodine-127 (I-127), were used for the typical and advanced water treatment processes at the laboratory scale. For the coagulation/flocculation process, three major coagulants were assessed for this process. However, the removal rates of this process were low. For the adsorption process, powdered activated carbon and zeolites were investigated. The powdered activated carbon showed insignificant removal rates for both reference materials. However, synthetic zeolite was an effective process for Cs-133, and the ion exchange method showed high removal rates for both Cs-133 and I-127.</jats:p>",

Multiple injection-abstraction cycles were performed after injection of 1 m3 of aerated water. From these experiments it can be concluded that hand-pump SAR, in the traditional injection-abstraction design, does not provide drinking water below the WHO arsenic guideline of 10 μg/L. Results show that arsenic removal was not enhanced by: (i) injection of O2-rich water, (ii) higher Fe:As ratios in the groundwater, or by (iii) multiple injection-abstraction cycles, i.e. at location 1, the breakthrough occurred at abstraction-injection ratios of Va/Vi = 2, for cycle 23. It is proposed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC), bicarbonate and phosphate have a significant effect on the arsenic adsorption process. However, iron removal was very efficient and abstraction-injection ratios increased within successive cycles, with Va/Vi &amp;gt; 8 for cycle 23. Furthermore, intermittent operation reduced arsenic concentrations after stop and restart, suggesting insufficient contact time between soluble arsenic and oxidized iron surfaces around the tube well.</jats:p>",

While the risks and uncertainties involved in this strategy have been widely acknowledged in the literature on interorganizational networks and supply chain management, labor conditions and labor relations—and related human resource management issues—have thus far been neglected. Starting from a perspective that takes into consideration that global supply networks are not only confronted with calculable risks but also genuine uncertainties, we explore the conditions under which labor may constitute a source as well as a means for dealing with risk and uncertainty. The study is based on a review of the relevant interorganizational network and supply chain management literature and is informed by an investigation of International Framework Agreements (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IFA</jats:styled-content>s) in 10 European corporations and their supply networks.<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IFA</jats:styled-content>s—in addition to unilateral codes of conduct—could be used to detect and cope with labor‐related risk and uncertainties.

The other team used the same PA-emulation but basic parameter relations instead of the process simulation models, the virtual commissioning (VC) system. Each test team found one (different) error of the 13 errors put into the software prior to the experiment; most of the errors were found prior to the functional test. The team using the AVC-system found three errors, the team using the VC-system found four, but the AVC-team judged 1% of the test items ‘not possible’, the VC-team 17%. It was concluded that the hypothesis that with AVC more errors could be found than with VC could not be accepted. So, for the FAT of PA-software of drinking water treatment plants, the addition of basic parameter relations to PA-emulation was sufficient. It was not the exact process behavior that helped to find errors, but the passing of process thresholds.</jats:p>",

To establish the applicability of this technique in (drinking) water quality analysis, the MALDI–TOF MS identification results for Enterococcus spp. isolated from various water environments were compared with those obtained using the commercial Rapid 32 ID Strep system. One hundred and one bacterial isolates were isolated from various types of water and determined as enterococci on the basis of their growth on Slanetz-Bartley agar in typical colonies. The isolates were identified by MALDI–TOF MS and the commercial biochemical test Rapid 32 ID Strep. Isolates yielding in discrepant identifications were genotyped using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. For 86 isolates (85%), the results of Rapid ID 32 Strep were identical to those obtained with MALDI–TOF MS. Six isolates were impossible to be classified by means of the Rapid 32 ID Strep test. And for eight out of a total of nine discrepant results (89%), the 16S analyses confirmed the MALDI–TOF MS identification. MALDI–TOF MS produced highly reproducible results. These results indicated that the use of two different culture media had no effect on the identification. In addition, no significant differences (p = 0.32; n = 20) were evident between the scores obtained from a 20-fold measurement of the same isolate. The results of this study showed that MALDI–TOF MS identification (Bruker) is a reliable method for identifying E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. durans, E. hirae and E. casseliflavus isolated from water samples. E. mundtii and E. moraviensis were not included in the Rapid 32 ID Strep database and could therefore not be identified using that test set. However, MALDI–TOF MS and 16S identified all six isolates as members of these species.</jats:p>",

Three groups of reactions linked by 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> were defined. The 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> supply group comprised all metabolic steps leading to its formation, and the two 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> consumer groups comprised the enzymes and transporters involved in 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> transformation into lysine and glutamate and their further utilization for protein synthesis and storage. Various 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> steady‐state concentrations that produced different fluxes to lysine and glutamate were attained using yeast mutants with increasing activities of Krebs cycle enzymes and decreased activities of Lys synthesis enzymes. The elasticity coefficients of the three enzyme groups were determined from the dependence of the amino acid fluxes on the 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> concentration. The respective degrees of control on the flux towards lysine (flux control coefficients) were determined from their elasticities, and were 1.1, 0.41 and −0.52 for the 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> producer group and the Lys and Glu branches, respectively. Thus, the predominant control exerted by the 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> supply on the rate of lysine synthesis suggests that over‐expression of 2‐<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OG</jats:styled-content> producer enzymes may be a highly effective strategy to enhance Lys production.</jats:p>",

The analysis of the converter is carried out, and a design procedure is proposed. The design is also performed so that low capacitances are needed at the output of each semi‐stage. This allows for the use of long‐life film capacitors, thus matching the converter lifetime to that of the LED lamp.

Wynn-Edwards proposed the hypothesis that aggressive level increases with population density; Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons proposed the hypothesis that body weight is an indicator of animal aggressivity; however, Smith and Price hypothesized that aggression level varied with external conditions; that is, the population lived in the most unfavorable environment demonstrated the highest average aggression level, and the population that lived under the most favorable external conditions demonstrated the lowest average aggression level. In this paper, we tested these three hypotheses by manipulating enclosed root vole (<jats:italic>Microtus oeconomus</jats:italic>) populations under different food and predation treatments and observed their aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior was measured by matching mice in a neutral arena. The experimental results supported  Smith and Price’s hypothesis and Adams and Mesterton-Gibbons’s hypothesis; however, they did not support Wynn-Edwards’ hypothesis. Moreover, we found that reproductively active individuals were more aggressive. We concluded that the growth of population density did not cause or otherwise bring about increased aggressive behavior of root voles, but the external factors (predation and food supply) and physical factors (body weight and reproductive condition) were significantly correlated with aggression levels in a root vole population.</jats:p>",

However, long‐term exposure to high concentrations of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> induces toxicity in plants, and thus decreases the biomass production. Short‐term application of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> before harvesting in soilless cultivation may provide an alternative strategy to decrease oxalate accumulation in spinach, and minimise the yield reduction caused by NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> toxicity</jats:bold>.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULT</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>The plants were pre‐cultured in 8 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> nutrient solution. Next, 6 days before harvest, the plants were transferred to a nutrient solution containing 4 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and 4 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. This new mix clearly reduced oxalate accumulation, increased levels of several antioxidant compounds, and enhanced antioxidant capacity in the edible parts of spinach plants, but it did not affect biomass production. However, when the 8 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> was shifted to either nitrogen‐free, 4 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> or 8 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> treatments, although some of the quality indexes were improved, yields were significantly reduced</jats:bold>.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Short‐term alteration of nitrogen supply prior to harvest significantly affects quality and biomass of spinach plants, and we strongly recommend to simultaneously use NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in hydroponic cultivation, which improves vegetable quality without decreasing biomass production. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:bold></jats:p></jats:sec>",

Sampling took place monthly from July 2006 to June 2007 in both reservoirs. Collected specimens were identified and their morphometric data measured. The gonads were macroscopically and microscopically analysed. Gonadosomatic Index (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSI</jats:styled-content>) and condition factor results indicate there was a higher reproductive investment in Passaúna Reservoir for both sexes, although with lower total condition. The occurrence of partially spawned ovaries allowed the characterization of partial spawning in both reservoirs. Higher growth rates and the largest individuals were found in Passaúna Reservoir for both sexes, according to length–weight relationships and length class distributions. Significant seasonal sexual rate differences were only detected in Passaúna Reservoir, with male predominance. Total length explained just a small fraction of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSI</jats:styled-content> variability of mature females and males, supporting the hypothesis of local factor influence. It was concluded that this species uses distinct reproductive tactics in each of the two studied reservoirs and that these tactics seem to be reflective of environmental stability.</jats:p>",

The highly processed foods produced by large food corporations are primary drivers of increases in consumption of these adverse nutrients. The objective of this paper is to present an approach to monitoring food composition that can both document the extent of the problem and underpin novel actions to address it. The monitoring approach seeks to systematically collect information on high‐level contextual factors influencing food composition and assess the energy density, salt, saturated fat, trans fats and portion sizes of highly processed foods for sale in retail outlets (with a focus on supermarkets and quick‐service restaurants). Regular surveys of food composition are proposed across geographies and over time using a pragmatic, standardized methodology. Surveys have already been undertaken in several high‐ and middle‐income countries, and the trends have been valuable in informing policy approaches. The purpose of collecting data is not to exhaustively document the composition of all foods in the food supply in each country, but rather to provide information to support governments, industry and communities to develop and enact strategies to curb food‐related <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">NCD</jats:styled-content>s.</jats:p>",

La modelación se realizó bajo la plataforma Water Evaluation And Planning System (WEAP) y comprende aporte de glaciares, precipitación-escorrentía, infraestructura hidráulica y demanda urbana. El estudio caso está referido a los sistemas de agua de las ciudades de La Paz y El Alto que están ubicadas en la región Occidental de Bolivia. Estas ciudades son abastecidas de agua por pequeñas cuencas glaciares de la Cordillera Real. Por el crecimiento acelerado de la población especialmente en la ciudad de El Alto existen problemas en el abastecimiento de agua, y esto podría exacerbase por los impactos negativos del cambio climático por ejemplo el retroceso de los glaciares. Existe una necesidad urgente de conocer los posibles impactos del cambio climático, para esto es necesario tener un mayor conocimiento del potencial hídrico de las cuencas. Sin embargo, existen bastantes limitaciones respecto a la disponibilidad y calidad de los datos hidro-climáticas. Asimismo, no se cuenta con datos de escenarios de clima futuro a la escala de las cuencas que permitan modelar los posibles cambios esperados. En ese sentido en esta investigación se desarrolló una herramienta útil para la planificación de recursos hídricos bajo la incertidumbre de datos históricos y futuros. Los resultados para un horizonte de tiempo 2010-2050 muestran que los glaciares podrían desaparecer en los próximos 30 años, y esto podría tener implicaciones en la respuesta hidrológicas de las cuencas con la reducción de la oferta de agua. La ciudad de El Alto sería la más afectada, ya que se advierten serios problemas en el abastecimiento de agua. Se debe pensar en estudiar estrategias de nuevo almacenamiento de agua como medidas de adaptación al cambio climático.</jats:p>"
