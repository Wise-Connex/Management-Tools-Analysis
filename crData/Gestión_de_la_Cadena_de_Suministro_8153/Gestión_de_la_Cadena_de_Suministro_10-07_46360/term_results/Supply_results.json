Observations from the field should guide practitioners, and in combination with information technology, may lead to best practice rules in dispute resolution. For this study, the Delphi Method was selected, in which a panel of 14 experts participated in three rounds of successive surveys over a one-year period. Survey data was collected by mail as well as via telephone conversations and interviews, while under the Delphi method, the content of the second questionnaire was derived from the responses of the first questionnaire. All participants were supply chain experts in the United States from eight different industrial sectors, and none of the participants interacted with one another. End results show that supply chain’s relationships are very private trade arrangements and that disputes arise, predictably, from common performance criteria such as quality, timely delivery and payment issues.</p>",

In general, the operational rules applied to water distribution networks have as a sole objective the continuity of the water supply and disregards saving energy costs related to the operation of the pumps. The task of determining optimal operational procedures involves several elements such as the daily variation of water consumption, energy cost rates and the level of the tanks and reservoirs. This work presents a hybrid genetic algorithm which is connected to the widely known software EPANET, in order to determine operational strategies in water supply with reduced energy costs. The model is applied to a hypothetical example and to a real water distribution network located in the city of Ourém, in Portugal.</jats:p>",

First, it includes the design of a supply chain reference model and the identification of the data required for the efficient operation of the traceability system. The main elements of the proposed model defined in this paper are the entities, stages, events, and processes. The reference model consists of three distinct phases that represent stages of real-life supply chains. Each of these phases is defined by certain interactions between the above basic elements. Additionally, the proposed e-platform is based on the above reference model aiming to follow and register the production and distribution processes of the raw materials, semi-finals, and final products that are used in the examined industry.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Supply chains are assessed for the contribution they make in improving business processes. Assessment also looks at the return on investment and improves the overall functioning of the entire chain. However, supply chains extend beyond geographical borders and span a wide variety of activities; therefore, a systematic examination of factors required for success of supply chains is essential. This paper proposes a composite method by which supply chains could be assessed at multiple levels to enable a comprehensive comparison. The objective is to first compare at a global level and then narrow down to the firms’ level. Although over time a number of measures have been developed to evaluate supply chain performance, this paper provides a methodology involving well-known techniques to assess the supply chain success based on objective considerations. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how global players can select the partnering countries to reap maximum benefits. Finally, a comprehensive model is provided involving three approaches that look at the issue of comparison from different perspectives and are debated with respect to India and the United States.</p>",

In 2006, the city's water consumption accounted for only a quarter of that in 1990.The role of regulated inflow in the water balance decreased and that of catchment run-off increased. Lake HRT increased four-fold. Before the 1990s, Lake Ülemiste resembled a river, now it is more lake-like. Changes in the water regime were correlated with the decline in concentrations of organic matter and chloride suggesting a likely causal relationship between them. Managerial challenges turned on finding new functions for upstream reservoirs and on the opportunity to refill the lake with better quality raw water.</jats:p>",

Toilets during the Roman era can be divided into two groups: public and private. A public toilet was often built in proximity to or inside a bath so that it was easily entered from both inside and outside of the bath. The abundance of water that was conducted to the bath could also be used to flush the toilet. Piped water for flushing private toilets seems to have been a rarity. In many cases the private toilet was located near the kitchen. Hygienic conditions in both types of toilets must have been very poor, and consequently intestinal diseases have been all around. Dysentery, typhoid fever and different kinds of diarrhoeas are likely candidates for diagnoses. Descriptions of the intestinal diseases in the ancient texts are unfortunately so unspecific that the identification of causative agents is a very problematic venture. Studies of ancient microbial DNA might offer some new evidence for the identification of microbes spread by contaminated water.</jats:p>",

The 2007/2008 commodity crisis underscored the vulnerability of the global food system to shocks from extreme weather events, energy and financial markets, as well as government interventions in the form of export bans and other measures designed to avoid domestic adjustment to global scarcity. We have learned that a “perfect storm” in which all these factors coincide can have a devastating impact on the world’s poor, as well as putting considerable pressure on the world’s natural resource base. As we look ahead to the middle of this century, will such commodity price spikes become more commonplace? Will the world’s agricultural resource base be up to the task of meeting the diverse demands being placed on it?</jats:p>"

These structures are very complex hydraulic systems: for their good functioning, in fact, not only adequate constructing tricks were necessary, but also good theoretical knowledge, to be applied during the planning stage. In particular the systems that will be examined in this work are the double inverted siphon of the Yzeron aqueduct (Lyon, France) and the triple inverted siphon of Aspendos (Turkey); in both cases the Roman engineers ensured the correct functioning of the systems relying on specific technical solutions. Besides, the Barratina (Termini Imerese, Italy) siphon will be shortly presented, that is a “mixed” siphon whose technical conception distinguished it from the others. The Barratina siphon is the only case so far known in the history of the Roman aqueducts where the receiving tank is above the hydraulic grade line; nevertheless in many cases a precise leveling was not executed. It still possible that in the territory of the Roman Empire, other similar solutions can be found.</jats:p>",

To bring a steam plant back online, supplying its own power after a “cold iron” period, would involve a substantial light-off, warm-up, and transition period compared to modern, fully automated plants.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Onshore power supply (OPS, sometimes referred to as “cold ironing”) is a system of procedures and equipment that provides ships with a source of electrical power as an alternative to the ship’s service electrical power system. The primary benefit is that, since the ship no longer has main or auxiliary engines operating, the engine emissions are virtually eliminated in the port area. Many ports around the world are located near large populations, and engine emissions from ships unfortunately contribute to unwanted levels of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, particulate matter, and even the “greenhouse gas” carbon dioxide. Onshore power supply achieves a better total emissions reduction result than ship-installed emissions equipment, because the engines are off-line. On the other hand, there are difficulties associated with high voltage, varying frequencies, safety and infrastructure costs that must be addressed in order to justify an onshore power supply installation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Paper published with permission.</jats:p>",

Most research focuses on the supply impacts of prescribed limits on land use but housing supply may also be affected by the process of planning monitoring and approval but this is hard to measure in detail. The UK has a particularly restrictive planning regime and a detailed and uncertain process of development control linked to it, but does offer the opportunity of detailed site-based investigation of planning delay. This paper presents the findings of empirical research on the time taken to gain planning permission for selected recent major housing projects in southern England. The scale of delay found was far greater than is indicated by average official data measuring the extent to which local authorities meet planning delay targets. Hedonic modelling indicated that there is considerable variation in the time it takes local authorities to process planning applications. Housing association developments are processed more quickly than those of large developers and small sites appear to be particularly time-intensive. These results suggest that delays in development control may be a significant contributory factor to the low responsiveness of UK housing supply to upturns in market activity. </jats:p>",

In late pregnancy, many women consuming contemporary Western diets may not be able to meet the fetal demand for n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) from the diet alone. Numerous mechanisms have evolved to protect human offspring from extreme variation or deficiency in the maternal diet during pregnancy. Maternal adipose tissue is an important source of LCPUFA. Temporal changes in placental function are synchronized with maternal metabolic and physiological changes to ensure a continuous supply of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFA-enriched fat to the fetus. LCPUFA storage in fetal adipose tissue provides an important source of LCPUFA during the critical first months of postnatal life. An appreciation of these adaptations is important in any nutritional strategy designed to improve the availability of fatty acids to the fetus. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The human tongue has a critical role in speech, swallowing, and respiration, however, its motor control is poorly understood. Fundamental gaps include detailed information on the course of the hypoglossal (XII) nerve within the tongue, the branches of the XII nerve within each tongue muscle, and the type and arrangement of motor endplates (MEP) within each muscle. In this study, five adult human tongues were processed with Sihler's stain, a whole‐mount nerve staining technique, to map out the entire intra‐lingual course of the XII nerve and its branches. An additional five specimens were microdissected into individual muscles and stained with acetylcholinesterase and silver staining to study their MEP morphology and banding patterns. Using these techniques the course of the entire XII nerve was mapped from the main nerve to the smallest intramuscular branches. It was found that the human tongue innervation is extremely dense and complex. Although the basic mammalian pattern of XII is conserved in humans, there are notable differences. In addition, many muscle fibers contained multiple <jats:italic>en grappe</jats:italic> MEP, suggesting that they are some variant of the highly specialized slow tonic muscle fiber type. The transverse muscle group that comprises the core of the tongue appears to have the most complex innervation and has the highest percentage of <jats:italic>en grappe</jats:italic> MEP. In summary, the innervation of the human tongue has specializations not reported in other mammalian tongues, including nonhuman primates. These specializations appear to allow for fine motor control of tongue shape. Clin. Anat. 23:777–791, 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three alternative approaches to desalinating seawater were evaluated with respect to their thermodynamic efficiencies and greenhouse-gas emissions. The technologies considered were multistage flash distillation (MSF), reverse osmosis (RO), and membrane distillation (MD). The analysis was based on published stream data from large-scale operational MSF and RO facilities and experimental-scale data for the MD process. RO was found to be the most exergy-efficient (30.1%) followed by MD (14.27%) and MSF (7.73%). RO and MD required less power consumption to produce water (3.29 kWh/m3 and 5.9 kWh/m3, respectively) compared to MSF which had a much higher energy demand (16.7 kWh/m3). Similar results were obtained when comparing equivalent carbon dioxide emissions from each process; MD and RO accounted for 5.22 and 2.91 kg CO2eq/m3, respectively, whereas MSF generated three to four times that amount. The results indicate that MD has potential as a commercially viable technique for seawater desalination provided a source of waste heat is available. This study provides an overview of the use of thermodynamic efficiency analysis to evaluate desalination processes and provides insight into where energy may be saved with developed desalination processes and areas of research for emerging desalination techniques.</jats:p>",

A partir d’une étude de cas monographique, l’auteur décrit les phases du processus d’apprentissage qui se concrétise entre deux entreprises qui entretiennent une relation partenariale de type client-fournisseur. Cette étude empirique confirme l’existence du processus d’apprentissage à une échelle interorganisationnelle mais révèle aussi plusieurs conditions de réussite attachées à sa réalisation. La recherche montre la réalité d’un concept novateur qui combine les phénomènes d’apprentissage aux pratiques récentes de gestion des connaissances, en particulier à travers l’usage des technologies de l’information. Elle permet également de positionner la connaissance comme un enjeu stratégique du supply chain management car elle montre que l’échange d’informations qui sous-tend la gestion des flux externes peut évoluer vers un socle de connaissances partagées entre plusieurs entreprises qui interagissent. Cet article dégage des pistes de réflexion dans un domaine qui offre un potentiel de recherche important et amène des perspectives d’amélioration significative du fonctionnement et de la performance des chaînes logistiques grâce à une meilleure compréhension des mécanismes de coordination entre les différents maillons.</jats:p>",

The primary reverse osmosis concentrate used in the work was obtained from the RO process of the direct drinking water preparation system designed for the 29th Olympic Games with 50% recovery. The feed water was Beijing tap water. Membrane fouling during the DCMD process was discussed, and acidification and accelerated precipitation softening was used as the pretreatment method to control the calcium scaling. Experimental results showed that acidification can alleviate and even eliminate CaCO3 scaling, but CaSO4 crystallization still occurred and led to a sharp decline of module efficiency. Accelerated precipitation softening enabled a high removal efficiency of Ca2 + , so both the CaCO3 and CaSO4 scaling was efficiently controlled. After proper pretreatment to control calcium scaling, the primary reverse osmosis concentrate could be concentrated 40 times and then the whole recovery was enhanced to 98.8%.</jats:p>",

An obvious interest of water utilities is thus to optimise their investment planning to obtain the maximum possible benefits for the costs accrued by the investments. The objective of this article is to demonstrate an approach for a water utility to determine the benefits of investments in different possible service areas. We used a stated preference choice experiment approach to estimate the willingness-to-pay of customers of a utility company in Southeast England for various water services that are both private and public in nature. Using state-of-the-art econometric methods, we demonstrate how customer preferences can be estimated at the individual level, as opposed to more standard modelling approaches that assume that tastes are homogeneous among the customer population. Willingness-to-pay results were mostly statistically significant for the various private and public services presented to customers, and results conformed to the expectations of economic theory. We demonstrate how individual-level customer preferences can be used to forecast the preferred alternatives of customers when faced with different possible investment programmes. Lastly, we outline how various benefits and costs, including those captured by willingness-to-pay, are used to optimise the water utility's investment planning.</jats:p>",

ESCMS for food products must have the strategy of supply-to-stock and supply-to-order (efficient and responsive), effective collaboration within the supply chain, well-defined expectations and requirements, effective communication and information flow, mutual relationship management, and close relationships as partners.

For this reason, acquiring a better understanding of consumer perception of tap water is an important issue for water authorities and utility managers. In this study, water consumption choice and profile were investigated. The case under study is the territory of a water supply system in Québec City (Canada). Data on drinking water consumption was obtained through a questionnaire-based survey. Survey results showed that an important proportion (about one third) of the population under study do not drink tap water. To explain consumption choice (tap water or not) and consumption profile (levels of tap water consumption), binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses (LGA) were performed based on survey responses and complementary data resulting from measurements of water quality parameters in 32 locations throughout the water distribution system. Water quality information was managed through a water quality index (WQI). The WQI of each sampling point was associated with the location of each survey respondent using a geographical information system (GIS). LGA results showed that the geographical location of the consumer within the distribution system, the WQI and perceived risk toward water consumption were the main factors explaining both the water consumption choice and tap water consumption profile.</jats:p>",

The main attention is paid to the unsteady effects the role of which is determining at the integral flow structure formation. A physical model of energy source is formulated. The numerical and experimental data on the structure of the flow around the source and the characteristics of a thermal wake arising behind the source are compared. The energy pulses frequency and capacity are shown to determine the wake properties: the formation and development of subsonic regions, vortex structures, and reverse flow regions. It follows from an analysis of the aerodynamic drag variation at a flow with a thermal wake of the energy supply source around blunt bodies that the energy and pulse as well as its duration are the main parameters determining the efficiency of the frequency effect. A high sensitivity of the results to the physical model accepted in numerical investigation is shown. The pressure variation dynamics on a conical surface is presented versus the frequency of pulses.

It is particularly important to be able to accurately detect E. coli presence and quantity in treated potable water because of potential human health effects from consumption of contaminated water. Presence of even a single E. coli in potable water can lead to significant consequences and costs for water utilities. Alum is frequently used as a coagulant in conventionally treated water, and is usually present in slight excess after treatment. We show here that E. coli can accumulate the Al3 +  ions present at natural levels in potable water and in so doing become uncultivable. Thus, E. coli, and perhaps a number of other bacteria, present in potable water could readily escape detection on laboratory culture media. Chelation with Tiron of the Al3 +  prior to exposure maintained the E. coli in a cultivable state.

Four factors are considered as the antecedents of supply chain excellence, such as collaboration, organizational conditions, technology adoption, and operations. The authors use the grounded theory approach to further understand those four critical factors and relevant concepts. Organizational condition was ranked by our senior supply chain executives as the most important factor based on this qualitative investigation. The effect of four critical factors on organizational performance is also assessed through regression analyses, and the results help supply chain professionals in Taiwan determine which factors and concepts of supply chain management to focus on to improve business performance. Although these findings are situation-dependent, the proposed framework is different from existing literature and can be adopted in other international studies to enhance the body of knowledge on supply chain management.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated the impact of bromide on the formation of N-nitrosamines during chlorination and chloramination, and tried to identify the reactive intermediates responsible for variations in the yield of N-nitrosamines. As an intermediate of the reaction between bromide and HOCl, bromine chloride (BrCl) may improve the yield of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation. But increasing the amount of bromide added would result in BrCl being converted into HOBr, which is a weaker oxidant than HOCl. This would result in less nitrite being formed, leading to a decreased yield of NDMA via the nitrosation pathway. When NH4+, was present with the bromide during chlorination, both the rate of formation and yield of N-nitrosamines were improved markedly by highly reactive bromamines. Interestingly, bromide had an inhibitory effect on NDMA formation during the chloramination process when tertiary alkylamines, such as 3-(Dimethylaminomethyl) indole (DMAI) and trimethylamine (TMA), were used as precursors. This phenomenon provides indirect evidence for the hypothesis that the pathway of NDMA formation using tertiary amines with DMA groups is different from that of NDMA formation using secondary alkylamines.</jats:p>",

This paper presents data on the microbial performance of these two technologies in the field on various Cambodian source waters. In addition, data are presented on the occurrence of nitrite in treated water. Results showed that 61% and 88% of BioSand filters and ceramic filters, respectively, produced water in the low risk range for E. coli as defined by the WHO (0–10 CFU/100 mL).

The logical inconsistency is because the AD and AS curves represent two mutually exclusive theories of the relation between output and the price level in the same economy. The empirical unreality is that it assumes that, when there is excess supply, prices will fall, and furthermore, falling prices will return the economy to full employment. Neither of these assumptions is valid for our economy today.

A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand. </jats:p>",

There are two sides to value added: the ability to meet consumer demand, and to identify least cost ways of supplying the demanded goods. Human and social capital plays an important role on both sides. At the municipality level the supply side issues are complex. First, because the production space has far more dimensions than for the single entrepreneur. Second, because the value of some goods and services produced depend on what other goods and services that is available. On the supply side networks are important to solve the coordination issues, while networks for identifying and understanding consumer preferences are important on the demand side. Participation in these two network types compete for the same scarce resource, the time of the inhabitants of a municipality. We address these issues in more detail. A major insight from our work is that in addition to the time conflict, innovation and new information may make it more difficult to maintain coordination networks.</jats:p>"

The RO plant was run at 75% recovery and at the membrane flux of 17 l m−2 h−1 (LMH) to simulate the full scale NEWater production when DO-HS treatment was conducted once per day and five times per week during the last two months. Permeability of RO membranes as a function of elapse time of the pilot operation was monitored and compared over different durations. Impact of DO-HS treatment on RO product quality in terms of TOC and conductivity was investigated.

Due to its high power density, nuclear reactor should take an important place in this production. This paper focuses on the hydrogen production by thermochemical cycle using the heat available at 900°C of a new generation nuclear reactor. The chosen thermochemical cycle for this study is the iodine-sulphur thermochemical cycle water splitting.The process flowsheet under consideration has high total energy consumption. It has also many local energy needs unevenly distributed over a wide temperature range. The raw distribution of this energy gives a hydrogen production efficiency of 14.0%. To improve this, the proposed coupling is built using an energy distribution network with a coolant to meet the safety requirements. In this simple case, the efficiency of hydrogen production comes to 21.9%. By integrating a heat pump into the energy distribution network, the efficiency of production increases to 42.0%. The exergetic efficiency, increases from 59.3% to 85.8%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many islands in Korea have problems related to water source security and supply. In particular, the water supply condition is worse in small islands which are remote from the mainland. A couple of alternatives are developed and suggested to supply water to islands including water hauling, groundwater extraction, and desalination. However, these alternatives require much energy, cost, and concern in installation and operation. Rainwater harvesting is a sustainable option that supplies water with low energy and cost. However, lack of practical or comprehensive studies on rainwater harvesting systems in these regions hinders the promotion of the system. Therefore, this research examines defects of current RWH systems on an existing island, Guja-do, and provides technical suggestions in quantitative and qualitative aspects. A simple system design modification and expansion of system capacity using empty space such as a wharf structure can satisfy both the qualitative and the quantitative water demand of the island. Since rainwater harvesting is estimated to be a feasible water supply option under the Korean climate, which is an unfavorable condition for rainwater harvesting, implies a high potential applicability of rainwater harvesting technology to other regions over the world suffering from water shortage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Boron in the desalinated water produced by the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) system is one of the most challenging issues for drinking or irrigation water uses. In recent years, many post-treatment methods and designs for boron elimination have emerged and attracted lots of attention, but only a few cases have demonstrated high performance and economic efficiency. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of boron removal from seawater using a two-pass SWRO system employing different RO membranes at Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay, the Yellow Sea of China. In this study, HYDRANAUTICS SWC3+ and ESPAB were chosen as the first and second pass membrane, respectively. The impact of feed properties including temperature, pH, salinity, boron concentration, and operational conditions such as feed pressure on boron rejection and permeate flux was determined. In addition, a relative long term run of the two-pass SWRO system was investigated and compared with performance of system that uses Filmtec membrane as reported in the literature. Although the pilot system in this study experienced more severe feed conditions with lower pH, higher feed boron concentrations and lower operational pressures: all potential negative factors for boron rejection, it still achieved good performance for boron reduction. The results of three-month long term operation indicated that, at optimum conditions, two-pass SWRO system at Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay achieved a high performance and stability without anti-scalants to produce permeate which has much a lower boron concentration than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline.</jats:p>",

However, existing empirical work has not examined the differential impact of various upstream supply arrangements for PL products or the strategic motives for PL supply. To do so requires one to model the interaction between private and national label (NL) products both upstream and downstream while accounting for strategic behavior on the part of manufacturers and retailers and retaining essential differences between NL and PL products. We build a model that satisfies these requirements and lets us answer our two research questions: First, can an NL firm profit from being an outsourced PL supplier? Second, what are the upstream and downstream impacts of different PL supply arrangements?</jats:p><jats:p>We answer these questions by modeling private labels as homogenous products at wholesale, but as differentiated products at retail. In contrast, national label products are differentiated at both wholesale and retail levels. Using structural model estimates for fluid milk in a major metropolitan area, we conduct three counterfactual experiments. We find that both NL producers and retailers profit from adding private labels. We also find that a vertically integrated supply of PL leads to lower prices for end consumers.</jats:p>",

The goal is to reconstruct past system behavior and diagnose the causes of a major water crisis. In order to do this, we develop a hydrologic‐engineering‐economic model to address the complexity of urban water supply arising from consumers' dependence on multiple interconnected sources of water. We integrate different components of the urban water system: water flowing into the reservoir system; diversion and distribution by the public water utility; groundwater flow in the aquifer beneath the city; supply, demand, and prices in the informal tanker‐truck‐based water market; and consumer behavior. Both the economic and physical impacts of consumers' dependence on multiple sources of water are quantified. The model is calibrated over the period 2002–2006 using a range of hydrologic and socio‐economic data. The model's results highlight the inadequacy of the reservoir system and the buffering role played by the urban aquifer and consumers' coping investments during multiyear droughts.</jats:p>",

Bleeding from the IT branch of the posterior lateral nasal artery (ITB) may interfere with the outcome of IT surgery. The aim of this study is to define the anatomic localization of the ITB and its variations and to investigate its clinical importance. Anatomic relations of the ITB were determined by microdissecting 20 adult, sagittally cross‐sectioned head specimens. Branching characteristics of the ITB and its anatomical relations were evaluated. The most consistent two markers to define the ITB on the lateral nasal wall were the posterior attachment of the IT (PAIT) and the posterior attachment of the middle turbinate (PAMT). Mean horizontal distances of the ITB from the PAIT and the PAMT were 7.2 mm ± 2.8 mm (2.5–11.8 mm) and 8.2 mm ± 2.8 mm (4–14.6 mm), respectively. ITB was the only major artery that supplied the IT in 85% of the specimens, and, in 15%, there was more than one artery. ITB was located lateral to the IT in 95% and medial to the IT in 5%. The ITB coursed on the lateral nasal wall, vertically between the middle and ITs and always anterior to the PAIT. All the variations of blood supply to the IT were within a one square centimeter area, ∼1‐cm anterior to the PAIT. Successful cauterization of this particular area may be an alternative cauterization site in IT surgery. Clin. Anat. 23:770–776, 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

This has led experts to highlight the existence of a “long tail” of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is “selling less of more.” However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In an attempt to achieve better estimates on both potable and likely recycled water end uses within this region, this paper presents a predictive model that utilises a range of input parameters, including: current use in the Gold Coast and the Pimpama Coomera regions at both a bulk billing and end use level; recycled water use at other dual reticulated schemes; and questionnaire survey of residents water source preferences for outdoor uses. Prior to the commissioning of recycled water, potable water is supplied through the recycled water pipelines. Water end use consumption analysis from the recycled water smart meter indicates that this supply source currently provides 20% of total household use with the majority of use being for toilet flushing. However, a range of factors have attributed to this low baseline level with evidence collected in this study indicating that higher recycled water consumption rates will occur once this supply line has been commissioned; largely due to the lower cost and fewer restrictions placed on this water source for discretionary outdoor purposes. The weighted amalgamation of a range of baseline adjustment factors assisted in the prediction of post-commissioning end uses for the Pimpama Coomera dual reticulated region. The predictive model indicated that recycled water end uses would account for 53 litres per person per day or 30.6% of total household consumption. The paper concludes with a brief overview of Phase 2 of the study which aims to compare actual post-commission end uses with the baseline situation and prediction, as well as the development of a robust end use model for dual reticulated regions.</jats:p>",

In our study, we considered the reservoirs with a volume in the order of thousands of cubic metres, storing flowing water, set low in the ground or actually underground, and roofed over. In general, a Roman aqueduct was not built to provide drinking water, nor to promote hygiene, but either to supply the baths or for military aims. As a matter of fact, the population of Rome at the end of the 1st century AD had an average water supply of 1,550 L/d per capita especially used for baths. This circumstance required reservoirs of huge capacity. The reservoir of the Baths of Caracalla in Rome could contain over 80,000 m3 of water. The use of columns in a Roman reservoir was introduced in the ancient Constantinopolis and the Yerebatan Saray with a maximum capacity of almost 85,000 cubic metres can be considered the biggest Roman reservoir. While for military aims, the Piscina Mirabilis in Misenum can be considered the biggest Roman resevoirs used for military aims ever known until now (provide the Classis Praetoria Misenensis) with a volumetric capacity of 12,600 m3 of water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the third edition of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, the World Health Organization concludes that an integrated management of risks in source waters, treatment systems and distribution networks is the most effective way to guarantee safe drinking water to consumers. The integrated approach is fundamental to avoid sub-optimisation of risk-reduction measures. This paper presents an application of an integrated and quantitative risk model for comparing risk-reduction measures to support decisions for reaching specified water safety targets. A fault tree approach is used for structuring the risk analysis and for estimating the risk, expressed as Customer Minutes Lost (CML). Input information is a combination of hard data and expert judgements. Uncertainties in input information are considerable and modelled by a Bayesian statistical approach. A drinking water system in Sweden is used to exemplify model application. Quantitative safety targets have been confirmed at the political level as a basis for long-term planning of investments and reinvestments. One target defines an acceptable risk level of 144 annual CML for the average consumer. For the current system structure an estimated risk of 612 CML was obtained. Four risk-reduction alternatives were compared and they reduce the risk to between 50 and 81 CML, i.e. below the acceptable level. The paper describes how a structured and thorough analysis of risk-reduction measures can facilitate transparency and long-term planning of drinking water systems.</jats:p>",

Flow monitoring techniques are used by water service providers to monitor leakage, generally through offline application of mass balance type calculations and manual observations of change in night line values. This paper presents the combination of real-time data collection (using cello loggers with General Packet Radio Service communications) and a self-learning, online Artificial Intelligence system for detection of bursts at the District Meter Area level. The system components consist of communications software, a data warehouse and a MATLAB application. The online system continuously analysed a set of 146 DMAs in a case study area every hour generating automated alerts in response to abnormal flow. Specific examples are given, including a validation field test, and overall results are presented for a one year period. 36% of alerts were found to correspond to bursts confirmed by repair data or customer burst reports with only 18% ghosts. The results indicate that the software tool has the potential to reduce lost water and improve customer service hence enhancing water service provider's reputations.</jats:p>",

Spores within the pipe loop poised at 0.5 mg/L free chlorine showed a 7.6-log10 inactivation in the bulk water phase, but only a 2.7-log10 inactivation was observed within the biofilm after 14 days of treatment. Complete inactivation was observed in the 1.0 mg/L free chlorine system in both the biofilm and the bulk water phase in less than 10 min.

The PCM, who is the sole supply source of a critical component used to assemble an end product, can either provide its component to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in the end‐product market (component supplier structure), develop the end product exclusively under its own brand (monopoly structure), or provide the component to the OEM as well as develop the end product under its own brand (dual distributor structure). Typically, the end products of the PCM and the OEM will be differentiated, and the OEM tends to have a capability advantage (compared with the PCM) in producing the end product. Our paper studies the impact of this degree of differentiation and capability advantage on the optimal choice of distribution structure. We then investigate how investing in component branding, enhancing the value of the end product, using alternative supply contracts, and product valuation uncertainty influence the PCM's optimal choice of distribution structure. </jats:p>",

The two demand streams are jointly described with a vector autoregressive time‐series process in which they interact and their respective innovation errors correlate contemporaneously. For each supply chain, we develop insights into when and how much the supplier and the retailer can improve on their forecasting accuracy if the external demand history of the other supply chain is utilized. When this external demand history is not available or made available after a time lag, we develop a partial process and a delayed process to characterize the demand structure that the retailer can recover from the available demand histories. Our results show that the external demand history of the other supply chain always helps the retailer make better forecasts when demand streams interact; however, the enhanced information alters the retailer's order process, which may produce larger forecasting errors for the supplier. Conditions are established for the supplier to benefit from the external demand history of the other supply chain. </jats:p>",

There was a statistically significant increase in source water conductivity, nitrate, and pharmaceutical and EDC concentrations over this time period, concomitant with a statistically significant decline in the volume of Lake Mead. There was no statistically significant increase in conductivity and nitrate in the Colorado River or the Las Vegas Wash over this period, nor was there an increase in flow of the Las Vegas Wash or Colorado River. Thus, the deterioration of source drinking water quality is due to the decrease in the volume of Lake Mead which has been attributed to drought.

Drawing on the resource‐based view and its extension, the relational view, this paper highlights that partner‐focused supply management capabilities evolve to corporate core competences as competition shifts from an inter‐firm to an inter‐supply‐chain level. The ‘collaborative paradigm’ in supply chain management regards strategic collaboration as a crucial source of competitive advantage. Collaboration is even more essential when supply chains aim at ensuring simultaneously economic, environmental and social performance on a product's total life‐cycle basis. Inter‐firm resources and capabilities emerging from supply‐chain‐wide collaboration are prone to become sources of sustained inter‐firm competitive advantage, since they are socially complex, causally ambiguous and historically grown and hence particularly difficult to imitate by competitors.

The town was also a strategic hub for sea and land trade and drew its strength from its geographic position, climate and abundance of spring waters near the sea. This wealth of freshwater, managed by special magistrates (curator aquarum), had multiple public and private uses: (i) intake structures (draining tunnels, cistern and an octagonal hall/musaeum/nymphaeum which may have been used as a model for the most famous octagonal hall of Nero's Domus Aurea in Rome); (ii) supply structures (above all aqueducts); (iii) storage structures (above all cisterns); and, finally, (iv) utilisation structures for public use (thermal baths, probably a pond/piscina dulcis and at least two fountains located along the Appian Way, the regina viarum of the Roman period) and private use (balnea and nymphaea/oeci described by the famous architect Vitruvius who was born in Formia).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In some supply chains, materials are ordered periodically according to local information. This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency. </jats:p>",

Calcium carbonate flocculation (CCF) and membrane filtration (MF) concentration techniques, with and without purification by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) were evaluated. The cysts and oocysts were detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and confirmed by differential interference contrast (DIC). Membrane filtration method generally produced higher recovery efficiency. Giardia spp. was detected in 87.5% of the water samples analyzed with densities ranging from 2.5 to 120 cysts per L. Cryptosporidium spp were detected in 62.5% and the concentrations ranged from 15 to 60 oocysts per L. Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst concentrations detected in this study were elevated and are associated with discharge of untreated sewage in Atibaia River.

We model the supply chain by incorporating asymmetric information among all the parties, contractors' innovation activities, subcontractors' misappropriation, and transfer-pricing schemes. We examine the impact of various transfer-pricing schemes on supply chain efficiency. Specifically, we conduct a performance comparison between the variable-cost transfer-pricing scheme and the full-cost transfer-pricing scheme. We find that the subcontractor's choice of transfer-pricing scheme affects the contractor's sourcing decisions and supply chain performance. For a selected set of parameters we show that the variable-cost transfer-pricing scheme achieves better supply chain coordination. </jats:p>",

This research conceptualises and develops five secondary constructs for supply chain practices (use of technology, SC speed, Customer satisfaction, SC integration, and Inventory management). The research also identifies four primary competitive advantage constructs (Inventory Management, Customer Satisfaction, Profitability, and Customer Base Identification) and six primary organisational performance constructs (Market Performance, SC Competencies, Stakeholder Satisfaction, and Innovation and Learning). The data for analysis was collected from top 10 non-livestock organised retail players operating in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, New Delhi and, Gurgaon in India. The relationships among supply chain practices, competitive advantage, and organisational performance, are tested in the proposed framework using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that Indian retailers know that competitive advantage has high impact on SCP but they fail in matching supply chain practices, competitive advantage and, organisational performance. </jats:p>",

Reciprocally, modulation of origin efficiency does not affect acetylation. However, treatment with a deacetylase inhibitor changes the initiation pattern.

MetR was previously shown to control methionine metabolic gene expression. Functional analysis of CysR and HomR was carried out by phenotypical studies and transcriptional analysis. CysR is required to activate the transcription of\n            <jats:italic>cysK</jats:italic>\n            encoding the cysteine biosynthesis enzyme,\n            <jats:italic>tcyABC</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>gshT</jats:italic>\n            genes encoding cysteine and glutathione transporter systems, and\n            <jats:italic>homR</jats:italic>\n            . HomR activates the transcription of\n            <jats:italic>metBC</jats:italic>\n            encoding methionine biosynthesis enzymes,\n            <jats:italic>tcyDEFGH</jats:italic>\n            involved in cysteine transport, and still uncharacterized thiosulfate assimilation genes. Control of HomR by CysR provides evidence of a cascade regulation for sulfur amino acid metabolism in\n            <jats:italic>S. mutans</jats:italic>\n            . Two conserved motifs were found in the promoter regions of CysR and HomR target genes, suggesting their role in the regulator binding recognition site. Both CysR and HomR require\n            <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>\n            -acetylserine to activate transcription. A global sulfur amino acid supply gene regulatory pathway is proposed for\n            <jats:italic>S. mutans</jats:italic>\n            , including the cascade regulation consequent to transcriptional activation of HomR by CysR.

Our objective was to evaluate agronomic performance and potential environmental impacts of in‐season N management (INM) against increased or reduced N fertilization on a calcareous alluvial soil for maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) in China. Optimal N rates (ONR) were determined for INM by deducting measured soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>–N content in root layers from the N target value during three maize growth periods: from planting to three‐leaf stage, three‐ to 10‐leaf stage, and 10‐leaf stage to harvest. Other treatments included a 0 N control, below ONR (70% ONR, 50% ONR, or ONR − 30 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), above ONR (130% ONR, 150% ONR, or ONR + 30 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and farmers' N practice (FNP). Across all 14 sites from 2003 to 2006, when N treatment was less than ONR (average 141 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), grain yield was significantly reduced from 8.5 to 7.7 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> while maintaining similar residual soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>–N content and N losses. When extra N fertilizer was applied, no yield gain was achieved, but N losses were significantly increased from 50 to 81 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> The FNP treatment had the lowest N recovery (22%) and greatest residual soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>–N of 158 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and N loss of 87 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> The INM is an extremely practical strategy for effectively utilizing soil N supply, synchronizing N demand and N supply, and addressing site‐specific N management needs.</jats:p>",

The ischiatic a. gave rise to the caudal coxal a. that supplied muscles caudal to the femur, muscular branches to the iliotibialis lateralis muscle and to the deep femoral a. that supplied the iliofibularis muscle, cutanea femoralis caudalis and lateralis aa., and branches to the flexors of the leg and knee joint, then terminated as the sural and popliteal arteries. The sural a. supplied most of the flexors of the foot. The popliteal a. supplied the knee joint and flexors of the leg, and then terminated as the cranial and caudal tibial arteries. The caudal tibial a. supplied flexors of the foot. The cranial tibial a. provided four branches to the knee and ankle joints and to the leg. The cranial tibial a. continued into the foot as the common dorsal metatarsal a., which gave off seven different branches to the ankle and foot.

The site of vascular occlusion was divided into three groups: Group1-ICA: intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion with or without extension into any of the terminal branches; group2-MCA: middle cerebral artery occlusion either at the main stem or the MCA bifurcation with thrombus extending into the proximal M2 branches; and group3-M2/M3: isolated M2 branch occlusion without involvement of the MCA bifurcation or those with an M3 occlusion. Collateral blood supply was graded on the pre-intervention angiogram based on pial collaterals. For MCA occlusions, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) collaterals from an ipsilateral carotid injection were assessed, and for ICA terminus occlusion, the ACA collateralization was determined from a contralateral carotid injection. The pial collaterals were graded as: no collaterals (grade 0), some collaterals with retrograde opacification of the distal MCA territory (grade 1) and good collaterals, with filling of the proximal MCA (M2) branches or retrograde opacification up to the occlusion site (grade 2). Angiographic recanalization was based on the TIMI grading system (successful recanalization: TIMI 2–3) and clinical outcome on the modified Rankin score (mRS) at 3–6 months of follow-up. All patients had been selected for treatment based on their preprocedure CT angiogram and perfusion imaging.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>98 patients with anterior circulation AIS who had undergone endovascular therapy (lytics and/or mechanical therapy) were studied. Of these, a clinical follow-up and mRS were obtained on 86 patients. Procedural factors (such as recanalization, time to procedure, location of occlusion) were analyzed for all 98 patients but only the 86 patients with a clinical outcome were studied for factors impacting outcome. Overall, a good outcome (mRS 0–2) was seen in 47.6% of the patients. Successful recanalization (TIMI 2–3) was achieved in 56% of patients. Predictors of good outcome were divided into pre- and intraprocedural factors. Among the preprocedure factors, logistic regression analysis showed that a higher age (p=0.004) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (p=0.0009) at admission were the most significant predictors of a poor outcome. Intraprocedural factors such as site of occlusion (p=0.001), degree of recanalization (p&lt;0.0001), extent of collaterals (p=0.001) and procedure duration (p=0.003) were significantly associated with the clinical outcome. Distal occlusions, successful recanalization and shorter procedures were associated with good outcome. A good collateral grade was an independent predictor of good clinical outcome. However, the time to procedure from symptom onset was not significantly associated with the clinical outcome.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Angiographic factors such as the degree of recanalization have been previously shown to be predictors of outcome. We demonstrate that the collateral blood supply plays an important role in independently determining clinical outcome. This is important as preprocedure perfusion imaging and calculation of viable brain may be related to the state of the collateral circulation thus aiding in patient selection and predicting outcome. Separate studies need to be done to confirm this hypothesis.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Data from nine randomized and replicated field experiments from the UK and Denmark showed that the economic optimum N input to winter wheat was greater if diseases were controlled by fungicides, than for untreated wheat. The GHGs associated with this additional N largely negated the benefit to emissions per tonne of grain resulting from disease control. However, the mean grain yield obtained without fungicide treatment was 6·71 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, compared to 8·88 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> with fungicide treatment, if N input was optimal for each situation. In the absence of disease control by fungicides, and assuming that the optimum N rate was used, an additional 481 kha of wheat would be required to maintain UK wheat production at the current level. If the additional land area came from converting temperate grassland to arable production, the GHG emissions caused by ploughing grassland would cause emissions to rise from 503 to 713 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e per tonne of grain produced. This would result in an additional 3·15 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e per year to produce the typical UK annual production of 15 Mt.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous studies describe the suitability of a new type of phosphorus (P) fertilizer, called “rhizosphere‐controlled fertilizer” (RCF), to supply available P to plants while reducing soil phosphorus fixation. In order to explore the involvement of organic acid root exudation in P uptake from RCF, we investigated the relationship between shoot and root P concentrations, and the concentration of the main polycarboxylic organic acids in roots, shoots, and plant exudates. Plant species with different P‐acquisition efficiency (low: maize; medium: chickpea; high: lupin) were grown in hydroponics with three different P fertilizers: The water‐insoluble P fraction of RCF (RCF); Phospal, a slow‐release source of phosphate composed of calcium and aluminum phosphates (PH); monopotassiumphosphate (KP), and a control treatment without P (P–).</jats:p><jats:p>RCF was as efficient as KP in supplying P to plants in the case of chickpea and lupin, and slightly less efficient than KP in maize. However, P from PH was not available for maize and less available compared to KP and RCF in chickpea and lupin. This variation reflects the different efficiencies in P acquisition for the three plant species. Except in the case of maize, plants receiving KP presented the lowest concentration of organic acids in roots and exudates, while those plants suffering severe P deficiency (P– and PH) showed the highest organic acid concentration. However, RCF had a high concentration of organic acids in roots and exudates, as well as a high P concentration in the shoot indicating that P uptake from RCF is enhanced due to root release and action of specific organic acids.</jats:p>",
