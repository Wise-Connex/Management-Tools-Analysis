      "abstract": "<p>This chapter addresses freedom of association (FOA) and collective bargaining (CB) in global supply chains. FOA and CB rights are internationally recognized as core and fundamental human rights of global citizens. Thus, in 1998 when the International Labour Organization recast its objectives to promote “decent work,” FOA and CB were among the “core labor rights,” along with the freedom from child and forced labor and freedom from discrimination. The chapter uses diverse datasets from brands, auditing firms, multi stakeholder institutions (MSIs), and Better Work to assess FOA and CB in the global apparel industry and substantiate the arguments. The breadth of the data permits systematic and comprehensive analysis of the incidence and nature of FOA violations and the influence of FOA and CB on overall labor standards in the industry. FOA and CB show great promise for improving compliance with codes of conduct overall — the expressed goal of private regulation — but FOA and CB are the least supported rights in current private regulation efforts. In other words, most companies with private regulation programs are eschewing the very rights that could potentially improve the functioning of their private regulation programs.</p>",

It first looks at overall progress in terms of the number of violations recorded through more than twenty thousand reliable audits in multiple industries and countries over a seven-year period, before considering progress in specific factories that have been audited multiple times in India to see whether the improvement is being sustained. It appears reasonable to assume that a factory that is audited multiple times over a three-year period will register improvements (in terms of having fewer violations) after each audit. The data for these two examinations were provided by AUDCO, a global auditing company. The chapter then explores progress in specific factories, with data from the Better Work program. Finally, it examines the specific case of the supply chain of a global home products retailer, in which the factories have demonstrated remarkable progress in compliance over a short time frame.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter assesses progress on wages in global supply chains, using AUDCO data. The data include hourly wage rates, the gap between actual wages and minimum wages, the gap between actual wages and take-home pay, and finally the gap between these paid wages and a number of different living wage estimates drawn from 14,315 reliable audits done during the period 2011–2017 in ten countries and seven industries. These data show that wages in all countries have increased and are above the minimum wage (with a few exceptions in a small number of audits). Of course, it is difficult to credit private regulation programs with these increases, given the numerous other influences on wage levels — not the least being local labor market conditions as well as prices paid to suppliers for their product. But the fact that wages paid are above the minimum in most countries is at least consistent with code of conduct commitments. The evidence also shows that wages have been increasing every year — some codes require annual year-on-year increases. Moreover, it demonstrates that wage levels are nowhere near the living wage required by many codes of conduct. The gaps are large, and wages would need to increase considerably to reach the living wage commitments made by global firms in different countries and industries.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This introductory chapter provides a background of private regulation of labor standards in global supply chains. Over the past three decades, there has been a plethora of private, voluntary regulatory initiatives with regard to social (labor) and environmental issues. This proliferation has come about in part because of pressure from antiglobalizers calling for global governance, and consumer and activist movements calling for global corporations to be more socially and environmentally responsible. There are many different methods of private voluntary regulation for labor standards, but the most common is the private regulation model. It has three elements: setting of standards regarding labor practices in global supply chains through a corporate code of conduct generally based on the conventions of the International Labour Organization; “auditing” or “social auditing” that involves monitoring whether supplier factories comply with the code of conduct; and incentives for suppliers to improve compliance by linking future sourcing decisions to their compliance records (penalizing or dropping noncompliant suppliers and rewarding more compliant ones). The book looks at the current state and future trajectory of this form of private regulation.</p>",

A survey of 220 supply chain respondents revealed that both top management support and data-driven culture have a high significant influence on their intention to adopt BDA. However, the firm entrepreneurial orientation showed no significant effect. Also, the findings revealed that supply chain connectivity positively moderates the link between top management support and intention. This study contributes to the practical field, offering valuable insights for decision makers considering BDA adoption in SCM. It also contributes to the literature by helping minimize the research gap in BDA adoption in the Saudi context.</p>",

This work is devoted to the optimization of the structure of heat supply to oil terminals. In this sense it is relevant. The object of research is the heat supply systems of an oil terminal. At the same time, the subject of research is the energy efficiency of heat supply systems for oil terminals using water vapor and high-temperature organic heat carriers. The following research methods were used: an analytical review of information sources, a technical and economic analysis with the necessary substantiating calculations. As a result of the studies, the possibility of using high-temperature organic heat carriers for organizing heat supply to oil terminals has been shown. The advantage in the efficiency, environmental friendliness and reliability of systems with high-temperature organic heat carriers versus systems using water vapor as a heat carrier is shown. On-site heating networks in the oil terminal are recommended. The main advantages are that the heat losses in them have been reduced and the reliability of the system has increased. The cost estimation of capital investments of the compared variants of the heat supply system arrangement is carried out. The centralized heat supply systems have greater equipment cost compared with the decentralized ones. The operating cost for decentralized systems is also lower due to a decrease in specific fuel and electricity consumption. The materials obtained as a result of the research can be used as recommendations for the design of heat supply systems for oil terminals using high-temperature organic heat carriers.</jats:p>"

The CCDE should be planned based on the multiscale structure of water infrastructures, in which the systems are divided into a number of hierarchically organized subsystems. The CCDE allows independent execution of all subsystems under normal situations yet coordination of subsystems at different scales to mitigate any disturbances during failure events, i.e. the multiscale resilience. This vision is discussed in detail for water distribution systems (WDSs). Specifically, the conceptual design of the multiscale CCDE is described, and progress on understanding the multiscale structures in WDSs is summarized based on the literature review. Furthermore, a few theories consistent with the multiscale CCDE concept are discussed which include the decomposition theorems, fractal theory, control theories, and complex network theory. The next step in the vision will be to identify the optimal multiscale structure for the CCDE based on the best trade-off of different goals of WDS analysis and management. This process needs support from not only innovative modelling tools and extensive datasets and theories but also inspiring exemplar systems, e.g. natural systems.</jats:p>",

The book charts the development and effectiveness of corporate codes of conduct to ameliorate “sweatshop” conditions in global supply chains. This form of private voluntary regulation, spearheaded by Nike and Reebok, became necessary given the inability of third world countries to enforce their own laws and the absence of a global regulatory system for labor standards. Although private regulation programs have been adopted by other companies in many different industries, we know relatively little regarding the effectiveness of these programs because companies don't disclose information about their efforts and outcomes in regulating labor conditions in their supply chains. The book presents data from companies, multi-stakeholder institutions, and auditing firms in a comprehensive, investigative dive into the world of private voluntary regulation of labor conditions. The picture painted is wholistic and raw, but it considers several ways in which this private voluntary system can be improved to improve the lives of workers in global supply chains.</p>",

Small scale industries and organisations are either unaware or reluctant to apply analytics and digitise their supply chain for multiple reasons. This paper is an effort to demonstrate the effect of supply chain analytics on a company and its current constraints. A detailed description of diverse analytics to aid in the surge of productivity at XYZ plant is presented. An underlying objective of this research was to impact all three aspects – strategy, design and execution of the supply chain to boost profits and optimise the system in consideration.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the authors are interested in the role played by supply chain relational connection in moderating how demand variability signal is transmitted upstream. The paper conducts an empirical study based on a panel data of 55 manufacturing industries and 9 wholesale industries. The regression analysis shows that demand variability is propagated through supply chain upward and the transmission is influenced by the structural relationship between suppliers and customers, which is measured by customer-base concentration and customer interconnectedness. On the other hand, customer demand variability has a greater impact on industries with less concentrated customer base or with less interconnected customers.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This concluding chapter reviews the key findings and arguments of this book regarding private regulation. It also looks at other suggestions to reform and improve private regulation which are not canvassed extensively in this book. An important one is to reform the buyer–supplier contract to make the contract “work both ways” — that is, level the playing field so suppliers and workers can sue for buyer compliance. A second concerns institutionalizing unemployment insurance for supply chain workers. Meanwhile, a third suggestion is that global buyers reform their sourcing to source only from countries with good labor standards, or at a minimum, clearly indicate to those country's governments that they will stop sourcing if labor laws are not enforced. Ultimately, private regulation is not a panacea, and researchers have pointed to other steps that could improve working conditions in supply chains. For one thing, national governments need to do a better job enforcing existing labor laws; indeed, it was governments' failure to do so that gave rise to private regulation. Another step is regionalization — harmonizing national labor standards within regional trade blocs through arrangements similar to those employed by the European Union. Moreover, labor standards could be improved if the International Labour Organization (ILO) could be more forceful with its members with respect to adhering to ILO conventions.</p>",

We consider this a significant research gap and explore the relationship between smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. First, we define the concept of smart contracts in terms of supply chain management. Then, we conduct a content analysis of the literature to explore the overlapping research fields of smart contracts and sustainability in supply chains. Next, we develop a semi-structured assessment framework to model the potential environmental and social impacts induced by smart contracts on supply chains. We propose a conceptual framework for supply chain maturity by mapping the relationships between organizational development, sustainability, and technology. We identify smart contracts as a foundational technology that enables efficient and transparent governance and collaborative self-coordination of human and non-human actors. Thus, we argue that smart contracts can contribute to the economic and social development of networked value chains and Society 5.0. To stimulate interdisciplinary research on smart contracts, we conclude the article by formulating research propositions and trade-offs for smart contracts in the context of technology development, business process and supply chain management, and sustainability.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the prevalence of food insecurity and food supply issues, and perspectives of food supply stakeholders in regional Australia. Methods: A mixed-methods consumer survey and in-depth interviews with food supply stakeholders were conducted in South West Western Australia between May and July 2020, immediately after the 1<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> wave of the pandemicResults: The prevalence of food insecurity was 21%, and significantly more prevalent for those aged less than 30 years and living with a disability. Most consumers (73%) agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the food supply. Food insecure respondents were more likely to report that food was more expensive, resulting in changes to the types and quantities of food bought. Food supply stakeholders perceived that consumers increased their intention to buying locally grown produce. Panic buying temporarily reduced the availability of food for both consumers and food suppliers.Conclusions: Further government support at a local, regional, and national level is necessary to support households at risk of food insecurity and to bolster regional food systems to support equitable access to food.</jats:p>"

They construct, improve, operate and maintain infrastructure of different complexities, from individual wells to complex collectively owned water schemes. While most of these schemes operate without legal recognition, they provide essential services to many households. In this article we will first provide an overview of the growing international body of literature describing self-supply as an alternative pathway for public service delivery. We then take a historical perspective on the role of communities and self-supply in South Africa and describe the emergence of six collectively owned, gravity-fed, piped schemes in Tshakhuma, Limpopo Province. We describe and compare these systems using key characteristics like resource access, investment, construction, operation, maintenance and institutional governance. We further assess their performance with regard to coverage, service level, reliability, governance structure, accountability and water quality. We do so because we are convinced that lessons learned from studying such schemes as locally adapted prototypes have the potential to improve public approaches to service delivery. The described cases show the willingness of community members to engage with service delivery and their ability to provide services in cases where the state has failed. The assessment also highlights problematic aspects of self-supply related to a lack of accountability, technical expertise and the exclusion of disadvantaged community members. By describing and assessing the performance of rural self-supply schemes, we aim to recognize, study and learn from such schemes. We consequently do not conclude this article by providing answers, but by raising some pertinent, policy-relevant questions.</jats:p>"

A whole CS construction, in a supply chain management system, can be generally divided into two driving modes, industry regulation (IR), and administrative supervision (AS). The authors firstly establish payoff functions based on traditional income function and marginal effort-cost function. And then they analyze strategic equilibriums of the supervisors and the manufacturers based on their decision roles in the two modes. After that, they make comparisons on equilibrium states between IR and AS. From the results, they find that strategic equilibriums in AS construction is not necessarily better than those in IR construction. These results can also provide strategic help for CS construction in supply chain management when considering better combination between IR and AS.</p>",

However, the studies on resilient supply chain design considering these two types of risks are limited. Furthermore, how to quantify the uncertainty arising from the lack of historical data in the planing stage is not sufficiently studied. Aiming at these problems, this paper presents two uncertain programming models that optimize the strategic decisions before disruptions and supply chain operations after disruptions. The presented models introduce p-robustness measure to bound the cost in disruption scenarios. Besides, uncertainty theory is adopted to handle parameter uncertainty in the absence of historical data. Later, these two programming models are converted into their corresponding deterministic equivalents, which can be solved by cplex. Finally, we illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed models and explore the impact of critical parameters on the optimal solution by implementing a series of randomly generated instances and a practical case. The observations may provide some interesting managerial insights for decision-making in reality.</jats:p>"

The JKN era is also a burden where health financing managed by BPJS is always deficit every year. Hospitals as health service providers must be able to carry out operational cost efficiency as mandated by the JKN era, namely quality control and cost control. One of the cost efficiency methods is the implementation of lean management in hospital operational processes, especially the supply chain management process (procurement, inventory control, distribution planning and demand management). This study aims to evaluate the improvement process and cost efficiency after the implementation of lean management in the supply chain management process at the hospital. This study used a single holistic case study method with the unit of analysis at the Lean team level at Panti Rapih Hospital, Yogyakarta. Research subjects are employees in the team who are directly involved in the implementation of lean management. Selection of research subjects based on purposive sampling. Total sample of 7 respondents for in-depth interview process. The research instrument used an interview guide. The result of this research is that lean management which is applied in the logistic unit of the neat orphanage hospital can reduce waste such as motion, inventory, and waiting time. In addition, another benefit that can be felt by management is increasing cost efficiency. The conclusion of this study is that lean management is recommended to be applied in health services such as hospitals.</jats:p>",

In the United States, a benefit corporation is a type of for-profit corporate entity that includes among its goals — in addition to profits — a positive impact on society, workers, the community, and the environment. The chapter argues that the B-Corp movement is a false promise because of the legal limitations of actors to seek remedy if a benefit corporation does not meet its “benefit goals” and because of a variety of issues in the certification process for such a corporation. This argument is supported through the analysis of the private regulation program of a leading benefit corporation, which shows that its status has in no way improved coupling between private regulation practices and outcomes. It would seem that the benefit corporation certification is simply another modern ritual of due diligence, although there is a need for additional research on benefit corporations to confirm this conclusion.</p>",

We carefully analyzed forty (40) papers selected from leading, highly-ranked journals to answer the following research question: “What are the measures necessary for the development of sustainable Halal food supply chains?”&#x0D;\nResults and discussion. The findings revealed that the improvement of Halal processes through the implementation of quality management systems, the effectiveness of Halal labeling, and the use of technology could enhance the economic performance of HFSCs. Furthermore, HFSC’s sustainability efforts are strengthened by enhancing trust and transparency benefitting human resource skills development, promoting animal welfare issues, and increasing regulatory compliance. The implementation of environmental protection measures is a primary driving factor for environmental sustainability activities. Environmental sustainability could be fostered by a shift to the application of greening practices and the support of environmentalism in the Halal food industry.&#x0D;\nConclusion.

Second, it is worth noting that the linkage would not have been possible had it not been for a well-developed compliance system already operating for many years with a high profile in the corporate organization. Third, developing a software architecture that included comprehensive supplier scorecards facilitated linking compliance with sourcing. Fourth, the Pangia case highlights the transactional mentality that permeates sourcing operations in the apparel industry. Fifth, the case makes clear that changing the transactional mentality may well require a change of talent. Sixth, benchmarking with firms outside the industry was crucial for learning new lessons. And the final lesson is that vendors will respond to incentives to change their behavior.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter discusses practice multiplicity in the implementation of private regulation programs. As private regulation unfolded through the 1990s and early 2000s, the number of codes of conduct also proliferated — and there are now likely numerous different codes across different companies, each with some degree of variation. While codes relating to labor standards were initially quite diverse, individual company codes have gradually coalesced into multi stakeholder institution (MSI) codes or industrywide codes. Nevertheless, wide variations remain. All this variation is a problem: it “complicates the work that industry players have to do to implement policies” and “contributes to a sense of confusion among an external audience of consumers, governments, and activists groups.” This confusion and debate is the result of practice multiplicity and is a fundamental cause of the decoupling between private regulation policies and positive outcomes for workers. For a more detailed view of practice multiplicity in action, the chapter turns to an empirical investigation regarding multiplicity in the implementation of private regulation approaches by different companies sourcing from the same supplier.</p>",

In this paper, we explore this intersection in the case of Bangalore’s water supply, where IBM in alliance with the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is implementing a water-flow sensor network and geographic database system under the label of “big data for water supply.” We illustrate how the BWSSB-IBM approach narrows down the complex field of water provision to a question of water in- and out-flow measurements and the monitoring of BWSSB ground personnel. In theoretical terms, we discuss the ways in which these processes constitute both particular claims to knowledge, and the redefinition of citizenship as consumption.</p>"

The Cointegration test results indicated that there was no causal link between the money supply M1 and inflation in the long term. Finally, the results of Granger Causality presented a unidirectional causality running from the money supply M1 to inflation in the short term, meaning that money supply causes inflation, not vice versa; this means that the money supply M1 can explain the changes that occur in the consumer price index (CPI) in the Jordanian economy.The study recommends that the monetary authority in Jordan should have greater control over the money supply due to its impact on the stability of the general level of prices, in order to avoid a repeat of the 1989 crisis represented by the sharp decline of the dinar exchange rate against other currencies and an increase in inflation that year to 25.6%.</jats:p>",

It draws attention to the varieties of transparency required and specifically to the integration and inclusion of workers in private regulation programs to stimulate internalization of goals, especially through worker participation in compliance auditing and through methods such as surveys by which workers' perspectives are heard. The chapter then highlights the need for more data sharing, data analysis, and predictive modeling and concludes with specific recommendations for the variety of actors in private regulation to move the institutional field from opacity to transparency. Only through data analysis can we generate the predictive models that allow for evidence-based decision making and identification of other means by which the coupling of private regulation programs with worker outcomes can be increased. Ultimately, workers and trade unions, in what has been called contingent coupling, can help “shrink the gap between practices and outcomes” for workers by leveraging the private regulation policies of brands.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Fuzzy Supply Chain Network (FSCN) is one of the modern attitudes that lead to reduce system costs, losses in shipping products, and reduce inventory levels. The queuing model used in this study obeys from M/G/1 queue that the arrival rate has a Poisson probability distribution, and the service rate has the general probability distribution. In this study, the fuzzy supply chain is analyzed in three levels. The suppliers are placed on the first level, the distribution centers are at the second level and the local warehouse (consumer) is on the third level. The objective function of the presented model is based on profit maximization which the resulted benefit from products sale obtained from the difference between total revenues and total costs. The presented model in the fuzzy set is converted to the deterministic mathematical model. The appropriate results can be obtained from the analysis of the presented model. The model is solved by using Maple 12 software. Finally, this approach leads to the appropriate management of the market, increasing customer satisfaction, and ultimately, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities in the supply chain network.</p>"

When there are two types of decision model (decentralized decision, centralized decision), we analyze the demand price elasticity, market share ratio, revenue sharing ratio and quality cost coefficient how to influence the product demand, product quality level, retail price and direct price in different channels, expected revenue functions of manufacturer and retailer, consumer surplus and product quality control strategy. We find that: First of all, the retail price and direct price are positively related to product quality level, and the product quality level is negatively related with the demand price elasticity in traditional retail channel and the demand price elasticity in internet channel. What's more, the retailers’ retail price in traditional retail channel will be higher than direct price in internet channel. Thirdly, in the case of centralized decision, the manufacturers' product quality level, retail price, joint expected revenue and consumer surplus will all rise, but the direct price will fall. Fourthly, when the manufacturer establishes the dual channel structure, i.e., entrusting the third-party platform to build the internet channel, the manufacturer's product quality level, retail price, direct price, expected revenue, and consumer surplus will all decline. Finally, we conduct the numerical example by Matlab 2018, which verifies the validity and credibility of our conclusions, and points out the direction for the specific application of the model in practice.</jats:p>"

A survey was carried out by the Intermittent Water Supply Specialist Group of the International Water Association (IWA IWS SG) to better understand the current state of these systems and challenges that water companies may have faced under COVID-19 pandemic and to capture successful management strategies applied by water utilities. The survey consisted of three parts: (1) general information about IWS systems, (2) current state of IWS and (3) resilience of IWS under COVID-19 conditions, as well as some questions about potential interventions in order to improve system performance in general and under future uncertain conditions. The survey responses were evaluated based on the Safe &amp; SuRe resilience framework, assessing measures of mitigation, adaptation, coping and learning, and exploring organisational and operational responses of IWS utilities. Infrastructure capacity and water resources availability were identified as the main causes of intermittency in most water distribution systems, while intermittent electricity was considered as the main external cause. Participants indicated that some risk assessment process was in place; however, COVID-19 has surpassed any provisions made to address the risks. Lessons learnt highlighted the importance of financial resources, e-infrastructure for efficient system operation and communication with consumers, and the critical role of international knowledge transfer and the sharing of best practice guidelines for improving resilience and transitioning towards continuous water supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter examines causal complexity. The determinants of improvement in working conditions in supplier factories in global supply chains are complex. The complexity arises from the interaction between heterogeneous actors (companies, auditing firms, suppliers) following a multiplicity of practices, combined with the effect of local institutional conditions and industry and workplace context. Along with the general lack of transparency in private regulation, this combination of causal factors leads to uncertainty with respect to cause–effect relationships. The central assumption of the private regulation model is that if standards are set by codes of conduct (whether based on international conventions or local laws), and if supplier factories comply with the codes, sweatshop conditions will be avoided and improvements will be made in the lives of workers in global supply chains. But this assumption may not be warranted; buyers and brands may not have the power to force suppliers to compel compliance. And within the businesses of most global buyers and retailers, sourcing may not be sufficiently well integrated with compliance, so the incentive effects of rewarding good factories that are making improvements in compliance are not realized in practice — even though such incentives are the very basis for the model of private regulation of first-tier supplier factories.</p>",

In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities associated with bitwise operations by doing cryptanalysis of a secure lightweight authentication protocol for RFID tags. The bitwise operations like rotation and XOR show that the protocol is vulnerable to tag, reader, and supply chain node impersonation attacks. We find that the major cause of the vulnerability is bitwise operations and suggest using the physically unclonable functions rather than bitwise operations to secure such lightweight protocols.</jats:p>"

The fresh vegetables we enjoy may come from a local farmers market, the grapes from California, tree nuts from Vietnam, coffee from Brazil, spices from India, and fish from the Bering Sea, to name a few. This global interconnected and interdependent food system that feeds us also provides 40 per cent of global employment and accounts for 10 per cent of consumer spending. But it faces increasing risks from a changing climate. With a global view of the food system as a foundation, the chapter then considers how the many changes in the climate are affecting plants, the basis of life. Plants require the right temperatures, water, soil, air, and sunlight. All of these requirements except sunlight are changing, with subtle to profound implications. The air now has more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, which means that most plants will grow faster and bigger, but any benefit will be offset by stress from increasing heat and drought. The chapter also looks at how the changing climate affects pests, pollinators, and the food supply chain.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>A requirement for developing desalination in coastal regions suffering water scarcity is proposed to address the increased water demand and limited traditional water supply. The determination of plant capacity and water allocation scheme in a multiple-source water supply system, the first problem in planning desalination under stream flow and water demand uncertainties, remains a challenge. To address this gap, an interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming model is developed in this study. The first-stage problem is to determine a proper desalination plant capacity, and the second is the water allocation scheme under uncertainties of natural stream flows, water demands, benefits and economic losses. The objective function is to maximize the net benefit of the system, and the cost function of desalination, including capital and operational costs, implying environmental impact, is linearized within a range of plant capacities to solve the model. The proposed approach is applied to an urban area of Weihai city in China to illustrate the validity of the model. The results suggest a capacity of 46 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/d in 2030 and 56 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/d in 2040. Sensitivity analyses of the parameters indicate that the unit price of electricity influences the utilization level of desalinated seawater, and a complementary relationship is observed between reclaimed water and desalinated seawater.</jats:p>"

We proposed that the functioning of bee populations and communities may depend on the floral diversity of the local habitat, which determines whether a nutritionally balanced pollen diet obtained from specific species can be provided to bee larvae.

Based on consideration of the behavior preferences of supply chain members, in this paper, we study the influence of rebate distribution on supply chain utility. We establish a supply chain utility model, including the proportion of distribution, fairness concern coefficient and effort level, and discuss three different situations of supply chain members. The results show that (i) a manufacturer’s rebate can more effectively improve the utility in a supply chain with fairness perception; (ii) with other conditions unchanged, the fairness perception of supply chain members will have a positive impact on their own utility; and (iii) at the same time, when the party who has more discourse power in the supply chain has a sense of fairness, this is conducive to realizing the stable development of the supply chain through changes in the proportion of rebate distribution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter focuses on assessing data reliability, using data provided by AUDCO (a large auditing company) from more than forty thousand audits spanning seven-years across twelve countries and thirteen industries. It highlights China, which reports very high levels of unreliable audit information, and examines the role played by a “gray” actor — the audit consulting company (ACC) — in helping suppliers “pass” audits. ACCs provide a variety of services, including falsification of audit records. The chapter then considers how ACCs “advertise” their services and how they work, through a detailed analysis of an audit consultant's work logs, as well as an assessment of why ACCs may be so successful. The analysis suggests that getting a clear picture of what is really happening in a factory requires a nuanced understanding of the nature of the data that auditors examine. It points to the need for auditors to be better trained at spotting falsified data but also to triangulate with other data and information sources (perhaps from workers). Ultimately, the results show that the lack of reliable data provided to auditors is a major reason for the decoupling we see between private regulation practices and sustainable improvements in working conditions in global supply chains across multiple industries and countries.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In this paper, we study a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain(CLSC), where the manufacturer wholesales the new product through the traditional retail channel and distributes the remanufactured product via a direct channel established by himself. We focus on developing two dynamic Stackelberg game models under the assumption of the retailer is an adaptive agent and the manufacturer is a bounded rational player with non-delay and delay decisions. The existence and locally asymptotic stability of Nash equilibrium is investigated, and also the complex dynamics of each model is illustrated including period-doubling bifurcation, Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, strange attractor and chaotic phenomena. Numerical simulations are conducted to examine the impacts of key parameters on the complex behaviors of the long-run dynamic Stackelberg game and the performance of chain members under various scenarios. The results reveal that the excessively high value of the price adjustment speed of the manufacturer, the consumer discount perception for the remanufactured product as well as the consumer preference degree to the direct channel have adestabilization effect on the Nash equilibrium. Besides, the delay decision adopted by manufacturer no matter in the traditional or direct channel does not always necessarily make the system more stable, but the appropriately delay weights can expand the stability domain of the system. Moreover, the manufacturer would suffer a significant profit loss while the retailer can capture more profits when the dual-channel CLSC system falls into periodic cycles and chaos motions. At last, the variable feedback control method is utilized to eliminate the delayed system chaos.</jats:p>"

We find this result using an empirical cross-country model with many economic drivers for the neutral rates of 11 advanced economies during the 1960-2019 period. The increasing availability of safe assets after 2008 has pushed up neutral rates, preventing them from continuing their previous decline because of other drivers. We also evaluate the \"global savings glut\" hypothesis. We estimate that since 1994 the global accumulation of international exchange reserves in safe assets has lowered the availability of these assets to the private sector and, thus pushed down neutral rates. Finally, we find that economies' neutral rates are subject to important global spillovers from developments in other economies.&amp;amp;lt;/ns2:p&amp;amp;gt;</jats:p>"

A typical ventilated window functions as a solar collector under inward air flow direction and incident solar radiation. The ventilated window is a modification of the multiple pane windows in which air is drawn in from outside and is heated through conduction, convection, and radiation in the cavity. In this study, a detailed parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the thermal performance of ventilated windows and their capacity to preheat ventilation air. High-resolution 3D steady RANS computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed for six ventilated window geometries. Model results were compared with measurements. The following geometric characteristics were evaluated in detail: (i) The height of the window, (ii) the width of the cavity, (iii) the location of double-layered glazing, and (iv) the width of the supply air opening. The results suggested that taller cavities and a smaller cavity depth can provide higher incoming air temperature. Windows with inner double-layered glazing and a smaller width of supply air opening displayed a better thermal performance.</jats:p>"

On this basis, the influence mechanism of haze pollution on urban shrinkage is analysed theoretically. Next, using the dynamic panel model and the mediating effect model, we empirically examine the impact of urban shrinkage on haze pollution and the mediating effect of labour supply. The main findings are as follows: haze pollution increases the degree of urban shrinkage, and labour supply plays a regulatory role in the process of haze pollution affecting urban shrinkage. According to our research, pertinent policies and suggestions are proposed to reduce both urban shrinkage and haze pollution.</jats:p>"

Supply Chain Management merupakan salah satu proses dimana aliran bahan baku, informasi, serta keuangan antar perusahaan terjadi dalam tujuan memenuhi pemesanan konsumen. Proses yang dilakukan untuk memenuhi pasokan bahan baku dimulai dari permintaan retail oleh distributor dan permintaan konsumen oleh retail, proses rantai pasokan yang baik dapat memenuhi pasokan yang setabil dengan tujuan tidak ada kekurangan bahan baku atau bahan jadi. Supply chain management dilakukan untuk memperbaiki proses pasokan yang dilakukan oleh bagian pemasok, produsen, distributor, pengecer, dan pelangga, konsep tersebut merupakan rantai pasokan multi-layer yang terdiri dari material akhir yang memiliki banyak produk yang siap jual.

This study builds a stylized game-theoretical model in the sustainable supply chain context, where the competitive traditional product manufacturers sell their products through the platform’s marketplace, while the platform decides whether to introduce the green products and the pricing strategy. We find that, when the evaluation difference for the green product is sufficiently low, the introduction of the green product by the platform benefits the manufacturers (or third-party sellers). Interestingly, a higher platform fee makes a higher likelihood of a win-win situation between the platform and manufacturers. Moreover, when consumers value green products sufficiently higher than traditional products, the traditional products’ manufacturers can also benefit from the green product entry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main aim of the study was to assess the environmental performance, through the application of the life cycle assessment, of a recycled paper production process focusing on the energy aspect. The production process occurred in a paper mill that produces packaging paper using paper and cardboard from source separation of municipal solid waste as raw materials. Two scenarios (S1 and S2) were defined by their energy supply sources. A cogeneration (CHP) system using natural gas for the combined production of thermal and electric energy was the source in S1. The Italian electricity grid (using the Italian country mix) and a natural gas boiler were the separate sources for electric and thermal energy, respectively, in S2. Finally, in order to evaluate the environmental effects on the results of the study about the variation in the natural gas supply source, four alternative Italian import mixes (M1, M2, M3, and M4) were defined by varying the contribution of the supplier countries. The environmental impacts were evaluated with ReCiPe 2016 (H) using both midpoint and endpoint approaches. The results showed that for both the scenarios, the energy consumption was the main cause of impacts mainly because of the natural gas contribution. The presence of the cogeneration (CHP) system generated significant environmental benefits compared with the use of energy provided by more conventional sources. The production and use of chemicals as well as the disposal of waste produced during the paper production were other environmental hotspots. The variation in the composition of the Italian import mix of natural gas, in terms of the supplier country’s contribution, had a significant influence on the results. The import of natural gas from Russia was the most impactful option. Since Russia is the country that contributes to the Italian import mix the most, in the next years, the use of natural gas in Italy could become increasingly impactful. Therefore, the replacement of natural gas with renewable sources is an urgent priority.</jats:p>"

Rainfall-induced shallow landslides often provide an adequate source of solid materials to recharge moving sediment during flash floods. In this study, we used the TRIGRS model to analyze the rainfall-related landslide stability in a mountainous basin and gain potential landslide volumes as potential sources for sediment loads. Then, with the calculated results of landslides as input, the Massflow model was used to evaluate how the landslides as sediment loads evolved with flows. The results showed that there was a large amount of sediment deposited in the channel, which can be initiated and transported by heavy rainfalls, leading to the destruction of villages at the mouth of gullies. In general, this study offers a strategy of evaluating sediment-coupled flash flood disasters that the TRIGRS can provides the estimate of landslide distribution and volume first and the Massflow provides the estimate of subsequent movement of the solids caused by flash floods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

This complex issue for supply chain stakeholders highlights the need for the application of supply chain finance (SCF). This paper proposes the five Vs of big data (value, volume, velocity, variety, and veracity) as a platform for determining the role of GSCM practices in improving SCF implementation. The fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) was employed to prioritize the five Vs by their roles in SCF. The fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was then applied to evaluate GSCM practices on the basis of the five Vs. In addition, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was used to visualize the optimum implementation of the GSCM practices. The outcome is a hybrid self-assessment model that measures the environmental maturity of SCF by the coherent application of three multicriteria decision-making techniques. The development of the Basic Readiness Index (BRI), Relative Readiness Index (RRI), and Strategic Matrix Tool (SMT) creates the potential for further improvements through the integration of the RRI scores and ISM results.

A base-case scenario is considered to show the impact of risk management strategy on performance improvement. The expected profit of the decision maker is obtained for different combination of strategies, and sensitivity analysis is performed to show the impact of perishability on the percentage of improvement from the base case scenario. The results show that backup supplier strategy is very effective during the yield disruption, but it is not as effective during harvest disruption.

In the real world, the CLSC network design is subject to a variety of uncertainties, such as random and fuzzy (epistemic) uncertainties. Designing a reliable and environmentally cautious CLSC with consideration of risks and the uncertainty of the parameters in the network is necessary for a successful supply-chain network. This study proposes a sustainable and environmentally cautious closed-loop supply-chain network for the tire industry, by considering several recovery options, including retreading, recycling, and energy recovery. This study aims to design and develop a robust multi-objective, multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-cycle, multi-capacity, green closed-loop supply-chain network under hybrid uncertainty. There are two types of uncertainties associated with the parameters in the network. There is an uncertainty associated with the demand, which is expressed in some future scenarios according to the probability of their occurrences, as well as fuzzy-based uncertainty associated with return rates, retreading rates, recycling rates, procurement, and production costs, which are expressed with possibilistic distributions. In order to deal with this hybrid uncertainty, a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach has been proposed, and the proposed mixed integer programming model is applied to a case study in the tire industry to validate the model. The result indicates the applicability of the proposed model and its efficiency to control the hybrid uncertainties and the risk level in the network.</jats:p>"

Despite this significance, there is currently a lack of methods for reconstructing how much fine sediment was transported by ancient rivers. Mud accumulations in sandy river deposits are often interpreted as indicators of variable flow conditions; however, these deposits may present an opportunity to constrain how much fine sediment was transported through ancient rivers. We report results from a series of experiments designed to evaluate how much clay and silt are preserved in sandy riverbed deposits under constant and variable discharge conditions. Our results demonstrate that (1) mud deposits, including drapes and lenses, form readily under constant, high-discharge conditions, (2) the amount of fine sediment recovered from bed-material deposits increases as fine-sediment supply increases, and (3) fine-sediment retention is higher during bed aggradation than during bypass conditions. These results indicate that the net retention of clay and silt in sandy riverbed deposits may be a simple but powerful proxy for comparing the overall amount of fine sediment supplied to ancient rivers.</jats:p>",

Using data from interactions with unannounced standardized patients, we find that fixed-term contracts motivate greater diagnostic effort without increasing unnecessary treatments. Lower effort among civil servants appears due to both weaker career and wage incentives.</jats:p>"

They do not consider the features of gas fields (overhead lines with a length of up to 20 km and a capacity of 1 MV with a projected growth of up to 10 MV, a transmission network with one pass-through trunk line with distributed transformation along the line). Currently, to develop a mathematical model, the following factors are considered: the average length of the power line and the total load of an enterprise. The proposed models do not allow us to quantify the dynamics of the gas fields power supply system considering the multiple growth of the electrical load in each period of the life cycle. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to solve this problem. An extreme experiment has been carried out during the research. The following input data are set: the average length of the power line; the number of gas clusters; the growth rate of the electric load. The response function is the voltage class that is optimal for the minimum discounted cost. The authors suggest the regression model. In this model the “total load” factor is split into two components, they are gas clusters and growth rate of electric loads. The algorithm to select the optimal voltage class of a distribution grid is proposed. The dynamic experiment is carried out and the growth rate of electric loads in the regressive model is being changed while other factors are being unchanged. As a result, the optimal minimum of the discounted costs of the voltage class for each period of the field life cycle is obtained. The algorithm is implemented in “PRON” software. With the help of “PRON” software, the distribution grids of several operating gas fields in Western Siberia have been investigated. The optimal voltage class of a distribution grid of gas fields is 20 kV. The reliability of the results is verified by reference models of calculating discounted costs.</jats:p>",

The proposed control system allows selective harmonic currents compensation up to the 50th harmonic with the utilization of a model-based predictive current controller. As the system is fully predictive, it provides high effectiveness of the harmonic reduction, which is proved by waveforms achieved in performed tests. On the other hand, the control system is prone to loss of stability. Therefore, the paper is focused on the stability analysis of the discussed control system with the additional outer control loop of the supply current with predictive control of this current. The conducted stability analysis encompasses the assessment of system stability as a function of the coupling circuit parameter identification accuracy, whose values are implemented in the current controller, as well as parameters such as the sampling frequency and proportional-integral (PI) controller coefficients. The obtained results show that the ranges of the LCL circuit parameter identification accuracy for which the system remains stable are relatively wide. However, the most effective compensation of the supply current distortion is achieved for the parameters identified correctly, and the greatest impact on the compensation quality has the value of L1 inductance.</jats:p>"

To achieve this aim, three arrangements of humidification–compression (HC) processes are designed. Two single-stage processes and one double-stage HC process are designed and their performances are compared based on desalinated water production, gained output ratio (GOR) and power consumption. An attempt is made to reduce the power consumption and improve the system performance. All three processes are simulated to examine the effect of operation parameters on HC performance. To validate these simulations, the theoretical results are compared with an experimental rig with a humidifier column of 1.5 m height. The results indicate that the simulation values conform to the experimental data. The effect of minimum approach temperature (ΔTmin) on system performance is investigated for three processes subject to constant operating conditions (feed temperature, water mass flow, air mass flow, and pressure ratio). For this purpose, four values of ΔTmin are considered (7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 °C) for heat exchanger operations. The results indicate that an increase in ΔTmin in all three cases increases desalinated water volume and GOR. Also, the double-stage HC system has higher water production rate (66.08 kg/h) and higher GOR (17.19) compared with its counterparts.</jats:p>",

This approach also improves resiliency and ability to address peak load burden effectively. Demand response programs and grid-interactive buildings are also essential to meet the energy needs of the 21st century while addressing climate impact. Given the significance of the scale of building energy consumption, this study investigates how cogeneration systems influence the primary energy consumption and carbon footprint in residential buildings. The impact of onsite power generation capacity, its electrical and thermal efficiency, and its cost, on total primary energy consumption, equivalent carbon dioxide emissions, operating expenditure, and, most importantly, thermal and electrical energy balance, is presented. The conditions at which a cogeneration approach loses its advantage as an energy efficient residential resource are identified as a function of electrical grid’s carbon footprint and primary energy efficiency. Compared to a heat pump heating system with a coefficient of performance (COP) of three, a 0.5 kW cogeneration system with 40% electrical efficiency is shown to lose its environmental benefit if the electrical grid’s carbon dioxide intensity falls below 0.4 kg CO2 per kWh electricity.</jats:p>"

As far as the methodology adopted is concerned, the qualitative analysis of the cases was carried out with an inductive method. The 20 study cases belong to the fashion, mechatronics, automotive, and packaging systems, and they have been investigated as real research laboratories for 6 years. The first results suggest that there might be a close relationship between innovation, efficiency, and firm performance. In addition, many innovations are technology-driven and related, for instance, to business model re-configuration. This paper aims to benefit both practice and theory.</p>",

The relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth is largely explained by the environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. By employing the basic postulation of the baseline EKC framework, this study proposes and tests the existence of a dualistic approach of the EKC hypothesis. Geometry is used to illustrate the proposed dualistic model. Meanwhile, the novel dynamic common correlation effect econometric technique is employed to test the existence of the dualistic EKC within a panel of 109 countries from 1995 to 2016. The outcome from the estimated models shows that, in the global sample, the existence of the dualistic U-shape and N-shape EKC hypothesis is validated. When the sample is split into sub samples based on income levels, the U-shape EKC hypothesis is validated for lower income and high income economies meanwhile, the N-shape dualistic EKC is mostly associated with high income economies.</jats:p>"

Such a DSCT promises to enable several improvements all across the supply chain while also be capable of simulating and evaluate several different scenarios for the supply chain. Therefore, the DSCT will not only be able to optimize multi- and intermodal supply chains but also makes them potentially more robust by identifying possible issues early on. This paper discusses the major requirements that such a DSCT must fulfil to be useful and how several information technologies that matured in recent years or are about the mature are the key enablers to fulfil these requirements. Finally, a suggested high-level architecture for such a DSCT is presented as a first step towards the realization of a DSCT, as presented in this work</jats:p>"

First, the individual total profit functions of the manufacturer and multiple retailers are established and are integrated to form the total profit function of the supply chain system. Then, to address the model complexity, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Several practical numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the solution procedure, and a sensitivity analysis is performed on the major parameters. From the numerical results, several findings that differ from those in the previous literature were observed. First, retailers with larger market scale, better cost control, and inspection capabilities guarantee higher integrated total profit. Second, increasing the deterioration rates of materials and finished products affect the order quantity of materials in various ways. Third, the manufacturer’s shipping strategy is rigid and not easily adjusted in the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model has several meaningful management implications.</jats:p>"

In the present work, two case studies with their networks of two different sizes are designed using the Critical Path Method (CPM). The pipe diameters thus obtained in CPM are optimized using two optimization techniques, viz. linear programming (LP) and recently developed Jaya Algorithm (JA). JA is a relatively new optimization technique requiring minimum input parameters and are selected based on sensitivity analysis. The comparison of the results using LP and JA exhibits significant reduction in cost of IPDN using newly developed JA. The scope of reduction in the total cost using JA increases with increase in the network area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most important factors in the development of chronic haemorrhoids today are considered to be the combination of two factors (vascular and mechanical) that lead to the development of hemorrhoids. The underlying vascular factor is the vascular dysfunction, providing arterial blood flow through the arteries to the cavernous bodies and outflow through the cavernous veins, which leads to dilation of cavernous bodies and the formation of vascular malformations.There were performed clinical examination and treatment of 140 patients with chronic hemorrhoids of stage III-IV according to Goligher. The features of arterial blood supply of the anal canal were evaluated by transrectal ultrasound examination.It was found that there was no clear linear relationship between the number of anal arteries with increased blood flow and the number of hemorrhoidal nodes in the patient. Each node was supplied with blood from one or two arteries: the node placed at 11 o'clock had blood supply from the arteries visualized at 10 and 11 o'clock, the node at 3 o'clock - arteries at 3 and 5 o'clock, the node at 7 o'clock - arteries at 7 and 9 o'clock. The arteries were most frequently visualized at the first (89.4%), the third (93.3%), the seventh (88.8%) and the eleventh (93.4%) hours. With less frequency the hemodynamically significant arteries were visualized at the fifth (65.0%), the ninth (62.8%) and the tenth (66.7%) hours. The arteries that were suppliing blood hemorrhoidal vessels were located in the internal sphincter at a depth of 5 to 10 mm. In the area of 3, 7 and 11 hours, they overlapped with a mosaic pattern that corresponded to the localization of the cavernous body and resembled an arteriovenous fistula according to the СDS.</jats:p>"

It corresponds to the human physiology as much as possible, creates comfortable conditions at a lower temperature of the internal air, reduces the rise of dust by reducing convective flows, allows the use of low-grade heat carriers, especially from secondary and renewable energy resources, does not take up space in the room, minimally affects the interior. However, the temperature of the heating elements is significantly higher than the room temperature. At the same time, the requirements for thermal insulation under the heating elements should be higher than for structures without heating. As the analysis of the regulations in force in Poland has shown, this is not always observed. In many cases, the heat transfer resistance is lower by 42-181 %. The percentage difference in requirements for flooers over aisles in rooms with an air temperature of 16 °C and above is 160%. It will reach 215 %, according to the requirements that will be applied from 2021. In the case of floors over unheated rooms, the percentage difference between the requirements reaches 181 %. By the new norms in 2021, this difference will reach 215 %. Also, the normative limitation on the temperature of the floor surface does not always allow providing the normative level of comfort. In rooms of categories A and B, the surface temperature of the floor must be 20-28 °C. In the case of category C it should not exceed 30 °C. The most favorable conditions are achieved when the floor surface temperature is close to 23.5 °C. PN-EN 1264-4 standard allows the temperature of the floor surface in some rooms up to 33...35 °C. Thus, to ensure energy efficiency and comfort, it is necessary to harmonize the regulations with each other.</jats:p>"

The main aim of the supply chain management process is to provide the valuable business services, infrastructure, logistic control and inventory control to the business for improving the business. Among the various supply chain factors, inventory control is one of the difficult tasks in supply chain management process because of high cost inventory, consistent stockouts, low rate of inventory turnover, high value of obsolete inventory, maximum working capital, huge cost for storage and lot customers. Then, several supply chain management techniques are introduced in traditional to control the inventory process but they are failing to detect with greatest accuracy due to the low convergence rate in computation techniques. So, in this paper introduce the effective and optimized neural network computational approach for managing the inventory control. In addition to this, the system ability to select the product based on the few factors that improve the inventory control system accuracy. Then the excellence of the system is evaluated using experimental analysis and respective performance metrics.</jats:p>"

Ancak, arazi kullanımının ve iklim değişikliklerinin olumsuz etkileri, ülkenin bazı bölgelerinde su sıkıntısı hatta su kıtlığı ile sonuçlanmıştır. Bu çalışma, Türkiye'nin son 25 yıldır evsel su temini ve su kullanım örüntülerinin mekânsal ve zamansal değerlendirmesine odaklanmaktadır. Ulusal evsel su istatistikleri ve belediye su istatistikleri TÜİK'ten alındı ve coğrafi perspektifle değerlendirildi. Türkiye'de çekilen su miktarı artmakta; baraj, kuyu ve pınarlar ana su sağlama kaynaklarını oluşturmaktadır. Son yıllarda nehirlerden su çekilme oranı artmaktadır. Evsel kullanım için yüzey sularına bağımlılık, özellikle metropol alanlarda artma eğilimindedir. Barajların iklim değişikliği ile birlikte değişen yağış desenleri ve artan buharlaşma bakımından kırılganlığı düşünüldüğünde, gelecekte su güvenliği açısından pek çok risk ortaya çıkabilir. Su ve diğer suyla ilgili hizmetleri sürdürmek için, belediyeler su kullanım verimliliği yaklaşımlarını benimsemelidir.</jats:p>"

With the time, the information systems have become more crucial, with multiple problems affecting the supply chain and the continuous writing of performance areas. The principle of chain management aims at chain values. The working of chain management states that chain management enhances the value of the chain by establishing operational units. Traditional manufacturing supply chains bear a lot from additional, costs, delays and information loss due to information middleware’s. Therefore, we propose a blockchain oriented supply chain architecture to reduce intrusion in traditional ones. Current approaches to private-key security include signature schemes based on bio-metrics, index-hidden private key design, and post-quantum block chain schemes. Nevertheless, recovering the lost private key is difficult in all approaches.

This study aims to validate and further develop, through its practical application, a baseline SOI practices framework, which can be used as a benchmark model. While applying and validating this framework, several new, conceptually distinctive SOI practices were identified that were not included in the proposed baseline model. This led the authors to propose expanding the initial baseline model with a new category of “transversal” SOI practices, so that the expanded model provides a more comprehensive view of the mechanisms that foster innovation at SSCs. These “transversal” SOI practices are highly contingent on the adopting company’s traits and strategy, thus suggesting that they might be a major conduit through which its strategy is reflected in its SSCM. Besides their transversal and contingent nature, another key trait of the identified SOI practices is their integrated, dynamic, time-dependent, feedback-loop-based interrelationship. These findings suggest the potential effectiveness, for processes such as sustainability innovation that involve substantial time lags, to reposition top management focus and performance evaluation “upstream” in the causal chain. This potentially promising approach involves shifting focus from results (particularly short-term results) to its causes (processes, methods), and systematically managing the ensuing feedback loops.</jats:p>"

The equation describing the problem is a partial differential parabolic equation of second order. This equation requires knowledge of the initial and boundary conditions as well as the various soil parameters. The above auxiliary conditions are subject to different kinds of uncertainty due to human and machine imprecision and create ambiguities for the solution of the problem, and a fuzzy method is introduced. Since the physical problem refers to a partial differential equation, the generalized Hukuhara (gH) derivative is used, as well as the extension of this theory regarding partial derivatives. The objective of this paper is to compare the fuzzy numerical and analytical results, for two different cases of the physical problem of an aquifer's unsteady flow, in order to prove the reliability and efficiency of the proposed fuzzy numerical scheme (fuzzy Crank–Nicolson scheme). The comparison of the methods is based on the transformed Haussdorff metric, which shows that the distances between the analytical and numerical results tend to zero.</jats:p>",

In as much as the mining industry contributes hugely to economic and social growth, its operations are characterized by complex supply chain processes that are relatively capital and cost intensive, and technologically sophisticated to manage. Unfortunately, firms in the mining industry especially for developing countries tend to focus more on procuring modernized equipment and technologies to carry out the complex processes of mining operations to the detriment of applying logistics optimization models.&#x0D;\nThis research project therefore seeks to analyze the logistics and supply chain operations of mining companies in Ghana, identify the challenges and inefficiencies associated with these operations and their underlying causes, and recommend logistics and supply chain management design, modelling and analysis tools to optimize. With the help of secondary data collected from books, journals, which were further depicted in graphs and tables, the Microsoft Excel Solvers for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP, Version 3.42), with an embedded Bing Map Key License was used to illustrate and derive optimal solutions for the transportation efficiency of mining firms in Ghana.&#x0D;\nThe study revealed that the mining industry in Ghana is confronted with supply chain issues like poor road networks in mining communities, variable lead time and exchange rate, strict governmental laws, violent clashes over land royalties, high transport cost due to bad roads, unreliable lead times (caused by port delays), unavailability of local suppliers of international standards, and policy restrictions as the main challenges to supply chain. Clearly, the policy implication emanating from this study is that mining firms in partnership with transport services firms in Ghana must adopt an efficient service delivery and optimal transportation cost reduction strategies, which is designed with the Vehicle Routing Problem Optimization Model in order to benefit mutually in gaining competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Sometimes, a lengthy recovery period is needed for supply chains to return to regular operation after being disrupted. During the recovery time window, how to increase the performance of supply chains is not sufficiently studied. Furthermore, the works considering parameter uncertainty arising from the lack of historical data are also limited. To address these problems, we formulate the recovery scheduling of supply chains under major disruption as mixed-integer linear programming models. In the presented models, outsourcing strategy and capacity expansion strategy are introduced to increase the service level of the supply chain after the disruption. The effects of disruption risks on supply chain performance are quantified using uncertainty theory in the absence of historical data. A set of computational examples illustrate that cost may increase markedly when more facilities are disrupted simultaneously. Thus, decision-makers have to pay close attention to supply chain disruption management and plan for disruption in advance. Moreover, the results suggest that outsourcing strategy is more useful to reduce cost when a higher service level is required.</jats:p>",

There is still a certain number of consumers without meters, where the determination of the volume of gas consumed is based on approximate indicators. In addition, most consumers do not have correctors for gas pressure and temperature on the meters, which makes it impossible to accurately determine the amount of gas reduced to standard conditions. The quality of natural gas is also not enough. The way out of this situation is the implementation of an intelligent energy metering system for calculating the consumed natural gas. In addition to controlling the technological parameters of natural gas, it is necessary to determine the composition of natural gas and its energy value on existing gas control point. The analysis of gas composition in the place of its extraction is carried out, the data of the gas transmission system operator and the experimental data received at research of properties of gas in Institute of Gas of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine are considered. Significant discrepancies have been obtained, which confirms the fact of a significant change in both the composition of the gas and its energy value during selection at different points of the gas network. Given global trends, the single energy market, Ukraine's course into European structures, the transition of gas metering to energy units is extremely important. The scheme of improvement the process of dispatching of natural gas metering for measurement of its quantity in units of energy is developed. This scheme provides for the metering of gas from the place of its production to the consumer in energy units.

Pumping systems are responsible for a significant portion of the total electrical energy use. Significant opportunities exist to reduce the pumping energy through smart design, retrofitting, and operating practices. Today, considering the increase in pumping energy prices in water conveyance systems, the problem of optimal operation of pumping stations is very actual. The optimal operation of pumping stations was determined using a Genetic Algorithm Optimization (GAO) to achieve the minimum energy cost. The paper presents a novel management model for the optimal design and operation of water pumping systems on a real case study for the town of Gonabad in Iran. To achieve this goal, three days in a year were selected randomly. The results indicate that the proposed mode in conjunction with a GAO is a versatile management model for the design and operation of the real pumping station. Modeling results show that optimization with a GAO reduces power consumption by about 15–20%.</jats:p>"

In this study, spatial variations are obtained by placing observation wells in the downstream zone. Temporal variations in contaminant concentration has been simulated during the study period. Generally, simulations are carried out using various numerical models, which are subject to the availability of all required input parameters and are necessary for the proper management of contaminated aquifers. In previous publications, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are prescribed in such situations as these modeling methods focus on available input/output datasets, thus resolving the concern of obtaining all inputs that a numerical simulator usually demands. Past studies have predicted groundwater breakthrough contaminants. But the effects of input/output variations need to be discussed. This study aims to quantify the effects of a few input/output datasets in the performance of ANN models to simulate pollutant transport in groundwater systems. The combinations of input/output scenarios have rendered these ANN models sensitive to variations, thus affecting model efficiency. These outcomes can reliably be employed for contaminant estimation and provide a paradigm in data collection that will help hydrogeologists to develop more efficient prediction models.</jats:p>",

We described the supply and demand of vaccines, and compared the ratio of vaccine supply and demand of each vaccine to illustrate the shortage of vaccines and the need of vaccine stockpiles in China.\nMethods\n\nWe downloaded the manufacturers supplying vaccines and the vaccination requirements for the national immunization program for children from 2016 to 2019 in the National Immunization Program Information system, as well as the batch issue data of biological products from the official website of China Academy of Food and Drug Control (CFDA). Vaccine prices were obtained from Chinese Central Government Procurement (CCGP).The demand, supply, and the ratio of vaccine supply and demand of each vaccine were calculated respectively.\nResults\n\nOn average, five out of ten vaccines were supplied by three or more enterprises, three kinds of vaccines were supplied by two enterprises and two kinds of vaccines were supplied only by one enterprise between 2016 to 2019. The ratio of vaccine supply and demand of Diphtheria-tetanus and Group A meningitis polysaccharide were 79.52% and 67.99% respectively, with a potential shortage. There were three vaccines with a supply-demand ratio below 80% in 2016–2018, and five in 2019. The number of potential vaccine shortage was increasing. The average price of vaccines with potential shortage was $ 0.28. The average price of other vaccines without shortage was $ 1.8.\nConclusions\n\nMost vaccines used in the childhood immunization program are available to meet demand, but there are also some vaccines with the risk of shortage and the number of vaccines with the risk of shortage tends to increase. The next step is to develop a national stockpiling mechanism to avoid a shortage of vaccines.</jats:p>"

Decentralization of these systems may be an effective solution. Known techniques for distribution network sectorization design can help to achieve such a goal, but this has not been recognized in the literature. None of those known techniques considers the conversion of a centralized system to a decentralized one. In this paper, two new distinct yet complementary methodologies for water supply system decentralization by distribution network sectorization are proposed and implemented in a software decision support tool freely available on internet. The first methodology identifies the main flow paths from water sources to some strategic nodes and considers the nodes in these paths as new potential sources for dividing the rest of the network. The second methodology sectorizes the network according to the contribution of sources to the consumption at nodes, based on mass balance equations for the transport of a hypothetical conservative constituent in a steady state. Both methods were applied to two real network models. The results obtained were better, for decentralizing the supply, compared to those obtained by other methodologies proposed in the literature.</jats:p>"

Ensuring the shortest travel distance between involved locations plays an important role in achieving the company’s/industry’s objective as (i) the cost of a final product can be minimized by minimizing the total distance travelled (ii) finding the shortest distance between involved locations will require less fuel than the longest distance between involved locations. This will eventually result in lesser degradation of the environment. Hence, in the last few years, various algorithms have been proposed to solve different types of shortest path problems. A recently proposed algorithm for solving interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy shortest path problems requires excessive computational efforts. Hence, to reduce the computational efforts, in this paper, firstly, an alternative lexicographic method is proposed for comparing interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. Then, using the proposed lexicographic comparing method, a new approach (named as Mehar approach) is proposed to solve interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy shortest path problems.

The purpose of the work is to optimize the air environment by an example of the winter garden in Kiev National University of Construction and Architecture using phytodesign by phytoncidal plants. Objectives of the work: to examine the assortment of plants in the winter garden; to assess whether the number of plants is sufficient for sanitation of the air environment of the premises with an area of ​​930 m2; analyze the shortcomings of the range of phytoncidal plants; to develop proposals for the phytodesign of a winter garden to improve the quality of the air environment. It was found that the existing number of phytoncidal plants (18 pieces) for effective sanitation of the air in the investigated room is insufficient. Their decorative effect is reduced due to some disadvantages of care. It’s one of the reasons for a decrease in the growth of vegetative mass and the production of phytoncides. For effective air sanitation of the area of the investigated room, 310 specimens of large-sized phytoncidal plants are required. To expand the assortment, the following phytoncidal species are offered: Aglaonema, Anthúrium Aspidistra elatior, Begonia Chlorophytum, Dracena marginata, Ficus benjamina Wiandi, Hedera, Kalanchoe, Nolina, Philodendron, Spatifillum, Scindapsus, Sansevieria, Eucevieriaceae, plants of the families Euphorbiaceae, Orchidáceae, Bromeliaceae.

The capital costs and operating expenses of pipeline systems are so large that even small improvements in the use of the system can involve large sums of money. Purpose. This article proposes a method to improve the reliability and optimization of power supply systems for compressor stations. The novelty of the proposed work is the development of a new mathematical model that allows the choice of the most appropriate maintenance policies in the best way to significantly reduce costs as well as to optimize useful key performance indicators – failure rate, average time between breakdowns, the average repair time for equipment in compressor station electrical supply systems. Applying graph theory to represent this mathematical model from the schematic diagram of the different energy sources with respect to the five compressor stations is adequate. Methods. The problem that arises for the future operator or operator is, among others, how to balance two main aspects: a technical aspect and an economic aspect. The proposed methodology introduces a research algorithm to calculate the optimal values of the operating parameters of the power supply systems of compressor stations by combining technical and economic aspects in order to reduce costs and increase performance indicators. The proposed algorithm can be implemented in FORTRAN code. Results. The algorithm developed is an efficient tool for calculating maintenance costs and allows by means of programming to define the most appropriate maintenance policy. On the other hand, this technique could be used as an essential economic evaluation indicator for other equipment in order to choose among all the technically possible solutions the one which allow obtaining the best economic result. Practical value. The proposed algorithm has been examined in this third variant of the supply system with two turbogenerators. The result of the optimization shows a clear preference for selecting station C for the pipeline as this presents the minimum cost which is the definition of the algorithm optimizer. Then, it is important to adopt the most recommended maintenance policies and practices in order to ensure the availability of the power supply systems and to avoid unplanned outages with the resulting loss of production.</jats:p>"

One of the most challenging areas faced by logistics and project managers is determining the appropriate level of supply chain inventory management when implementing projects. Today, there is a demand for the development and implementation of dynamic supply chains, the essence of which is to increase the service level by increasing the speed of response to customer requests and flexibility in excess components (high stock levels, unbalanced duration of supply cycles), taking into account the uncertainty of demand.The analysis of the justification of the value of the supply chain, namely of such components as logistics costs, the cost of storing inventories and deficit costs, is carried out. Models of inventory management in the supply chain with centralized and decentralized service are presented. Calculations of the indicators of the standard deviation of demand and the duration of the supply cycle, the values of the cyclic and safety stock are presented. For the situation of centralized service of the resource flow, the influence of the demand dependence on the stock level was investigated.The study used the theory of supply chain management and project management, which made it possible to take into account the variability of demand and the duration of supply. As a result of the work, models of the volume of insurance stocks in conditions of uncertainty in demand and the duration of the supply cycle of resources are proposed. In order to ensure the optimal strategy of resource provision, the concept of «service level» was investigated. The service level of the first kind (cyclical service level) and the service level of the second kind (saturated demand) are considered.The results of this research provide an opportunity to improve project efficiency in the face of volatile demand, reduced product life cycle and increased competition. Such changes require supply chains to develop strategies that are focused on the end user, that is, an integrated supply chain management strategy is required.</jats:p>"

Besides, there were two attributes of economic ODTWASG that have not been managed optimally. Thus, it has not contributed to customer satisfaction, which were food and beverages prices at the food court as well as water tourism object entrance fee. Therefore, ODTWASG supply optimization could focus on these two economic attributes; first, setting and adjusting the attribute of food and beverages prices, and second, improving water tourism quality.  &#x0D;\nKey words: Importance Performance Analysis (IPA), satisfaction, supply and demand </jats:p>"

In particular, the manufacturing industry experienced a slowdown due to the sudden disruption in supply and demand. This situation stimulates the manufacturing industry to recover from this current challenging disruption. This study investigates the impact of supply chain integration on business performance through supply chain resilience, supply chain flexibility, and innovation system in Indonesia’s manufacturing companies. Data collection has obtained as many as 470 questionnaires considered valid for further analysis. Data analysis used the partial least square (PLS) technique using smartPLS software version 3.0. The results show that supply chain integration affects innovation system, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience because of its ability to share complete product information and share production planning. Innovation systems and supply chain flexibility enhance supply chain resilience through the ability to deal with sudden changes in customer demand and production problems. Supply chain integration improves business performance through innovation, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience in the COVID-19 era. This research could be the best practice for managers in restoring manufacturing performance quickly. This study also contributes to the current research in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This is also counterproductive to the visibility of the supply chain within the company and can adversely affect the organization’s core business. This paper attempts to evaluate how organizations can benefit from introducing Digital Twins to enhance their logistics supply network visibility. Additionally, deployment issues and technologies supporting Digital Twins were reviewed. This study used ATLAS.ti 9 software tools to save, classify, and evaluate the data for this analysis to systematically review the literature. We reviewed, compiled, and sorted papers from 227 publications for this article and then recognized 104 as critical to the work scope; this analysis’ quest date was set from 2002 to 2021. This article represents the first attempt at dealing with the issue of supply chain visibility through the Digital Twins in the logistics field. The research outcomes found that Digital Twins would help companies develop predictive metrics, diagnostics, projections, and physical asset descriptions for their logistics. This study also suggested some steps to overcome the challenges in implementing a Digital Twins in the logistics industry. For researchers, this review offers the possibility to unify and expand existing solutions and to identify links and interfaces that are still needed. As for managerial implications, this study can be used to identify future strategies and technologies to fulfil certain logistics tasks and develop new technological solutions for current and future demands.</jats:p>"

Therefore, researchers are consistently developing and improving various predictive/forecasting techniques to accurately represent a river's attributes, even though traditional methods are available. This paper presents the Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) modelling technique to accurately model the stage–discharge relationship for the Arouca River in Trinidad and Tobago using only low flow data. The proposed method uses the stage and associated discharge measurements at one cross-section of the Arouca River. These measurements were used to train the GEP model. The results of the GEP model were also compared to the traditional method of the Stage–Discharge Rating Curve (SRC). Four statistical paraments namely the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the GEP model and the SRC method. Overall, the GEP model performed exceptionally well with an R2 of 0.990, RMSE of 0.104, MARE of 0.076 and NSE of 0.957.</jats:p>",

During COVID-19 pandemic, the demand of medical supplies and essential products increases unexpectedly while the availability of recourses and raw materials decreases significantly. As such, the questions of SC and society survivability were raised. Responding to this urgent demand quickly and predicting how it will vary as the pandemic progresses is a key modeling question. In this research, we take the initiative in addressing the impact of COVID-19 disruption on manufacturing SC performance overwhelmed by the unprecedented demands of urgent items by developing a digital twin model for the manufacturing SC. In this model, we combine system dynamic simulation and artificial intelligence to dynamically monitor SC performance and predict SC reaction patterns. The simulation modeling is used to study the disruption propagation in the manufacturing SC and the efficiency of the recovery policy. Then based on this model, we develop artificial neural network models to learn from disruptions and make an online prediction of potential risks. The developed digital twin model is aimed to operate in real-time for early identification of disruptions and the respective SC reaction patterns to increase SC visibility and resilience.</jats:p>"

This supply chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility levels (i.e., 65.68% and 92.8% for IM compared to 58.70% and 75.35% for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h and €0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and €30,000 for IM, respectively). This work will allow decision-makers to take timely decisions by providing useful information on the effect of AM adoption on supply chain flexibility in different sudden disruption scenarios such as demand uncertainty, demand variability, lead-time compression and product variety.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In this study a multi-objective formulation is proposed for designing a supply chain of perishable products including suppliers, plants, distributors, and customers under sustainable development. In addition to the studies of the literature, direct shipment between producers and customers and also alternative products possibility are allowed. In this problem the objectives like facilities establishment costs, transportation costs, negative environmental impacts, and social impact (fixed and variable employment rates) are optimized simultaneously. As in real situations, most of the transportation activities of such supply chain are performed by hiring transportation devices, the open routing logic is applied to form the travelling path of each hired transportation device. Furthermore, the possibility of direct shipment from the plants to the customers is considered in order to increase profitability of the plants. Because of the NP-hard nature of the supply chain design problems, some meta-heuristic solution approaches of the literature are modified to multi-objective form and applied to solve the problem. Several test problems from small to large sizes are generated randomly to evaluate the meta-heuristic algorithms. As a result, among the proposed algorithms, the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MGWO) perform better than others by considering four well-known evaluation metrics. At the end, a case study from perishable products supply chain of Iran is solved and analyzed to show the applicability of the proposed problem.</jats:p>"

The sensitivity analysis of transportation delay time and manufacturer’s production cycle shows that extending transportation time can reduce manufacturer’s inventory, but raw material inventory in transit will increase; Shortening the production cycle of producers under the information sharing environment is more conducive to reducing the bullwhip effect of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Productivity improvement should not only focus on economic efficiency but also the environmental impact called the principle of green productivity. This paper aimed to discuss the potential implementation of green productivity improvement activities and determine the level of green productivity that has been achieved in the supply chain of the sugar industry. The analysis began with supply chain configuration analysis, analysis of seven waste sources with Green Value Stream Mapping (GVSM), and inference of the green productivity level with Fuzzy rule-based. The results of the supply chain analysis show that two activities required to be analyzed for productivity, namely the sugarcane cultivation and the sugar milling processing division. The green productivity index in the current state of plantation supply chain activity was 0.90 and processing was 0.61. Green productivity improvement with good housekeeping and efficiency resulted in a GPI of 1.81 for plantation supply chain activities and 2.30 for processing. The fuzzy inference shows an increase in green productivity in the supply chain processing activities from a bad label to normal.</jats:p>",

In this study, the capability of Support Vector Machine and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine as kernel-based approaches and Gene Expression Programming method was assessed in breached dam peak outflow prediction. Two types of modeling were considered. First, only dam reservoir height and volume at the failure time were used as the input combinations (state 1). Then, soil characteristics were added to input combinations to investigate particularly the impact of soil characteristics (state 2). Results showed that the use of only soil characteristics did not lead to a desired accuracy; however, adding soil characteristics to input combinations (state 2) improved the models' accuracy up to 40%. The outcome of the applied models was also compared with existing empirical equations and it was found the applied models yielded better results. Sensitivity analysis results showed that dam height had the most important role in the peak outflow prediction, while the strength parameters did not have significant impacts. Furthermore, for assessing the best-applied model dependability, uncertainty analysis was used and the results indicated that the SVM model had an allowable degree of uncertainty in peak outflow modelling.</jats:p>",

This makes it vital to understand how these policies affect retirement decisions. In this paper, I revisit the labor supply effects of a major Australian reform that increased women’s pension age from 60 to 65. Atalay and Barrett (2015) studied these effects using repeated household surveys and a differences-in-differences design in which male cohorts form the comparison group. They estimate that the reform increased female labor force participation by 12 percentage points. Using earlier data, I show that the parallel-trends assumption did not hold before the reform because of a strong female-specific trend in participation rates across the relevant cohorts. Accounting for this trend, the estimated effect on female participation falls by two-thirds and becomes statistically insignificant at conventional levels. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing and controlling for trends across cohorts when evaluating pension reforms, which are typically phased in across cohorts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The requisite of direct-on-line (DOL) starting for various applications in underground mines subjects the rotor bars of heavy-duty squirrel cage induction motors (SCIMs) to severe stresses, resulting in sustained fault in the rotor bars, unlike the applications where mostly reduced voltage starting is preferred. Furthermore, SCIMs working in underground mines are also affected by unforeseen frequency fluctuations. Hence, the paper proposes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based broken rotor bar detection scheme using the stator current analysis of SCIM when subjected to a frequency regulation (±4% of 50 Hz supply) in steady-state, as prevalent in underground mines. In this regard, the level-seven detailed coefficient obtained by the DWT-based multi-resolution analysis of stator current corresponding to the healthy rotor is compared with that of the faulty rotor to extract the necessary features to identify the fault. Further implementation of the proposed scheme is done using artificial neural network (ANN)-based pattern recognition techniques, wherein both feed-forward backdrops and cascaded forward backdrop type ANNs have been used for fault pinpointing based on the feature extraction results obtained from DWT. The scheme is developed and analysed in MATLAB/Simulink using 5.5 kW, 415 V, 50 Hz SCIM, which is further validated using the LabVIEW-based real-time implementation.</jats:p>"

A large-scale pandemic such as COVID-19 can cause an overwhelming demand for urgent medical supplies on very short notice. Well-established supply chain planning and modeling are necessary to avoid any national level or company health supply chain problems resulting from demand shortages. This paper addresses the issues from a supply chain perspective. The need to be prepared for any surge in demand is addressed in terms of emergency inventories, including those of Work-in-Process and finished goods. Linear Programming models are developed to minimize the costs of production, inventories, and transportation of goods from one stage to the next stage.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an essential and highly significant remote measurement widely used in agriculture for phenological monitoring and crop health (Ray and Dadhwal, 2001).&#x0D;\nIn this work, we present a methodology for the contribution of NDVI from Landsat 7 (TM)  and (ETM+) images to crop mapping in the Gharb region using a classification based on the pixel approach and estimating rice crop coefficient from NDVI.&#x0D;\nThe classification results concern six main types of crops planted in this region (beet, maize, sugar cane, market gardening, cereals, and rice). The classification map showed differences in agricultural practices adopted by farmers in crop spatial distribution. The classification results showed the ability of this methodology to discriminate between crops.&#x0D;\nCrop coefficients were deduced from the NDVI extracted from the images. Due to meteorological data collected from the meteorological station TCSC of SK Tlet, the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration was made and subsequently the potential evapotranspiration of each crop during the agricultural season 2019-2020.&#x0D;\nThe highest values for ETC were obtained when the crop was in its full development when water was mainly lost through transpiration after a slight decrease in the ratio values observed during the phase of the  vegetative cycle (maturity).&#x0D;\nThe water requirements (daily, monthly and annual) for the crops were determined and their electrical energy consumption.&#x0D;\nRenewable energy can be an effective solution to meet the energy needs of plots , greenhouses and large farms.&#x0D;\nA technical-economic study of different combinations of autonomous hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) in order to meet the power supply needs of the above mentioned crops in the Gharb region. The renewable energy sources considered are solar, wind and biomass. The results show that for an average energy requirement of 92 kWh/day and a peak load of 6.5 kW, the unit energy cost of the optimal configuration scenario A (PV-wind-biomass-battery) is 0.19 $/kWh. Therefore, the design, development and implementation of the proposed system is a promising solution for the security of energy supply. For a 100% integration of renewable energy, the HRES produces electricity according to the following distribution: 11% from wind, 41% from solar and 48% from biomass.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing demand for cassava and its products has continued to stretch the supply of cassava globally. Nigeria is a leading producer of cassava in the world yet, there are concerns that if appropriate policy strategies are not adopted to increase production, the current fragile situation of food insecurity in Nigeria may be worsened. Besides the increasing number of gigantic cassava-based industries spring up in Nigeria, the rapidly growing population of consumers is another factor that may further disrupt the relatively stable cassava market in Nigeria in the future. Therefore, “ceteris paribus”, the study determined the appropriate quantitative models to forecast the trends in cassava production indictors in Nigeria. Using the historical series (1961 – 2018), 12-year period (2019 -2030) forecasts were made for each of the production indicators as follows: 106 million tonnes (production output), 7.7 tonnes/ha (yield) and 9.6 million hectares (cropped area) in 2030. The study extrapolated the expected food supply from the expected production output in the forecast period using the 2014 FAO estimates of food supply per caput. Thus, in 2030, cassava food supply per caput was found to decline from 267 Kcal/capita/day in 2014 to 239 Kcal/capita/day. The study concludes that despite keeping the future demand of the growing cassava-based industries constant, cassava production is expected to continually increase but future food supply per caput would decline. However, the growing cassava-based industries globally is expected to hugely influence the future cassava market dynamics.</jats:p>"

This research optimizes the supply chain of ready mix concrete based on real-time data from a batching plant in Surabaya by using the metaheuristic method. The metaheuristic method used in this research are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS), and also compares the performance of both metaheuristic algorithms, because both algorithms have proven effective in solving various optimization problems.  The objective function of this research is to minimize the total waiting times of mixer trucks. The results showed that the SOS algorithm has better performance than the PSO algorithm, which gets lower total waiting times of 100,863 hours.</jats:p>"

This study adopts a broader view and investigates their potential to contribute to the achievement of other sustainability objectives. In particular, the paper employs a multi-objective programming (MOP) model, which examines the possibilities of simultaneously achieving four conflicting objectives with the upgrade of an irrigation network in a rural area in Greece. The four objectives are maximization of economic result (economic sustainability) and of employment (social sustainability) as well as the minimization of agrochemical use and irrigation water consumption (environmental sustainability). The compromise is sought through different cropping patterns either by restructuring existing crops (Scenario 1) or by also introducing new crops (Scenario 2). The results show that solutions in Scenario 2 perform much better in all dimensions of sustainability; however, large increases in economic performance and employment come with lower environmental gains. A cost-benefit analysis shows that very few solutions yield positive Net Present Value and the investment could be halted if benefits relating to social and environmental sustainability are disregarded. Results are discussed in conjunction with the proposal of a new governance scheme, which could assume broader roles in supporting sustainable development.</jats:p>",

To provide an outlook on the variation in potato supplies and market prices under changing climatic factors (temperature, rainfall, and solar-radiation), the yield, area, import, and demand functions were assessed using district-level time-series data of Bangladesh (1988–2013), disaggregated into seven climatic zones. Results suggest that temperatures above or below the optimal range (18–22 °C) lowered yields. Little rainfall and low solar radiation hinder potato cultivation areas during the potato maturity stage. During the simulated period, the annual production was projected to rise from 88 to 111 million metric tons (MT), with an equilibrium farm price of 155 to 215 US dollars MT−1. Between 2014 and 2030, the nation’s per-capita potato intake is expected to increase from 49 to 55 kg year−1 because of changing dietary patterns. According to the estimated equilibrator, scenario simulations that incorporated various dimensions of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios indicate that potato production and consumption can increase in the future.</jats:p>"

Data collection, data exchange, and connection throughout the wood supply chain have become increasingly important. There exist many technologies for the implementation of Industry 4.0 applications in forestry. For example, the integration of harvester production data throughout the wood supply chain seems to have strong optimization potential but it is faced with several challenges due to the high number of stakeholders involved. Therefore, the objective of this article is to analyze the legal, social, and economic conditions surrounding the integration of harvester production data integration in Germany. For analysis of the legal and economic conditions, a narrative literature analysis was performed with special consideration of the relevant German and European legal references. For determination of the social conditions, a qualitative content analysis of 27 expert interviews was performed. Results showed that legal ownership of harvester production data cannot be clearly defined in Germany, but there exist several protection rights against misuse, which can define an ownership-similar data sovereignty. Furthermore, harvester data use can be restricted in the case where personal data are traceable, based on European data protection law. From a social perspective, the stakeholders interviewed in the study had different opinions on data ownership. Stakeholders require specific criteria on the data (interfaces) and other factors for the acceptance of new structures to allow successful harvester data integration. From an economic perspective, harvester production data are tradeable through varying transaction forms but, generally, there is no accepted and valid formula in existence for calculating the value or price of harvester data. Therefore, the authors advise discussing these issues with key stakeholders to negotiate and agree on data ownership and use in order to find a suitable solution to realize optimization potentials in the German wood supply chain.</jats:p>"

As a main barrier preventing potential consumers from purchasing EVs, the consumer range anxiety for EVs’ performance was incorporated into the analytical model. Three primary cases and one strategic alliance case are sequentially analyzed. The results show that the supplier always self-motivates to implement energy-saving innovation to improve the performance of the core component, and the EV manufacturer is always willing to participate in its supplier’s energy-saving innovation by sharing a fraction of the investment. Moreover, a strategic alliance between the manufacturer and the supplier can effectively improve the profit of the whole supply chain. This strategic alliance can be coordinated through a generalized Nash-bargaining mechanism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is consumer pressure on the US beef cattle industry to minimize antibiotic use (ABU) in order to aid in the global antimicrobial resistance mitigation efforts. Our objective was to estimate the economic costs of ABU constraints in a conceptual US integrated beef supply chain (IBSC) to aid the beef industry in mitigating the ever-increasing risk of antimicrobial resistance, by reducing their ABU. An IBSC network model was developed and differentiated into 37 different nodes of production. Each node could only raise a specific type of animals, differentiated based on the production technique and animal health status. The cost, as well as the weight gain coefficient, was estimated for each node, using an IBSC cost of production model. Linear programming solutions to this network model provided the least cost path of beef supply through the system, under various ABU constraints. The cost as well as weight gain coefficient of the 37 nodes, initial supply of 28.5 million calves weighing 0.65 million metric tons, and final demand of 16.14 million metric tons of slaughter-ready fed cattle were used as inputs/constraints to the three different linear programming scenarios, with different ABU constraints. Our first scenario, which placed no constraint on ABU, estimated that the minimum total economic cost to meet the final beef demand was $38.6 billion. The optimal solution was to use only the high health status calves for beef production. Because low health calves occur in the beef system, our second scenario required all the calves irrespective of their health status to be used, which increased the system cost to $41.5 billion. Thus, the value of only producing high health status calves is $2.9 billion. Our third scenario, which restricted feedlots from using antibiotics even for low health calves, incurred a total cost of $41.9 billion for antibiotic-free beef production. We concluded that the additional cost of $367 million for implementing antibiotic-free beef production is relatively low, ~0.90% of the minimum cost incurred for the conventional beef supply chain (model 2 cost of $41.5 billion). However, a much higher cost savings is obtained by producing only high health status calves.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on inequality and transaction costs in PAMSIMAS (Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation), a water sector program in Indonesia’s rural and peri-urban areas. The method used is a case study of PAMSIMAS in Tajuk, a village adjacent to Mount Merbabu National Park in Semarang Regency, Central Java. The data were gathered from documentary studies, in-depth interviews, and observations, and were analyzed using transaction cost economics and institutional analysis. This study found that the rules of PAMSIMAS, especially water pricing mechanisms, enhanced water availability but could not diminish the uncertainty of water access and transaction costs born by water users. Inequalities of endowment, power, and information among the hamlets affected how PAMSIMAS was run. Mobilization of water resources is related to property rights, which should be well-defined. Still, there was an overlapping property institution of Mount Merbabu National Park forest and its water resources; thus, the water user groups had to bear different transaction costs. The study provides suggestions for providing broader 'rules of the game' in rural water management, recognizing local conditions and prospects, acknowledging community rights to resources, and developing inclusive community participation.JEL Classification D23; P48; Q15</jats:p>"

Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology, and a lot of work is done on the factory level. In this paper, the concept of cognitive digital twins (CDTs) and how they can be deployed in connected and agile supply chains is elaborated. The need for CDTs in the supply chain as well as the main CDT enablers and how they can be deployed under an operational model in agile networks is described. More emphasis is given on the modelling, cognition and governance aspects as well as on how a supply chain can be configured as a network of connected CDTs. Finally, a deployment methodology of the developed model into an example of a circular supply chain is proposed.</jats:p>"

Issues regarding the centralization and amalgamation of the industry, making many regions underserved; recent milk dumping due to a strong shift in demand caused by COVID-19; and the popularity of dairy alternatives, show that the dairy sector in Canada is ill-prepared for major change. Dairy farmers are receiving compensation for trade deals recently ratified by the federal government, creating a precedent that will lead to an overcapitalized industry.

Due to the inadequate capability of government water supply company, it is becoming common for a community to establish their own water supply system. This includes a deep well, high water reservoir, and submersible pump. The pump is normally supplied with power from electricity grid. The extensive availability of sunlight may be used to generate electric power using Solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels for supplying power for the pump. This paper presents the application of Solar PV panels to generate power that contributes power for the pump at the system of clean water provider. A 1000-WP solar panels system is employed to generate the voltage and a 60-A MPPT is used to regulate the voltage for supplying 2 x 150-Ah Li-ion battery. A 3000-W inverter is used to provide AC power for 3-hp 220-V pump. Considering the capacity of Solar PV panels and the continued availability of sunlight, the hybrid supply for the pump is established. This integrates the supply from solar PV and utility grid controlled with Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS). This determines the power supply for the pump either from Solar PV or electricity grid. This system is implemented in the community water supply at Sidomulyo, Krikilan, Sragen. The hybrid strategy enables solar PV to contribute supplying power for the pump and reduce the need of power from utility.</jats:p>",

Based on the resource dependence theory, this paper proposes a mediation model to promote ambidextrous green innovation. The relationship between green innovation strategy and ambidextrous green innovation is discussed, and the mediating role of green supply chain integration is investigated. Based on the questionnaire data from manufacturing companies in three developed economic zones in China, a structural equation model is established to verify our hypotheses. The empirical results show that the green innovation strategy has a positive impact on both exploitative and exploratory green innovation, and the impact on exploratory green innovation is greater than that on exploitative green innovation. Green supply chain integration plays a partial intermediating role in green innovation strategy and ambidextrous green innovation. The implementation of green innovation requires not only internal cross-department integration, but also integration with external supply chain partners such as suppliers and customers. By emphasizing the importance of green innovation strategy in the context of sustainable development, this research helps provide effective strategic directions and required capacity structures for companies to successfully implement green innovation practices, and reduces the uncertainty of green innovation.

If legislators and defense officials wish to consider either approach for short-term or long-term objectives, they should also consider the historical lessons of the financial and information asymmetries between government and industry, and the general uncertainty over how technologies will evolve.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, biofuels have increasingly been used as fuel in Ukraine. Ukraine is an agro-industrial country with great potential for the production and use of pellets of plant origin. Our country ranks 6th in the world for the production of such biofuels as pellets, but most of them (about 85 %) are exported abroad. This is due to the low demand for pellets in the domestic market. Cereal straw can be used in municipal energy. The amount of straw left after harvest is sufficient for its use as fuel. This biofuel in its composition and calorific value is close to such traditional fuels as wood and peat. Also, raw materials for bio-pellets can be sunflower husks and energy crops. The main objectives of this work are experimental studies of the combustion of different types of agropellets. An experimental installation of a solid fuel boiler with a pellet burner was developed and implemented at the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine to study the peculiarities of pellet combustion. With the help of the developed measurement system based on a comb with thermocouples, which is located above the torch in the boiler, the temperature regime in the boiler volume was studied and the peculiarities of the pellet burning process in the burner were determined. As a result of the work, experimental studies of the peculiarities of burning pellets of agricultural origin, namely straw (barley, wheat) and pellets from corn cobs were carried out. On the basis of the constructed graphic dependences the characteristic features of temperature modes of work of a household copper at burning of agropellets were defined. The use of the results is possible in the communal and industrial heat energy, social and budgetary sphere and individual household sector.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increasing reliance on global sourcing and the growth in the likelihood of disruptive incidents, today’s supply networks are more prone to unexpected natural and man-made disruptive events. In order to alleviate the losses caused by these disruptive events, when a large-scale event disrupts multiple suppliers simultaneously, a single or several critical suppliers should be selected from the disrupted ones to assist them to recover their production as soon as possible. The selection of these recovery suppliers is of great importance in the recovery process of the entire supply network. Thus, this paper proposes a recovery supplier selection method from the view of the supply network structure. Firstly, a tripartite graph-based supply model is proposed to depict a two-stage supply network, which consists of multiple manufacturers and suppliers as well as the diverse product supply-demand interdependence connecting them. To measure the impacts caused by supplier disruptions and to evaluate the effectiveness of recovery supplier decisions, two supply network performance metrics reflecting product supply availability are also given. Then, the recovery supplier selection problem is described as a combinatorial optimization problem. To solve this problem, a heuristic algorithm, with enhanced variable neighborhood search (EVNS) is designed based on the general framework of a variable neighborhood search. Finally, experiments based on a real-world supply network are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is applicable and effective.</jats:p>"

This study aims to contribute to this issue, in the competitive context of the tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment centres (DTC), and to describe the spatial distribution of the residence of TB patients and DTC, to understand the DTC attendance’ rate in the city of Douala, Cameroon.\nMethods\n\nThe Spatial analysis was performed to access the spatial-economic model hiding behind the distribution of the “observed” number of patients attending the DTCs compared to the “expected” number. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression and the analysis of variance were used to identify the factors associated to the demand and supply of DTCs respectively.\nResults\n\nThe decentralization policy advocated by the national program against tuberculosis (NTP) is not always followed by the patients: The “expected” and the “observed” number of patients in DTCs are not correlated.  The attendance of DTCs in Douala is in accordance with the spatial-economic theory models of Salop and Hotelling, which is an artefact. Patients seeking treatment in DTCs closer to their residence are mainly women and patients from relative poor households, while attendance of DTC was associated with the quality of service and the level of the HF.\nConclusion\n\nAttendance HF is dictated by the spatial-economic theory models. The policy of creating HF for TB is not followed by patients in competitive context. Attendance of HF by TB patients is associated with socioeconomic factors;</jats:p>"

Slugs may feed on carrion and feces, and they are potential vectors of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. We isolated L. monocytogenes from the pest slug Arion vulgaris and examined the persistence and survival of human- and slug-derived L. monocytogenes in groundwater-based drinking water and biofilms. L. monocytogenes survival was evaluated using cultivation and cultivation-independent techniques. L. monocytogenes remained culturable for 35–47 days in drinking water with first-order decay rates between 0.314 and 0.457 h−1 (T99 ≥10 days). Attachment of L. monocytogenes to filter sand delayed washout from drinking water filters and increased persistence 2–3-fold. Indigenous biofilms stimulated initial surface attachment 10–100-fold but L. monocytogenes declined more rapidly in drinking water biofilms compared with virgin filters not colonized by microorganisms. Grazing by protozoa likely attenuated L. monocytogenes survival in some drinking water biofilms. A comparable survival pattern was observed for L. monocytogenes and the fecal indicator bacterium E. coli. The study suggests that live L. monocytogenes can persist for weeks as sessile organisms in groundwater-based drinking water supplies and may subsequently be released to the drinking water.</jats:p>",

The discharge coefficient (Cd) of weirs, as the key hydraulic parameter, involves the combined effects of the geometric and hydraulic parameters. It is used to compute the flow rate over the weirs. For this purpose, a hybrid ISaDE-SVR method is proposed as a hybrid model to estimate the Cd of sharp-crested W-planform weirs. ISaDE is a high-performance algorithm among other optimization algorithms in estimating the nonlinear parameters in different phenomena. The ISaDE algorithm is used to improve the performance of SVR by finding optimal values for the SVR's parameters. To test and validate the proposed model, the experimental datasets of Kumar et al. and Ghodsian were utilized. Six different input scenarios are presented to estimate the Cd. Based on the modeling results, the proposed hybrid method estimates the Cd in terms of H/P, Lw/Wmc, and Lc/Wc. For the superior method, R2, RMSE, MAPE, and δ are obtained as 0.982, 0.006, 0.612, and 0.843, respectively. The amount of improvement in comparison with GMDH, ANFIS and SVR is 3.6%, 1.2% and 1.5% in terms of R2.</jats:p>",

In addition, hydrogen storage system performs as the long-term storage is considered, which can promote more renewable energy installed in the local consumer side. However, when there are large numbers of grid-connected multi-energy microgrids, the scheduling of these multiple microgrids in real-time is a problem. Because different types of devices, three types of energy, and three types of utility grid networks are considered, which make the dispatching problem difficult. In this paper, a two-stage coordinated algorithm is adopted to operate the microgrids: day-ahead scheduling and real-time dispatching. In order to reduce the time taken to solve the scheduling problem, and improve the scheduling performance, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) is used in real-time operation. Different types of value function approximations (VFA), i.e., linear function, nonlinear function, and neural network are compared to study about the influence of the VFA on the decision results. Offline and online processes are developed to study the impact of the historical data on the regression of VFA. The results show that the neural network based ADP one-step decision algorithm has almost the same performance as the Global optimization algorithm, and the highest performance among all others Local optimization algorithms. The total operation cost relative error is less than 3%, while the running time is only 31% of the Global algorithm. In the neural network based ADP, the key technology is continuously updating the training dataset online, and adopting an appropriate neural network structure, which can at last improve the scheduling performance.</jats:p>"

Risk and value added were optimized by using Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and LINMAP to find an ideal solution of Pareto. A balanced risk and value added was applied to determine an ideal and fair price of supply chain product in each stage stakeholders.

Because retailers are unaware of the third party, the production process becomes obscure and cannot be tracked. In this paper, we present an empirical study of the factors that can lead suppliers to engage in unauthorized subcontracting. We use data provided by a global supply chain manager with more than 30,000 orders, of which 36% were subcontracted without authorization. We find that the frequency of unauthorized subcontracting across factories has a pronounced bimodal distribution. Moreover, the degree of unauthorized subcontracting in the past is highly related to the probability of engaging in unauthorized subcontracting in the future, which suggests that factories behave as if they choose a strategic level of unauthorized subcontracting. At the order level, we find that state dependence (i.e., the status of an order carrying over to the next one) and price pressure are the key drivers of unauthorized subcontracting. Buyer reputation and lead time also play a role. Finally, we show that unauthorized subcontracting can be predicted correctly for more than 80% of the orders in out-of-sample tests and for about 70% of suppliers. This indicates that retailers can use business analytics to predict unauthorized subcontracting and help prevent it.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To ensure optimum peach quality during precooling, air supply temperature within the precooled facility should be precisely controlled. Three-dimensional unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established in this research, taking air supply temperature as an influencing factor, a dynamic simulation of this model was performed based on Fluent, and its reliability was verified through experiments. Simulation results showed that the decrease of air supply temperature did not affect the 7/8ths cooling time (SECT) significantly, but shortened the cooling time of the fruit which was cooled from the initial temperature to a fixed temperature, especially when air supply temperature dropped below 4oC, its corresponding cooling time showed a trend of steady variation. Meanwhile, respiration rate of 6-8 oC was about twice as high as that of 2-4 oC, its corresponding moisture loss was also increased by 34.71-39.74%. Thus, the range of 2-4 oC was more suitable for quick precooling peaches after harvest. Experiments showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7 and 2.7 m·s-1 were 0.747 and 0.836 oC, respectively. It could be seen that simulation results were in good agreement with experimental results, which fully verified the feasibility and high accuracy of this new modeling method. Finally, this study can provide a reliable reference for establishing an accurate precooling numerical model, and rationally optimizing air supply temperature range of fruits precooling experiment to maintain its high quality.</jats:p>",

Providing long-term demand is very likely necessary and sufficient to maintain industry structures. Providing short-term infusions of cash may be necessary to maintain programs, but it is not always sufficient. If legislators and defense officials wish to consider either approach for short-term or long-term objectives, they should also consider the historical lessons of the financial and information asymmetries between government and industry, and the general uncertainty over how technologies will evolve.</jats:p>",

A system dynamics simulation is thus applied to study a cheese supply chain with three individual firms: a producer, a logistics service provider (LSP), and a retailer. Our purpose is to study the effects of SCI strategies with different dimensional focuses, i.e., information integration (Scenario 1), relational integration (Scenario 2), and operational integration (Scenario 3), on the recovery of three types of disruptions, i.e., a producer capacity disruption, an LSP capacity disruption, and a demand disruption. Tests of parameter scenarios are further applied to provide solutions for supply chains using different strategies. Our results indicate that Scenario 3 is the best practice, regardless of any type of disruption, while Scenario 1 usually achieves the worst performance. This is consistent with an evolutionary perspective of supply chain integration: information integration gives firms a competitive advantage as the first step. Working as partners to share the most appropriate information leads to greater benefits. We extend this perspective by showing that further elimination of information delay helps the supply chain achieve the best performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With supply chains becoming increasingly extended, the uncertainties in the upstream production process can greatly affect the material flows that aim toward meeting the uncertain demands at the downstream. We analyze a two‐location system in which the upstream production facility experiences random capacities and the downstream store faces random demands. Different from the widely used approach that seeks the decomposition of the profit function based on the echelon inventories, our approach builds on the notions of stochastic functions, in particular, the stochastic linearity in midpoint and the directionally concave order. With these notions, we establish the concavity and submodularity of the profit functions in the transformed decision variables. In general, it is optimal to follow a two‐level state‐dependent threshold policy such that an order is issued at a location if and only if the inventory position of that location is below the corresponding threshold. In the special case where the salvage values are linear in the ending inventories, the profit function becomes separable in the inventory positions, and the optimal policy reduces to the echelon base‐stock policy. The effect of the uncertain capacity and demand depends critically on whether the production capacity is limited or ample in relation to the demand. Only when the capacity and the demand do not differ much, the upstream facility carries positive inventory; otherwise, all units produced are shipped immediately toward the downstream. We further extend our analysis to systems with general stochastic production functions and with multiple locations. </jats:p>",

In fact, the aim of this paper is to classify and prioritize SDPs according to their priority for better risk management and effective SC performance. The proposed approach comprises two phases. First, 14 SDPs are identified and selected from the literature. Second, MICMAC (Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée à un classement) method as a structural analysis method applies to identify and assess sustainable supply chain risk management (SSCRM) practices which reduce risk in the SC. The input data for each phase are based on Delphi technique, which is a process group used to collect the opinions of experts in the field. The aim of the proposed approach is to prioritize SSCRM practices and classify them into influential, non-influential, independent and dependent practices and their mutual relationships. The six key findings SSCRM practices from direct and indirect classification include the following elements: (1) Delayed differentiation, (2) Information sharing with upstream and/or downstream partners, (3) Simplification of product dismantling/anticipation of product end of life, (4) Supplier/subcontractor’s performance assessment, (5) establishing shared supply management and (6) establishment of contracts with transporters.</jats:p>"

The Cyprus agri-sector faces increasing challenges since water resources are very limited and particularly susceptible to climate change. As total profit highly depends on cultivation patterns, the present study aims to define the optimal pattern of agricultural crops in Cyprus. A linear programming model is set up to maximize the net profit of annual and permanent crops. As for the constraints, these include limitations on land and water availability under four different scenarios, provided that production secures current consumption of (1) domestic products, (2) domestic and imported products, (3) domestic products but under a 40% decrease in water availability and (4) domestic products but limited to only traditional, tropical and subtropical crops, under a 40% decrease in water availability. The results indicate that when using an optimal cultivation pattern, economic benefit increases by 120%, 62%, 20%, and 48%, based on Scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, the results are considered useful and directly applicable for policy makers to redesign their strategy in light of water scarcity.</jats:p>",

We posit that dyadic scenarios, that is, those created jointly by a buyer and a supplier, alter the scope of supply chain design in relation to a regulatory disruption. We offer four hypotheses distinguishing dyadic scenario creation from the traditional single‐firm scenario creation and two additional hypotheses related specifically to scenarios of regulatory disruptions. Five of the six hypotheses are supported in a behavioral study of a regulatory context. We integrate these findings to propose a Supply Chain Regulation Preparedness (SRP) framework for assessing the effects of dyadic scenario creation in six regimens of regulatory disruptions. We discuss the implications of this framework for the theory and practice of organizational learning associated with supply chain configurations in the face of emergent public policies and highlight collaborative scenario planning as an emergent strategic‐level mechanism that supply chain partners can deploy jointly to address just‐in‐case uncertainties. </jats:p>",

This system takes Labview as the software development platform and Access as the background database to realize the acquisition, storage and information management of power data. In the program design, the producer-consumer mode is adopted for data collection and processing, and the queue technology is used for circular communication to ensure the integrity and reliability of data processing.

In this context, we develop a conceptual framework of digital retail supply chains to identify the key elements and their interactions. We offer a theoretically derived explanation of the ecosystem characterization of digital supply chains and show how retail supply chains fit this characterization. The supply chain ecosystem provides retail firms a way to strategize an organizational outlook that enables digitization of conventional supply chain processes. We find that emerging digital supply chains harness corporate digital awareness to operate within an ecosystem that iteratively guides the digital transformation process. The subsequent analysis highlights a digital transformation process that incorporates real‐time reporting, speed of discovery/action, visibility across the enterprise, and flexibility to react to environmental changes. Consequently, these contributing elements enable executional flexibility that is the hallmark of digital supply chains. We conclude by theorizing relevant research propositions that describe relational connections among the constituent elements of the digital supply chain framework and offer avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the research perspective of the cooperation risk and opportunistic risk between supply network enterprises, this article investigates the mechanism of how tie strength between manufacturers and suppliers influences risk sharing among enterprises from two dimensions of tie strength: structural strength and relational strength. In particular, we introduce how asymmetry of dependence moderates the relationship between tie strength and risk sharing. We surveyed China’s domestic auto OEMs and their first-tier suppliers in China through 260 questionnaires and used a hierarchical regression model as a research method to carry out the empirical analysis and test. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and risk sharing among enterprises, and asymmetry of dependence has a significant negative adjustment function on relational strength of the tie and risk-sharing relationship, while there is no significant adjustment function on the structural strength of it. Our findings suggest that keeping moderate tie strength among enterprises is conducive to achieving risk sharing. Moreover, trust and reciprocity is inhibitory regarding the adjustment effect of asymmetry of the dependence influencing relational strength and risk-sharing relationship. However, the structural strength and risk-sharing relationship are not interfered with by the adjustment function of asymmetry of dependence; that is, structural strength plays a decisive role in risk sharing.</jats:p>"

As a data collection method, a survey instrument was considered that included three dimensions of effective leadership, Green supply chain management (GSCM), and organizational performance. The data were analyzed by using partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The research found positive and significant causal relationships among the leading organization, leading people, and leading self with GSCM practices. In addition, GSCM practices positively correlated with organizational performance. The findings confirmed that GSCM practices fully mediate the relationship among the leading organization, leading people, and organizational performance, as the leading organization and leading people constructs indirectly correlated with organizational performance. The findings also showed that GSCM practices partially mediated the relationship between the leading self and organizational performance, as leading self, directly and indirectly, correlated to organizational performance. The research contributes to the literature by indicating that effective leadership via its dimensions—leading organization, people, and self— indirectly improves organizational performance by the mediating role of GSCM practices. Meanwhile, GSCM practices improve social and environmental performance. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the study was aimed at developing a web-based material requisition system (W-BMRS) that will make the supply chain on construction sites seamless and more effective. A use case and an activity block diagram provided an understanding of the users and functionalities of the material requisition platform. In addition, using a different user interface and a database system including a programming language to connect them, the study developed a web-based material requisition system for construction firms using the model view controller (MVC) model. The MVC model comprised of using MySQL, HTML, and PHP. The W-BMRS was tested by sending materials requisition through the supply chain of a construction firm. The results were presented via screenshots of the web-based platform. In conclusion, any construction firm can register on the platform and make use of the web-based materials requisition system to maximize productivity and optimize the use of ICT in their materials’ supply chain process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, air-to-water heat pumps are more widely used, which due to the high coefficient of performance reduce energy consumption and negative impact on the environment. They decrease the dependency on costs of energy resources.  The work is devoted to solving the urgent problem of improving the efficiency of air heat pumps at low temperature of outdoor air in winter. One of the main problems of an air heat pump is the reduction of productivity when the outdoor air temperature decreases in winter. In this paper, the effectiveness of LG Therma V air-to-water heat pump to provide apartments with heating and hot water supply was analyzed. The heat pump is reversive, which can cool or heat a heat carrier. A four-way valve swithes the coolant flows between air exchangers. On the basis of the obtained results, plots of effectivness of the heat pump dependent on outdoor air temperature are built. It is shown that the effectiveness of the heat pump significantly depends not only on the outside temperature but also on the water temperature at the outlet of the heat pump. The use of heat pumps with a high coefficient of performance can significantly reduce energy costs. The most effective are low-temperature heating systems, in which the water temperature does not exceed 45 °C. The example is floor heating, which requires very low temperature of the floor surface – up to 30 °C. At outdoor air temperature not less than milnus 7 °C the heat pump is effective at higher temperature off heat carrier at output – up to 55 °C. To provide the uninterrupted heat supply, an additional air heater is included. It covers heat load during defrosting and very low outdoor air temperature. On the basis of the conducted researches, the directions of the further experimental and field researches are planned.</jats:p>"

Therefore, three field experiments were carried out in the three years (2018–2020) to study the effects of straw return at two methods and four levels of potassium fertilization on photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield of the maize ‘Xianyu 335’. To conduct the field trials, a split plot system in five replications was established. Two straw return methods (straw return with deep tillage and straw mulching with no tillage) were in the main plots, and four potassium fertilization levels (0, 30, 45 and 60 kg/ha) were in the subplots. Each sub-plot consisted of 10 rows with 5 m length and 0.6 m width, and each sub-plot area was 30 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in the three years. The results indicated that the straw return methods and the potassium supply significantly affected the maize photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield in the three years. Under the same potassium supply, straw return with deep tillage significantly improved the maize photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield compared to straw mulching with no tillage. The above characteristics improved with increased potassium supply. The treatment of SFK60 recorded the highest values for the parameters of maize photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and yield during the three harvest seasons. The treatment of SFK45 reached maximum profit of maize planting, which was 12088.77 yuan/ha. Therefore, SFK45 was an effective way to ensure the stable and higher yields of maize and to maximize the income of farmers.</jats:p>"

The capacity and characteristics of waste heat source, flow demand and supply system of hot water were surveyed, and data is collected from the real system. The new heat exchanger system which utilizes the EGH to produce the hot water is designed considering the dew point temperature and the back pressure of exhaust gas system. The results show that the proposed system could supply hot water at a temperature of 55 °C corresponding to the present resort demand of 6 m3/h using EGH of ICE at 20% load. The proposed system could achieve the saving of 400 L/day in diesel oil (DO) fuel consumption and the payback time of new system could be evaluated as 9 months. The proposed system could produce hot water of 14 m3/h at 25% of engine load and 29 m3/h at full engine load which are sufficient to satisfy the regular and maximum hot water demand of resort. The presented results show the capability of the proposed system to satisfy the current hot water demand of resort and suggest the larger potential to save energy by recovering EGH of ICE.

Meanwhile, the health risk assessment model recommended by USEPA was used to evaluate the potential health risk for adults and children. The results showed that the average concentration of nitrate in the pore water is lower than that of karst water, which may be attributed to the thinner thickness of loose sediments for karst water. The nitrate in groundwater mainly originates from chemical fertilizers, industrial and domestic waste. The health risk of nitrate to children through drinking water intake and skin contact was significantly higher than that of adults, which was explained by their being more sensitive receptors and facing higher health risks than adults. The non-carcinogenic risk of nitrate in all samples was within the acceptable range. The results also indicated drinking water control is the main way to reduce nitrate health risk. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to take measures to strengthen groundwater management, improve groundwater quality, and reduce nitrate health risk.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few years, energy security and sustainable development have moved up the global agenda. Energy is what makes an economy run. There is a strong correlation between economic development and energy consumption. Energy security plays an important role in all economic sectors in attaining the long-term vision of inclusive economic growth and development of the economy. The attainment of this vision is difficult as it is challenged by the need to build energy infrastructures that are not only responsive to the growing demand but can withstand the maximum credible natural disaster. One of the primary objectives of sustainable development is to make people without access to enough energy be able to meet their needs through the provision of stable, reliable, clean, safe, and affordable energy services. This research will use the Granger Causality test to analyze the causal relationship among the endogenous variables among (1) GNI per capita; (2) GHG Emissions; and (3) Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) between energy-economic development and the influencing factors of power supply security indicators. In the end, this paper expects to suggest that the paper electric power development plans in the country also have implications for the path that would lead the country to what is known as a green economy. It is in this background that energy security and economic growth development are intertwined by public policy. In a broader development sense, public policy draws in the active involvement of the community in identifying problems. Anchored deeply in the national development agenda, the local community develops its own sets of development goals and pushes itself towards realizing this long-range vision. Hence, the output of public policy supported by strategic planning will require effective monitoring and evaluation of programs. This remains to be both a challenge and priority for both the national and local governments.ReferencesAstana, K. (2011).

We consider inflation at zero, at one, and at both zero and one. We introduce the model and provide closed‐form expressions for its score vector and Fisher's information matrix. The proposed model is used to evaluate the impacts of different conditioning variables on the proportion of people who live in households with inadequate water supply and sewage in Brazilian municipalities.

In spite of the enormous and abundant energy resources across the country (renewable and non-renewable alike), the question of sustainable energy development in Nigeria remains a farce. All spheres of energy development (generation, transmission and distribution) together with consumption is occasioned by irregularities that have plunged the nation into a protracted energy crisis for decades due to its inability to harness adequately the abundant energy resources, and sustainably utilize the low-supplied energy. This study therefore attempts to review the state of energy development in Nigeria with its attendant limitations in terms of energy supply and its utilization in a bid to attaining a sustainable national energy development.

Of approximately 160,000 Romanian Jews deported to “Transnistria,” only 50,000 survived the ordeal. The Romanians, with local Volksdeutsch and Ukrainian collaborators, also massacred and were otherwise responsible for the death of approximately 150,000 local Ukrainian Jews, including the large Jewish community of Odesa. While not comparable to the Jews in number, deported Romanian Roma and local Roma were also subjected to physical brutality, forced labour, and incarceration.&#x0D;\nFamine and starvation did not cause all Jewish and Roma deaths in Bessarabia and Transnistria. Mass executions exacted a huge toll. So did exposure to the elements, exhaustion, and typhus. Still, while there was no famine in the region, starvation was a permanent presence. Romanian authorities controlled the food supply and denied it to their targeted victims. This article describes the steps taken by Romanian occupation authorities to isolate Jews and Roma; to limit the flow of food supplies to them; to prevent them from accessing food in local markets; and to prevent help that might have been offered by those local civilians who took pity on the starving victims. Official documentation and testimonies of both officials and survivors provide a vivid picture of the consequences. Specific cases reveal factors that made the situation in one locality better or worse than that in another, or that caused a situation to improve or deteriorate. Variations notwithstanding, however, all sources lead to the conclusion that Romania’s goal was to eliminate the Jews and reduce the Roma population. This made starvation, the use of “food as a weapon,” an acceptable element of state policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electrification offers an opportunity to decarbonize the transport sector, but it might also increase the need for flexibility options in the energy system, as the uncoordinated charging process of battery electric vehicles (BEV) can lead to a demand with high simultaneity. However, coordinating BEV charging by means of smart charging control can also offer substantial flexibility potential. This potential is limited by restrictions resulting from individual mobility behavior and preferences. It cannot be assumed that storage capacity will be available at times when the impact of additional flexibility potential is highest from a systemic point of view. Hence, it is important to determine the flexibility available per vehicle in high temporal (and spatial) resolution. Therefore, in this paper a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation is carried out based on a vast empirical data set to quantify mobility profiles as accurately as possible and to subsequently derive charging load profiles. An hourly flexibility potential is derived and integrated as load shift potential into a linear optimization model for the simultaneous cost-optimal calculation of the dispatch of technology options and long-term capacity planning to meet a given electricity demand. It is shown that the costs induced by BEV charging are largely determined by the profile costs from the combination of the profiles of charging load and renewable generation, and not only by the additional energy and capacity demand. If the charging process can be flexibly controlled, the storage requirement can be reduced and generation from renewable energies can be better integrated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most energy efficient ventilation and air-conditioning is variable air flow (VAV) depending on the needs of a room. To avoid broken air circulation by gravitational forces, the most of air diffusers should change geometrical shape and sizes using additionall automation of them. In contrast, high stability of a scheme of air exchange organization with air supply over a working zone by convex wall jets that interact with each other under conditions of variable air flow, is confirmed. This scheme is useful in cases where it is impossible to supply air directly to the working zone. Simulation of the air exchange organization in an exhibition hall of International Exhibition Centre in Kyiv with ventilation at a variable air volume (VAV) in the entire possible range of performance control has been performed. The floor area is 5258 m2, the height is 19 m. The outdoor air-flow at design conditions (100 % load) is 21.667 m3/s (78000 m3/h). The minimum load corresponds to the absence of solar radiation and only some people in the room. The minimum air-flow is 25 % of the design one. The proposal air scheme is single-zonal using 24 diffusers PES-D-8-10/15-0,9 4 m above the floor and air removal from the upper zone. The air distributor have a diameter of a cylindrical surface and an inlet branch pipe of 8 dm (800 mm). There are 10 rows of nozzles at an angle π/12 (15 °) to the horizon on each distributor. The total area of the air outlet on them is equal to 0.9 of the cross-sectional area of the inlet pipes. Due to forces of the vacuum holding of jets on the wall surfaces, the influence of gravitational forces is significantly reduced. This avoids the automation of air distribution devices to stabilize the scheme of air circulation in the room by gravitational forces. It is enough to install valves with actuators on branches of a network of air ducts. Thus, the economic benefit of the system is confirmed both at the stage of installing and during operation.</jats:p>"

However, due to the complexity of evaluated objects and the cognitive limitations of individuals, the decision information given by experts is often fuzzy, which may make it difficult to make decisions. In this regard, many scholars applied fuzzy techniques to solve decision making problems in SCM. Although there were review papers about either fuzzy methods or SCM, most of them did not use bibliometrics methods or did not consider fuzzy sets theory-based techniques comprehensively in SCM. In this paper, for the purpose of analyzing the advances of fuzzy techniques in SCM, we review 301 relevant papers from 1998 to 2020. By the analyses in terms of bibliometrics, methodologies and applications, publication trends, popular methods such as fuzzy MCDM methods, and hot applications such as supplier selection, are found. Finally, we propose future directions regarding fuzzy techniques in SCM.

      "abstract": "<p>In the digital age, social media technology has an important role as a communication platform for interpersonal interactions in the online virtual world. In addition, social media has impacted product exchange behavior in both vendors and buyers, with a shift from the traditional sales model to communication between parties via social media. Social media marketing, an online means of buying, selling, and exchanging goods and services, is increasingly popular due to convenience, speed, and greater choices. This trend has grown rapidly and is set to expand, leading to increased interest in research which analyzes and processes social media marketing data to gain a new integrated body of knowledge to better serve online business transactions. This research covers a new field, which may cause research and development limitations requiring background knowledge in several areas, such as digital technology, data analytics, and business analysis. This research aims to develop a framework to search for association rule mining of demand and supply data on social media platforms. Data is collected from Twitter and underwent cleansing and labeling for separating into five groups. Hashtag data from tweets is then extracted and transformed to input attributes of the framework. Next, association rule mining is performed using the Apriori algorithm in order to determine frequent items and extract candidate association rules. The last stage is rule selection, which uses Twitter-specific statistical attributes, that is, number of retweets and likes, to select highly effective association rules. The findings are that it is possible to mine association rules relating to demand and supply on Twitter. Based on an analysis of the association rule results, the content of those rules reflects trending activities and events at different times. Such information can be analyzed in further research to design improvements in social media marketing.</p>",

Models that balance a steady input of magmatic heat with a vigorous hydrothermal output are generally successful at explaining the thermal state of magmatically robust mid‐ocean ridges. However, the magma supply of ultraslow spreading ridges is often subdued and highly episodic, and the depth‐extent and vigor of hydrothermal circulation in these settings remain poorly known, requiring modifications to the standard magmatic‐hydrothermal paradigm. We develop models that couple repeated magmatic intrusions with hydrothermal convection in a permeable domain whose boundaries are controlled by the extent of grain‐scale thermal cracking. Our simulations reveal decreasing trends of venting temperatures with increasing intrusion periodicity, as well as with increasing permeability. Our model explains the seismically inferred depth (∼10 km) to the brittle‐ductile transition and the depth of MORB crystallization at the Mid‐Cayman Spreading Center by invoking repeated intrusion of sills every 20–50 kyrs, depending on their size. Doubling this periodicity predicts a thicker (∼15 km) seismogenic layer and lower‐temperature venting, as observed at the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) at 64˚E. However, if fluid convection is not possible below ∼6 km, our model requires that high‐temperature venting at ultraslow ridges (e.g., Longqi at SWIR 49.7˚E) be fueled by shallow episodic magma intrusions into the long‐term convective region, which maintain high‐output circulation for at most a few tens of kyrs.</jats:p>",

Conclusions as follows. (1) The overall water utilization efficiency is low, and the regions are very unbalanced. The more efficient areas are concentrated in the east, and the less efficient areas are in the west. (2) There is a ‘U’-shaped relationship between the intensity of environmental regulation and water resource utilization efficiency, that is, weaker environmental regulation intensity is not conducive to the improvement of water resource utilization efficiency, but when the intensity of environmental regulation crosses the ‘inflection point’, it can promote the improvement of water resources utilization efficiency. (3) The level of economic development has a very significant positive effect on water resources utilization efficiency, and the coefficient of scientific and technological progress is positive, but the impact of scientific and technological input on water resources utilization efficiency is limited and not significant; industrial structure and water resource utilization efficiency shows a negative correlation; water use structure and water resources efficiency show a negative correlation.</jats:p>",

This gives rise to an assumption that solutions, for example direct air capture (DAC)—involving the direct removal of carbon dioxide from ambient air—can be commercialised and deployed at the necessary speed and scale to have a material impact, in the order of gigatonnes, by mid-century. Modular, solid-sorbent DAC on a gigatonne scale will require the mass mobilisation of supply chains to manufacture millions of modular DAC units−20 million of the present state of the art 50 tonne/year modules to deliver 1 gigatonne per year, as well as the large-scale production of novel chemical sorbents. To achieve a climate relevant DAC industry will demand innovative procurement models, for example carbon purchase agreements (CPAs), and dedicated DAC manufacturing facilities or dactories. In addition, insight is offered through the work of DAC start-up Carbon Infinity into the industry supply-chain position, adopting lessons from computing, and energy technologies. In particular, we look at approaches to drive demand and scale-up DAC module production, and opportunities presented in the development of an integrated DAC manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

The objective function of our model is the maximization of the whole profit of the supply chain, which consists of the stochastic demand, shortage cost, and holding costs. This paper aims to analyze a single period with two products to define the optimum retail prices and wholesales under different game theory approaches (e.g., Bertrand, cooperation, and Stackelberg competitions) based on Double Interval Grey Numbers (DIGN). The other aim of this paper is to specify the price using the manufacturers and the common retailer and considering the stochastic different channel power structures and demand function. In this paper, it is considered that different power structures of channel members may affect the optimal pricing decisions. In this paper, two pricing policies of manufacturers, eight pricing models and various structures of distribution channel members are utilized. In these pricing models, the impacts of retail substitutability are evaluated on the decisions of the chain members and the equilibrium profits. In this paper, the products are substitutable and the demand is stochastic. In this model, the demand is not certain then, we may have shortages or unsold products. Finally, sensitivity analysis is provided for illustrating the theoretical outcomes established in each case.</jats:p>",

If a distribution network contains multiple distributed power sources, the distribution network becomes a complex power grid with multiple power supplies. When a short-circuit fault occurs at a certain point on the power distribution network, the size, direction and duration of the short-circuit current are no longer single due to the existence of distributed power, and will vary with the location and capacity of the distributed power supply system. The change, in turn, affects the current in the grid, resulting in the generation and propagation of additional current. This power grid of power electronics will cause problems such as excessive standard mis-operation, abnormal heating of the converter and component burnout, and communication system failure. It is of great and practical significance to study the influence of distributed power in distributed power distribution networks.</jats:p>",

The optimal ordering quantity of the retailer and the optimal production quantity of the supplier are derived with the call option contract in the presence of a service requirement. Furthermore, by investigating the effect of the service level and the risk aversion on the supply chain, it is found that the retailer’s optimal Conditional Value-at-Risk is non-increasing in the service requirement and increasing in the risk aversion, while the supplier’s optimal expected profit is non-decreasing in the service and decreasing in the risk aversion. In addition, this paper demonstrates the impact of contract parameters on the service-constrained supply chain, and finds that the retailer’s optimal Conditional Value-at-Risk may be increasing, constant or decreasing in unit exercise price. Finally, with the call option contract, a distribution-free coordination condition is derived to achieve the Pareto improvement under Conditional Value-at-Risk criterion in the presence of a service requirement.</jats:p>"

The research on the influencing factors of the utilization of community cultural and leisure services of the older adults can help improve the service effect and enhance the quality of life of the older adults. Based on Anderson's model, we constructed an analytical framework of the influencing factors of the utilization of community cultural and leisure services for the older adults from both the supply and demand sides, and then used Poisson regression method to empirically test the analytical framework based on the survey data of three cities in Shaanxi Province in 2019.\nResults\n\nThe results found that supply-side factors significantly influenced the utilization of community cultural and leisure services by the older adults, mainly including service facility supply, service content supply, and service location accessibility; demand-side factors significantly influenced the utilization of community cultural and leisure services by the older adults, mainly including service acceptability, service satisfaction, and service need. The study also found that, unlike the results of previous studies, the use of community cultural and leisure services by older adults was not constrained by economic level.\nConclusions\n\nBoth supply-side factors and demand-side factors significantly affect the utilization of community spiritual culture services by the older adults. In strengthening and improving the supply of community cultural and leisure services, the previous \"top-down\" and \"service-centered\" approach should be changed to a \"bottom-up\" and \"demand-centered\" approach. In the past, the supply of community spiritual culture services should be changed from a \"top-down\" and \"service-centered\" approach to a \"bottom-up\" and \"demand-centered\" approach, and attention should be paid to the urban-rural differences in supply.</jats:p>"

Despite some regional technical improvements, the industry’s decarbonization progress at the global scale has largely stagnated since 1995 mainly due to expanded production in emerging countries with high carbon intensity. Our analysis of future scenarios indicates that the expected demand expansion in these countries may jeopardize steel industry’s prospects for following 1.5 °C emission reduction pathways. To achieve the Paris climate goals, there is an urgent need for rapid implementation of joint supply- and demand-side mitigation measures around the world in consideration of regional conditions.</jats:p>"

The study covers 390 employees through a questionnaire survey. The study used the endogenous switching regression model for modelling average working hours per week day of social media addicts and non-addicts comparatively.  Age, marital status, executive employment, type of social media and commuting distance to the workplace are the key factors associated with social media addiction of workers as in the selection function of the model. Working hours of social media addicts are affected by age, gender and executive employment while the working hours of non addicts are mainly affected by gender, marriage, executive employment, years of education and monthly net salary. Social media addiction of non addicts causes reduction of average hours of work per week day, while hours of work of social media addicts increase, if they have given up social media addiction. Institution specific policy insights are also proposed to increase the performance of employees.</jats:p>"

We also find that it is often optimal to hold more reserve capacity downstream than upstream. While in one‐stage supply chains RMI and reserve capacity always behave as substitutes, it turns out that in multi‐stage serial supply chains the interplay between RMI and reserve capacity is more nuanced.

These lower‐tier suppliers are much less visible and may not even be known to the focal firm. Our intention is to bring awareness to the importance of these lower‐tier suppliers and capture possible strategies that buying companies may pursue to manage them. Extended supply chains are complex and involve evolving relationships between various buyers and suppliers that are located along different tiers of the chain and across different parts of the globe.

To this end, researchers have proposed a multitude of methods to detect such leaks in WDSs. Model-based and data-driven approaches, in particular, have found widespread uses in this area. In this paper, we reviewed both these approaches and classified the techniques used by them according to their leak detection methods. It is seen that model-based approaches require highly calibrated hydraulic models, and their accuracies are sensitive to modeling and measurement uncertainties. On the contrary, data-driven approaches do not require an in-depth understanding of the WDS. However, they tend to result in high false positive rates. Furthermore, neither of these approaches can handle anomalous variations caused by unexpected water demands.</jats:p>",

This study compiles and analyzes the data from two previous experiments with the beer game (Croson and Donohue, 2003, 2006) to gain insight on the specific mechanisms that decrease order amplification. By structuring the data as a panel and using a fixed‐effects estimation model, we find that additional supply‐chain‐level information (e.g., POS and inventory data) leads subjects to react less aggressively to changes in their own inventory and to pay more attention to the supply line of orders placed. Furthermore, our analysis shows that such effects are more pronounced for upstream subjects. Our findings provide insight into the role that additional supply‐chain information play on subjects' orders in the beer game. © 2021 The Authors. <jats:italic>System Dynamics Review</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of System Dynamics Society.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, so far, the suggested models have focused on the P-D stages of the chain while the delivery of high-quality products to customers is of paramount significance in the perishable SC. In the present paper, a multiobjective, mixed-integer, and nonlinear programming (MOMINLP) mathematical model was developed for integrated P-D deteriorating items in a two-echelon SC that emphasizes quality degradation. Quality is monitored and calculated as a function of temperature and time throughout the SC, and the main purpose of the model is to first increase the quality of products delivered to customers and, second, minimize the SC costs. To optimize the problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach was also incorporated into the model. The obtained model was applied to a case study in Protein Gostar Sina Company in Iran, which resulted in decreased P-D costs as well as increased customer satisfaction.</jats:p>",

Firstly, hogget breeding was identified to become profitable when break-even HWRs of 26% and 28% were achieved for flocks with FWRs of 135% and 150%, respectively. Secondly, relatively smaller improvements in FWR were identified to increase profit to the same level as larger improvements in HWR. Thirdly, a high performing flock with FWR and HWR both ≥ the 90th percentile currently achieved commercially, was the most profitable flock modelled. Fourthly, a FWR was identified with which a farmer not wishing to breed hoggets could have the same profit as a farmer with a flock achieving current industry average FWR and HWR. Overall, the relative profit levels achieved by the modelled flocks suggest that more farmers should consider breeding their hoggets, though improvements in FWRs should be prioritised.</jats:p>"

Generally, the reference voltage is obtained using both complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) current and proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) current. This technique increases the complexity and area of the reference circuit. To overcome these drawbacks, the temperature compensated reference voltage has been proposed using only CTAT currents. Mostly, the CTAT current generators are simple, power-efficient, and area-efficient as compared to the PTAT current generators. The negative feedback loop has been formed in the proposed design to obtain a supply independent CTAT current and to avoid the use of startup drivers. The proposed circuit has been designed using Cadence virtuoso analog design environment in BSIM3V3 180[Formula: see text]nm CMOS technology. The simulation results of the proposed circuit show a reference voltage of 312[Formula: see text]mV with a temperature coefficient (TC) of 38.85[Formula: see text]ppm/<jats:sup>∘</jats:sup>C over a wide temperature range of [Formula: see text]C to 125<jats:sup>∘</jats:sup>C with a supply voltage of 0.8[Formula: see text]V. The line sensitivity is 0.027% [Formula: see text] with a supply voltage ranging from 0.8[Formula: see text]V to 3[Formula: see text]V. The power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) without using any capacitive filter is observed as [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]dB at 100[Formula: see text]Hz and 100[Formula: see text]kHz frequency, respectively.

Two irrigation practices (deficit irrigation and rainfed conditions) were applied to the main crop types of the Almyros Basin, a coastal basin located in Thessaly, Greece. The Almyros groundwater system suffers from progressive water balance deficit, nitrate contamination and seawater intrusion due to groundwater abstractions for agricultural irrigation to cover crop water demands in the dry season. The impacts of the irrigation and nitrate fertilization scenarios on groundwater resources quantity and quality were simulated using an Integrated Modelling System consisting of models of surface hydrology (UTHBAL), groundwater hydrology (MODFLOW), crop growth/nitrate leaching (REPIC), contaminant transport (MT3DMS), and seawater intrusion (SEAWAT), for the historical period of 1991–2018. The results of the scenarios were evaluated with the indicators of Crop Water Productivity (CWP) for crop yields and irrigation water, Partial Factor Productivity (PFP) for Nitrogen Use Efficiency, and Economic Water Productivity (EWP) for the gross profits of the irrigation water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Financial technology and smart transportation is key cross-field of transportation in the future. The demand for smart transportation investment is constantly released. As typical and efficient financial products, asset-backed securities (ABS) can greatly improve the turnover efficiency of funds between upstream suppliers and downstream buyers in the field of smart transportation and also help participants of the supply chain to maintain healthier financial situations. However, one of the most common problems of ABS is portfolio allocation, which needs portfolio optimization based on massive assets with multiple objectives and constraints. Especially, in the field of smart transportation, sources of underlying assets can always be complex, which may involve a variety of subdivision industries and regions. At the same time, due to the relationships between upstream and downstream entities in the supply chain, correlations among assets can be strong. So, during the optimization of smart transportation ABS portfolio allocation, it is necessary to identify and deal with those problems. Different from forward selection or linear optimization, which could have low efficiency for complicated problems with large sample size and multiple objectives, new methods and algorithms for NP-hard problems would be necessary to be investigated. In this article, a penalty function based on graph density (GD) was introduced to the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and a GD-PSO algorithm was proposed. Experiments also showed that the GD-PSO algorithm solved the problem of portfolio optimization in smart transportation supply chain ABS effectively.</jats:p>",

The suggested method is based on the identification of the fundamental harmonic of signals from the current and voltage sensors observed at the input and output of the tested filters, respectively. The identified parameters of the fundamental harmonic of signals before and after the filter allow the determination of points of the filter frequency’s characteristics and their comparison with the reference values. In the suggested method of assessing the operation of analog filters, the new approach consists of checking the frequency characteristics on the basis of identification of the basic harmonics of the signal at the input and output of the tested filter (installed in the measuring line of the electrical quantity) using data acquired during the frequency start-up of the mining machine driving motor under normal operational conditions. Results are presented of the filter performance assessment, using the suggested method, after three years of its operation in the measuring system. For this purpose, empirical data recorded during the operation of a roadheader on a test stand are used. The results are compared with the theoretical frequency characteristics of the tested filters.</jats:p>"

In addition, practices to improve their functionality and enhance community awareness were recommended. A spatial database of the wider urban setting including suburbs and rural areas (weather, land cover, soils, roads, protected areas, riparian areas, etc.) was developed within GIS. The datasets were then inputted in a hydrologic model to simulate the water balance and stream discharge in the main urban streams and torrents. Field measurements of stream water discharge, and vegetation and stream channel conditions were undertaken using two visual protocols. The results of the protocols indicate that most streams/torrents and their riparian areas are of low ecological quality. Nature-based solutions were recommended to improve their ecological quality. In addition, the implementation of Eco-Routes was recommended to enhance the awareness of their importance and to promote their sustainable management. Overall, the urban streams/torrents and riparian ecosystems of Drama are degraded and innovative management practices should be implemented to conserve them and feature their ecosystem services.</jats:p>",

Given that the field has changed a great deal, it seems valuable to examine the evolution of OSCM's intellectual structure over its 70 years of academic communications. Using bibliometrics methods, we analyze 96,125 articles containing 1,047,468 references from 31 representative OSCM journals. Our study defines primary topic areas represented in the most co‐cited documents, while tracing past and current research trends. We include analyses of recent bursts in research attention and comparisons of trends in academic and practitioner literatures. The results from an inclusive analysis suggest that OSCM researchers have been responsive to methodological advances and to some of the dynamics in the operating environments of businesses. However, a product/manufacturing focus seems to persist, and inconsistencies between researchers’ and practitioners’ interests suggest that relevance of OSCM could be further improved. Current hot topics are quite different from those of the past. Trend data suggest that studies of supply chain management and data analytics issues will continue to figure largely in shaping the future research agenda. Our analysis quantifies trends and identifies subtopics that are growing in prominence. In addition, the findings provide a benchmark for evaluating the progress of the OSCM field, while highlighting opportunities for shaping its development and directions.</jats:p>",

The research strives to develop a better understanding of global value chains through relational view, behavioral, and contingency theories along with institutional and stakeholder theories of supply chains. Based on conflicting insights from these theories, this research investigates how relationships and operational outcomes of collaboration fare when market turbulence is present. Data is obtained and analyzed from focal firms that are engaged in doing business in emerging markets (e.g., India), and headquartered in the United States. We investigate relational outcomes (e.g., trust, credibility, mutual respect, and relationship commitment) among supply chain partners, and found that these relational outcomes result in better operational outcomes (e.g., profitability, market share increase, revenue generation, etc.). From managerial standpoint, supply chain managers should focus on relational outcomes that can strengthen operational outcomes in GVCs resulting in stronger organizational performance. The research offers valuable insights for theory and practice of global value chains by focusing on the GVC disaggregation through the measurement of market turbulence, playing a key role in the success of collaborative buyer–supplier relationships (with a focus on US companies doing business in India) leading to an overall improved firm performance.</jats:p>"

The CCUS network is a large-scale comprehensive model which is used to meet the mandated target of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission reduction at different levels with a maximum profit. The novel CCUS infrastructure includes various stationary sources, capture processes, transportation modes, and sequestration and utilization sites. The results suggest that it is possible to reduce current CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions by 40–80% in Germany with the total annual costs ranging from 519.34 to 1372.03 billion euro while generating 681.55 to 1880.98 billion euro of revenue annually as a result of producing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-based chemical products including methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid, acetic acid, urea, and polypropylene carbonate. Overall, the optimal CCUS systems achieve economic profits of 999.62–1568.17 euro per ton of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> captured and utilized. The CCUS model may be critical in aiding decision-makers to ascertain investment strategies for designing CCUS infrastructures.</jats:p>",

CKD patients often restrict their potassium (K) intake to avoid the high risk of hyperkalemia. In this study, quantitative K management in hydroponics was adopted to produce low K cherry-type tomato (Solanum lycopersicom L.) fruit. The total quantity of K supply per plant during the cultivation was 7.2 g (1 K), 3.6 g (1/2 K), 1.8 g (1/4 K), 0.9 g (1/8 K) and 0.6 g (1/12 K), respectively. The total fruit yield decreased to about 75% at 1/2 K and 58% at 1/12 K compared to 1 K. The fruit K content was lower in 1/4 K, 1/8 K and 1/12 K than in 1 K and 1/2 K, and the fruit from 1/8 K and 1/12 K achieved below 100 mg 100 g−1 FW of K. Total soluble solid content (Brix) was 7–8% in 1 K and 1/4 K but was lower in 1/8 K and 1/12 K. Fruit acid content decreased to 87% in 1/2 K to 70% in 1/4 K and 1/8 K, and to 57% in 1/12 K of 1 K. In conclusion, quantitative K management in hydroponics is expected to produce low K tomato fruit. Fruit K content of approximately 100 mg.100 g−1 FW was achieved when the quantity of K supply was 1/4 K and 1/8 K, with a relatively smaller effect on fruit yield, Brix and acid content.</jats:p>"

With respect to the traditionally used marginal allocation that considers items individually, the proposed black-box optimization model is a holistic approach in the fact that it exploits relationships among items. The authors propose a derivative-free algorithm specifically tied to the application which exploits a new selection strategy for choosing entire subsets of items with the aim to get the best expected improvement in the objective function. The approach has been tested on a real case study for optimizing stocks in an airline's inventory network. The case study provides evidence about the good behavior of the exploratory geometry of the proposed approach in finding quickly a feasible and optimal solution for inventory control.</p>",

The conducted research is based on the application of system analysis methods to formalize the process of expert evaluation in the planning of an energy system with renewable energy sources. Here were used methods of expert evaluation of characteristics of qualitative criteria, methods of the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic for the formation of the value of criteria, and methods of estimating the reliability of the expert evaluation. Methods of structural analysis and functional modelling of information systems are used to build structural and functional models of the expert evaluation process. The issue of creating an appropriate information system for planning a power system with renewable energy sources is considered. One of the components of the information system is the unit for evaluating candidate experts. A six-level algorithm of the hierarchical structure of expert selection is proposed. As a result of the algorithm, an expert group is formed. This paper shows the process of narrowing the circle of experts from twenty to three candidates. The list of criteria influencing the choice of experts is formed: length of service, availability of the certificate, the efficiency of decision-making, education. The process of assessing the stability of experts' opinions is shown. It is proposed to use the method of processing the opinions of experts to find the value of the membership functions of qualitative criteria. As a result of the study, a group of three experts was formed, whose opinions are taken into account when choosing alternatives to the energy system. In accordance with the proposed information technology of energy supply planning of buildings using renewable energy sources, an information system in the form of a web-oriented application is proposed. A separate part of the information system is a subsystem for working with experts. The diagram of sequence of actions of the expert and the interface of work with system is developed. The use of the information system allowed to increase the efficiency of questionnaires of experts and decision-making on the choice of the optimal structure of the power system as a whole.</jats:p>"

After analysing the classification method of service resource, the ontology information model of service resources and service activities is constructed. Then the search matching between service demander and service resource provider is transformed into the mapping between service resource ontology and service activity ontology to solve. Finally, the ontology model of specific instance is established, and the Semantic Web ontology language OWL is used.

In this regard, creating soil nutrition’s supply chain network for the fertility of agricultural fields is one of the most critical priorities of the government. In the above strategic network, we are faced with uncertain parameters that show a complex behavior under time, geography, and market changes. This parametric uncertainty is aggravated by the occurrence of disruptions such as sanctions and natural disasters, with devastating effects on strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. In this paper, by adopting a set of reactive and preventive strategies, the resilient supply chain network of dependent petrochemical industries is presented, consistent with the structure of its production cycle in Iran. To cope with the uncertainty, a robust programming approach was extended into flexible-possibilistic programming. The final model controls the uncertainty and risk-aversion of output decisions and effectively confronts the adverse effects of disruptions. Finally, using a real industrial study, the effectiveness and applicability of the final model are explained. Furthermore, by providing efficient solutions, mean cost and minimum standard deviations were achieved. </jats:p>",

For the first strategy (T1), the trees were irrigated every week at 100% crop evapotranspiration (ETc), while for the second strategy (T2) at 60% ETc. At harvest time, tree yield was estimated along with fruit quality and water productivity. T1 strategy significantly increased the tree yield, the fruit weight and the juice content. Although an increase in water productivity (crop yield/total water use) was achieved during the water stress experiment for three out of the four varieties. The main effect of the T2 strategy was a significant increase of qualitative (commercial and nutritional) attributes like total soluble solids (TSS), citric acid, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and phenolic content. In addition, strategy T2 increased the maturation index and the fruits had sweeter flavor for two varieties. These results lead to the conclusion that in mature grapefruit trees, optimal irrigation practice provided better fruit yield, while water stress practices favor the accumulation of specific nutritional elements and improve specific fruit quality parameters, especially for cv. Ruby.</jats:p>",

The study adopted a survey research design and quantitative method to allow for descriptive and inferential analysis. The population for the study was 377 registered SMEs in Rivers State of Nigeria. The convenience simple technique was used to select one respondent each from the 377 retail SMEs studied. The convenience sampling of respondents was used to ensure that those employees found at their workplaces were the ones used for the study. Subsequently, 377 copies of questionnaire were distributed to 377 employees crosswise the identified retail SMEs. Of the 377 respondents contacted, 258 contributed to the study, resulting to a response rate of 68 The 258 respondents produced a total of 249 working response deposit. Data were subjected to correlation and regression analysis using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Version 22.0). The study’s findings showed that, the influence of supportive leadership style on order fulfillment was statistically positive and significant at 0.05 significant level. This implies that a well packaged supportive leadership style can increase the chance of boosting order fulfillment in retail supply chain. The study therefore, concludes that, there is a positive and significant influence of supportive leadership style on supply chain performance of retail SMEs in Rivers State of Nigeria, and recommends that, managers who are driven by the desire to achieve efficiency in operation should emphasis more on exhibiting added supportive leadership style in their organizations to boost order fulfillment to enhance supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the influence of information forecast accuracy on the profits of the supply chain under the circumstance of a multichannel apparel supply chain. Due to the emergence of multichannel, customer showrooming behavior is becoming increasingly prevalent. For example, consumers usually buy garments online after experiencing the service in the traditional bricks and mortar in the clothing industry. Meanwhile, there are often information barriers between the manufacturer and the retailer, which will affect enterprise decision-making. To solve these problems, this paper mainly investigates the information sharing and customer showrooming phenomenon, which includes four models: no information sharing without showrooming model (NN), information sharing without showrooming model (SN), no information sharing with showrooming model (NS), and information sharing with showrooming model (SS). The numerical analysis shows that under the impact of the forecast error, information sharing between channel members is more favorable than no information sharing when parameters satisfy certain conditions. From the perspectives of the retailer, the manufacturer, and the whole supply chain, customer showrooming behavior will bring them less profit. These conclusions mean that the retailer should share information with the manufacturer and adjust their service level and sales price to alleviate the effect of showrooming.</jats:p>",

However, the central problem associated with such technology is the high temperature of its exhaust gases, which can be recovered via appropriate waste heat elimination schemes. Although various studies have previously discussed optimal operating conditions of the enhanced biogas-driven BC in terms of thermodynamics and economic, no comprehensive investigation in terms of selecting the best bottoming cycle for the biogas-driven BC has been carried out up to yet. This spurs the current investigation to recommend the it best bottoming cycle between a close supercritical BC (CSBC) and an inverse BC (IBC) for waste heat recovering of a biogas-driven BC around the optimum point. Another novelty of the present study is the inclusion of the environment index (EI) along with energy, exergy, and economic metrics in the performed multi-objective optimization scheme, resulting in the design of a highly sustainable energy system. The results indicated that no single optimal solution exists in selecting the best bottoming cycle by accounting energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental metrics, simultaneously. Hence, a trade-off should be deliberated in selecting the best case in the design process. Accordingly, the integrated BC/CSBC system is superior to the BC/IBC system in terms of thermodynamics (i.e., both energy and exergy metrics) around both base and optimal design points; however, it is not commendable in terms of economic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. Quantitatively speaking, selecting the BC/CSBC system can lead to thermal and exergetic performance enhancement of around 3.3%, while degrading economic and exergoenvironmental metrics around 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively.</jats:p>",

Riparian buffer strips (RBSs) are crucial in alleviating nitrogen into water bodies. This study examined the impacts of different RBS patterns on nitrogen removal. The effects of different RBSs of various widths (5, 15, 30, and 40 m), with different vegetation types (Taxodium hybrid ‘Zhongshanshan’, poplar (Nanlin-95), and a mixed forest of T. hybrid ‘Zhongshanshan’ and poplar) and at different densities (400, 1,000, and 1,600 plants·hm−2) on the TN, NH4+-N and NO3−-N removal rates in different depths of runoff water were studied. The results showed that the 15 m-wide RBS removed nitrogen the most effectively, with average removal rates of NH4+-N, NO3−-N and TN reaching 67.79%, 65.93% and 65.08%, respectively. Among the RBSs with different vegetation types, the poplar forest RBS removed the most NH4+-N (74.28%) and NO3−-N (61.71%). The mixed-forest RBS removed the most TN (65.57%). The RBS with 1,000 plants·hm−2 was more suitable in terms of the removal of NH4+-N (74.25%), NO3−-N (71.08%) and TN (62.67%). The conclusion can provide the basis of vegetation and width optimization for the design and construction of an RBS for maximum eutrophication nutrient removal.</jats:p>",

Amphipods prevailed in the diet of juvenile pink and chum salmon that corresponded to these zooplankton species abundance in the southern part of the sea; other significant portions of their diet were presented by euphausiids, copepods, arrowworms, pteropods, and oikopleura. Decapods, fish and squids were in the diet of masu, coho and chinook salmon. Portion of zooplankton was about 100 % in the diet of pink salmon fingerlings, but only 98 % in the diet of chum salmon fingerlings with 2 % portion of squids. Grazing by salmons was insignificant: 0.2-0.3 % of the total zooplankton biomass within the periods of observation (18 days in 2018 and 13 days in 2019), or 0.04-2.0 % for certain taxonomic groups, except of pteropods and oikopleura with the consumed portions of 4-7 % and 7-12 %, respectively. However, the daily consumption by salmons relative to daily production of some groups was significant in October, 2018 and reached 97 % for amphipods and &gt; 200 % for euphausiids in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea (biostatistical areas 6-8) and 48 and 27 %, respectively, in the entire surveyed area.

The sudden shift in food consumption patterns from food service to food retail required realignment of food supply chains. For the most part, food supply chains have performed remarkably well during the pandemic. Cross‐border food supply chains have continued to function effectively. The most significant disruptions emerged from workforce outbreaks of COVID‐19 in the meat processing sector and in fruit and vegetable production. The paper discusses supply chain resilience and argues that agrifood supply chains are characterized by several important differences that need to be taken into consideration when evaluating resilience. Economies of scale and scope offer economic efficiency advantages in normal times, while investments in adaptability and flexibility can enhance resilience for abnormal times. Potential long‐run changes within supply chains include increased automation and digitalization in food supply chains, while investments in infrastructure for online delivery services have permanently altered the food retailing landscape.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research paper presents theoretical and practical aspects of differentiation of territories according to the level of transport infrastructure development. The purpose of the research is to develop a formalized approach to territorial differentiation according to the level of transport infrastructure development on the example of Ukrainian regions. The issues with the term of \"transport infrastructure\" are defined. Classical methodological approaches to transport infrastructure level of development assessment are described. The essence of the concept of \"differentiation\" and its meaning in the transport industry are revealed. The coefficients for assessing the provision of regions with transport infrastructure, transport network density coefficient and the assessment of transport network safety indicator are considered. On the basis of the considered coefficients and initial statistical data, the analysis of regions of Ukraine, based on a level of development of a transport infrastructure, was conducted. The inequality of transport infrastructure level of development (even within one country) is caused due to both objective (geographical location, resource potential) and subjective reasons (efficient use of resources, effectiveness of regional management). An integrated assessment in order to solve this task was formed. It is based on the apparatus of the methodology of decision-making in conditions of uncertainty. For the practical demonstration, the regions of Ukraine were differentiated, according to the level of transport infrastructure development. During the evaluation, it is possible to determine the factor with the greatest impact on the overall result by region. Improving the quantitative indicators that form the most influential qualitative assessment would lead to an increasement of the overall assessment. Thus, using the developed algorithm, it becomes possible to optimize the management of transport infrastructure development of a particular territory.</jats:p>"

In such a context, the WAT may accordingly modulate its mitochondrial metabolic activity. We previously demonstrated that a partial replacement of glucose by galactose in a culture medium of 3T3-L1 cells leads to a poorer adipogenic yield and improved global mitochondrial health. In the present study, we investigate key mitochondrial metabolic actors reflecting mitochondrial adaptation in response to different carbohydrate supplies. (2) Methods: The metabolome of 3T3-L1 cells was investigated during the differentiation process using different glucose/galactose ratios and by a targeted approach using 1H-NMR (Proton nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy; (3) Results: Our findings indicate a reduction of adipogenic and metabolic overload markers under the low glucose/galactose condition. In addition, a remodeling of the mitochondrial function triggers the secretion of metabolites with signaling and systemic energetical homeostasis functions. Finally, this study also sheds light on a new way to consider the mitochondrial metabolic function by considering noncarbohydrates related pathways reflecting both healthier cellular and mitochondrial adaptation mechanisms; (4) Conclusions: Different carbohydrates supplies induce deep mitochondrial metabolic and function adaptations leading to overall adipocytes function and profile remodeling during the adipogenesis.</jats:p>"

UD.Ridwan in its business activities has experienced several problems in the part of the supply of raw materials that are not fixed, because the amount of fish waste is not fixed per day. UD. RIDWAN in its production activities, every 1 kg of raw materials used can produce 761 grams of feed product. As a result, the results of feed production are also not fixed, and cannot fulfill orders from consumers, so there is often a mismatch between demand and orders. This will lead to unfulfilled consumer demand and delays in distribution to each distribution center (DC). UD. Ridwan distributes his products to existing DCs, namely: Medan, Banda Aceh, and Lhokseumawe. To fix the losses faced by the company, it is necessary to measure the performance of the supply chain first. There are several models of supply chain performance measurement systems, namely: POA (Performance of Activity) and SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference). POA is a model used to measure the performance of activities that are part of the process in the supply chain. Activity performance is measured in various dimensions, namely: costs, time, capacity, capabilities, productivity, utilization and outcomes.

With the development and application of 5G technology in recent years, the Internet of Everything will become a historical inevitability. Compared with the traditional wireless networking technology, the application of NB-IoT technology can greatly reduce the power consumption and cost of the equipment, and also increase the service life of the equipment. Under the background of more and more mature communication network technology in the future, how to make the equipment more durable and lower power consumption has become one of the key issues to improve the performance of the equipment. Therefore, the power equipment charging with polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and storing energy with supercapacitors can supply energy for the detection equipment continuously. The photovoltaic charging circuit uses the variable step length conductance increment method to track the maximum power point to improve the utilization rate of solar energy. As a communication technology, narrow-band IoT can reduce more power consumption. The narrow-band bandwidth allows devices to be widely placed in a fixed area. Under the premise of realizing the functional requirements, the principle of hardware and software design is mainly to realize the low power consumption in all aspects, and the design of the upper computer is mainly to realize the real-time understanding of the detection equipment.</jats:p>",

We first document a baseline fact: a significant proportion of tier-2 suppliers are shared by tier-1 suppliers. We then construct two simple metrics to capture the degree of tier-2 sharing and disentangle its effect from tier-2 suppliers’ own risks. We show that the focal firms’ risk levels are significantly related to the proportion of shared tier-2 suppliers in their supply network, and the effect becomes monotonically stronger as their tier-2 suppliers become more highly shared. Finally, we uncover causal relationships behind these associations using a new source of exogenous, idiosyncratic risk events in an event study setting. We show that, as tier-2 suppliers are impacted by these events, focal firms experience negative abnormal returns, the magnitude of which is significantly larger when the impacted tier-2 suppliers are more heavily shared. Overall, our study uncovers the subtier network structure as an important risk source for the focal firm, with the degree of tier-2 sharing as the main moderator. Our results also provide the microfoundation for a common structure in idiosyncratic risks and suggest the importance of incorporating the effect of subtier supply network structure in the portfolio-optimization process. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management. </jats:p>",

Therefore, in order to choose a more suitable plan and create a more reasonable airflow organization form, we use CFD numerical simulation method to simulate the airflow organization of a tall and open-duplex-structured factory in mainland, China. By setting different air supply parameters and air supplier column parameters, the composite air supply scheme combining the tuyere type and the air supplier column type is evaluated respectively.

In this paper, the effects of valve closure on speed of pump and pressure along the pipeline were investigated. Valve closure formula based on pump runaway characteristics were proposed and verified using numerical simulation. In addition, when valves were closed under the formula proposed in this paper and other closure laws, the minimum speed, minimum and maximum pressure along the pipeline were compared. The results showed that formulas agree well with the numerical results. In the high lift supply systems, compared with the other closure laws, the minimum speed and minimum pressure along the pipeline under valve closure formula were the largest, and the maximum pressure along the pipeline was the smallest. Moreover, in the low lift supply systems, the minimum speed under valve closure formula did not exceed the rated speed.

TFAs are considered one of the major dietary risk factors of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Efforts are underway in the country to eliminate industrially-produced TFAs from the food supply in keeping with the priority targets of the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2019–2023. We reviewed the TFA content reported in industrially produced foods and discuss the regulatory landscape for TFAs, to facilitate the required policy changes in Pakistan and ultimately eliminate the TFA burden from industrial food products.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Design and method:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The study components included review of published research and product labels as well as review of prevailing food regulations for TFA-related information.

Food products with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or bakery margarine in their ingredients also contained high level of TFAs. Repeated use of oil for deep frying of potato and cereal products also caused an increase in TFA content. Federal and provincial food authorities have recently established the limits for TFAs in a few products; however, regulations do not include mandatory food labeling.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>A comprehensive national strategy for TFA elimination, based on knowledge of TFA prevalence associated regulatory control is suggested in this study. We recommend to: (1) promote actions towards replacement of traditional vanaspati ghee/bakery fats with healthier alternatives; (2) review national and provincial food standards to support development and implementation of legislative actions and their compliance; (3) amend food labeling laws so that clear information will be provided to inform consumers’ healthy food choices.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

However, much of the research is focused more on how to acquire this type of discharge or how to use it in some fields; there is a lack of clear and universally accepted theories. In this paper, we described the polarity effect in the process of atmospheric pressure glow discharge driven by a resonant power supply, from the standpoint of the differences in electric field direction in the pin-to-plate gap. We also discussed the characteristics of the discharge waveform, the characteristics of discharge images and the light-intensity distribution on the centerline of the discharge channel. Also studied were the polarity effect of unipolar discharge and the influence of different output-voltage amplitudes on the polarity effect. We found that both positive and negative discharges looked like a typical glow discharge. The voltage and current waveforms of unipolar discharge have a rapidly rising slope, and there is strong ionization near the anode. In the process of a unipolar discharge, there is an obvious γ discharge stage, and the α mode discharge has an obvious high-slope stage, whereas the slope of this process of a negative discharge is more gradual, and the polarity effects of positive and negative unipolar discharges become less and less obvious with the increase in the output-voltage amplitude of power supply.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the consumer’s loss aversion behavior was illustrated at a fixed balking probability, and the SC models were created for centralized and decentralized decision-making modes. After that, the optimal strategies for the retailer and the manufacturer were identified, and the comparative static analysis was adopted to explore the effects of the CBB and QC on the optimal decision-making of the SC. The research results show that the QC-based SC under the CBB cannot be coordinated by wholesale price contract alone, but can be coordinated perfectly by this contract when the retailer shares the quality effort and the manufacturer shares the oversupply cost and analyzed through the fuzzy environment with the formulation. This finding sheds new light on the theory and application of wholesale price contract in SC coordination. Finally, the parameter sensitivity analysis was performed on balking probability and product qualification rate (PQR) through numerical experiments, which further discloses the impacts of the CBB and product QC on the optimal decision-making and profit of the SC.</jats:p>",

This article aims to analyze the performance of oversized pumps, driven with variable frequency drives, from WSS. The work was carried out in two experimental setups that have oversized pumps. The methodology consisted of evaluating data collected in experimental tests using hydraulic and electric meters. Tests were realized for different operating conditions of the systems, with the variation of the rotation of the pumps, in order to obtain the pump efficiency curve according to the VFD output frequency. The results demonstrated that the use of variable frequency drives proved to be an alternative to increase the energy efficiency of the evaluated systems. It was observed that the highest efficiencies were recorded in the lowest frequency bands (30 Hz and 35 Hz), while in the values close to the nominal frequency (45 Hz to 60 Hz) there is little variation in the efficiency values.</jats:p>"

The research method used is qualitative, especially phenomenology. The novelty of this research lies in the innovation of the supply chain model and the Covid-19 handling constraints obtained through a series of empirical studies and literature reviews that allow it to be used by decision makers. The results revealed that various innovations to meet the supply chain relating to the handling of Covid-19 have been carried out by the government ranging from the creation of special hospitals, the appointment of public hospitals to the referral hospitals specifically Covid-19, the purchase of medicines from other countries that were imported , a mask development company, increases mask production for state-owned and private companies that produce masks, increases alcohol production, and recruits human resources in the health sector, especially for final year students majoring in health.

Results of laboratory analysis indicated a suitable soil for coriander's growth and revealed that field's soil was characterized sandy clay loam (SCL) with mean values: soil organic matter (SOM) = 1.70%, bulk specific gravity = 1.42 g·cm−3, plant available water = 0.129 cm·cm−1, pH = 7.10 and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) = 19.3 cmol·kg−1. The two-way ANOVA statistical analysis (P = 0.05) results revealed that the irrigation treatments (IR1: rainfed, IR2: rainfed plus supplemental irrigation [best]), and the SP treatments (SP1: October's last week, SP2: November's first week [best]) significantly affects coriander's seed yield and essential oil content, but the SP have no significant effect on plant's umbel height (P = 0.873). Supplemental irrigation, using a limited amount of water, if applied during the critical crop growth stages, can result in substantial improvement on seed yield (+284.934%), essential oil content (+125.396%) and plant's umbel height (+117.929%).</jats:p>",

Moreover, a complete sensitivity analysis of parameters is carried out. In particular, the retailer’s optimal order quantity and coordinating wholesale price decreases as the loss aversion or confidence level increases, while it increase as the buyback price or sharing coefficient increases.

The aim of this research is to examine the inhibitors that have a major impact on the performance of CSC operations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study provides a synthesis and suggests a hierarchical model among CSC inhibitors and their respective relevance. The hierarchical synthesis of twelve (12) primary CSC inhibitors is achieved through a comprehensive literature review and consultation with academics and CSC professionals. This study used semi-structured interviews, a fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) and a Fuzzy-MICMAC (FMICMAC) analysis to explore and establish the relationship between and among identified inhibitors. FISM is used to examine the interaction between inhibitors, while FMICMAC analysis is used to examine the nature of inhibitors on the basis of their dependence and driving power. The results of the FISM and FMICMAC analysis show the inter-relationships and relative dominance of identified inhibitors. The results show that some inhibitors are of high strategic importance due to their high driving power and low dependence. These inhibitors seek more management attention in order to improve their effectiveness. The result of a hierarchical model helps to understand the influence of a particular inhibitor on others. ‘Higher capital and operating costs’ occupy the highest level in the FISM model. The ‘fragmented cold supply chains’, ‘lack of skilled labor’, ‘inadequate information system infrastructure’ and ‘lack of commitment by top level management’ had strong driving power but weak dependence, which characterizes them as independent inhibitors. Management should be extra careful when dealing with these inhibitors as they influence the effects of other variables at the top of the FISM hierarchy in the overall management of the cold supply chain. The study also suggests a number of recommendations for addressing these inhibitors in cold supply chains operating in the UAE. With due attention and care for these inhibitors, the operation of the cold supply chains is likely to be even more successful.</jats:p>"

This type of mechanism is quite effective, since the majority of product returns management is performed by the retailer. However, in practical industries, the implementation of ROCLSC is still limited. In this study, we investigate a ROCLSC system that involves an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a retailer. OEM plays a role as a producer of new products, while the retailer is in charge of remanufacturing, collecting, as well as selling and distributing both newly manufactured and remanufactured products. We develop a mathematical model to maximize the profit of each party. Although several studies have developed models for cores acquisition, here we apply a different cores switching mechanism. We introduced the fixed rate and flat rate mechanisms used in the business-to-business (B2B) system, where product functions are very important to consumers. In addition, this research focuses on ROCLSC where most of the existing cores acquisition models are Manufacturer-Oriented Closed-Loop Supply Chain (MOCLSC). The result of this study shows that the retailer will get higher profits when the product returns are acquired through the fixed rate mechanism, rather than the flat rate mechanism. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of cores collected through the fixed rate mechanism will increase the retailer’s profit, as well as joint profit of both parties. From the results, we also point out an interesting note that the retailer should increase efforts to sell new products along with the increasing proportion of consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP) for remanufactured products. Hence, both OEM and retailer profits can be increased consecutively</jats:p>"

Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the “new normal” have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as “disruption tails.” While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic’s impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production–inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control.</jats:p>",

We examine a supply chain consisting of two competing module suppliers and a common manufacturer, in which the manufacturer sources two differentiated modules from two suppliers and then produces two competing products for consumers. A delegation relationship is applied to explore the possibility of the module services offered by the suppliers. When the service commission fees are fixed, there exist optimal commission fees to maximize the manufacturer's profit. Service commission fees, service efficiencies, service sensitivity, and market types greatly affect the service levels, prices, and profitability of each member in the supply chain. The manufacturer should strategically adopt differentiated pricing strategies and service provisions from two suppliers rather than the best service abilities of the suppliers. In the service‐level sensitivity market, the improved service levels are more attractive to consumers so that the manufacturer will charge high prices by investing more in services. Product services with “high quality, high price” are more suitable for high‐end consumers. We also consider the variable service commission fees and find that there are still some robust results except that the effects of the service incentives and the commission fees will be enlarged.</jats:p>",

Fuzzy information in the natural decision-making process is considered, linguistic variables are used to mitigate the uncertain levels in the criteria weights. First, FAHP (the weighting method) is adopted to evaluate and calculate each criterion’s relative significant fuzzy weight. FVIKOR (the compromised ranking method) is then used to rank the alternatives. The combination of FAHP and FVIKOR methods provides more accurate ranking results. As a result, reliability and delivery time, voice of customer, logistics cost, network management, and quality of service are the most impactful factors to the logistics outsourcing problem. Eventually, the optimized 3PLs were determined that fully meet the criteria of sustainable development. The developed integrated model offers the complete and robust 3PLs evaluation and selection process and can also be a powerful decision support tool for other industries.</jats:p>"

Illustrating the managing of overall supply chain capabilities among network responsiveness stems from the supply chain responsiveness concept. Several challenges to responsiveness prevent actors’ networks from fully benefitting from coordination. A management approach is employed to explore the impact of network responsiveness on the supply chain as an overarching strategy for safety and security. The study suggests three different approaches which differ in their impact on the network’s responsiveness: (i) an overall strategic planning approach, (ii) one integrated system approach for the overall response, and (iii) a coordination approach for managing the overall supply chain responsiveness strategy.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of this study is to identify and rank the significant barriers affecting the implementation of blockchain technology as a key component of cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM). This research relied on the “interpretive structural modeling (ISM)” technique in the structure of a hierarchical model to investigate the contextual relationships of identified challenges for blockchain adoption in CSCRM; it also classifies the influential challenges based on their driving and dependence powers. The results highlight that “cryptocurrency volatility” is the challenge at the top level of the hierarchy, implying weak driving power but it is strongly dependent on the other challenges. “Poor regulatory provisions”, “technology immaturity”, “dependent on input information from external oracles”, “scalability and bandwidth issues”, and “smart contract issues” are significant challenges for the adoption of blockchain in cyber supply chain risk management and are located at the bottom level of the hierarchy with higher driving power. The implications for theory and practice of the research are also highlighted.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A transport system can be defined as a complex system characterized by a random value of transport demand, variable weather and climatic factors, a set of characteristics of transport infrastructure, and a complex system of interconnections. One of the key modes of transport providing freight transport both in domestic and international traffic is road. Its mobility and the ability to deliver cargo from door to door is a unique competitive advantage over other modes of transport. To create an effective logistics infrastructure that meets the demand for domestic freight transport, first of all, information is needed on the needs for transport between regions of the country. Thus, it is necessary to look for mathematical approaches to modeling freight flows, combining their practical implementation using widely used software products (for example, MS Excel). The purpose of the paper is to build effective multifactor regression models of demand for input and output transportation of goods by road for each region of Ukraine according to publicly available statistical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The modern approach to modeling cargo flows requires fast processing of a large amount of statistical data. In addition, the method should be as universal as possible and capable of quick and simple changes under conditions of a change in statistical data. From this point of view, the most acceptable option can be considered to be the modeling of freight traffic using regression models based on correlation and regression analysis. In general, the task is to find the dependence of the demand for transportation on the factors that influence it. Such factors in the existing models are connected with various macroeconomic indicators, as well as the distance of delivery. The data of regional statistics of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and data of the “Lardi-Trans” website as the most widely used by freight carriers and shippers were taken as the initial data for modeling. A list of factors has been found that significantly influence the demand for freight transport by road between regions of Ukraine. A rating of influencing factors has been compiled, among which are the gross regional product, regional volumes of foreign trade in goods (imports) and gross regional product per one inhabitant of the region. The absolute values of the correlation coefficients are in the range 0.351-0.974. The lowest correlation coefficient is between the transportation distance and the demand for delivery, which proves a negligible relationship between the volume of regional transportation and the distance of delivery. Multivariate regression models with thirteen, five and two factors of influence on demand are built. Accuracy parameter values are acceptable for all model variants. The normalized R-squared of the obtained models does not fall below 84%, and the average approximation error does not rise above 1.6%, which is an excellent performance of the models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Emerging research within the field of personalised medicines has aimed to enhance patient treatment through the use of pharmaceutical products that are customised to the individual needs and preferences of the patient. The currently dominant production platforms of pharmaceutical products, however, regard a mass production paradigm and are thus unfeasible for the production and provision of personalised medicines. The production platforms are not designed or are intended for a customisation context. Operating such a context with the current supply chain entails challenges such as increasing costs, time to patient and efforts in quality assurance activities. To address these challenges, this paper presents four reconfigured pharmaceutical supply chain designs. A qualitative operational performance assessment elicits the strengths and weaknesses of the respective supply chain design operating in a customisation context. The results suggest that a later point of variegation, that is, the point in the supply chain where the final customisation is achieved, can relieve the operational effort of the stakeholders in the supply chain while providing the benefits of personalised medicines, that is, an enhanced treatment outcome of the patient. A trade-off remains, however, between the supply chain’s decreased operational effort and degree of necessary reconfigurations, such as introducing new functions to stakeholder operation, reallocating activities to other stakeholders or educating stakeholders. </jats:p>",

The study adopts as its methodology a systematic review of relevant literature covering the twin problems of the degradation of the environment and the shortage of natural resources currently caused by the fashion-garment industry, in search of feasible solutions centred on the concept of eco-fashion. The study also addresses how the concept of ecological clothing can generate a new mentality among consumers. The study identifies concepts, techniques and processes which can economically be applied in producing fashion garments from a more ecologically sound starting point. This paper also sheds light on how corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be practiced within the fashion supply chain.

This can be attributed to economic, environmental and/or regulatory motivations. Mathematical modeling of such systems has assisted decision-making processes and provided a better understanding of the behavior of such production and inventory environments. This paper reviews the literature on the modeling of reverse logistics inventory systems based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) and the joint economic lot size (JELS) settings to systematically analyze the mathematics involved in capturing the main characteristics of related processes. The literature is surveyed and classified according to the specific issues faced and modeling assumptions. Special attention is given to environmental issues. There are indications of the need for reverse logistics models' mathematics to follow current trends in ‘greening’ inventory and supply-chain models. The modeling of waste disposal, greenhouse-gas emissions, and energy consumption during production is considered as the most pressing priority for the future of reverse logistics models. An illustrative example for modeling reverse logistics inventory models with environmental implications is presented.</jats:p>"

This paper updates the river health assessment indicator system, weight, and assignment criteria in China by reviewing and examining the peer-reviewed literature. We propose an indicator system, weight, and criteria, validated by nine case studies and able to assess the country-scale river health. Our analysis shows that the rule layer of indicator system includes hydrology, water quality, aquatic organism, physical habitats, and functional service; its corresponding weights are set to 0.15, 0.21, 0.18, 0.22, and 0.24, respectively. The ten most representative indicators are selected that incorporates the indicator layer with their corresponding weights. The evaluation based on case studies shows that in eight out of nine cases, our results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies. Therefore, the suggested index system, weight, and three-assessment criteria are well suited for the complex cases in China. This paper can serve as a reference for a river health assessment and present a comprehensive listing of assessment criteria.</jats:p>",

The wide linewidth laser and cascaded long period fiber grating (CLPFG) band rejection filter are used to suppress the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effects, respectively, integrating sphere like, scattering light guide cone and thermoelectric power generation improve PC efficiency. A HPL over SMF remote power supply system is developed and tested. The injected fiber power is 10 W, the wavelength of 1550 nm laser is transmitted through 103 km single‐mode fiber, and then 26 mW power is converted for the sensor.

It includes mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models of the economic, environmental and social impact of IBDSC, and respective criteria defined in terms of costs. The purpose is to obtain the optimal number, sizes and locations of bio-refineries and solid waste plants; the areas and amounts of feedstocks needed for biodiesel production; and the transportation mode. The approach is applied on a real case study in which the territory of Bulgaria with its 27 districts is considered. Optimization problems are formulated for a 5-year period using either environmental or economic criteria and the remainder are defined as constraints. The obtained results show that in the case of the economic criterion, 14% of the agricultural land should be used for sunflower and 2% for rapeseed cultivation, while for the environmental case, 12% should be used for rapeseed and 3% for sunflower. In this case, the price of biodiesel is 14% higher, and the generated pollutants are 6.6% lower. The optimal transport for both cases is rail.</jats:p>"

This study developed Machine Learning (ML) models to detect leaks in the WDN. Water pressure data under leaking versus non-leaking conditions were generated with holistic WSN simulation code EPANET considering factors such as the fluctuating user demands, data noise, and the extent of leaks, etc. The results indicate that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a supervised ML model, can accurately classify leaking versus non-leaking conditions; it, however, requires balanced dataset under both leaking and non-leaking conditions, which is difficult for a real WSN that mostly operate under normal service condition. Autoencoder neural network (AE), an unsupervised ML model, is further developed to detect leak with unbalanced data. The results show AE ML model achieved high accuracy when leaks occur in pipes inside the sensor monitoring area, while the accuracy is compromised otherwise. This observation will provide guidelines to deploy monitoring sensors to cover the desired monitoring area. A novel strategy is proposed based on multiple independent detection attempts to further increase the reliability of leak detection by the AE and is found to significantly reduce the probability of false alarm. The trained AE model and leak detection strategy is further tested on a testbed WSN and achieved promising results. The ML model and leak detection strategy can be readily deployed for in-service WSNs using data obtained with internet-of-things (IoTs) technologies such as smart meters.</jats:p>",

First, this paper presents a mathematical model, analyzes the time-domain robust control - linear matrix inequality and regional D stability and turns the analysis of the problem of robust control problem to a one of linear matrix inequality (LMI) convex optimization problem through the augmentation of system matrix dimension. Then, the YALMIP toolbox is used to solve for the status feedback gain matrix. Finally the whole system is simulated and tested.

The effects of electrolysis voltage and cathode materials on efficiency, energy consumption and scale crystal form of electrochemical water treatment technology were studied experimentally. The experimental results show that electrochemical water treatment can effectively remove more than 40% of the TDS (total dissolved solids) in the influent. The electrolysis voltage has a great influence on the removal rate of hardness ions. The optimum electrolytic voltage for the titanium plate cathode is 25 V. At this electrolytic voltage, the treatment capacity of the titanium plate cathode is 16% higher than that of the copper plate cathode, and the energy consumption is 16% lower than that of the copper plate. Titanium plates are more efficient than copper plates and consume less energy. The effects of electrochemical water treatment on the scale crystal form were investigated by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffraction). Electrochemical water treatment increases the mass fraction of aragonite in the calcium carbonate scale and changed the microscopic surface structure of calcium carbonate scale.</jats:p>",

The optimization model is constrained by the demand for bike-sharing, urban traffic carrying capacity (road network and parking facilities carrying capacities), and the flow conservation of shared bikes in each traffic analysis zone. The model was formulated through mixed-integer programming with the aim of minimizing the total costs for users and bike-sharing enterprises (including the travel cost of users, production and maintenance costs of shared bikes, and repositioning costs). CPLEX was used to obtain the optimal solution for the model. Then, the optimization model was applied to 183 traffic analysis zones in Nanjing, China. The results showed that not only were user demands met, but the load ratios of the road network and parking facilities with respect to bike-sharing in each traffic zone were all decreased to lower than 1.0 after the optimization, which established the rationality and effectiveness of the optimization results.</jats:p>"

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of the flocculants/coagulants chitosan, <jats:italic>Moringa oleifera</jats:italic> seed (MOS), and poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) in settling cyanobacterial species present in the Legedadi Reservoir. We also tested whether coagulant-treated reservoir water promotes cyanobacteria growth.

Compared to other coagulants, MOS of 30 mg/L concentration, with the removal efficiency of 93.6%, was the most effective in removing cyanobacterial species without causing cell lysis. Contrary to our expectation, PAC was the least effective coagulant. Moreover, reservoir water treated with MOS alone or MOS combined with chitosan did not support any growth of cyanobacteria during the first two weeks of the experiment. Our data indicate that the efficacy of a flocculant/coagulant in the removal of cyanobacteria is influenced by the uniqueness of individual lakes/reservoirs, implying that mitigation methods should consider the unique characteristic of the lake/reservoir.</jats:p>"

Simultaneously, the industry has also been faced with supply chain resilience concerns. Research on the intersection of supply chain sustainability and resilience is nascent and is a consequence of their observed mutual influences. However, confusion about concepts, implementation methods, and measurements of sustainable and resilient supply chains remains. This study completes a systematic literature review that critically examines several major observations and directions. We find the concept of sustainable supply chains is more established, and general agreement on its theoretical foundations exists. Supply chain resilience is relatively less mature. The nexus and relationships between the two topics are often incoherent: there is confusion on sustainable and resilient supply chains establishment; there is no clarity on what practices could jointly advance both areas. A major conflict exists since sustainability generally focuses on efficiency, while resilience seeks effectiveness. We recommend studies to analyze implementation relationships and impact. We also observe that performance measurement systems should be developed to assess supply chain sustainability and resilience performance taking with explicit consideration time horizons considered in these measures.</jats:p>",

Even the analysis of the availability of scarce minerals from European Union sources leads to the suggestion that a wide-ranging approach is essential.

Our main findings are: (1) the Reform increased households’ hidden credit demand, but not their effective credit demand; (2) the Reform had no significant effect on effective credit supply or a household's credit access; (3) the Reform increased the likelihood of non‐price credit rationing, in particular risk rationing; and (4) in the subsample of households living in counties where the local governments explicitly permitted the use of land as collateral, the Reform had a positive effect on credit supply; but in the subsample of households living in counties where land collateral was not explicitly permitted, the Reform was associated with an increase in non‐price rationing. Findings of this study are not only useful to assess the economic and social implications of rural land titling in China, but they also offer insights in understanding similar policies in other countries, particularly developing economies.</jats:p>",

The inter-continental supply chain is verified and validated using an integration of an interactive mapping application and a simulation platform. The integrated model is applied to a case study in which agricultural pellets are produced in six locations in Canada and shipped and discharged at the three major ports in Western Europe. The cost of agricultural pellets in the six locations is estimated to be in the range of EUR 92–95/tonne (CAD 138–142/tonne), which is comparable with the recent cost of wood pellets produced in small-scale pellet plants (EUR 99–109/tonne). The average agricultural pellet price shipped from the six plants to the three ports in Western Europe is estimated to be in a range of EUR 183–204 (CAD 274–305/tonne), 29–42% more expensive that the average recent price of wood pellets (EUR 143/tonne) at the same ports. There are several potential areas in the agricultural pellet supply chains that can reduce the pellet production and distribution costs in the mid and long terms, making them affordable supplement to the existing wood pellet markets. Potential economic activities generated by the production of pellets in farm communities can be significant. The generated annual revenue in the biomass logistics system in all six locations is estimated to be about CAD 21.80 million. In addition, the logistics equipment fleet needs 176 local operators with a potential annual income of CAD 2.18 million.</jats:p>"

There is a lack of research results that can meet engineering applications at home and abroad. The design of a 500 kV HIET with dry‐type insulation is proposed, using 10 cascade connected 50 kV sub‐transformers (STs), which uses silicon rubber suitable for DC voltage as the main insulation material. High‐voltage (HV) winding of ST adopts double‐shielding structure of coil semi‐conductive shielding and inner semi‐conductive shielding to improve electric field distribution. The simulation analysis of an electric field at different insulation thicknesses and temperatures shows that the electric field decreases with an increase in thickness of insulation. When the thickness is greater than 25 mm, the electric field reduction effect is significantly weakened. The electric field is closely related to temperature, when at 20°C, the electric field between double‐shielding is relatively uniform. When at 70°C, the inner shielding electric field is much higher than coil shielding, and undergoes obvious reversal. In addition, the 500 kV HIET's electric field has been analysed. The 50 0kV HIET prototype has been manufactured and passed the type test, and successfully applied to the 500 kV Zhangbei DC grid project.</jats:p>",

This forest in unique to Europe because it is almost entirely created and managed by man for specific industries. On the basis of a material flow analysis, we assessed the upstream supply chain of maritime pine from 2013 to 2019, using a cradle-to-gate approach. The assessment is based on data provided by Alliance Forêts Bois, an important stakeholder of the region and leader in the production of forest resources in France. For various reasons, the harvest totals decreased 10% in the last years. We identified a clear orientation to specific industries—in 2019, 45% was used as pulpwood. This is due to the overall design of the current territory, species of tree, and market values of the pulp and paper industry. The current design provides a limited supply of old growth trees, which produce high-quality logs for construction-based products, and are also more resistant to climate variability. A future shift or balance in raw material flows could be a crucial step in protecting the long-term economic viability of the region. This article aims to contribute to new attempts in providing comprehensive views of stocks and flows in the French forest-wood supply chain.</jats:p>"

The results show that the influence of the voltage variation on SEU cross section clearly depends on the LET value which is above heavy ion LET threshold no matter whether the SRAM is non-hardened 6T SRAM or radiation-hardened double dual interlocked cells (DICE) SRAM. When the LET value is lower than the LET threshold of MCU, the SEU only manifests single cell upset, the SEU cross section increases with the decrease of voltage. The lower the LET value, the higher the SEU sensitivity to the voltage variation is. Lowering the voltage has no evident influence on SEU cross section while the LET value is above the LET threshold of MCU. Moreover, the reduction of the voltage can result in a decrease in the highest-order MCU event cross section due to the decrease of charge collection efficiency of the outer sub-sensitive volume within a certain voltage range. With further scaling the feature size of devices down, it is suggested that the dependence of SEU on voltage variation should be paid special attention to for heavy ions with very low LET or the other particles with very low energy for nanometer commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SRAM.</jats:p>",

Based on the good development of my country’s electricity sales market environment, this paper designs the grid-connected microgrid power supply optimization system and its distribution and conversion capabilities to optimize the quality of electricity sales and optimize the grid configuration. In view of the fact that the operation of the microgrid system in my country’s market environment is more flexible at this stage, after a long time simulation test, a simulation analysis of the operation status of the grid-connected microgrid is carried out. In the course of the experiment, the electricity price in the distribution point process and the real-time changes of the electricity purchase price in the market will be considered comprehensively, and the processing in the micro-electricity system based on its distribution transformer capacity optimization system and the load forecast result will be considered. This article uses a power grid project actually constructed in East China as an example to analyze the results of simulation calculations. Then the NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the optimized model for the cost and benefit composition of the grid. The optimized configuration method of the optical storage microgrid proposed in this paper can ensure the reliable power supply of users’ important loads during the off-grid operation of the microgrid, increase the installed capacity of distributed photovoltaics, and the configured energy storage system also allows enterprises to achieve low electricity prices. Purchase electric energy at any time and use it to supplement the load’s demand for electric energy during peak electricity price periods, thereby increasing revenue. The experimental research results show that the design of the grid-connected microgrid power supply capacity optimization system under the electricity sales environment studied in this paper can effectively reduce the additional investment required by external loads and the capacity of optical storage and distribution transformers. Only then can the economic marketing profit of the microgrid be improved to a certain extent.</jats:p>",

Therefore, along with increasing the application of technology and effective business models, it is necessary to increase the connectivity of the infrastructure systems of industrial parks, roads, and seaports of regions and the country. Over the past decades, Vietnamese businesses have been step-by-step going through many stages from production, packaging, quality, hygiene, and safety to grasping new stages in the domestic and global value chain. In many industries, businesses are increasing the content of their own designs, exploiting brands, and approaching consumption networks in the target market. The role of the distribution center is becoming more and more important in ensuring a seamless and flawless supply chain. In particular, the distribution center is the most sensitive contact point between supply and demand in each enterprise. Therefore, the key mission of a distribution center is to reconcile supply and demand requirements. Distribution center location selection problems usually involve multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria that the decision maker must take into account for assessing the symmetrical impact of the criteria to reach the most accurate result. In this study, the authors propose a hybrid MCDM model based on Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) Algorithm to support the distribution location selection problem of perishable agricultural products. The proposed model is then applied to the numerical case study of the sweet potato product of the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. The contribution of this research is to propose an MCDM model for improving the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain through selecting a location distribution center. This proposed model can be applied to the agricultural supply chain around the world.</jats:p>"

The data used in this study are data generated by the movement of rice commodities and data on rice production in West Java Province in 2016. The analytical approach used is linear regression and statistical tests are performed on the regression equation function to test the significance level. Based on the results of linear regression analysis, the function equation is y = 316.21 + 0.16x. It can be concluded that the greater the amount of rice production, the greater the generation of rice commodity movement. In addition, from statistical tests, it can be seen that the amount of rice production has a strong relationship and has a positive and significant linear effect on the rise of the movement of rice commodities in West Java.</jats:p>"

This study looks beyond the direct impact of the program and examines the indirect impacts on labor transitions as well as the engagement of children and the elderly in the labor market. The study employs the combined propensity score matching and difference‐in‐difference technique to obtain robust estimates in examining the effect of the cash transfer program on labor shifts of beneficiaries. Overall, the paper finds that cash transfer programs can have productive impacts and dismisses the assertion that such grants end up making beneficiaries perpetually dependent. The heterogeneous analysis provides evidence that the results are differentiated by age but not by gender. Based on the evidence from this study, we recommend that as LEAP continues to expand and reach more beneficiaries in poor districts, it needs to ensure that the issue of complementarity of poverty reduction programs is a key feature of its design. Indeed, findings from the study point to the fact that graduation from cash transfer is possible and therefore, programs must seek to maximize this potential.</jats:p>",

Improving the efficiency of water embedded in rice production and supply could have great implications for food and water security. This study starts from Yunnan, a traditional rice producing and consuming province in southwest China, and analyses its rice supply structure and dynamics, together with embedded water footprints (WFs) of three other regions: Northeast China, South and Southwest China and Southeast Asia. The results show that Yunnan has been through drastic food change in the past decades, leading to an increasing production and supply gap. Yunnan is found to have the least WF (778.2 m3/t) for rice production across the study regions, while Northeast China consumes the highest blue WF (364.6 m3/t) and blue to total WF ratio (97.7%). The study indicates that Northeast China is at risk of groundwater deficit due to rice production and export and the current rice production and consumption pattern is inefficient. The study suggests that policies for groundwater extraction, water resource price and international trade need to be in place to ensure sustainable food supply and water use at regional and national levels.</jats:p>",

It is very suitable for power supply for sensors or mobile electrical equipment in complex high potential environment, such as patrol UAV. Because the beam quality of high-power semiconductor laser is far worse than that of other types of lasers, when it is used as the transmitter of beam shaping system, it must be equipped with corresponding beam shaping system to obtain laser beam with uniform spot, appropriate size and small divergence angle, so as to ensure that the photoelectric cell module has high conversion efficiency and meet the needs of long-distance laser transmission. In this paper, a beam collimation scheme based on aspheric lens group is designed, which integrates optical devices with low cost, reduces the energy loss in the process of laser transmission, and obtains laser beam with certain intensity uniformity. The test shows that the collimator can better meet the parameter requirements of the collimation system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>India is the largest jute and fifth largest maize producing country in the world. In India maize is commonly stored and transported in jute bags which are used multiple times. Aflatoxin contamination of maize is a major issue in India. This study evaluated the potential impact of re-using jute bags on the risk of aflatoxin contamination of maize in the food supply chain. A total of 121 jute bags were collected in India; 95 had been used for maize and 26 bags were new. Significantly higher numbers of viable aflatoxigenic fungi were counted from re-used bags (27.8 times) (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05), than the number from new bags. There was no significant difference between aflatoxin concentration found in the re-used jute bags and the new jute bags (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&gt;0.05). Further analysis revealed that the aflatoxigenic fungal population (3.0 times) and aflatoxin concentration (1.2 times) were significantly higher in jute bags that had been used for maize with higher aflatoxin contamination (14-188.4 μg/kg total aflatoxins) than in those that had been used for maize with lower contamination (0.8-5.4 μg/kg total aflatoxins) (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05). The significant positive correlation (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05) between the aflatoxigenic fungal population of used jute bags and aflatoxin contamination of their packed maize indicated there is a risk of cross-contamination in the supply chain introduced by re-using jute bags. This is the first study to systematically reveal the potential impact of re-using jute bags on the fungal population and aflatoxin contamination risk. The application of readily applied treatments to re-used jute bags would help to minimise the aflatoxin contamination.</jats:p>",

However, the abundance of solar irradiation in tropical Africa can be advantageously exploited to serve the inhabitants in this region, particularly the extremely low-income earners who not only have access to very inadequate power supply but also experience much discomfort in terms of poor ventilation and heat-triggered infections. This paper focuses on developing a small household-sized solar power-based electric energy supply system together with a temperature control circuit to power a direct current (DC) fan, and a light-regulating circuit to control LED lamps—with additional features such as a digital clock, a remote control, and mobile phone charging units. The system also has a provision for power supply through the mains (whenever it is available). The overall intent is to provide the rural dwellers with a cost-effective way of powering essential devices for basic economic living. This affordable solution is designed, simulated, and constructed to have hardware and software sections supported by various components and devices such as Arduino Mega, Lm35 sensor, RF transceivers, diodes, transistors, regulators, batteries, lamps, a DC fan, etc. The sensor senses room temperature, which is compared with the reference temperature of 25°C programmed on the Arduino microcontroller. When the temperature is less than 25°C, the fan remains stationary but when the temperature is higher than the reference value, the fan begins to run. As the temperature rises further, the speed of the fan increases to maintain adequate ventilation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High incidence of postharvest losses is a major challenge to global food security. Addressing postharvest losses is a better strategy to increase business efficiency and improve food security rather than simply investing more resources to increase production. Global estimates show that fruit and vegetables are the highest contributors to postharvest losses and food waste, with 45% of production lost. This represents 38% of total global food losses and waste. However, the lack of primary data on postharvest losses at critical steps in the fruit value chain and the unknown economic, environmental and resource impacts of these losses makes it difficult to formulate mitigation strategies. This paper quantifies postharvest losses and quality attributes of ‘Crimson Seedless’ table grapes at farm and simulated retail levels. Table grapes were sampled from four farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, the largest deciduous fruit production and export region in Southern Africa. Mean on-farm losses immediately after harvest was 13.9% in 2017 and 5.97% in 2018, ranging from 5.51% to 23.3% for individual farms. The main reason for on-farm losses was mechanical damage (7.1%). After 14 days in cold storage (−0.3 ± 0.7 °C, 81.3 ± 4.1% RH), mean grape losses were 3.05% in 2017 and 2.41% in 2018, which increased to 7.41% in 2017 and 2.99% in 2018, after 28 days. After 10 days of further storage under simulated market conditions (5.4 ± 0.6 °C, 83.7 ± 2.9% RH), fruit losses were 3.65% during retail marketing and 4.36% during export. Storing grapes under ambient conditions (25.1 ± 1.3 °C and 46.6 ± 6.0% RH) resulted in a higher incidence of losses, increasing from 7.03 to 9.59 and 14.29% after 3, 7 and 10 days, respectively. The socioeconomic impacts of these postharvest losses amounted to financial losses of over ZAR 279 million (USD 17 million according to the conversion rate of 20 October 2020) annually, and this was associated with the loss of 177.43 million MJ of fossil energy, 4.8 million m3 of fresh water and contributed to the emission of approximately 52,263 tons of CO2 equivalent.</jats:p>"

Here, Pcrit is defined as the PO2 at which physiological oxygen supply (α0) reaches its maximum capacity (α; µmol O2 g−1 h−1 kPa−1). α is a species- and temperature-specific constant describing the oxygen dependency of the maximum metabolic rate (MMR=PO2×α) or, equivalently, the MR dependence of Pcrit (Pcrit=MR/α). We describe the α-method, in which the MR is monitored as oxygen declines and, for each measurement period, is divided by the corresponding PO2 to provide the concurrent oxygen supply (α0=MR/PO2). The highest α0 value (or, more conservatively, the mean of the three highest values) is designated as α. The same value of α is reached at Pcrit for any MR regardless of previous or subsequent metabolic activity. The MR need not be constant (regulated), standardized or exhibit a clear breakpoint at Pcrit for accurate determination of α. The α-method has several advantages over Pcrit determination and non-linear analyses, including: (1) less ambiguity and greater accuracy, (2) fewer constraints in respirometry methodology and analysis, and (3) greater predictive power and ecological and physiological insight. Across the species evaluated here, α values are correlated with MR, but not Pcrit. Rather than an index of hypoxia tolerance, Pcrit is a reflection of α, which evolves to support maximum energy demands and aerobic scope at the prevailing temperature and oxygen level.</jats:p>",

Food security is the dominant part of the socio-economic policy and the primary task of the leaders of any state, a necessary factor for improving the quality and increasing the comfort of life of the population [2]. The problems of the formation and development of the Russian food market in general and regional food markets in particular in the border regions remain not fully understood. In the conducted research, insufficient attention was paid to the assessment of the conditions and factors that determine the process of achieving the goal of regulating the food market in a market economy, the specifics of the methods, mechanism and consequences of regulating the food markets of the regions, the assessment and methods of ensuring food security of both the country as a whole and the Far East in particular. The revision of the policy of state influence on economic processes required the development of a concept of state support for various subjects of economic relations and the formation of mechanisms for regulating markets, including food markets.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the desired transition toward sustainable and multimodal mobility, few tools have been developed either to quantify mode use diversity or to assess the effects of transportation system enhancements on multimodal travel behaviors. This paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing a methodology to appraise the causal impact of transport supply improvement on the evolution of multimodality levels between 2013 and 2018 in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). First, the participants of two household travel surveys were clustered into types of people (PeTys) to overcome the cross-sectional nature of the data. This allowed changes in travel behavior per type over a five-year period to be evaluated. A variant of the Dalton index was then applied on a series of aggregated (weighted) intensities of use of several modes to measure multimodality. Various sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the parameters of this indicator (sensitivity to the least used modes, intensity metric, and mode independency). Finally, a difference-in-differences causal inference approach was explored to model the influence of the improvement of three alternative transport services (transit, bikesharing, and station-based carsharing) on the evolution of modal variability by type of people. The results revealed that, after controlling for different socio-demographic and spatial attributes, increasing transport supply had a significant and positive impact on multimodality. This outcome is therefore good news for the mobility of the future as alternative modes of transport emerge. </jats:p>",

Another way to do this is to study the company to find out how the supply chain system is carried out by the company i.e. the company uses 2 echelons, single item, single objective, centralized strategy, and no quantity discount. From the references studied, the included environmental model reference which has 4 echelons attributes, multi objective, multi-item, and centralization can be taken as the basic model. It requires developer models with quantity discounts, multi stages, multi items, centralized strategy, multi objectives in order for the basic model that can approach the company’s system. The developed model is supply chain models in natural rubber products by considering quantity-discounts and environmental factors with quantity discounts, 3 echelons, centralized strategy, multi-items, and multi-objectives.</jats:p>",

The disunity of the direction of existing approaches in assessing the efficiency of operation of district heating systems does not allow a comprehensive assessment of the overall efficiency of the functioning of the technological sequence of the entire system.\nIt is proposed to consider efficiency as the probability of full functioning of all elements of the heat supply system.\nIt is shown that the heat output of the boiler house is proportional to the power consumption of the boiler house and is approximated by a periodic function.\nIt is shown that the main element of the heat supply system, which determines its efficiency, is the heat-generating source. As a result of the study, it is determined that the efficiency of the heat-generating source functioning increases as the maximum value of its efficiency is reached.\nNumerical modeling has shown that the flexible use of the installed heat generator capacity contributes to an increase in the efficiency factor from 0.53 to 0.70 and the overall efficiency of the heat supply system can be increased by more than 30 %. When designing a boiler house, it was recommended to provide for the installation of capacities with gradation 1; 0.5; 0.25.\nIt is shown that the OEE indicator allows one to characterize the efficiency of both the heat supply system as a whole and its individual components, and can be used in the design and analysis of the operation of systems</jats:p>"

However, when assessing the reliability of heat supply systems, it is necessary to take into account not only the service life and the amount of depreciation wear of heat network elements, but also their real state in specific operating conditions. The use of cluster analysis in addition to the currently used method of heat network reliability assessment allows us to take into account the variety of factors that affect the operability of pipelines of the heat supply system, and thereby increase the accuracy of calculations when assessing their residual resource.

Therefore, this study investigated the aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) concentrations in the drinking water supply chain at the basin because of its prolonged persistence and toxic characteristics in the aquatic environment. Three replicates of water samples were collected from the river, outlets of WTPs, household tap and filtered water, respectively, in 2015, for analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Higher concentration of these metals was found in household tap water than in the treated water at the WTPs; however, the concentration of these metals at the four stages of the drinking water supply chain conformed to the drinking water quality standard set by the World Health Organization. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests also found that metal concentration removal significantly varied among the eight WTPs as well as the five types of household water filtration systems. With regards to the investigated household filtered water, the distilled filtration system was found to be more effective in removing metal concentration because of better management. Therefore, a two-layer water filtration system could be introduced in the Langat River Basin to obtain safe drinking water supply at the household level.</jats:p>"

The research method used qualitative by reviewing documents and interviews community-based groundwater stakeholders and managers. The results showed that most people feel comfortable using water. They had long been less aware of the risks of groundwater exploitation. There were patterns and characteristics of the area, economy, and groundwater utilization by the community that affected their acceptance of switching to a new water supply system.

These changes have accelerated the pace of life and improved the quality of life, but have also had some negative effects. For example, in China, in the supply chain of the takeout delivery platform, the service deliverer often violates traffic rules to shorten the delivery time. This phenomenon has aroused widespread concern in society. From the perspective of sustainable operation of platform enterprises and reducing social risks, this issue is worthy of in-depth study. First, this study analyses the optimal decision-making about pricing and service efforts, then discusses the supply chain coordination mechanism under a revenue-sharing contract, and finds that the platform’s service level is related to the efforts of deliverers and the elasticity of demand/service. However, under a traditional revenue-sharing contract, the economic returns are not enough to motivate deliverers to avoid violations of traffic regulations; When the increase of cost caused by the improvement of service level is not fully covered by the revenue sharing from the platform, they have a strong incentive to break the rules even if the optimal coordination can be achieved in the supply chain. Second, this study reconstructs the revenue-sharing contract by adding social responsibility to the objective function of the platform enterprises and designs contingent rewards to regulate behaviours of service deliverers. The results indicate that when the contingent reward factor reaches a certain level, the optimal effort of the service deliverers is constrained within a reasonable range, which can to some extent reduce the occurrence of illegal behaviour. Our findings offer fresh insights on coordination of supply chain in the sharing economy, identify new direction for future research on CSR, and provide managers of platform enterprises with suggestions for regulating the behaviour of partners and balance the economic and social benefits.</jats:p>",

Finally, the average value of the node score is subtracted from the score of the node to calculate the information centralized scoring, as well as the establishment of Spark operation framework, to achieve the logistics park supply chain information pushing. In the simulation experiment, the international land port logistics park of a city is selected as a case to test.

The effect of foliar P fertilization has not been widely studied in maize, despite it being a crop with high P demand during juvenile development. Our aim was to investigate the effect of P foliar application during juvenile development on maize crop growth and yield. We conducted outdoor pot experiments to investigate the effect on P uptake, translocation, and dry matter following three applications of foliar fertilizer of various P formulations and with additional P soil fertilization between the 4th and 6th leaf stage during two growing seasons. To determine direct and possible long-term effects, plants were harvested at various developmental stages. P foliar application resulted in a significant increase in P concentration in all plant parts ten days after the last application, regardless of P form, nutritional status, or year. P concentration remained high only in those parts of the plant that were present during foliar application. Biomass effects were sporadically visible until flowering, but not at maturity. We conclude that foliar P fertilization during juvenile development does not increase yield but might nevertheless be a useful remedy for short-term P deficits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the deepening of reform and opening up, the social management function of county government is becoming more and more important. As one of the symbols of the maturity of modern country, public service function is not only a test of the comprehensive ability of the country, but also a profound practice of serving the people. Aiming at the problem that traditional genetic algorithm is easy to fall into local optimal solution and its performance is unstable, an adaptive genetic algorithm (CEAGA) based on co-evolution is proposed. And then combined with some of the constraints inherent in the battlefield situation, a comprehensive evaluation model was established. The analysis on social cooperative governance is carried based on the fuzzy TOPSIS which is utilised for making multi criteria decision making situations. Research shows that the innovation of the public service supply mechanism must respect the reality of China’s political ecology, ensure the government’s dominant position in the governance of public affairs, and at the same time correctly respond to the development of social forces. The theory of collaborative governance also provides a new research perspective for the innovation and development of public service mechanisms.</jats:p>",

Smallholder farmers in sub-Sahara Africa are particularly more vulnerable to the effects of climate change leading to loss of income and livelihood thus affecting global food security. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is emerging as a viable option to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by supporting rain-fed agriculture through supplemental irrigation. However, smallholder farmers are still grappling with a myriad of challenges hindering them from reaping the benefits of their investment in RWH systems. This review explores some of the factors behind the poor performance of RWH systems in Kenya and also seeks to suggest techniques that can be applied to optimize the design parameters for improved performance and the adoption of RWH systems. According to the review, RWH has the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change among smallholder farmers. It allows for crop production beyond the growing season through supplemental irrigation. However, their impacts have been minimal due to the consistent poor performance of RWH systems. This is attributed to inefficiencies in design and construction brought about by lack of required technical skills among RWH system designers and implementers. Proper design and implementation are therefore paramount for better performance and adoption of RWH systems in the region. This will ensure that RWH systems are reliable, technically and economically feasible as well as possess a desirable water-saving efficiency.</jats:p>",

Automotive Fuel Cell applications present several challenges for implementing a turbo-type air compressor. When operating a fuel cell in high-temperature or high-altitude locations, the FC stack must be pressurized to prevent dry-up. The flow rate vs pressure conditions that the FC must pass through or in some cases operate at are typically within the surge region of a turbo-type air compressor. Additionally, Toyota requires quick air transient response (&amp;lt; 1 sec) for power generation, energy management, and FC dry-up prevention. If the turbo-type air compressor is not precisely controlled during quick transients, it can easily enter the surge region. To solve the above issues, we developed a new air supply controller which can avoid compressor surge by controlling 3 variables, ‘FC stack air flowrate’, ‘FC stack air pressure’, and ‘FC stack air Bypass’ independently with high accuracy. The controller was designed using a model-based development approach. At first, the physical characteristics of the air systems compressor, valves, pipes, and FC stack were modeled and integrated into a system level simulation that can run real-time on-board the vehicle Engine Control Unit (ECU). Next, the feedforward and feedback (PI) control were developed by implementing inverse models of the air system component equations. We confirmed that this control development approach could achieve Toyota’s air supply control performance requirements and prevent turbo-type air compressor surge.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

In general, the studied district is situated in the territory with a shortage of fresh groundwater. Currently, the water supply to Azovsky Nemetsky (German) National District settlements is provided by a complex of hydraulic constructions of the Lyubino-Isilkul and Tavrichesky group water conduits. These pipes take water from the Irtysh River as part of water intake and treatment facilities, water pipelines and a pressure distribution network. In addition to the generally accepted water supply from the group water conduit we define the aquifers of the lower Miocene deposits of the Abrosimov (N1 <jats:italic>ab</jats:italic>) and upper Oligocene deposits of the Zhuravsky suites (P3 zr) with water mineralization from 1.3 to 5.4g/l. as the most potentially productive in the period of increasing anthropogenic load within Azovsky Nemetsky (German) National District.

And the contribution of the model is that marketing effort and water purity has been considered. First, four models including the centralized model (model B) and decentralized models (models BM, I, and II) are established and analyzed. Second, the Stackelberg game model is used to discuss the pricing strategy of water supply chain members in centralized and decentralized scenarios. The comparison results show that revenue-sharing contract is beneficial to improve the level of product greening, the profit of supply chain members, and the overall profit of the water supply chain compared with model BM. However, it leads to the decrease of retailers’ green marketing efforts and the wholesale price of water. In addition, revenue-sharing contract through bargaining makes bigger influence than revenue-sharing contract. Marketing can stimulate the increase of the green product’s market demand on one hand, and on the other hand, it generates the amount of marketing cost. In this study, the profit is that marketing produces cannot offset the cost that it brings. Thus, it will be important to take some measures to make up the loss that marketing generated.</jats:p>",

The process produces an intermediate energy carrier (Fischer-Tropsch (FT) hydrocarbon product), which can be refined to transportation fuels using existing refineries. The FlexCHX process can be integrated into various combined heat and power (CHP) production systems, both industrial CHPs and communal district heating units. In the summer season, renewable fuels are produced from biomass and hydrogen; the hydrogen is produced from water <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> electrolysis that is driven by low-cost excess electricity from the grid. In the dark winter season, the plant is operated only with biomass in order to maximise the production of the much-needed heat, electricity and FT hydrocarbons. Most of the invested plant components are in full use throughout the year with only the electrolysis unit being operated seasonally. The catalytic reformer plays a key role in this process by converting tars and light hydrocarbon gases into synthesis gas (syngas) and by bringing the main gas constituents towards equilibrium. Developmental precious metal catalysts were used, and an optimal reformer concept was established and tested at pilot scale. Reforming results obtained at pilot gasification tests with commercial nickel catalysts and with the developed precious metal catalysts are presented.</jats:p>",

Insufficient records, a lack of digitalization and standardization of processes, and information exchange are some of the most critical challenges, which can be tackled with disruptive technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Studies provide evidence that novel technological and sustainable practices in FSCs are necessary. This paper aims to describe current practical applications of DLTs and IoT in FSCs, investigating the challenges of implementation, and potentials for future research directions, thus contributing to achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Within a systematic literature review, the content of 69 academic publications was analyzed, describing aspects of implementation and measures to address the challenges of scalability, security, and privacy of DLT, and IoT solutions. The challenges of high costs, standardization, regulation, interoperability, and energy consumption of DLT solutions were also classified as highly relevant, but were not widely addressed in literature. The application of DLTs in FSCs can potentially contribute to 6 strategic SDGs, providing synergies and possibilities for more sustainable, traceable, and transparent FSCs.</jats:p>"

Least developed countries (LDCs), which have a high prospect of conversion to OA, are underrepresented in the literature related to the yield potential of OA, and its impact on regional food security. This paper aims to assess food and nutrient (calorie, protein, and fat) supply, thereby contributing to food security, from OA using yield ratio (YR) in LDCs and to compare this with North America (NA). Literature is the main source of data to estimate YR. Food supply data available in FAOSTAT for 1963–2013 along with the YR is used to estimate food and nutrient supply from OA in 2013. YR of crops shows a higher yield from OA in LDCs compared to NA. The food supply in LDCs between 1963 and 2013 increased at a higher rate than in NA. However, per capita nutrient supply is growing at a meager rate in LDCs; calorie and protein supply are just above the minimum threshold level and fat supply is still below the threshold level. Cereal is the single most important food item contributing to nutrient supply in LDCs, indicating a lack of dietary diversity. Thus, with relatively higher yields and crop diversity, and localized production and distribution systems, OA will have important contributions in dealing with persistent food insecurity in LDCs. However, a concerted effort is necessary to achieve yield gain and wider acceptance of OA.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drought is caused by a long period of lack of rainfall and water resources, and has a great impact on the life and ecosystem of both humans and animals. It is particularly important for the agricultural sector, which is closely related to food security. Global warming, urbanization, and industrialization have led to a gradually increasing demand for agricultural water. In response, Korea has steadily developed its agricultural water sources to reduce rising damage to the agricultural sector due to climate change. The severity of drought is evaluated by using meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic drought indexes. The agricultural drought index is evaluated using soil moisture and crop dryness, and the hydrological drought index is evaluated based on water shortage by comparing demands with water resources available for supply, such as rivers and groundwater, reservoirs and dams. However, these methods were found to over- or under-estimate the relatively low sensitivity of agricultural water as they assess the shortage of water for life, industry, and agriculture. Therefore, in this study, we developed the Agricultural Water Demand and Supply Drought Index (AWDSDI), which evaluates agricultural drought by analyzing water supply systems such as agricultural reservoirs, pumping stations and drainage, groundwater systems, and demands for agricultural water. In order to review the applicability of the developed drought index, AWDSDI was applied to 32 Eps and Myuns in three cities, including Jincheongun, Changnyeonggun, and Jangseonggun in the period June-August 2017, when drought damage was significant. It was found that AWDSDI reproduced the daily agricultural drought well in small administrative districts such as Eps and Myuns. In addition, in order to verify the developed drought index, the evaluation results of AWDSDI, the previously developed agricultural drought index and the hydrological drought index were compared together. The comparison found that the AWDSDI reproduced the drought period and drought depth in 32 Eps and Myuns in three cities better than previously developed drought indices.</jats:p>",

The testing result indicates that the combined technology performs over 90% removal rate for organic substances and humus (UV254) and 70–80% removal rate for disinfection by-products including chloroform, bromoform and carbon tetrachloride. In addition, the combined technology also shows 70% minimum removal rate for pigments including chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin, 20–60% removal rate for water hardness, over 95% removal rate for sulfates which occupies the major part of bivalent salts, and 50–70% removal rate for odorous substances. Based on the pilot testing results, a new water purification process, which is sequentially combined by the conventional drinking water treatment technology, pressurized-pot MF and NF, is creatively applied in the large-scale engineering project of drinking water advanced treatment of Zhangjiagang Third Water Plant for the first time in China. The designed water-production amount of this project is 100 thousand tons per day, and the project is aimed at reforming and upgrading the drinking water treatment technology which is currently used in the Zhangjiagang Third Water Plant. The recovery rate of the NF system applied in the project is able to reach 90%, and the predicted electricity consumption of pressurized-pot MF system and NF system is, respectively, 0.003 and 0.197 kWh/ton of water. After accomplishing the project, Zhangjiagang Third Water Plant will be capable of supplying drinking water with higher quality and will simultaneously possess higher capability of replying to water contamination emergencies.</jats:p>",

The model takes the maximum relative yield of crops as the objective function, the amount of water supplied, water spilled and water replenished as decision variables, the total amount of water supplied by the system, the water right of the pumping station and the operation criteria as constraints, and uses a dynamic programming method to solve the model. The optimal water supply and water spill process of the irrigation reservoir and the optimal water replenishment process of a pumping station during the entire growth period of dry crops were obtained. Moreover, under the conditions of 50 and 75% probability of exceedance, the optimized relative yields of crops increased by 17.1% and 19.6%, respectively. The results show that ensuring the optimal operation of joint water source projects can achieve the optimal allocation of limited water resources, and improve the relative yield of crops in irrigation areas, which has important guiding significance for the planning and management of water resources in similar irrigation areas.</jats:p>",

A strategy that includes using a fixed, single intravenous dose of 400 mg for eligible patients will help extend available supply and is likely effective in treatment of COVID-19. Sarilumab, another IL-6 inhibitor, can be considered as a substitute. Additional options to consider to optimize tocilizumab use include the use of a provincial dashboard to help monitor and allocate use and estimating supply-to-demand adequacy. Likewise, a centralized allocation lottery system could be employed as soon as predicted demand exceeds supply to help ensure fair allocation.

Models which have attempted to include it are generally at coarse resolution and uncoupled to the atmosphere. We propose to describe human water management at high spatial resolution using ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms concept of hydrological‐transfer‐units in the routing parametrization. Irrigated areas are linked to river abstraction points using a minimization process. The directed graphs of river flows and adduction network for irrigation is transposed to propagate water demands upstream. Reservoirs and dams are placed along the graph to balance supply and demands in the four chosen water value classes. Dam regulation is assumed to maximize demand satisfaction and dampen floods while respecting the properties of the infrastructure. The developed human water management module is applied to the Yellow River where irrigation and dam regulation are known to have a strong impact. Results show that the impact of human water management is strongly heterogeneous over space. It propagates along the river channels and can be mitigated by the confluence of tributaries. Moreover, the human impact has a strong seasonality due to time varying irrigation demands and the response of dam regulation. A number of uncertainties still remain and affect the simulated river discharge. Nevertheless, the representation of human water management improves the model's behavior in terms of magnitude and intra‐annual variations of river discharge, and offers the opportunity to implement anthropogenic processes in the water cycle of Earth System Models.</jats:p>",

This circuit employs the charge transfer switches (CTSs) which dynamically directs the charge flow in one direction. The limitations of conventional charge pump topology, that is, reverse charge sharing phenomenon and limited output voltage, are mitigated in the proposed design. It offers a voltage conversion efficiency (VCE) of 97.8% and maximum power efficiency of 91.1% at a load current of 5 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>A when simulated using an in‐house analytical model in cadence virtuoso environment. It is capable of working at a voltage as low as 3 V provided by thin‐film, printed batteries. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the first design, which demonstrates on‐chip power supply generation for oxide TFT‐based circuits using a single thin‐film battery (equivalent voltage) which offers the highest output DC voltage of 14.36 V at a clock frequency and input voltage of 1 MHZ and 3 V, respectively. Further, an on‐chip clock generator is implemented to generate all signals required by the charge pump circuit. The proposed circuit provides highest VCE and power efficiency in comparison to reported circuits using same technology. Hence, it finds potential application in next era self‐contained electronics, such as smart packaging and wearable devices using flexible electronics.</jats:p>",

In this study, we determined if the Czech Republic has enough water to fight forest fires and whether these water supply points are distributed so that all forest stands will have enough water nearby to fight fires. We analysed forests, water supply points and forest roads in three study areas. One reservoir is sufficient to cover tens to hundreds of hectares of forest. We found that there are currently enough water supply points in the studied areas of the Czech Republic to extinguish forest fires. The results indicate that any shortage in water availability can be eliminated by using water supply points that are useable but that are not currently part of the database used by Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic.

We have concluded that the period of E<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>s<jats:sub>1-2</jats:sub> was very suitable for the development of carbonate minerals and organisms because of the stable tectonic background, the weak siliciclastic influence of large source systems outside the basin, and the high salinity of the water. There were many local uplifts inside the basin during E<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>s<jats:sub>1-2</jats:sub>, and the source area, supply direction, and quantity of the local provenance varied greatly. We summarized that the mixed sediments generally developed in the intermittent and stagnant periods of the source supply, or on the flank or distal end of the source supply direction due to the absence of direct interference of terrigenous clasts. To a large extent, the formation of different types of mixed deposits is controlled by the different spatiotemporal relationship with siliciclastic supply. The background of strong source supply led to the formation of large-scale mixed deposits that were mainly composed of terrigenous clasts. Mixed deposits are mainly composed of organisms and carbonate with relatively large depositional thickness formed on the flank of source supply in the steep slope area. On the flank of source supply in the gentle slope belt, thinner mixed deposits with terrigenous clasts mainly formed and thin-layer carbonate clastic-dominated deposits formed on abandoned deltas. On the uplift of the buried hill far away from the provenance, thick mixed deposits mainly composed of bioclastic were formed whereas fine-grained mixed deposits formed under the low-energy argillaceous background. </jats:p>",

However, research has largely failed to consider the costs of WUAs operating the kiosks and the impact on the kiosk tariff. The determination of kiosk tariffs is critical to ensuring lifeline access to a sustainable water supply under Sustainable Development Goal 6. We provide evidence of this from our experience in the field in Blantyre. In particular, we argue that sustainable kiosk running costs cannot be born solely by the end user. A number of reforms are needed to help reduce the kiosk tariff. To reduce WUA costs and the kiosk tariffs, WUAs need more training in financial record keeping and cost management, WUAs should not inherit outstanding kiosk debt upon taking over their operations, and water boards should build kiosk costs over which they have fiscal responsibility into integrated block tariff calculations and subsidize them accordingly.</jats:p>"

Based on the model assumptions, the risk-seeking retailer’s optimal decision-making inventory model with stochastic demand in a water supply chain is studied. The risk-seeking retailer’s optimal inventory quantity, optimal inventory cost, supplier profit, retailer profit, and the profit of the entire water supply chain are derived. The validity of the equations is proved. The sensitivity analysis of the risk-seeking retailer’s optimal inventory decision-making is carried out. The risk level effects on the five dimensions, the retail price, wholesale price, unit shortage cost, unit inventory cost, and unit residual value, are displayed through numerical simulation.

We, here, identify non‐neuronal Synaptobrevin (Syb) as the essential vesicular SNARE in <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic> peripheral glia to insulate and metabolically supply neurons. We show that tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TeNT‐LC), which potently inhibits SNARE‐mediated exocytosis from neurons, also impairs peripheral nerve function when selectively expressed in glia, causing nerve disintegration, defective axonal transport, tetanic muscle hyperactivity, impaired locomotion, and lethality. While TeNT‐LC disrupts neural function by cleaving neuronal Synaptobrevin (nSyb), it targets non‐neuronal Synaptobrevin (Syb) in glia, which it cleaves at low rates: Glial knockdown of Syb (but not nSyb) phenocopied glial TeNT‐LC expression whose effects were reverted by a TeNT‐LC‐insensitive Syb mutant. We link Syb‐necessity to two distinct glial subtypes: Impairing Syb function in subperineurial glia disrupted nerve morphology, axonal transport, and locomotion, likely, because nerve‐isolating septate junctions (SJs) could not form as essential SJ components (like the cell adhesion protein Neurexin‐IV) were mistargeted. Interference with Syb in axon‐encircling wrapping glia left nerve morphology and locomotion intact but impaired axonal transport, likely because neural metabolic supply was disrupted due to the mistargeting of metabolite shuffling monocarboxylate transporters. Our study identifies crucial roles of Syb in various glial subtypes to ensure glial‐glial and glial‐neural interplay needed for proper nerve function, animal motility, and survival.</jats:p>",

Of the animals identified, several hundred, possibly several thousand, individuals were shipped, at least monthly, to North America, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere in Africa, via a number of major airlines. Among the vertebrates observed, approximately one‐third had not yet been evaluated on the IUCN Red list, and three quarters were not CITES‐listed (i.e., their trade was not regulated under this international treaty). The apparent lack of adequate monitoring of population status, disease, biological invasion, and animal welfare risks associated with this trade, as well as neglected taxa (e.g., invertebrates), has potential implications for environmental, public, and animal health. The findings of this case study suggest that a systematic review of social media activity could efficiently reveal significant insights into the otherwise undocumented global supply of exotic pets, directing legislators to aspects and areas where regulation is insufficient, and informing international and national policy change.</jats:p>",

In the current work, the effect of the PPS for water use was evaluated based on the water use of 6661 households from 14 communities in Shanghai. It was found that the PPS did not reduce household water consumption when comparing the water consumption per household both before and after the implementation of the PPS policy. To investigate the weakness of the PPS, a principal component analysis (PCA) and a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were conducted to access the relationships between mean household water use and community factors such as housing price, management fees, and the number of parking sites. Moreover, a significant inverted U-shaped curve between housing price and water use was found, which demonstrates that rental households shared by several tenants were the main consumers of residential water, and they were not sensitive to the water price improvement in the PPS due to sharing water prices. Therefore, a proposal was made in this work to increase the proportion of water fee expenditure in the total household income and to use 3% as the benchmark for water affordability. Our results provided a new picture of residential water use in big cities and a method for saving and balancing urban water resources.</jats:p>"

To address these decision-making issues, while considering the word-of-mouth effect, our paper considers a local operator determining wholesale price and carbon reduction level of the tour package and a tour operator determining retail price of the tour package. According to different bargaining powers, we study three scenarios: the local operator leading Stackelberg (LL), the tour operator leading Stackelberg (TL), and the static Nash game (NG). We develop three theoretical models and present some insights. We find that tourist’s sensitivity to word-of-mouth has positive (negative) impacts on optimal wholesale price, carbon reduction level, retail price, demand, and profits if the impact of word-of-mouth is positive (negative), while the impact of word-of-mouth is always having positive impacts on optimal decisions, demand, and profits. Interestingly, the NG market structure contributes the most environmentally-friendly products but mostly hurts the environment. The local operator under LL can obtain the largest profit, which is even larger than the profit of the tour operator, while the tour operator under NG and TL can obtain more profit than the local operator.</jats:p>"

On this basis, this paper points out the optimal power structure of the whole supply chain system and then discusses the optimal cooperative decision-making mode to improve the operation efficiency of the supply chain system under optimal power structure. The results show that compared with the two power structures of manufacturer-led and logistics service integrator-led, the retailer-led structure is the optimal power structure, whether from the perspective of maximizing the total profit of the supply chain or the surplus of consumers. When the supply chain is facing consumers who are less sensitive to the retail price of products and more sensitive to the logistics service level, the advantages of retail-led decentralized supply chain are more significant. The centralized decision of product supply chain (PSC) and logistics service supply chain (LSSC) under different power structures is the dominant strategy, and the equilibrium strategy is Nash game adopted by both parties. At this time, the total profit of the supply chain system is the largest and the total social welfare is the largest, while the total profit and consumer surplus of the supply chain under LSSC-led structure are the smallest. When the supply chain is facing consumers with low sensitivity of logistics service level and product retail price, PSC and LSSC have more significant advantages in Nash game rather than Stackelberg game.</jats:p>",

Based on the analysis results at administrative unit scale, administrative units with an unbalanced UGS ES supply and demand were divided into three types: (Ⅰ) lack of green space; (Ⅱ) unreasonable green space structure; (Ⅲ) comprehensive, and different optimization schemes were put forward. According to the analysis results at 1-m scale, the regions with an unbalanced ES supply and demand of an administrative unit were divided into the following: (1) severe ES shortage area; (2) moderate ES shortage area; (3) mild ES shortage area, and the severe ES shortage area was taken as the UGS optimization area. We take the UGS within the 5th Ring Road of Beijing as an example and propose suggestions for optimizing the UGS pattern based on the evaluation of the supply and demand of UGS carbon sequestration services and purification services for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5).

Yet, only limited researches focus on the thermal performance of stratum ventilation under heating condition. The heating and cooling operation characteristic of stratum ventilation is different due to the distinct airflow characteristics. Therefore, this paper investigated the parameters that affect energy utilization efficiency and indoor thermal comfort under heating condition served by stratum ventilation via CFD simulations approach. The supply air parameters included temperature, airflow rate, angle, and return air outlet positions. The evaluation indicators adopt ventilation effectiveness and effective draft temperature (EDT) for assessing the energy utilization efficiency and indoor thermal comfort served by stratum ventilation under heating condition. The results demonstrated that, under the heating mode of stratum ventilation, different effects on the thermal performance were made by the mentioned parameters. The ventilation effectiveness was higher when the air supply temperature is 26°C, airflow rate is 7 air change per hour (ACH), and the air supply angle is 45°. The EDT range of the occupied zone is closest to zero K when the air supply temperature is 28°C, airflow rate is 12 (ACH), and the air supply angle is 60°. The related conclusions obtained from this study provide the theoretical basis for the stratum ventilation design and promote its heating application.</jats:p>",

In the course of the European project MyToolBox, prevention and control measures to reduce mycotoxin contamination in cereals were developed. This study aimed to estimate the impact of these prevention and control measures on both the reduction in crop losses and the increased volume of crops suitable for food and/or feed. It focused on the following measures: the use of fungicides during wheat cultivation, the use of resistant maize cultivars and/or biocontrol during maize cultivation, the use of real time sensors in storage silos, the use of innovative milling strategies during the pasta making process, and the employment of degrading enzymes during the process of bioethanol and Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) production. The impact assessment was based on the annual volume of cereals produced, the annual levels of mycotoxin contamination, and experimental data on the prevention and control measures collected in the course of the MyToolBox project. Results are expressed in terms of reduced volumes of cereals lost, or as additional volumes of cereals available for food meeting the current European legal limits. Results showed that a reduction in crop losses as well as an increase in the volume of crops suitable as food and/or feed is feasible with each proposed prevention or control measure along the supply chain. The impact was the largest in areas and in years with the highest mycotoxin contamination levels but would have less impact in years with low mycotoxin levels. In further research, the impact assessment may be validated using future data from more years and European sites. Decision makers in the food and feed supply chain can use this impact assessment to decide on the relevant prevention and control strategies to apply.</jats:p>",

The effects of magnetic flux density, flow rate and cycle-index on the solubility of scale-forming ions were investigated, and the effects of viscosity and surface tension on the molecular internal energy and order degree of the circulating water were analyzed. The scale was ground and mixed with water and placed in an S-HGMF system to study the effect of S-HGMF on the crystal form change of CaCO3. The experimental results showed us that S-HGMF could increase the solubility of scale-forming ions. It could enhance the interaction between water molecules by increasing viscosity and reducing surface tension, so as to improve the stability of water quality, reduce ion precipitation, and achieve the effect of scale inhibition. At the same time, it could also change the crystal structure of CaCO3, promote the transformation of calcite to aragonite, and realize the purpose of scale inhibition. In a word, S-HGMF treatment can effectively solve the scaling problem of a recirculating cooling water system, which provides a reference for scale inhibition of recirculating cooling water.</jats:p>",

The impact of emptying reservoir\non water supply is minimized through appropriate joint operation in a\nmulti-reservoir system, where drawdown and empty flushing is carried out in\na primary reservoir, and the other reservoir provides backup water for\nsupply. This method prioritizes allocating the storage in the primary\nreservoir for water supply during specific periods prior to its emptying. If\nthe storage of every reservoir achieves its predefined conditions, drawdown\nof the primary reservoir is activated and followed by empty flushing.\nPreviously preserved storage in the other reservoir ensures adequate water\nsupply during the periods of emptying the primary reservoir. Flushing of the\nprimary reservoir is continued until either the accumulative released water\nexceeds the specified volume, storage in the backup reservoir drops below\nthe predefined threshold, or the inflow to the primary reservoir recedes\nfrom the flood peak to be below the releasing capacity of outlets. This\nbehavior is simulated and linked with a nonlinear optimization algorithm to\ncalibrate the optimal parameters defining the activation and termination of\nempty flushing.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their atomic thicknesses, high carrier mobility, fast charge transfer, and intrinsic spin-valley couplings, have been demonstrated one of the most appealing candidates for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. The synthesis of TMDs with well-controlled crystallinity, quality and composition is essential to fully realize their promising applications. Similar to that in III-V semiconductor synthesis, the precise precursor supply is a precondition for controllable growth of TMDs. Although great efforts have been devoted to modulate the transition metal supply, few effective methods of chalcogen feeding control were developed. Herein we report a strategy of using active chalcogen monomer supply to grow TMDs and their alloys in a robust and controllable manner. It is found that at a high temperature, the active chalcogen monomers (such as S, Se, Te atoms or their mixtures) can be controllably released from metal chalcogenides and, thus, enable the synthesis of TMDs (MX<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) with very high quality, e.g., MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> monolayers exhibit photoluminescent circular helicity of ~92%, comparable to the best exfoliated single-crystal flakes and close to the theoretical limit of unity. More intriguingly, a uniform quaternary TMD alloy with three different anions, i.e., MoS<jats:sub>2(1-x-y)</jats:sub>Se<jats:sub>2x</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>2y</jats:sub>, was accomplished for the first time. Our mechanism study revealed that the active chalcogen monomers can bind and diffuse freely on a TMD surface, which enables the effective nucleation and reaction, quick chalcogen vacancy healing, and alloy formation during the growth. The chalcogen monomer supply strategy offers more degrees of freedom for the controllable synthesis of 2D compounds and their alloys, which will greatly benefit the development of high-end devices with desired 2D materials.</jats:p>"

The simulation model of energy processes is based on calculated expressions taking into account the characteristics of the battery. Operability of the proposed solutions are confirmed on an experimental setup based on a standard hybrid inverter. Results.

The high-altitude wetlands (HAWs) in the Central Andes are unique ecosystems located in the Altiplano that provide many ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental conditions associated with varying hydrology of the HAW, Salar de Tara, in the Andean Altiplano. Sediment samples of up to 20 cm in depth were obtained from various salt flat sub-environments. The samples were analyzed using proxies for mineralogical and chemical composition, thermal analysis, and magnetic susceptibility. Diatom and ostracod communities were also identified and analyzed. The results reflected changes in the geochemistry, carbon content, mineralogy, and magnetic properties of the sediments that can be explained by variations in the sources of water input to the Salar de Tara. The sub-environments depend on the supply of water via the groundwater recharge of springs adjacent to the streamflow from the Zapaleri River, which promotes greater diversity and richness of genera. Our results suggest that water extraction at industrial levels greatly impacts the persistence of hydrologically connected HAWs, which concentrate a worldwide interest in brine mining.</jats:p>"

The adoption of DRSC will make the system lose stability and fall into the trap of complexity. Further the consumer-related factors, such as consumer preference, service level, have also severely affected the system efficiency of DRSC. Therefore, it is necessary to help DRSCs to design their networks for maintaining competitiveness and profitability. This paper focuses on the issues of quantitative modelling for the network design of a general multi-echelon, dual-objective DRSC system. By incorporating consumer preference for the online recycling channel into the system, we investigate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to design the DRSC network with uncertainty and the model is solved using the ε-constraint method to derive optimal Pareto solutions. Numerical results show that there exist positive correlations between consumer preference and total collective quantity, online recycling price and the system profits.

This research was conducted with a qualitative approach using political (P), economic (E), social (S), technological (T), legal (L), and environmental (E) analysis in a village that was officially declared as a ‘climate village.’ Data collected by observation and conducting in-depth interviews with five informants who know deeply about this program. The result shows that the spirit of community cooperation is good enough to prevent environmental problems due to climate change. Every aspect of PESTLE shows a promising development, especially in Social and Environment. Still, it needs improvement for every indicator, especially financial assistance, to provide clean water and sanitation technology resistant to climate disruption.</jats:p>",

The need for sustainable use of resources serves as the basis for changing the existing approach where worn-out resources are considered wastes. Materials and methods. In this paper, we show that it is expedient to restore the sorption properties of granulated activated carbon (GAC) by its reactivation and reuse in closed-loop recycling. We also present methods to study GAC properties and technology of reactivation. Results and discussion. Based on the results of the GAC samples’ analysis, it was found that, during reactivation, the mass content of each fraction changes with a strongly pronounced decrease in the content of large granules with a size of 1.18–2.00 mm and an increase in the content of small granules with a size of 0.60–1.00 mm. Besides, the apparent density of the sorption material changes and the volume of carbon that underwent two reactivations falls below 75%. Conclusion. GAC reactivation in dual-media rapid filters allows us to optimize not only the operating and financial expenses of the company but also those natural resources that would have been spent for the production of new carbon.</jats:p>",

How to optimize the coordination development relationships among the social, economic and environmental systems has always been the focus. To bridge this gap, a water optimal allocation model for coordinated development was innovatively constructed and applied to the main stream of the Xiangjiang River Basin, China. The results showed the following. (i) From 2025 to 2030, the water deficit ratio of the study area will increase from 3.21 to 5.50% when P = 50% and from 4.59 to 6.85% when P = 75%. The existing water supply capacity will not be able to meet the increasing water demand. (ii) Agricultural and industrial water will account for a large proportion of the total water consumption. Due to the transformation of industrial structure, measures should be formulated to bring the best benefits. (iii) Restricted by different systems, the coordinated development in each city will present spatial and temporal differences. (iv) The proposed model was proved to overcome the backwards of uncoordinated development and achieve a balance of the regional social, economic and environmental benefits. Also, some recommendations and limitations were discussed. This study provides an effective basis for enhancing regional sustainable water resources planning and management.</jats:p>",

Determining the largest population size and economic scale that water resources can support without destroying the ecological environment in a region, that is, ultimate water resources carrying capacity (UWRCC), helps to realize the sustainable utilization of water resources. UWRCC is a variable value which is easily affected by natural conditions, technical level and economic status. This study proposes a UWRCC research method that combines multi-objective optimization and scenario analysis. This method draws a diagram of UWRCC result sets based on multi-scenario UWRCC calculation, through which UWRCC values under different specific technical and economic levels are easily and quickly obtained. This method has been applied to Yancheng in this study and the quantitative relationship between technical level, economic level and UWRCC of Yancheng was analyzed. Taking Yancheng as the research area, this study analyzes the quantitative relationship between the technical level, economic level and UWRCC of Yancheng. The results show that according to existing government planning, Yancheng's water resources will be sufficient to support socioeconomic development. But the districts of Yandu, Tinghu, and Binghai will experience population and gross domestic product overloading in future years. In addition, a diagram of the UWRCC sets of Yancheng was obtained and it provides a reference for local water resources management.</jats:p>",

Heat treatment of natural leathers as heat-sensitive materials is carried out under mild temperature conditions and high air moisture contents, the temperature does not undergo significant changes, and the heat transfer coefficients change almost linearly. When using analytical solutions, the authors made the assumptions that for small temperature gradients over the cross section of a thin body, the thermal transfer of matter can be neglected and for values of the heat and mass transfer Biot criteria less than unity, the main factor, limiting heat and mass transfer, is the interaction of the evaporation surface of the body with the environment; so, in solving the differential heat equation we can restrict ourselves to one first member of an infinite series. In this case, a piecewise stepwise approximation of all thermophysical characteristics with constant values of these coefficients at the calculated time intervals was applied, which made it possible to take into account the change in the transfer coefficients throughout the entire heat treatment process. Processing of experimental data showed that in low-intensity processes with reliable values of the transfer coefficients, it is possible to use the results of solutions of differential equations of unsteady heat conduction in heat transfer calculations. The results of the study of heat transfer during drying of leather confirm the laws of temperature change established experimentally. Together with experimental studies of drying processes, analytical studies are of great practical importance in the development of new methods for calculating heat and mass transfer in wet bodies.</jats:p>"

Using the Junshan Lake Basin as a study area, this paper quantitatively analyzes the response relationships between the water quality parameters, land use, and socio-economic factors in the study area from 2005 to 2019 and predicts the water quality in 2035 based on land and space planning scenarios. The results show the following. (1) The land use structure of the Junshan Lake Basin has changed significantly over the last 15 years. The basic trend is an increase in settlement and wetland areas in the basin and a decrease in water, cropland, forest, and grassland areas. (2) Settlement areas play the role of a ‘source’ for the total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH3-N) pollution load, and cropland areas play the role of a ‘sink’ for the TP, NH3-N, and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) pollution load. (3) The main land use type in the Junshan Lake Basin is cropland, which accounts for more than 40% of the total, and the water quality in the lake is affected not only by non-point source pollution but also by the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP), total population, and per capita disposable income. According to the water quality prediction and analysis, the concentrations of TN and TP in Junshan Lake will meet the Class IV water quality standard in 2035, and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and CODMn will meet the Class II standard. This study is significant for the management and control of the water environment in the Junshan Lake Basin.</jats:p>",

Factors of collaboration behaviour such as commitment, trust, coordination, stability, and continuous improvement are taken into account to support collaboration activities. This study aims to analyse the efficiency score of BULOG and its suppliers and determine the strategy to enhance collaboration quality. This study applied the integrated method of Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP), and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The QFD and FANP are to figure out the priority level of the collaboration behaviour factors. Then, DEA serves to calculate the collaboration efficiency score. The result shows that the most important behaviour factor in supporting the collaboration is the coordination, followed by continuous improvement, commitment, stability, and trust. Furthermore, among the nine stakeholders, two stakeholders are inefficient, with the efficiency score of 88.8% and 87.5%. Several strategies that can be applied to achieve the highest efficiency score (100%) are by increasing the sales level and changing the transportation method. Therefore, the economic and the environmental aspects which have a low level can be improved.</jats:p>",

The median values of 25(OH)D in children of the comparison group were statistically significantly higher than in children with AH of the 1st and 2nd subgroups – 23,3 ng/ml [20,8; 26,0], 14,9 ng/ml [10,8; 19,5] and 17,1 ng/ml [11,8; 23,7], respectively, p=0,001. Conclusion: according to the results of the multivariate analysis, 25(OH)D in the observed adolescents depends on many factors, such as age (6,7%), gender differences (5,7%), etc. The seasons have the greatest influence on its level (62,3%) and BMI (21,4%), the least – AH (3,9%).</jats:p>",

Yet, the risk factors for lower reproductive tract infections (RTIs) related to menstrual hygiene management (MHM) have not been studied among reusable absorbent users. Women of reproductive age attending one of two hospitals from two different cities in Odisha during two separate study intervals were recruited for the study. Laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) were conducted. A questionnaire was used to collect information on MHM practices, water, sanitation, and socio-demographic factors. Among the 509 women who used reusable absorbents, 71.7% were diagnosed with at least one infection. After adjusting for confounders, women with BV were more likely to identify as being a housewife (aOR: 1.8 (1.1–2.9)). Frequent absorbent changing was protective against BV (aOR: 0.5 (0.3–0.8)), whereas frequent body washing increased the odds of BV (aOR: 1.5 (1.0–2.2)). Women with VVC were more likely to be older (aOR: 1.6 (1.0–2.5)), live below the poverty line (aOR: 1.5 (1.1–2.2)), have a non-private household latrine (aOR: 2.2 (1.3–4.0)), dry their absorbents inside the house (aOR: 3.7 (2.5–4.5)), and store absorbents in the latrine area (aOR: 2.0 (1.3–2.9)). Washing absorbents outside the house was protective against VVC (aOR: 0.7 (0.4–1.0)). This study highlights the importance of improving MHM practices among reusable absorbent users to prevent lower RTIs among women reusing menstrual materials in Odisha.</jats:p>"

However, due to the extensive involvement of the logistics industry, the overly complex technology, and the huge amount of data and information, the security of logistics has become one of the hot topics of special concern. Based on the background of an intelligent environment, this paper constructs a supply chain financial logistics supervision system based on Internet of Things technology. This article refers to the research experience of previous scholars, briefly introduces the theoretical knowledge of the Internet of Things technology, smart environment, and supply chain finance, and makes a certain analysis of the logistics supervision system. We collect and calculate logistics data through the wolf group hunting and siege formula in the wolf group algorithm and analyze the application performance of the logistics supervision system in reality. Then, we briefly designed the system architecture diagram of the logistics supervision system and compared the freight situation of the logistics supervision system before and after and statistics on the deployment of the logistics supervision system in customs, docks, airports, stations, and other places from 2015 to 2019. Finally, a comparative analysis of the performance of wolf pack algorithm and other algorithms was performed under different path planning. The final result shows that the logistics supervision system has important practical value in the logistics industry; in addition, the deployment of logistics supervision systems in customs, terminals, and other places has increased year by year from 2015 to 2019.</jats:p>",

No previous study has comparatively examined nutrient intake in adults across countries in the EMR. This review examined the adequacy of nutrients in adults living in the EMR. Moreover, it analyzed the food balance sheets (FBS) for 1961–2018 to identify the trajectory of energy supply from macro-nutrients in the EMR. A systematic search was conducted from January 2012 to September 2020. Only observational studies were retained with a random sampling design. An assessment of the methodological quality was conducted. Levels of nutrient daily intake and their adequacy compared to the daily reference intake of the Institute of Medicine were reported across the region. No studies were identified for half of the region’s countries. Although nutrient energy intake was satisfactory overall, fat and carbohydrate intake were high. Intake of vitamin D, calcium, potassium, zinc, and magnesium were below that recommended. The analysis of the FBS data allowed for the identification of four linear patterns of trajectories, with countries in the EMR best fitting the ‘high-energy-supply from carbohydrate’ group. This systematic review warrants multi-sectorial commitment to optimize nutrient intake.</jats:p>"

For SWNOM, two peaks appeared at Ex/Em of 240/448 nm, and 350/450 nm. Static quenching was the dominant quenching mechanism between BSA and SWNOM, whereas no quenching was observed between tryptophan or tyrosine and SWNOM. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermodynamic calculation demonstrated that hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force are the potential binding forces of the BSA-SWNOM complex, as a result of rearrangement in the secondary polypeptide carbonyl hydrogen bonding network of BSA. This rearrangement led to the conformational change in BSA that induced quenching of BSA fluorescence by SWNOM.</jats:p>",

To facilitate the control of bubble size formed with oscillatory air supply, the present work investigated the dependence of bubble size on sparger configuration. It was found that bubble size was positively correlated with the chamber volume and the orifice size, while a nonlinear relationship was observed with the plate thickness. Besides, it was found that flotation recovery decreased over increasing bubble size when changing the sparger configuration.

The DBP formation increased with increasing total residual chlorine; EOM from PT presented the highest formation potential followed by HA, Msp, and SQ. The low dosage of 40 mJ/cm2 UV irradiation is insignificant to change the DBP formation from HA and SQ; however, it decreased the DBP formation from bromide-containing EOM of PT and promoted the DBP formation from EOM of Msp at various total residual chlorines. The DBP formation of each DOM correlated well with total residual chlorine. The maximum DBP formation potential (DBPFP) reduction of 42.25 and 13.75% for haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) was obtained at the UV irradiation dosage of 300 mJ/cm2 for EOM of PT.

The damage of chlorine to membrane material will seriously reduce the lifetime of the membrane and increase the cost of membrane treatment technology. Here, we prepared chlorine-stable membranes by a covalent modification method with cyclohexylamine. The cyclohexylamine observably changed the surface morphology, the roughness (arithmetic average) of the membrane decreased from 22 to 17.2 nm. The addition of cyclohexylamine produced a denser sacrificial layer of short chain polyamide, which made modified membranes possess significantly better chlorine resistance with slightly declined water flux. The water flux of the optimal modified membrane was 10.78 Lm−2 h−1, only 13% less than that of the pristine membrane. Importantly, after 20,000 ppm·h chlorine exposure, the membrane with 1.5 wt% cyclohexylamine had a salt rejection of 77.2% and showed 26.0% lower water flux than pristine TFC (thin film composite) membrane in FO mode. Notably, the grafting membranes could maintain a high performance under acidic chlorination conditions. The membrane with best performance had a salt rejection of 81.6%, exhibiting 24.4% higher salt rejection than pristine membrane with 20,000 ppm·h chlorine exposure at a pH of 4. The cyclohexylamine endowed the FO membrane with better chlorine resistance, making it attractive for the development of chlorine-resistant membrane for environmental and desalination processes.</jats:p>",

Results showed the following. (1) The soil at a depth of 0–1,000 cm had been desiccated when the area was an apple orchard. (2) Under rain-fed conditions, the jujube trees with the WSP technique were always able to maintain normal growth while the jujube trees with conventional pruning method had a normal growth stage of only 4 years. The water use efficiency of the jujube trees with the WSP technique was much higher than that of the jujube trees with conventional pruning. We recommend WSP in jujube orchard management, because the jujube trees with WSP could maintain normal growth in the deep dried soils of the loess hilly region, as WSP can reduce the water consumption of the jujube trees and may have a positive effect on soil moisture restoration.</jats:p>",

In the present study, PUFs were synthesized with various weight percentages of porous silica aerogel to reinforce the characteristics of PUF used in LNG carrier insulation systems. To evaluate the mechanical strength of the PUF-silica aerogel composites considering LNG loading/unloading environmental conditions, compressive tests were conducted at room temperature (20 °C) and a cryogenic temperature (−163 °C). In addition, the thermal insulation performance and cellular structure were identified to analyze the effects of silica aerogels on cell morphology. The cell morphology of PUF-silica aerogel composites was relatively homogeneous, and the cell shape remained closed at 1 wt.% in comparison to the other concentrations. As a result, the mechanical and thermal properties were significantly improved by the addition of 1 wt.% silica aerogel to the PUF. The mechanical properties were reduced by increasing the silica aerogel content to 3 wt.% and 5 wt.%, mainly because of the pores generated on the surface of the composites.</jats:p>"

The model design produced by this study may 1) emphasize land arrangement; 2) revegetation design with forestry, plantation, and food crops; 3) domesticated plant; and 4) environmental monitoring, concerning monitoring of soil quality, monitoring of erosion and sedimentation, water quality, acid mine drainage, successful revegetation, and others. These four aspects expect to help suppress the rate of land degradation in agriculture located in ex-mining areas and reduce forest destruction in the Grand Forest Park area.</jats:p>",

However, the hypoxic environment of solid tumors is likely to cause resistance or failure of RT. Moreover, high‐dose radiation may cause side effects to surrounding normal tissues. In this study, a new type of nanozyme is developed by doping Mn (II) ions into Ag<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Se quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm).

Conjugated with tumor‐targeting arginine‐glycine‐aspartate (RGD) tripeptides and polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules, the nanozymes are then constructed into in vivo nanoprobes for NIR‐II imaging‐guided RT of tumors. Owing to the radiosensitive activity of the element Ag, the nanoprobes can promote radiation energy deposition. The specific tumor‐targeting and NIR‐II emitting abilities of the nanoprobes facilitate the precise tumor localization, which enables precise RT with low side effects. Moreover, their ultra‐stability in the living body ensures that the nanoprobes continuously produce oxygen and relieve the hypoxia of tumors to enhance RT efficacy. Guided by real‐time and high‐clarity imaging, the nanoprobe‐mediated RT promotes anti‐tumor immunity, which significantly inhibits the growth of tumors or even cures them completely.</jats:p>",

To maximize the government’s expected utility, an uncertain contract model is presented in the framework of principal-agent theory, where the government’s assessment of the supply chain enterprise’s carbon emission level is described as an uncertain variable. Afterwards, the equivalent model is provided to obtain the optimal contract for the uncertain pollution abatement problem. The results demonstrate that the supply chain enterprise’s optimal output decreases with the carbon emission level. Furthermore, the government’s optimal transfer payment decreases with the carbon emission level if the carbon tax is low. In contrast, if the carbon tax is high, the optimal transfer payment increases with the carbon emission level. In addition, an increase in the carbon emission level decreases the optimal utilities of both the government and the supply chain enterprise and also leads to the supply chain enterprise’s incremental marginal utility. Finally, we provide a numerical example, which illustrates the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

A dipole coil of the coil system works with four magnetosheath coils (flux cores) to build the magnetic fields resembling that of the Earth and solar wind. A capacitor-based pulsed power supply (PPS) system with a modular design is developed to excite the dipole coil to generate a magnetosphere-like magnetic field required by the magnetopause magnetic reconnection experiment. The PPS of the dipole coil has a longer pulse duration and more energy than that of other coils in the coil system, it delivers a pulsed current with a peak of more than 18 kA, and the duration of the current is not less than 95% of the peak over 10 ms to the dipole coil when the charging voltage is not less than 20 kV.

To expand the market share of safe food, governments of some countries also provide subsidies to encourage food processors to invest in better food safety efforts. This paper establishes a three-stage game model between the government and a two-stage food supply chain that consists of one supplier and one processor, where the government subsidizes processors to invest in food safety efforts; furthermore, this paper determines the optimal wholesale price, marginal profit, food safety investment, and government subsidies. This paper analyzes the effects of the government subsidies and risk aversion of the food processor and introduces the mode of order quantity-based payment and demand-based payment; moreover, it also analyzes the impacts of subsidies and different payment methods on demands. The results show that suppliers can increase the market share of products by adopting the demand-based payment, but this method does not always benefit the members of the supply chain. As the processor is more risk-averse, the optimal subsidy is higher, encouraging the processor to invest in more efforts. Finally, the supplier’s profit increases with the processor’s risk aversion indicator.</jats:p>",

The synergetic effect of citric acid (Cit) and g-C3N4/CDs for high-performance visible light Cr(VI) photocatalytic reduction had been investigated. Cit was not only acted as a hole scavenger, but might also form surface charge transfer complexes (CTC) with g-C3N4 which delivered electrons on the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of Cit to the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4. CDs decorated on g-C3N4 could provide channels for the preferential transfer of electrons on CTC to the CB of g-C3N4 as well as improved separation of the charge carriers. Owing to these synergistic effects, g-C3N4/CDs displayed much higher photocatalytic performance for the reduction of Cr(VI), which was 1.89 times higher than g-C3N4. Moreover, the synergetic photocatalytic reduction mechanisms of aqueous Cr(VI) were proposed to elucidate the active species formation and photogenerated electron transfer. The results suggested that the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dominated the reduction of Cr(VI). The addition of Cit could trigger the in situ generation of H2O2 and the decorated CDs further enhanced the reaction. This work demonstrated the role of widely existed Cit on the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in natural aquatic environment.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose a scale-attention deep learning network (SA-Net), which extracts features of different scales in a residual module and uses an attention module to enforce the scale-attention capability. SA-Net can better learn the multi-scale features and achieve more accurate segmentation for different medical image. In addition, this work validates the proposed method across multiple datasets. The experiment results show SA-Net achieves excellent performances in the applications of vessel detection in retinal images, lung segmentation, artery/vein(A/V) classification in retinal images and blastocyst segmentation.

However, little is known about the common genetic basis of N use efficiency (NUE) at varying N availability. Two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were grown in the field with high, moderate, and low N supply. Cultivar Zhoumai 27 outperformed Aikang 58 independent of the N supply and showed improved growth, canopy leaf area index, flag leaf surface area, grain number, and yield, and enhanced NUE due to both higher N uptake and utilization efficiency. Further, transcriptome and proteome analyses were performed using flag leaves that provide assimilates for grain growth. The results showed that many genes or proteins that are up- or down-regulated under all N regimes are associated with N and carbon metabolism and transport. This was reinforced by cultivar differences in photosynthesis, assimilate phloem transport, and grain protein/starch yield. Overall, our study establishes that improving NUE at both high and low N supply requires distinct adjustments in leaf metabolism and assimilate partitioning. Identified key genes/proteins may individually or concurrently regulate NUE and are promising targets for maximizing crop NUE irrespective of the N supply.</jats:p>",

With the joint effect of supplier and manufacturer green innovation efforts on the dynamic change of the product’s green level, it compared and analyzed the long-term dynamic equilibrium strategies of green innovation cooperation in a supply chain under decentralized and centralized decision-making situations. Accordingly, a scientific and reasonable profit-distribution contract was then proposed. On this basis, it further carried out a numerical simulation analysis on the dual-driving effects of the government and market. The results showed that the scientific and reasonable profit-distribution contract under the centralized decision-making situation, which was designed by using the Rubinstein bargaining game model, could effectively ensure that the supply chain members’ sharing profits would realize \"Dual Pareto Improvements.\" With the increase of the environmental regulation’s intensity, the product’s green level kept rising and tended to be stable. However, the overall equilibrium profit of the supply chain was characterized by \"U\" fluctuation, which first descended and then ascended. In addition, the product’s green level, the green innovation investment and equilibrium (distributed) profits of supply chain members, and the overall profits of supply chain all increased with the consumers’ green preference.</jats:p>",

The molecular ions were observed by Arase in four orbits during this magnetic storm. This indicates that there was a continuous molecular ion supply from the ionosphere. During the storm main phase around the second Dst minimum (∼−100 nT) on September 8, 2017, the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar observed the ion upflow (∼50–150 m s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) in the low‐altitude (250–350 km) ionosphere together with strong ion heating up to &gt;2,000 K. The convective electric field derived from the electron heating observed by EISCAT at an altitude of approximately 110 km was also enhanced by a factor of 2. The observations suggest that the additional ion heating at low altitudes helps to cause the fast upflow and transport molecular ions upward. The flux decreases from 280 to 350 km altitudes due to the dissociative recombination was estimated to be approximately two orders of magnitude. This resulted in significant molecular ion flux remaining at 350 km altitude. These results suggest that the low‐altitude ion upflow caused by the ion frictional heating enables molecular ions to escape to space against rapid loss by the dissociative recombination.</jats:p>",

It seems that paying attention to innovation and entrepreneurship can solve some of these disruptions. This study was conducted to extract the factors affecting the technology-oriented entrepreneurial rescue supply chain in the Red Crescent Society from experts and specialists in Iran. Materials and Methods: This qualitative content analysis was conducted in 2020. Using the content analysis method, the considered criteria were collected through open-ended questions and interviews. To determine the desired indicators, 30 people were interviewed in-depth in a purposeful manner using snowball sampling. The thematic analysis method was also used to analyze the interviews. Results: A total of 30 experts with a mean age of 46 years were interviewed, of whom 21 cases were male. Also, 16 cases had a PhD degree, and 14 had a Master’s degree. After analyzing and extracting the criteria from the interviews, 123 codes were obtained. Finally, the codes were divided into two classes: supply chain management and technology indicators. The supply chain management class included subclasses of customer integration, supplier integration, internal integration, and innovative orientation. The technology indicators class included subclasses of individual characteristics, attitudinal factors, educational factors, technical factors, economic factors, environmental factors, and human and managerial factors.  Conclusion: Supply chains are essential for entrepreneurship because of the involvement of different parts of the Red Crescent Organization of Iran in joint activities. Because of the expansion of entrepreneurship issues in the supply chain, presenting a technology-oriented comprehensive model of the entrepreneurial supply chain in the Red Crescent Organization is of great importance. In today’s competitive environment, supply chain management is a strategic and robust basis for the Red Crescent Organization to achieve success and competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

An ordered logit model and sample selection model were used to analyze the impact of air quality on the effective labor supply. The results show that the effective labor supply was significantly correlated with air quality. That is, the worse the air quality was, the lower the effective labor supply was, although this relationship was more explicit for people who worked indoors. When air quality impedes residents’ daily lives and even affects their health, it indirectly affects the effective supply of local labor. This paper indicates the causal relationship between economic development and the ecological environment and has enlightening significance for the realization of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The standard k-ε three-dimensional turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) method were used for numerical simulation of the flow in six NACA airfoil pillar-shaped flumes with different wing lengths. In addition, to verify the accuracy of numerical simulations, the corresponding experiments were conducted. The Buckingham Pi theorem of dimensional analysis coupled with the incomplete self-similarity theory was applied to deduce the theoretical flow calculation formula of these flumes. Moreover, Froude number, velocity distribution, backwater height, critical submergence, and energy loss of the flume were analyzed, for which the experimental and numerical results are compared and further discussed. The results show that the backwater height is directly proportional to the wing length, while the head loss and critical submergence are inversely proportional to the wing length. Based on the results, in terms of backwater height, it is recommended to use the NACA airfoil pillar-shaped flume with a smaller wing length, while, in terms of head loss and critical submergence, the NACA airfoil pillar-shaped flume with a larger wing length should be used.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the new company could cooperate with new strategic ports along the Maritime Silk Road in liner service. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to optimize the liner shipping network (LSN) from strategic, tactical, and operational levels and help the merged shipping company adjust its operational measures according to market changes. The optimization towards different levels of decision-making process is a new research of highly practical values. Specifically, this paper created two-phase optimization models for LSN based on the selection of hub ports. In Network Assessment (NA) phase, the LSNs of two types of hub ports selected are designed and assessed on strategic and tactical levels, and the primary and secondary routes are identified; in Network Operation (NO) phase, the “path-based flow” formulations are proposed from the operational level, considering operational measures including demand rejection and flow integration. The models in both phases are mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), but are solved by different tools: CPLEX for the NA phase models and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the NO phase models due to the computational complexity of the latter problem. Then, a computational experiment is performed on the LSN of COSCO Shipping on the Persian Gulf trade lane. The results have proved the effectiveness of the methodology and inspired important countermeasures for the merged shipping company.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a continuous interval grey discrete Verhulst model based on kernels and measures (CGDVM-KM), different from the previous forecasting methods, can help us to efficiently predict the number of the wounded in a very short time, that is, an “S-shape” curve for the numbers of the sick and wounded. That is, the continuous interval sequence is converted into the kernel and measure sequences with equal information quantity by the interval whitening method, and it is combined with the classical grey discrete Verhulst model, and then the grey discrete Verhulst models of the kernel and measure sequences are presented, respectively. Finally, CGDVM-KM is developed. It can effectively overcome the systematic errors caused by the discrete form equation for parameter estimation and continuous form equation for simulation and prediction in classical grey Verhulst model, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. At the same time, the rationality and validity of the model are verified by examples. A comparison with other forecasting models shows that the model has higher prediction accuracy and better simulation effect in forecasting the wounded in massive earthquake disasters.</jats:p>",
