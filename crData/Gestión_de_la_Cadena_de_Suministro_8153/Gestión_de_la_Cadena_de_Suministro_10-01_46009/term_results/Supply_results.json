The aim of this article is to introduce the construction of GSCM system that improves collaborative relationships between an EEE manufacturer and its suppliers. The study is conducted in three steps. Firstly, the four elements, which are necessities to form collaborative relationships between an EEE manufacturer and its suppliers, are described. Secondly, the condition and construction of GSCM system including the four elements is proposed. Finally, we presented the method that the GSCM system is constructed as a practicable tool in the initial stage by a case study held in Shimadzu Corporation.</jats:p>"

Then, it moves on to report a preliminary result of secondary data analysis that explores the role of complementary resources to the development of web-enabled supply chains. Lastly, this chapter reports a case study that focuses on identifying: 1) the complementary resources that influence the successful implementation of web-based applications for supply chain management, and 2) the degree to which certain types of complementary resources function to support the successful implementation of web-based applications.</jats:p>"

Just-In-Time (JIT) companies should be particularly interested in managing supply chain failure risk as they often have very little inventory to buffer themselves when their upstream supply chain fails. We develop previous research further and present a strategic framework to manage supply chain failure in JIT supply chains. We identify two dimensions along which the risks of failure can be categorized: location and unpredictability. We go on to identify strategies which companies can use either before (proactive) or after (reactive) the failure to manage supply chain failure. We support our framework with examples of actual responses to supply chain failures in JIT companies. It is also hoped that our strategic framework will be validated empirically in the future leading to specific guidance for managers.</jats:p>"

In this article, we investigate the value of demand-forecast information sharing in a manufacturer-e-retailer supply chain. The value of market information depends not only on its accuracy, but also on the e-retailer’s market power and the product’s Web compatibility. We develop a theoretical approach to examine the value of information sharing for the manufacturer and the e-retailer first, and then we further check to see how information sharing is moderated by the e-retailer’s market share and the product’s e-market-base demand. Our results suggest that under some conditions, both the manufacturer and the e-retailer can be better off from information sharing. Especially when the e-retailer’s market share is larger and the product’s e-market-base demand is higher, information sharing is more valuable for the supply chain players. Using our analysis findings, we indicate marketing strategies that the manufacturer and the e-retailer may want to adopt.</jats:p>"

However, accurate calculation of promised ship date by suppliers can only be obtained at expense of corporate IT systems that provide accurate availability data. Our study indicates that refresh frequency of availability data in IT system substantially impacts accuracy of the ship date that is promised to customer. The value of customer service level corresponding to accuracy of promised ship date needs to be estimated against the costs of having necessary IT system. The estimation requires a simulation model of availability management process. In this paper, we describe how to model and simulate the availability management process, and quantify the customer service level resulting from various availability refresh rate.</jats:p>"

While RFID’s promise for improved inventory visibility and automation in inventory management is making many supply chain players hopeful for increased sales and reduced operating costs, these benefits do come at a cost and involve risks. This paper presents a financial returns analysis that captures RFID’s costs and benefits, and quantifies the financial risks of implementing RFID for various business sizes and products with different unit profits to understand when RFID makes business sense. More precisely, the returns analysis is performed using an econometric model to understand how break-even sales volumes, unit profits, tag prices, return on investment, and risks vary between a manufacturer and a retailer in a supply chain. The results are extended to multi-product cases as well. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to understand the returns in pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.</jats:p>"

This study examines different structures of e-networks (i.e., virtual supply chains linked via electronic information and communication technologies) and their maximum capabilities to gain e-network benefits. Further, this research explores four levels of e-network integration based on a 2x2 e-network technology and transaction integration matrix. Of the four levels, an e-network with high e-technology/high e-transaction integration appears to be most desirable for the companies that aspire to achieve the maximum benefits from their IT investments. Finally, this study identifies three alternative transformation paths toward a powerful high e-technology/high e-transaction integration network and discusses strategic implications of selecting those paths, in terms of e-network structures, availability of financial and technical resources, supply chain members’ collaborative planning, e-security mechanisms, and supply chain size.</jats:p>"

Over the last decade significant advances have been made in information and communication technologies. Many new companies have been founded to promote these technical advances. This research looks at both the upstream and downstream participants to determine the degree to which information technologies are currently being utilized and the degree to which these new technologies have driven performance improvements in the beef industry’s supply chain. We find through our survey that, by and large, the beef industry does not use information technologies to their benefit and that the US beef supply chain is not yet strategically poised to enable the use of these technologies.</jats:p>"

This study is one of the first to present simulation model of inventory control system in supply chain management using barcode and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The main objective of this model is to compare two inventory systems in a supply chain, one using RFID, versus the barcode. The model will help company to consider moving from a barcode system to the RFID application. A quantitative analysis based on a simulation model is developed. The model runs for both systems using ARENA simulation software with a comparison between the two systems. Furthermore, the simulation model is tested by applying three different types of demand for both scenarios. The results have shown that regardless of demand distribution pattern and customer order rate, the outcomes of the model are consistent and provide promising RFID technology adoption to improve inventory control of the entire supply chain system. The installation and unit cost of RFID implementation were estimated and considered to be the main barrier. Such model can offer the policymakers insight into how RFID might improve SCM system performance. Additional test has been conducted for demand with normal and triangular distributions using real data provided by ABC-Dubai Company. The results obtained from running the two models for these distributions are consistent with the original results.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Experiences from enterprise-wide integration initiatives during more than four decades indicate that industry-wide information integration could render substantial benefits. Two ways in which industry-wide integration differs from enterprise-wide integration are that there is no common management level and the economic units in the integration are the constituent units, not the industry. Management involvement has been emphasized as perhaps the most critical success factor for enterprise-wide information integration. The common economic unit enables increased costs in one part of the organization to lower the total cost in the company as a whole. In this article the authors address which consequence these two differences have for the development of information integration in four industry-wide supply chains. The authors find the existing methods for enterprise-wide information integration, such as BPR, virtually impossible to apply on industrywide information integration and that the disjoint economic responsibility is a hampering aspect in reaching potential benefits of industry-wide information integration.</p>",

The temporary nature of the relationship and the informal structure of the network can be the source of various challenges and risks. This chapter reviews the literature and investigates the risks associated with Virtual Enterprise Networks. It also argues that innovation is very important for managing/ mitigating risks and supports this argument by proposing a framework which defines a risk mitigation process under the perspective of supply chain innovation. This chapter also discusses ways to innovate within the virtual enterprise network and facilitating newfound innovation. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of future research areas and items of conclusion.</jats:p>"

GSCMS providers, according to the requirements of the supplier network leader, trained the representatives of suppliers. All suppliers of two sample vendors (manufacturers of electronic products) were surveyed. Five putative influencing factors were considered: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, training, computer anxiety, and computer self-efficacy. We find four factors significantly affect user satisfaction. The results show that the training provided by focal vendors will influence the satisfaction of users. Next, the anxiety and uncertainty experienced by users decreases when they acquire more knowledge about the operation of the new GSCMS. Finally, user satisfaction can be increased by designing the functions and interfaces of a GSCMS in accordance with the user perceptions of usefulness and ease of use, moreover, implications and suggestions are also discussed.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, a conceptual strategic framework for increasing value chain flexibility is proposed. This framework addresses issues such as the company’s own strategy towards the supply chain partners, the organization strategy, the logistics approach, the market strategy, the production strategy and finally innovation. To support the validity of our proposed framework, an empirical study is presented followed by the conclusions propagated by this study and a description of future research prospects.</jats:p>"

About 64 percent of Chile's one million microenterprises,which account for 60 percent of the nation's employment, lack access to banking services, a drawback for the country's otherwise exemplary economic performance. Banks are often reluctant to extend financial services to low-income entrepreneurs because of what they consider excessive risk, represented by the lack of a credit history for borrowers, their low incomes, and relatively low levels of education. This market is also associated with high service costs. BCI concluded that the microenterprise market, largely ignored,could fit into its growth strategy, offering both profits and an opportunity to help fulfill the bank's social mission.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The continued rise in global sourcing and manufacturing has significantly extended supply chains for many companies and has added to their complexity, often implying business fragmentation and virtualization, and thus increase supply chain risk. At the same time, there is now a growing realization that the supply chain ‘begins on the drawing board’; meaning that design decisions can dramatically impact the risk profile of the business. Historically, most organizations have been functional in their structure with responsibility for each stage in the value chain, including design being separate from the other. In today’s challenging markets these ‘silo’ type structures have been found wanting as typically they are not capable of rapid response to fast-changing requirements. This paper is focused on the need to bring design into the heart of supply chain management to achieve a more responsive - and hence competitive - organization. Thus, the primary purpose of this paper is to propose that one of the ways to achieve a more responsive and resilient enterprise is by better aligning product design with the supply chain and hence developing a concurrent design strategy. The recommendations suggest ways in which managers and key decision makers can adopt a more ‘design centric’ approach to their supply chain, which has been shown to enhance the resilience and responsiveness of a firm.</jats:p>"

A review of the corresponding literature indicates mainly theoretical approaches, which attempt to provide solutions to certain problems. In this chapter, a theoretical framework of supply chain risks analysis is proposed. Within this framework, studied risks are determined by possible disruptions that affect supply chain ability to function normally. Thus, supply chain performance parameters are taken as a basis for a risk measurement system. Correspondingly, supply chain reliability parameters and performance fluctuations are studied in order to manage risks. A possible implementation of the proposed framework is discussed through the presentation of a simulation example. Still, the evaluation of the proposed framework’s practical application remains an item of the future research agenda. The ultimate objective of the research presented in this chapter is the elaboration of a software solution for supply chain modelling and risk evaluation.</jats:p>"

Business continuity has focused on the business processes of individual organizations. A business process in a supply chain can involve multiple discrete organizations. This chapter draws on the approaches used by individual organizations to implement continuity and apply them to a supply chain. Typically, supply chains are dependent on IT and workplace for staff. Both can be impacted in a disaster. If one member of a supply chain is affected, this will affect other organizations in the supply chain, magnifying the impact of the initial disaster. The chapter also examines the issues of service supply chains as well as physical goods. A practical outline plan for the development, auditing, and testing of a continuity plan for a supply chain and its management within an overall supply chain governance is proposed as a starting point for supply chain managers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to escalating global competition and a decline in profit margins, most multinational corporations pursue global sourcing through a global supply chain (GSC) in order to secure market share and improve profits. The practice of e-commerce and the business trend of mass customization force both manufacturers and retailers to shorten cycle time by managing GSCs more effectively. Successful applications of GSCs, such as that by Dell Computer, have been widely discussed and publicized in the supply chain literature. However, the physical distribution of GSC execution is recognized as its weakest link and can result in inefficient and unreliable product delivery. The collaborative integration with global third party logistics (3PL) to execute physical distribution dictates the success of any GSC application. This article introduces an application of logistic collaboration, namely collaborative transportation management (CTM), which is a new business model that includes the carrier as a strategic partner for information sharing and collaboration in a supply chain.</jats:p>"

This includes their upstream suppliers and downstream customers. A supply chain involves a number of tiers of suppliers and customers that extends from the initial source of raw materials through to the final consumer of the finished product. Supply chain management involves the coordination of a number of functional areas in multiple organisations. Large amounts of information can be captured describing the activities in these organisations. It is possible to use this information in order to assist in decision making at strategic, tactical, and operational levels of the supply chain. The large volume of information available and the interdependencies between the activities within these multiple organisations means that it is necessary to employ computerized decision support systems to optimize supply chain activities.</jats:p>"

As a consequence, national boundaries are becoming less important to the large, multinational corporations who now operate on a global scale. Corporate global networks range from short term outsourcing contracts to long term investments in developing countries that offer low cost operations and/or the promise of future market expansion. Today the Internet and high-speed data networks enable knowledge tasks to be completed practically anywhere in the world, allowing companies in the developed world to achieve cost savings or simply stay competitive enough to survive by shifting work offshore (Saunders, 2003; Schultz, 2004). As a result, an increasing shift of work to low-cost countries will continue for the foreseeable future.</jats:p>"

However, the dynamics of the organization and the market make this challenging. In particular, the procurement function is a crucial link between the sources of supply and the organization. With most organizations spending at least one-third of their overall budget to purchase goods and services, procurement holds significant business value. Emerging technologies, especially e-procurement, are promising to change the picture of traditional procurement processes. However, the implementation of e-procurement is facing significant reengineering and change management challenges. This study identifies four main challenges in e-procurement implementation: business process integration, technological issues, value creation, and change management. The major challenge among them is change management. Critically, leadership is one of the primary requirements to make the change successfully.</jats:p>"

The information systems needed to monitor all of these activities are a critical part of the mix.

The American Water Works Association and ASME Innovative Technologies Institute have jointly developed an American National Standard to enhance the security and resilience of drinking water and wastewater systems. The ASME-ITI, under the Department of Homeland Security’s sponsorship, initiated discussions with the water sector to consider the development of sector-level guidance based on RAMCAP Plus. The RAMCAP Plus process is composed of seven interrelated analytic steps, which provides a foundation for data collection and interpretation, analysis, and decision making valuable for understanding and managing risk and resilience. The process is designed to guide the selection of options that reduce risk and increase resilience, including informing funding decisions. The joint standard fulfils the need identified in the water sector-specific plan. It facilitates the reduction of risk and the enhancement of resilience at water and wastewater systems across America.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, these data have been collected through, for example, panel interviews, camera tracking, and in-store observation. Their nature is more or less subjective. Modern technology makes it possible to use more objective methods, such as wireless local area network (WLAN) and radio frequency identification (RFID). In this article we examine the possibilities WLAN provides information systems studies. The empirical data is collected from a large DIY (do-it-yourself) store. The results show that WLAN has great potential for accurate and objective data collection processes and modeling data in retailing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decentralised supply chain formation involves determining the set of producers within a network able to supply goods to one or more consumers at the lowest cost. This problem is frequently tackled using auctions and negotiations. In this paper we show how it can be cast as an optimisation of a pairwise cost function. Optimising this class of functions is NP-hard but good approximations to the global minimum can be obtained using Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP). Here we detail a LBP-based approach to the supply chain formation problem, involving decentralised message-passing between potential participants. Our approach is evaluated against a well-known double-auction method and an optimal centralised technique, showing several improvements: it obtains better solutions for most networks that admit a competitive equilibriumCompetitive equilibrium as defined in [3] is used as a means of classifying results on certain networks to allow for minor inefficiencies in their auction protocol and agent bidding strategies.</jats:p>"

There is a lack of understanding of the phenomenon from strategic management and international business perspectives. This article conceptualizes international subcontracting as a type of relational contract formed by buyers and suppliers from different countries, aiming to facilitate the sourcing of products or components with buyer-specific requirements. It builds a transaction cost model for studying the strategic choice of international subcontracting as an intermediate governance structure, sitting between arm’s length outsourcing arrangement and vertically integrated multinational enterprises (MNEs). A set of propositions are developed to aid future empirical research and to provide managers with some guidelines for organizing supply chain across borders. The model also allows managers to examine the complex nature of a range of subcontracting relationships and identify the specific mechanisms that can be used to preserve and manage the dyadic principal-subcontractor exchanges.</jats:p>"

Because these plant‐derived peptides are resistant to degradation and exhibit a diverse range of bioactivities, they have become important agronomic and industrial objectives. They belong to a group of compounds with low market volume and high price that are poorly processed by microorganisms, are too complex for economic chemical synthesis, and thus are valuable candidates for the synthesis in plant cell bioprocesses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on rapidly changing market conditions and increasing pressure on cost and productivity, companies in different industries have started to concentrate on their core competencies and to decrease vertical range of manufacture. This resulted in an increasing dependency between the producing companies and their suppliers. Enterprise networks are formed emerging the necessity to focus on the strategic development of supply network partners. While currently strategic purchasing mainly deals with direct suppliers future strategic purchasing needs to deal with flexible and dynamic supply networks. This results in a paradigm shift in the domain of strategic sourcing from a supplier centric to a supply network scope. In order to support the paradigm shift the development of a reference model specifying the organizational and functional implications is necessary. This chapter therefore introduces a reference model for the domain of strategic supply network development extending the traditional frame of reference in strategic sourcing to a supply network perspective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Mega cities in developing countries are mostly dependent on external funding for improving the civic infrastructures like water supply. International and sometimes national agencies stipulate financial justifications for infrastructure funding. Expansion of drinking water network with external funding therefore requires explicit economic estimates. A methodology suitable for local condition has been developed in this study. Relevant field data were collected for estimating the cost of supply. The artificial neural network technique has been used for cost estimate. The willingness to pay survey has been used for estimating the benefits. Cost and benefit have been compared with consideration of time value of money. The risk and uncertainty have been investigated by Monte Carlo's simulation and sensitivity analysis. The results in this case indicated that consumers were willing to pay for supply of drinking water. It has been also found that supply up to 20 km from the treatment plant is economical after which new plants should be considered. The study would help to plan for economically optimal improvement of water supply. It could be also used for estimating the water tariff structure for the city.\n                        </jats:p>"

Regulatory authorities are demanding stricter customer compliance, and customers are demanding real-time data for better decision making. At the same time, customer demand is becoming more erratic thus the need for enhanced supply chain coordination with an objective to enhance overall customer value. Radio Frequency Identification RFID, an enabler of supply chain visibility, has the potential to provide customers with large amounts of information at any point in the movement of goods through the supply chain. This technology complements the barcode technology. However, with the acceptance of RFID technology, several managerial and technical issues arise. The focus of this chapter is to thus discuss the relevance of RFID technology for enabling supply chain visibility and adoption related issues.</jats:p>"

Various software industry studies indicate that over the next five to seven years, interenterprise business relationships, information structures, and processes will evolve dramatically. Enterprises will blend internal production and supply chain processes with those of their external trading partners. Currently, organizations are finding creative ways to mitigate supply chain costs while maintaining operational efficiency. New approaches, technologies, and methodologies are aiding with these cost-cutting measures to drastically reduce supply chain costs and increase customer satisfaction. This chapter discusses the background of supply chain planning and execution systems, their role in an organization, and how they are aiding in collaboration. The chapter concludes with a case study on how a supply chain management system could help an organization be more effective.</jats:p>"

Some important challenges such as false read, data overload, real-time acquisition of data, data security, and privacy must be dealt with. Good quality data is needed because business decisions depend on these data.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RFID (radio frequency identification) technology can be expressed in the most universal manner as wireless identification technology, which does not need the line-of-sight to be read or written. It offers enhancement of identification technologies like barcode technology. Optical barcode technology was developed in 1948 by Silver and Woodland at Drexel Institute of Technology and first commercially used in 1966 (Adams, 2002). Barcode technology stores data in the widths and spacings of printed parallel lines, or in patterns of dots, concentric circles, and hidden within images. The most extended is UPC code which was invented in 1973 and since then became everyday part of our life. Other commonly used types of barcodes are Code 128, Code 93 (Groover, 1980) and DataMatrix 2D barcode. At this time, mostly the barcodes are keeping inventory and shipments moving. RFID technology has several advantages for managing and collecting object’s data or tracking it as it moves through the supply chain (SC). Two of them are related to the increased abilities of security and reliability of the identification systems. These two properties of identification technologies are equally important for their use in supply chain management (SCM). The purpose of this chapter is to highlight selected areas of this technology that may be critical specific aspects of further RFID development and applications. We have also discussed about differences between RFID and barcode technologies especially in terms of their use in SCM and concluded this article with expectations of further development of this still progressive technology.</jats:p>"

To mitigate this uncertainty and increase performance, organizations within chains exchange information to achieve operational cohesion. However, as some researchers have noted, some supply chains benefit more from increased levels of information sharing than others (e.g. Cachon &amp; Fisher, 2000). To assist in explaining the performance differences experienced by supply chains engaged in information-sharing activities, we introduce a new perspective of information sharing within supply chains based on organizational information processing theory (Galbraith, 1973). More specifically, our work and derived conceptual model posit that individual supply chains may be examined as single information processors and that their characteristics can induce complexities in the shared information which subsequently influence how supply chains process this information. Furthermore, the degree to which supply-chain members’ information systems are compatible with each other is posited to also play a significant role in information-processing capabilities.</jats:p>"

One of the critical aspects during this type of inspection is to have on hand criteria for acceptance or rejection of flaws found during these inspections. The examinations typically include the use of advanced ultrasonic techniques such as Linear Phased Array (LPA), Focused Annular Phased Array (APA), and Time of Flight Diffraction. These techniques can detect and size flaws that are often “Fit for Service” for at least one additional outage cycle. However, schedule limitations during an outage often do not permit for extensive analysis time. Repair decisions need to be made immediately and having criteria available for these decisions are critical. The following is a case study for the generation of acceptance / rejection criteria for power boiler feedwater supply tube bends. The determination of “allowable flaw sizes” is needed to determine which of these supply tube bends need to be removed during the outage. The acceptance criteria in this work is based on the criteria of API 579-1 / ASME FFS-1 “Fitness for Service Standard” [1] to evaluate the rate of growth of the flaws found. Discussion is also made as to the sensitivity of the examination methods used to detect the flaws expected and how this relates to the acceptance criteria generated.</jats:p>",

The proposed model solves the drawbacks of objective function in current supply chain coordination model. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The following helpful conclusions are drawn from the paper: with the increase of the degree of risk averting for supply chain individual member, the optimal order quantity of supply chain is decreasing, while the optimal profit is decreasing; If supplier’s risk averting degree increases, supplier has to increase wholesale price to achieve supply chain coordination; If retailer’s risk averting degree increases, supplier has to decrease wholesale price to achieve supply chain coordination.</jats:p>"

While RFID’s promise for improved inventory visibility and automation in inventory management is making many supply chain players hopeful for increased sales and reduced operating costs, these benefits do come at a cost and involve risks. This article presents financial returns analysis that captures RFID’s costs and benefits, and quantifies the financial risks of implementing RFID for various business sizes and products with different unit profits to understand when RFID makes business sense. More precisely, the returns analysis is performed using an econometric model to understand how break-even sales volumes, unit profits, tag prices, return on investment, and risks vary between a manufacturer and a retailer in a supply chain. The results are extended to multiproduct cases as well. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to understand the returns in pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.</jats:p>"

Supply chain activities begin with a customer order and end with a satisfied customer. There must be an easy access for coordination, collaboration and integration among the suppliers for effective Supply Chain Management. These elements are equally important for fluctuation of orders, inventory maintenance, replenishment lead times, transportation costs etc. Certain incentives are also permitted by the supply chain partners in order to avoid the distortions (unavoidable delays, over ordering etc.).

An activity based cost estimation model, which takes into account stochastic process characteristics as well as setup time, machine failures and product yields, was developed. The activity based cost estimation was found to perform better than the traditional cost estimation. We found that by taking into account the capacity and stochastic nature of the parameters, the cost estimation accuracy is improved significantly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>It is commonly agreed that logistics is very demanding in forest fuel business. Even though logistics and supply chain management (SCM) tools already have found their way into forestry business, for example, in roundwood operations, they are not yet very widespread in the field of forest fuel procurement. The present study investigates if modern supply chain management applications are capable of increasing the profitability of forest fuel procurement operations. Since margins are low, decreasing the provision costs could boost wood-based bioenergy business. The study is based on the investigation of two Finnish forest owners associations (FOA) involved in forest fuel procurement using a modern SCM tool. The investigation is done by cost-benefit analysis (CBA) using the net present value (NPV) methodology to determine the profitability. According to the estimates made by the staff, which are based on data such as work time records and delivery notes from before and after introduction of the new system, in both FOAs, the benefits far outweigh the costs over a considered timespan of ten years. However, the amount of the NPV varied significantly. For FOA1, with an annual chip production of 150 000 loose m3, the NPV is 212 739 euro, while for FOA2, with an annual chip production of 37 000 loose m3, the NPV is 969 841 euro. Even if the NPV of FOA2 seems to be very high, the profitability of SCM tools in forest fuel procurement is clearly demonstrated. Additionally, the results indicate that a considerable cost saving potential in forest fuel procurement is attainable through improving work flows and thus reduce the work input.</ja:p>"

A manufacturer distributes a product through retailers who compete on both price and fill rates. We show that inventory durability is the key factor in determining the underlying nature of incentive distortions and their contractual resolutions. When the product is highly perishable, retailers are biased toward excessive price competition and inadequate inventories. Vertical price floors or inventory buybacks (subsidies for unsold inventory) can coordinate incentives in both pricing and inventory decisions. When the product is less perishable, the distortion is reversed and vertical price ceilings or inventory penalties can coordinate incentives. </jats:p>",

However, it may also enable an adversary using covert channels to surreptitiously learn sensitive information about the supply chain of a target business. We argue that the tracking of tags and the compromising of readers can create covert channels in the supply chain and cause detrimental market effects. To mitigate such attacks, we propose a framework that enables a business to monitor its supply chain in a fine-grained manner. We model the supply chain as a network flow graph, select key nodes to verify the tag flow, and actively search for covert channels. We note that optimal checkpoint node selection is NP-Complete, propose node selection and flow verification heuristics with various tradeoffs, and discuss appropriate countermeasures against covert channels detected in the supply chain. These practical methods can be implemented economically using current RFID technology.</jats:p>"

The essentiality of expendables identifies the strategic importance of the activity, which determines the preferred level of outsourcing. Outsourcing the management of expendables will create a leaner supply base. By using the essentiality model it is found that 35% of the expendables can be outsourced using some degree of hierarchical steering, 48% can be outsourcing using market steering and 17% do not need to be outsourced.</jats:p>"

Hence, there is a necessary to select the best suppliers among various suppliers available. The decision parameters in vendor selection contains vague and uncertainty. The fuzzy theory able to handle this uncertainty, vague, imprecision and subjectivity present in vendor selection process and makes decision process more effective. In the research, we have analyzed an existing system of vendor rating and proposed a better system of vendor rating for the organization. Most organizations use simple additive weighting for vendor rating. However, we have attempted to use the fuzzy decision making method for the purpose. In the proposed approach, linguistic values are used to assess the ratings and weights for these factors. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, a hierarchy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy theory is proposed to deal with the supplier selection problems in the supply chain system.</jats:p>",

By conceptualizing virtual integration as an efficient and effective vertical coordination mechanism, the study discussed in this chapter developed a model to examine the role virtual integration plays in improving manufacturing performance and the antecedent factors that can lead supply chain members to rely on virtual integration to govern supply chain integration. Based on the resource-based view and transaction costs theory, the suppliers’ specific investments and environmental uncertainty are identified as critical antecedents to virtual integration. The results show that the suppliers’ specific investments can significantly improve the manufacturers’ achievement of manufacturing goals, thereby motivating the manufacturer to rely on virtual integration to better coordinate with the suppliers who made significant idiosyncratic investments for enhancing transaction value while controlling the potential hazards.</jats:p>"

Situations are identified where different areas of theory are applicable. The paper also contributes to the discussion on what should be the conceptual domain of international business. Here, it is argued that international exchange is the product of joint decisions made by two or more actors based in different countries. Earlier academic literature reveals a striking imbalance: while one side of the coin – the exporter side – has been extensively studied, the importer side has largely been neglected. In this paper, it is tried to present a balanced view of both sides.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper introduces portfolio management models that can be used for both industrial purchasing and marketing management.

Although in today’s fast paced business environment, numerous supply chain solution tools are readily available to companies, choosing the right SCM software is not an easy task. The complexity of SCM systems creates a multifaceted issue when selecting the right software, particularly in light of the speed at which technology evolves. In this paper, we use the approach of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine which SCM software best meets the needs of a company. The AHP approach outlined in this paper can be easily transferred to the comparison of other SCM software packages.</jats:p>"

Along with the advantages of sharing information, it comes with the challenges of securing data and trade secret. Access control is an important method for securing data storing and sharing within and across partners in supply chains. In this paper, we propose a concept-level authorization model, aiming at addressing the challenges for securing RFID-enabled supply chains. We analyze the data characteristics and summarize common authorization challenges for RFID data from application perspectives. We propose to use concepts to reduce the size of policy repository and eliminate the structural heterogeneity across the information sources. We then focus on the details of semantic propagation rules that reflect the logical, time and spatial relationships. Other ideas such as policy groups and ontology merging techniques are employed to manage the authorization repository in an efficient manner.</jats:p>"

The primary obstacles to growth are the large number of participants in the upstream partners and the lack of coordination between them. Over the last decade significant advances have been made in information technologies. Many new companies have been founded to promote these technical advances. This research looks at the upstream participants, primarily the buyer agencies and principles between the cow-calf producers and the meat packing companies, to determine the degree to which information technologies are currently being utilized and the degree to which these new technologies have driven improvements within the beef industry’s supply chain. We find through our survey that, by and large, the beef industry does not use information technologies to their benefit and that the U.S. beef supply chain is not yet strategically poised to enable the use of these technologies.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the weak points in system security are identified. A stochastic model using measurable values to describe the information system security of a SCM is introduced. Information security is a crucial and integral part of the network of supply chains. Each chain or driver requires a different security level according to the services it contributes to the overall SCM system. Different probabilistic weights are assigned to the four goals CIAA of security depending on the SCM driver’s mission. A Semi-Markov chain model is used to describe the probabilistic nature of different security levels for each driver in the system. A comparison of the steady-state security for a multi-driver model with different levels of attack is performed, and the results analyzed. Enhanced supply chain security could be achieved by identifying the effects of attacks on the security goals of an organization. The use of this model helps to identify weak points in supply chain system security, and offers hints on how to strengthen them. The model is tested by considering intrusion scenarios representing different levels of attack on the SCM system. An analysis of the results is performed using an interactive application.</jats:p>"

These tasks require coordinated valve operation to reduce pressure variation and stabilize flow rate. In this paper, a nonlinear model describing filling dynamics of the supply and return manifolds is presented. The nonlinear model is then linearized around the stack operating point, based on which a model predictive controller is designed to maintain a constant supply and manifold pressures, as well as a constant pressure on the cathode side. Simulation studies demonstrate the model predictive controller is capable of not only regulating constant pressures during steady state operation, but also substantially reducing pressure variations during transient periods. Simulation also indicates that the control system has good robustness against model uncertainty.</jats:p>",

The integrated problem on heat conduction and radiation-convective heat exchange describes the temperature regime in current conductors and current carrying busbars of power electrical apparatus such as circuit breakers or high breaking capacity fuses. Beside steady-state conditions, the transient thermal regime of busbar has an important influence upon whole power supply system from thermal behaviour point of view. Hence, a 3D thermal analysis of a power system including fuse, low voltage circuit breaker and busbars connections, using a specific software package based on Finite Element Method, has been done. From 3D thermal modelling and simulations, the thermal transient impedance for the busbar has been computed. This allows a better correlation between protection characteristics of the fuse and circuit breaker and busbar design.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For over 200 years, scientists have recognized the nearly ubiquitous poleward decline of species richness, but none of the theories explaining its occurrence has been widely accepted. In this continental study of U.S. running waters, I report an exception to this general pattern, i.e., a U‐shaped latitudinal distribution of diatom richness (DR), equally high in subtropical and temperate regions. This gradient is linked unequivocally to corresponding trends in basin and stream properties with impact on resource supply. Specifically, DR distribution was related to wetland area, soil composition, and forest cover in the watershed, which affected iron, manganese, and macronutrient fluxes into streams. These results imply that the large‐scale biodiversity patterns of freshwater protists, which are seasonal, highly dispersive, and sheltered by their environment from extreme temperature fluctuations, are resource driven in contrast to more advanced, perennial, and terrestrial organisms with biogeography strongly influenced by climate. The finding that wetlands, through iron export, control DR in streams has important environmental implications. It suggests that wetlands loss, already exceeding 52 million hectares in the conterminous United States alone, poses a threat not only to local biota, but also to biodiversity of major stream producers with potentially harmful consequences for the entire ecosystem.</jats:p>",

This study presents development of an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model. This model aids in allocating outsourcing and supply-chain resources pertinent to strategic planning by providing a satisfying solution. The model was developed based on the data obtained from a business firm producing intelligent home system devices.

      "abstract": "<ja:p>New and ambitious targets for renewable energy production put attention  to increased supply of biomass. Harvest residues are only to a limited  extent demanded by the traditional forest industries and represent an  unutilized resource for increased production of renewable energy in  Norway. The overall objective of this paper is to study how GIS and  forest modelling can be combined to improve estimates of the supply of  harvest residues, taking different environmental and economic  constraints into consideration. The analyses are based on a case study  of a forest area of more than 40 000 ha in Southern Norway divided into  about 500 private forest properties. The study was carried out by  computations of timber harvest using the forestry scenario model SGIS  based on extensive forest inventory data at stand level. In the studied  area energy utilization of harvest residues is not profitable below an  energy price of about EUR 3.2/GJ (NOK 0.10 /kWh) when the distance from  roadside to industry is 20 km. Above this level supply increases rapidly  over a rather narrow price range and is nearly inelastic above EUR  4.1/GJ (NOK 0.12/kWh). We did not find significant negative shifts in  the residues supply caused by changes in location of roundwood harvest  over time. Exclusion of collection from stands with a site index (H)  below 14 reduced the potential supply of residues by 16â27%. The  optimisation method combined selection of exogenous variables in order  to map observed harvesting level and is probably the best approach to  map future harvest.<ja:sub>40</ja:sub></ja:p>"

In these projects the authors attempt to automate systems integration tasks typically performed manually. The essential form of the solution is to define ontologies of (1) the joint action of the required business process, (2) business domain objects from the viewpoints of the components playing roles in the process, and (3) the engineered interfaces through which the interaction occurs. The authors then use these ontologies, in semi-automated processes, to generate mediators that translate message content to the form required by message recipients. They discuss briefly how these methods suggest the need for a more methodical and rigorous systems engineering practice and semantically richer, computationally accessible exchange and interface standards.</jats:p>"

A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is used to estimate expected price and price volatility; price and supply equations are estimated jointly. In addition to the standard GARCH model, several different symmetric, asymmetric, and nonlinear GARCH models are estimated. These models use different conditional variance specifications (linear or nonlinear) to grasp some additional empirical regularity of data like asymmetry. Asymmetric price volatility means that different volatility is recorded in the case of a fall in prices than an increase in prices by the same amount. The possible existence of asymmetry in the producer's price volatility gives useful information about market structure and possible market power. The empirical results indicate that among the estimated GARCH models the nonlinear asymmetric GARCH model (NAGARCH) seems to better describe producers' price volatility of the Greek broiler industry. Furthermore, the empirical findings show that price volatility is an important risk factor and broiler feed price is the most significant cost factor of the supply response function. Finally, the model provides forecasts for quantity supplied, producers' price, and price volatility. [EconLit. Classifications: Q110, C510, D200]. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The lake is supplied with waters from the four streams, while the outlet from the lake is directed into the Świnka River. The residence time of water is very short in Lake Syczyńskie. A role and variation of water supply from the catchment area were calculated using the mean seasonal loads transported from lakes sub-basins. A range of ionic migration into the basin of the lake was presented by means of daily and five-day radiuses. Among all inflows, C2 and C4 streams that drained Chełm Hills structure, were the most stable ones. The C3 stream that drained lake vicinity, was less important in shaping the quality of the lake water, while stream C1 was the one with a wide range of seasonal loads inconstancy. The highest fluviodynamic and matter transport occurred during the cold season. However, during the warm season in-lake processes were significant in terms of shaping the quality of lake water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management recently has been developing into a dynamic environment that has to accept the changes in the formation of the supply chain. In other words, the supply chain is not static but varies dynamically according to the environmental changes. Therefore, under this dynamic supply chain environment, the priority is given not to the management of the existing supply chain but to the selection of new suppliers and outsourcing companies in order to organize an optimal supply chain. The objective of this research is to develop a multi-agent system that enables the effective formation and management of an optimal supply chain. The multi agent system for optimal supply chain management developed in this research is a multi agent system based on the scheduling algorithm, a cooperative scheduling methodology, which enables the formation of an optimal supply chain and its management. By means of active communications among internal agents, a multi-agent system for optimal supply chain management makes it possible to quickly respond to the production environment changes such as the machine failure or outage of outsourcing companies and the delivery delay of suppliers. This research has tried to suggest a new direction and new approach to the optimal supply chain management by means of a multi-agent system in dynamic supply chain environment</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a result of globalization, supply chains of many large business organizations nowadays tend to cover wider geographic areas spanning across different countries and continents. The growth in length and complexity gradually replaces the traditional linear supply chains with extended supply networks comprising not only suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers, but also service providers. With the increasing use of third-party logistics (3PL) providers by international firms seeking integrated logistics services, many global 3PL providers are forming partnerships with large corporations to take care of the latter’s logistics operations in different regions. The selection of the right 3PL provider for alliance is therefore paramount to the success of global supply chain management. This chapter investigates the significance of this subject and proposes a supplementary framework for evaluation of 3PL providers as global logistics partners for international firms. Using resource-based view theory and competencies hierarchy as theoretical underpinnings, the framework focuses on the core competencies of 3PL providers and their abilities to attain economies of scale helping users achieve their outsourcing objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> China's domestic supply chain networks are getting flat and unbalanced despite its spectacular growth and rise to the enviable position in the global supply chain arena in recent times. The aftermath of continued investment explosion, especially in the coastal areas of the mainland, calls for an interwoven relationship of Chinese companies with the rest of the global supply chains. However, with new information and communication technologies, the real-time problems arising from this flattened supply chains are much more complex, multifaceted and multidimensional. China needs to re-think and re-focus on better alignment to the western values and cultures while managing its global business activities. This paper discusses four recently developed enterprise models in the light of several case studies conducted recently in Australia, China and India to characterise these new flat supply chains: People-Centric, Molecular Organization, Globally Dispersed and Disaggregated Value Chain. These, apparently different but inherently similar models have a vibrant architecture and system behaviour in their core and propose an alternative approach to address challenges of unbalanced domestic flat supply chains in China and helps the Chinese manufacturers to explore an approach to embrace Western values and cultures by enlarging their sphere of influence. </jats:p>",

The infrastructure includes data warehousing, business intelligence software tools, pre-packaged analytical applications, and telecommunications and internet technologies. A noteworthy development in decision support systems, among others, is the emergence of inter-organizational DSS. The second generation of ERP systems consists of several modules to deal with supply chain planning activities. However, there are a large number of issues in supply chain management that cannot be adequately managed by ERP systems. This paper discusses those issues in supply chain management and introduces various decision support systems that has been proposed, or developed to augment the functionalities of the second generation of ERP planning systems.</jats:p>"

So the evaluation of loss of off-site power is important for the PSA (Probabilistic Safety Assessment). Uncertainty of the original parameters of electric grid components may be caused by the shortage of the statistical information, the approximation to model parameters or the statistic error. In order to deal with the uncertainty problem in electric grids, interval analysis method is introduced in this paper. The original reliability parameters that are changing in a certain range are treated with interval number. Thereby the uncertainty of the parameters can be calculated in the whole process of the probabilistic assessment. The proposed method has been tested on the reliability analysis evaluation of T power plant loss of off-site power. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and practical value of the interval analysis method.</jats:p>",

The results showed that top management support, IT infrastructure, training and education, business processes reengineering, trust among partners, open information sharing, and performance measurement are critical factors for Web-based SCC implementation success. In addition, this study revealed that Web-based SCC implementation is positively related to supply chain relationship quality, performance effectiveness, and performance efficiency.</jats:p>"

Also, many applications of DEA assume complete discretionary of decision making criteria. However, they do not assume the conditions that some factors are nondiscretionary. To select the most efficient third-party reverse logistics (3PL) provider in the conditions that both weight restrictions and nondiscretionary factors are present, a methodology is introduced. A numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed method.</p>",

These SCM systems exist within the overall EA of the business. SCM systems are further influenced by the increasing modern-day need for information and communications technologies (ICTs) within a business, to bring together all of its disparate applications. The resultant enterprise application integration (EAI) also stands to benefit immensely from the incorporation of mobile technologies within it. Traditionally, supply chain management systems have involved management of the flows of material, information, and finances in a complex web of networks that include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Thus, these traditional supply chain management systems have a great need for integration under the umbrella of EAI. Mobile technologies can provide time and location independence to these EAIs in terms of information in the supply chain systems, creating the possibility of multiple business processes that traverse diverse geographical regions. This chapter, based on the research conducted by the authors at the University of Western Sydney, discusses the opportunities that arise in supply chain management systems due to the time and location independence offered by mobility, and the resultant advantages and limitations of such integration to the business.</jats:p>"

The power supply is implemented using Silicon-Carbide (SiC) power switches, high-temperature silicon on insulator (HTSOI) control circuitry, as well as custom high temperature magnetics and packaging technology. The heart of this power supply is a custom-built PWM controller. The controller was built utilizing HTSOI component, which operate at temperatures as high as 300 °C. The developed power supply targets high ambient temperature environment applications and includes features such as housekeeping power supply, soft-start and under-voltage lockout. The power supply is packaged using a multi-chip module (MCM) packaging approach. A single layer power substrate and a multiple layer control substrate are used. Bare die devices are utilized to save space, reduce parasitic impedances, and increase temperature of operation and reliability. This paper provides details on the electrical and thermal design as well as fabrication and characterization of the power supply. Additionally, results of the full characterization of this power supply are provided; this includes temperature testing up to 230 °C, efficiency results, load transition behavior, output ripple, etc.</jats:p>",

This article inquires specifically around sub-contracting, especially what is a brand's or a buyer's responsibility regarding workers' rights beyond its first tier of suppliers. In-depth literature on this issue remains scarce despite buyer's responsibility being at the core of outsourcing, the very area that brought disrepute to Nike and thus moved corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the international limelight 15 years ago. This article reviews 12 prominent CSR instruments and asks: do they provide legitimacy to calls that buyers should be responsible for labour conditions down their supply chains? Where do these responsibilities end as abuses become more remote and take place at lower tiers of the value chain? What are the concepts, the principles that attribute responsibility to the buyer company and what concepts are used to limit these responsibilities? What strategies exist to improve conditions at sub-contractor level? Reading a dozen CSR instruments with a keen eye to sub-contracting reveals a staggering diversity of answers. The responsibility of the core company, particularly the limits of responsibility, move in and out of focus. Questions around buyers' responsibilities remain open, but there is a wealth of concepts and experience to draw upon. Professor Ruggie, a United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General, could bring clarity in this area of CSR and is invited to reconsider the justification, scope and content of a buyer company's responsibility to protect workers' rights in its value chains.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Collaborative product platform development in the supply chain faces problems not only with inefficient knowledge management and information exchange between collaborating partners, but also with configuration and carryover strategies — both of which result in large amounts of system variants to maintain, and restrained reuse. To address these problems, this article proposes a new, more system-oriented and abstract, knowledge-based approach to define and describe configurable product platforms. A new platform model concept with a new modeling procedure, consisting of linked, fully configurable generic and autonomous sub-systems, has been devised. The model has been implemented as a separate platform configuration (PFC) system within an envisioned product lifecycle management (PLM) system architecture. The PFC system is the common base for system configuration as well as for information and knowledge exchange between collaborating partners. The proposed platform model and collaborative modeling procedure have been partly verified and validated, in cooperation with the industrial partners participating in a joint research project.</jats:p>",

Creating value in the ISC involves gathering, organizing, selecting, synthesizing, and distributing information. In so doing, ISCs should provide secure, confidential, reliable, and real time access to heterogeneous information, while ensuring that the right information is delivered to the intended recipients at the right time. In other words, security, information quality, and information lead-time delays are critical performance determinants in ISCs. Recent disaster events such as Hurricane Katrina have highlighted the need for and value of ISCs by exposing the vulnerability of supply chains to demand surges and supply disruptions. Mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities requires a mechanism that allows for continuously sensing the environment, detecting existing or anticipated vulnerabilities, and responding to these vulnerabilities in real time through information sharing and collaboration. This chapter describes how the autonomic computing paradigm can be used to build resilient information supply chains by restructuring the associated relationships, chains, and networks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many multi-stage manufacturing supply chains, transportation related costs are a significant portion of final product costs. It is often crucial for successful decision making approaches in multi-stage manufacturing supply chains to explicitly account for non-linear transportation costs. In this article, we have explored this problem by considering a Two-Stage Production-Transportation (TSPT). A two-stage supply chain that faces a deterministic stream of external demands for a single product is considered. A finite supply of raw materials, and finite production at stage one has been assumed. Items are manufactured at stage one and transported to stage two, where the storage capacity of the warehouses is limited. Packaging is completed at stage two (that is, value is added to each item, but no new items are created), and the finished goods inventories are stored which is used to meet the final demand of customers. During each period, the optimized production levels in stage one, as well as transportation levels between stage one and stage two and routing structure from the production plant to warehouses and then to customers, must be determined. The authors consider “different cost structures,” for both manufacturing and transportation. This TSPT model with capacity constraint at both stages is optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the results obtained are compared with the results of other optimization techniques of complete enumeration, LINDO, and CPLEX.</jats:p>"

Transportation is a frontier in achieving the objectives of the supply chain. Thrust is also given to optimization problems in transportation. The fixed-charge transportation problem is an extension of the transportation problem that includes a fixed cost, along with a variable cost that is proportional to the amount shipped. This article approaches the problem with another meta-heuristics known as the Nelder and Mead methodology to save the computational time with little iteration and obtain better results with the help of a program in C++.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The high pressure (HP) turbine steam supply piping for APR1400 (Korea’s advanced power reactor 1400 MW-class) is routed from the Containment Building to the Turbine building via the Main Steam Isolation Valve Room in the Auxiliary building and supported by multiple structures. As such, the seismic analysis utilizing the Independent Support Motion (ISM) is preferable to the Enveloped Response Spectrum (ERS) method which is overly conservative but more widely used in seismic evaluation of piping systems. The ISM method is a mathematically rigorous technique that utilizes the principle of modal analysis to calculate the piping responses from each structure or support group and combines them to obtain the final results. In spite of the more realistic and less conservative approach of the ISM method for the piping systems subjected to multiple support excitations, the application of ISM method on a regular basis has been limited in nuclear power plant piping design because guidelines from the nuclear industry and the regulator are conservative and unclear. In this study, several related studies are performed to evaluate the adequacy of utilizing the ISM method for seismic analysis of the HP turbine steam supply piping for APR1400. Topics studied include support grouping effects, combination effects of responses between support groups, damping effects between PVRC and 4% damping per Regulatory Guide 1.61, and closely spaced modes effects. The results show that the support grouping by each floor of buildings, SRSS combination of support groups, 4% damping with ±15% spectrum peak broadening and absolute double sum (ADS) of modal combination are technically sound and preferable.</jats:p>",

However, e-hubs continue to elicit interest in industries such as car production. Yet, there is little research that investigates firms’ strategies for e-procurement in the automotive industry and the potential benefits of e-hubs to them. This research re-examines the transition from bespoke electronic data interchange to generic electronic procurement, and conflicting motivations and complex barriers at firm and industry level are revealed. The article develops a framework that examines the benefits and barriers to firms joining e-hubs, applies the framework to the car industry, and proposes an e-procurement matrix that offers alternative strategies. Six cases from vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers demonstrate a shallow industry structure that lacks supplier integration, where a particular concern is the emergence of consortium e-hubs that combine a transactional approach for reducing price, with a collaborative approach that requires sharing knowledge. While this dispels the myth of simplistic e-commerce models, the governance of e-procurement across collaborative supply chains is still uncertain.</p>",

It is, more likely, to be solved by the introduction of innumerable changes both in how we understand the problem and how we approach its solution. In this paper we examine the costs and benefits of tax measures that would promote greater involvement of the private sector in the provision of affordable housing. We also examine the costs and benefits of a variety of regulatory initiatives. In an earlier era, centrally directed federal-provincial grant programs for housing run by governments and non-profit organizations were the means of providing affordable housing. Most of the proposals in this paper, in contrast, aim to harness the energy and the efficiency-promoting competition of the private sector. The focus is on decentralized decision-making. Some measures would depend heavily on individual entrepreneurs and non-profit organizations. Others would depend on municipal governments, whose program capacities have grown greatly in recent decades and whose closeness to their constituencies makes them well-placed both to develop and to deliver supportive measures. Our assessment of possibilities suggests that a low-income housing tax credit best balances effectiveness with the need to minimize costs on strained government budgets. Tax measures aimed at investors in multi-unit rental buildings are also likely to meet these criteria.</jats:p>",

This paper analyze the reasons of causing problems of food quality and safety in the agricultural products supply chain from the perspective of the game theory as well as the government incentive and regulatory mechanisms affect the decision-making of farmers and food producers respectively. In the game between crop growers - farmers and food producers, the government play the outsider role and should give farmers subsidies to encourage them to grow high-quality green crops, as far as possible to ensure food safety from the source. In the game between producers and regulators, the government, as the game participant, should be asked to improve the supervision efficiency and the control ability to prevent unqualified food products entering the market.   </jats:p>"

We present treatments formulated to minimize the social preference reasons to give and, despite this, the allocations are identical to our replication of the standard double blind game, implying that altruism might be the wrong interpretation of giving. Instead, we hypothesize that giving might be driven by participants coming to the lab ready ‘to play’. The fact that there are strong correlations between participant responses to an attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder questionnaire and both the rate and level of giving provides direct support for the hypothesis that lab participants impulsively give money away. However, we also show that having players earn their endowments attenuates the bias. </jats:p>",

Although the information technology and livestock industries may seem completely disjoint, they have complementary characteristics that we exploit for mutual benefit. In particular, the farm waste fuels a combined heat and power system. The data center consumes the power, and its waste heat feeds back into the combined system. We propose a resource management system to manage the resource flows and effluents, and evaluate the direct and indirect economic benefits. As an example, we explain how a hypothetical farm of 10,000 dairy cows could fulfill the power requirements of a 1MW data center.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>California’s main source of greenhouse gas emissions is transportation, a relatively uncontrolled sector. Of the major energy commodities used by individuals, transport fuels are alone in lack of utility regulation: the dominance of refineries as transportation fuel suppliers suggests there may be an opportunity for California to engage its refining industry about transitioning into a transportation fuel utility role. While this concept could be extended beyond California, it is uniquely suited to California because of the State’s fuel isolation from the rest of the country: with its demand for a boutique low-pollution fuel, California is served almost exclusively by Californian refineries that face a different set of regulations than most other American refineries do. Due to infrastructural barriers and long vehicle lifetime, most forecasts predict slow penetration of alternative transportation technologies, even as policymakers suggest an urgent need for rethinking the transportation system. These infrastructural barriers, including the chicken-and-egg problem of building fuel supply stations and vehicles that use alternative fuels, may be more easily overcome by a single planning body than by a market that only uncertainly rewards first movers. By ensuring supply of fuels the state wishes to promote, California can more easily launch alternative vehicle policies and incentives.</jats:p>",

Dass aufgrund der verwendeten Dünnschicht-Technologie zusätzlich ca. 1000 Mal weniger thermoelektrisches Material als bei konventionellen Modulen benötigt wird, ist ein weiterer Garant für langfristig kostengünstige Bauteile.

In 2007, the value of Asian suppliers’ total apparel exports to the world amounted to US$ 165 billion which represented 52% of the world’s total apparel exports. The gravity trade model is utilized with an exploration at the aggregate level. Analyzing the data for fourteen exporting countries and their sixteen importing partners from 2000 to 2007, the country-specific, economic, social factors, in additional to logistics performance are analyzed statistically to identify the major determinants that have influenced the apparel trading of Asian countries to the EU-15, and American markets. Taking the robustness advantage of the gravity model, the analytical results indicate strong support for the model with parameters including GDP, per capita GDP, population size, female employment, value added factors and logistics performance. All these show statistically significance and positive effects. In contrast, distance, real exchange rates and wages have negative impacts on apparel trading. An important finding is that new variables, namely exporting countries’ logistics performance can derive competitive advantage, otherwise, it erects a trade barrier in its own right in apparel exports.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent NRC Generic Letter (GL) 2008-01 titled “Managing Gas Intrusion in Emergency Core Cooling, Decay Heat Removal, and Containment Spray Systems” to nuclear power plant licensees in the United States requires demonstration of suitable design, operational testing and control measures in order to maintain licensing commitments [1]. The generic letter outlines a number of actions that are detailed in nature; such as establishing pump void tolerance limits, limits on pump suction void fractions, etc. Each addressee was requested to evaluate their Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), Decay Heat Removal (DHR) system, and Containment Spray (CS) system. For each of these systems, design, operation, and test procedures were evaluated to assure that gas intrusion is minimized and monitored in order to maintain system operability and compliance with the requirements of 10 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 50 Appendix B [2]. In the GL 2008-01, licensees were requested to evaluate the ECCS, DHR and CS systems along four principal areas to ensure that gas accumulation is maintained less than the amount that challenges the operability of the systems, and that licensees shall take appropriate actions when the conditions are identified. The four principal areas are licensing basis, design, testing, and corrective actions. Each addressee was requested to provide a summary description of how the “REQUESTED ACTIONS” in the generic letter were addressed within nine months of the generic letter issue date. If an addressee determined that system or procedure modifications were necessary based on the review of the requested actions but cannot be accomplished within nine months of the date of the generic letter, then the addressee should provide a plan and schedule for completion of the actions. Many plants used their corrective action programs to accomplish this task. In its response, the licensee addressed any alternative course of action that it proposed to take, including the basis for the acceptability of the proposed alternative course of action. The nuclear industry, under the auspices of the Nuclear Energy Institute, has worked collaboratively with the industry to develop solutions and responses to the nine month NRC request, and these responses were submitted in October of 2008. Since that time, the NRC has been reviewing the plant submittals and issuing requests for additional information (RAIs) to the plants for clarification of their respective programs. This paper provides a snapshot review of the regulation of gas voids in the United States by focusing not only on industry actions to address the generic letter but also on the nature of the NRC requests to the nuclear plants for clarification of plant gas mitigation programs. The goal of the paper is to explore if the RAIs will provide some insights on NRC expectations of the industry as plants address gas intrusion in safety related Nuclear Steam Supply Systems (NSSS).</jats:p>",

The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic information exchange is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic information exchange is greater as opposed to operational information exchange. Information quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic information exchange and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic information exchange and operational information exchange are required to enhance supply chain performance. As such supply chain partners should effectively exchange strategic information as the impact is greater on performance. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the chapter’s first aim is to provide justified answers to the question of why the virtual enterprise business model is getting so much attention and correlate these answers with the main business drivers that today’s enterprises are facing. In virtual enterprises, the distributed tasks of the partners must be integrated over and above the barriers of missing face-to-face interactions and cultural differences. The social integration of the virtual network involves the creation of identities for the participating nodes, the building of trust and the sharing of tacit and explicit knowledge between them. The traditional organization already doing well in these areas seems to have an edge when going virtual. As a consequence, trust becomes more and more important in these types of virtual collaboration networks. Therefore, this chapter finally aims to discuss extensively the way of managing trust in virtual enterprise networks as a solution to mitigate collaboration and performance risk in varying business situations and also aims to present conditions for building trust in the virtual collaboration context.</jats:p>"

I find that the 1993 expansion has substantially increased the labor force participation of those women with two or more children. Moreover, the increase in the participation rate was mainly from less-educated women, the target population of the EITC program. Regarding the hours of work, I find evidence that the expansion increased total hours worked by all unmarried women. However, I find no evidence of statistically significant changes in annual hours worked by currently unmarried female workers. </jats:p>",

The model represents a challenge in terms of complexity and software robustness. It was jointly developed by PETROBRAS Gas &amp; Power Department and Det Norske Veritas. It was carried out with the objective of evaluating security of supply of 2010 gas network design that was conceived to connect Brazilian Northeast and Southeast regions. To provide best in class analysis, state of the art software was used to quantify the availability and the efficiency of the overall network and its individual components (such as gas processing units, city-gates, compressor stations, pipelines). The study requests, as input, a lot of information, that should be provided from different sectors of Petrobras, since it is supposed to depict reliability performance of all gas supply chain players. Information such as 2010 design configurations, gas offer and demand profiles, shedding priority, pressure delivery conditions, supply contract and associated penalties, commodity prices, etc., should be raised and addressed. More than twelve processing plants were modeled, in a detailed manner, and have their performance indicators compared. Different gas sources were considered in the study, such as offshore platforms, onshore fields, Bolivia pipeline and LNG ships. Detailed failure probability and repair data were addressed. Contingency plans, for each identified scenario, were made, in order to evaluate probable losses that constitute an input for the reliability modeling. Therefore, two additional software’s were used for their validation: - Pipeline studio – TGNET (from Energy Solutions), to check pressure conditions; and an in-house Petrobras software (PLANAGE), used for best gas allocation purposes. Experienced operational team opinion was incorporated on that contingency plans elaboration. This work constitutes a powerful tool for Petrobras planning and optimization of gas supply chain future configurations. The simulation provides propositions for investments prioritization, based on cost benefit analysis, and as a by-product, contingency plans, that were developed, considering different failure scenarios.</jats:p>",

An exploratory case study is employed to identify potential complementary resources that are required for the successful implementation of Web-based applications that support various portions of the supply chain management task. The utility of a potential complementary resource to each Web-based application for a supply chain task is evaluated to determine the relative value of the resource to the Webbased application. A matrix is then developed to show the degree to which a particular complementary resource is utilized to implement Web-based applications. The contribution of this study is to enhance our understanding of how Web-based applications and complementary resources can work together to create competitive advantages in supply chains.</jats:p>"

It aims to analyze how process interdependencies are managed either through modularity or coordination mechanisms. The paper is anchored in the emergent theory of modularity, a transaction cost‐based perspective of modular systems.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>This paper adopts the case study methodology. It uses an in‐depth case study of Logoplaste, a global supplier of plastic packaging, in particular investigating how the firm organizes supply chain activities around an integration mode designated as “hole‐in‐the‐wall.”</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>In a context of high process interdependence the firm has developed a coordination capability, an ability to manage the interfaces at minimum cost either by modularizing the process or defining appropriate coordination mechanisms. This capability becomes a core competence of the firm that enables it to further appropriate rents that lie at process interfaces.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The case study method limits the generalization of the findings, but allows more depth in the analysis of the proposed framework.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>As the complexity of sourced components increases firms will need to complement their modular approach to supply chain design with new organizational‐coordination skills and an ability to externalize knowledge. The case study provides several examples of the type of coordination required.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research adds to the literature on organizational modularity in two distinct ways. First, it focuses on the development of a coordination capability to manage process interdependences rather than the partitioning of technical capabilities across the supply chain. Second, it brings to the discussion of modularity recent developments in transaction cost economics that go beyond the engineering perspective. A coordination capability represents the organization's ability to organize transactions in order to appropriate rents, rather than merely minimize transaction costs.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It is not unusual for firms in a supply chain to come together and act as a Virtual Enterprise Network (VEN) and the supply chains of today’s globalized and outsourced business environment exhibit many VEN-like features. Looking at VEN risk management from the perspective of supply chain risk management, current ideas on VENs will serve as a base onto which ideas on supply chain risk will be transposed. Many concepts related to supply chain risk will be explored and related to their possible VEN counterparts: risk, vulnerability, robustness, flexibility, resilience and business continuity. Conceptual in its approach and drawing from other areas of research, this chapter introduces four distinct groups of VENS, namely Constrained, Directed, Limited and Free VEN, and concludes that VEN risk management can and should learn from supply chain risk management.</jats:p>"

In these structures, knowledge can be seen as a primary asset. There is a subdivision of cognitive tasks among specialised companies, which exchange knowledge much before they even exchange goods or money. Assuming a knowledge-based view of VEs, implies the necessity to define appropriate methods to manage knowledge exchanges and the associated risks. The aim of this chapter is to explore the nature of knowledge flows in a VE and study the connected managerial issues to point out the different knowledge-related risk factors and to discuss the challenges posed by their successful management. To provide a practical example, the chapter also illustrates the findings of a real-life case-study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organisations that simultaneously cooperate and compete are engaged in what has become known as 'coopetition'. The agri-food sector is one of the oldest and most established supply chains. It contains numerous examples of coopetition and this paper uses six cases drawn from the sector to investigate the concept and operation of coopetition. Observation of the cases leads to a number of lessons that may be of value to management practitioners interested in adopting coopetative strategies as well as to individuals responsible for developing policy within the agri-food supply chain, and academic researchers undertaking further inquiry into the concept of coopetition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Long-distance water-supply project is an effective way to solve the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, but the safety of water conveyance system is threatened seriously by water-hammer. Based on the research of the characteristic of water-hammer with pipe friction considered, the formula of indirect water-hammer is deduced and the application scope of the formula is also discussed, which is the theoretical basis for the design of polyline closure law. To the defects that valve closure time is long and response of accident is slow in the long-distance water-supply project, polyline closure law is designed with consideration of valve overflowing property, which greatly reduces the closure time and water-hammer. At the same time, the flow inertia is large in long-distance water-supply project and break point of polyline closure law is hard to fix. In order to improve the reliability of the mechanical operating system, locking device is installed, which make the polyline closure law carry out successfully and provide a new idea for water hammer protection in long-distance water-supply project.</jats:p>",

Such events can cause interruptions in the supply of water or secondary water pollution in the water-pipe network, which main reason are unfavourable hydraulic conditions of the network operation (low-speed flow), combined with older pipelines or chemical instability of water. In order to determine stationary and unstationary likelihood of occurrence of peak undesirable event (threat to water consumers) Fault Tree Analysis was used, utilizing BlockSim 7. The expanded fault tree for different combinations of failure scenarios, was analysed. The paper contains the methodology of the analysis and an example of application.</jats:p>",

The results provide empirical evidence that RFID technology can increase a supply chain’s agility and reduce the bullwhip effect by reducing inventory holding costs, stock out costs, and inventory-level variances.

Wine grapes constitute the single largest crop in the state of California in terms of total receipts. Allowing for the dynamic adjustments of quasi-fixed inputs, we estimate simultaneous systems of equations for California's four major wine grape growing regions and eight of the most widely grown varieties. We find that California wine grape production is, on the whole, inelastic with respect to prices received. The variety showing the most price responsiveness is Chardonnay. There appears to be no significant difference in price responsiveness between the coastal and inland growing regions, or between red and white grape varieties.

A cooperative game theory framework is utilized between buyer and supplier in order to increase the supply chain performance.

The WPCs from mill to stump were  calculated for three first-thinning stands of Scots pine (Pinus  sylvestris L.) with mean breast-height diameter of the removal of 6, 8,  and 12 cm. Pulp price had a strong effect on the WPC, and the CTL system  resulted in the highest WPC per m at stump. The savings in  procurement costs and gains in energy generation from additional raw  material acquired with the harvesting of loose whole trees did not  compensate the losses in pulp production. Considering removal per  hectare, loose whole trees gave the highest WPCs at stump in the two  stands with the smallest trees and the highest proportion of additional  raw material. Decrease in pulp price and increase in energy price  improved the competitiveness of the whole-tree systems. In the case of  whole-tree bundling, savings in transportation costs did not balance the  high cutting and compaction costs, and the bundling system was the  least competitive alternative.<ja:sup>3</ja:sup></ja:p>"

They propose a model of demand for skills with three production inputs, corresponding to workers with primary-, secondary-, and university-level education. Further, the authors demonstrate that an unprecedented rise in the supply of workers having completed secondary-level education depressed their wages relative to workers with primary-level education throughout Latin America. This supply shift was compounded by a generalized shift in the demand for workers with tertiary education. </jats:p>",

The method resolves the problems of multi-state and dependence simultaneously, by utilizing Markov theory and Bayes network synthetically. Applying the method to analysing reliability of power-supply system in nuclear power plant, the system failure probability, RAW and posterior probability of each component are obtained, which are useful for system reliability evaluation, improvement of weakness and fault diagnosis. Synchronously, the method is proved feasible and effective for solving system reliability that contains dependent and multi-state components.</jats:p>",

Still, combinatory studies on the effects of outsourcing, positive or negative, on the creation and maintenance of organizational knowledge and the related risks and consequences of outsourcing, remain scarce. Given the popularity of both fields of organizational analysis we consider the lacking of combinatory studies as striking. In this paper, we present the findings drawn on a multiple case study analysis of four medium size pharmaceutical companies, all of them having implemented outsourcing strategies. The chapter attempts a categorization of risk sources during the outsourcing initiative, proposes mitigating actions and organizes the findings of the research on the case companies by proposing a model of ‘vicious cycle’ suggesting that outsourcing, if not managed successfully, eventually leads to the addiction of the organization to ‘buy’ expertise and knowledge in spite of knowledge acquisition. While we identify the conflicting strategies and rhetoric, we also attempt to come up with a set of guidelines, which could help organizations avoid the knowledge negative side effects of outsourcing.</jats:p>"

Innovation of contrast agents and advances of new US technologies have dramatically changed both diagnostic and treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, the breakthrough technique, pure arterial phase (PAP) US imaging, which depicts only intranodular arterial supply by use of maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, was developed from advanced raw data-storing and accumulation technologies. A total of 8 dysplastic nodules (DNs), 16 early HCCs, 5 nodule-in-nodule type early HCCs and 48 overt HCCs were included in this study. All 8 DNs (100%) showed arterial hypovascularity in the PAP followed by preserved portal perfusion at the portal phase and isouptake at the Kupffer phase by Sonazoid-enhanced contrast US. A total of 12 out of 16 early HCCs (75%) showed similar patterns on vascular and Kupffer phase imaging of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. The remaining 4 HCCs showed slightly hypervascular pattern without venous washout and slightly decreased Kupffer uptake. All 5 nodule-in-nodule type early HCCs presented partial arterial enhancement within hypovascular nodule at the PAP followed by isovascular pattern at the portal phase and partial Kupffer defect within isouptake nodules. All 48 overt HCCs showed a hypervascular pattern with Kupffer defect on contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. This technique can clearly identify whether blood supply in the tumor is of arterial or portal origin, and facilitate the noninvasive characterization of nodular lesions associated with liver cirrhosis. In conclusion, this newly developed innovative technique can depict pure portal supply in early HCC and DN, enabling differentiating premalignant lesions and early HCCs from overt HCC even though dynamic CT or MRI does not have such capabilities.</jats:p>"

Supply chain managers are being required to respond to the challenges of new legislation, standards and regulations; changing customer demands; drivers for efficiency, cost effectiveness and return on investment; while simultaneously being ‘green’. The fundamental tension between business and environmental drivers is difficult, but critical to understanding how to effectively re-engineer and re-design existing supply chains in a manner that is sustainable both financially and environmentally. Information systems have a significant role to play in supporting corporate responses to environmental management and the development of holistic green logistic solutions. This chapter examines contemporary discussions on the current state of sustainable supply-chain management and green logistics. It presents a case study from the Fujitsu Corporation in Japan and explores models of information systems and RFID use in green logistics. Combining insights from the case and existing models the chapter explores an example of how a combined model can be used to explore the potential of a specific emerging technology (RFIDs) in ‘greening’ supply chains.</jats:p>"

By answering four critical research questions, the paper focuses on the role of performance measurement systems (PMSs) as a CSF to support QII and discusses which PMS is more appropriate for the different SC context existing in the new economy.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The methodology adopted in this research relies on different approaches. In order to evaluate the readiness of a company in the SC to start a QII, the authors propose a checklist of CSFs defined through a literature review. Further, to evaluate the impact of PMSs to support QII at the SC level, the authors review PMS literature and discuss the characteristics of the various PMS available.

In addition to incorporating stochastic situations, simulation also enhances decision making by offering the flexibility to understand system behavior when cost parameters and policies are changed in a timely, cost-effective, and non-disruptive manner. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate an approach toward modeling disruptions, risks and other crisis events in virtual enterprise networks. It provides several illustrations from published literature, presents a framework for managers and researchers to better apply and gain from the strength of simulation modeling, identifies several common pitfalls to avoid during the process, and compiles extensive references for readers who want to further their knowledge in this specific area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nThe mixed crop–livestock farming systems of semiarid tropical Kenya are characterised by low livestock feed supply. The contribution of lablab and velvet bean to fodder production in a maize production system was investigated in the eastern region of Kenya. The experiment was run in three cycles, where each cycle consisted of a short legume fallow phase of ~6 months, followed by a maize-cropping phase. At the end of the fallow phase, the legume herbage was incorporated in soil at three levels; 0, 50 and 100% of total DM yield and maize planted. Maize yield from the legume fallow plots was compared with maize grown after natural fallow and maize top-dressed with 40 kg nitrogen/ha and nil nitrogen fertiliser. Overall, herbage DM yield was highest in velvet bean (3.9 t/ha) followed by lablab (3.4 t/ha) and lowest in natural fallow (2.2 t/ha). Mean crude protein from velvet bean was 13.5% of DM, which was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that of lablab (8.4% of DM) and natural weedy fallow (3.5% of DM). Maize grain yield following lablab fallow was 38% (3569 kg/ha) and 27% (1810 kg/ha) in short rains (SR) 2002 and SR 2004, respectively, higher than maize succeeding natural fallow. However, maize planted after velvet bean fallow was 43% (3728 kg/ha) and 29.4% (1828 kg/ha) in SR 2002 and SR 2004, respectively, higher than in maize grown after natural fallow. Generally, the highest maize yield among the fallows was recorded in plots where legumes were incorporated in soil at 50% of total DM implying that the other 50% was available for livestock feed. Maize stovers DM yields were highest at the higher (100%) and middle (50%) level of legume incorporation, and yields were more than those from natural weedy fallow. Maize production under the legume fallow system was more profitable than from natural weedy fallows. It was concluded that if lablab and velvet bean are integrated in cropping systems as fallows, they can provide highly nutritious livestock feeds and improve maize yield and are recommended in the maize production systems within semiarid tropical Kenya.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the impact of supply reliability on a retail firm's performance under joint marketing and inventory decisions. The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort. </jats:p>",

The author examines potential contradictions between ‘alternative service delivery’ business models, on the one hand, and goals of good governance and sustainability on the other. A case study of water conservation and efficiency programs implemented by municipal water utilities in Canada is used to show that specific alternative service delivery (ASD) models which seek greater distance between management and government can create incentives which deter utilities from pursuing important social and environmental goals. The neoliberal governance reform that commonly accompanies and encourages ASD tends to exacerbate its deficiencies vis-à-vis conservation in the water sector. Still, the prevalent government-led service delivery model can impose trade-offs of its own. Strategic (rather than ideological) improvements in governance can enable municipalities to reap the benefits of a variety of business models (including ASD) without compromising sustainability objectives. </jats:p>",

In this study we—instead of using commonly used cluster or resource dependence theories—utilize SCM framework to describe the development and path-dependence of knowledge-intensive geographical area, which is specialized in high tech or actually ICT business. In the context of geographical analysis, or of geographical economics, SCM is less-used viewpoint. This case study shows that SCM, and especially strategic level SC endowment viewpoint (introduced initially in Rusko, Kylänen &amp; Saari, 2009), is valuable and useful tool in analysing the geo-economic development and pathdependence of a high tech centre. As a result, we notice that the development of Oulu is based on the development of SC endowment connected with amounts of talents and also multi-dimensional coopetition. One essential result is the observed erosion in the SC endowment of high tech Oulu, which sets remarkable challenges for city planning.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capillary supply and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition of three different intrinsic tongue muscles was analysed in the anterior and posterior regions of the human tongue with biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. Mean capillary density for the whole tongue was 796 ± 82 cap/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, without regional differences. The overall number of capillaries around each fibre (CAF) was higher in the posterior than in the anterior region (2.5 vs. 2.1, p = 0.009). However, correcting for regional differences in fibre size, CAF per fibre area was higher in the anterior region (4.3 vs. 3.0, p &lt; 0.001). Muscle fibres containing fast MyHCs predominated in the anterior region (78.7%), consisting of MyHCIIa (58.5%), MyHCIIx (1.0%), MyHCIIa+MyHCIIx (11.3%) and MyHCI+MyHCIIa (7.9%). Fibres containing slow MyHC predominated in the posterior region (65.2%), consisting of MyHCI (45.5%) and MyHCI+MyHCIIa (19.7%). A minor fibre population (&lt;2%) contained unusual MyHC isoforms, namely MyHC foetal, MyHC slow-tonic, MyHC α-cardiac or MyHC embryonic. The microvascularization of the human tongue was twice as high as in human limb muscles. Regional similarities in capillary supply, but differences in fibre phenotype composition, suggest that human tongue muscle fibres are fatigue resistant independently of MyHC content. High frequency of hybrid fibres, that is fibres co-expressing two or more MyHC isoforms, indicates a wider spectrum of fibre contractile properties than in limb muscles. In conclusion, human intrinsic tongue muscles showed internal specialization in distribution of MyHC isoforms and capillary supply, but not in the expression of unusual MyHCs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The RFID value proposition allows grocery retailers to remain competitive by boosting the supply chain overall efficiency and by generating substantial cost savings. Although these cited benefits are significant, the exact description of how they are attainable in practice has remained vague. Drawing on the preparation and implementation for a RFID pilot in the supply chain for short-life products, this paper discusses the practical issues that one might encounter and that might undermine the successful implementation of RFID. From the findings it emerges that while there are opportunities, there are also some major practical challenges in implementing RFID. These challenges include the placement of the RFID readers, the automation of the tagging process, tagging identification levels (i.e. case/pallet) and issues that are specific to the application. We argue that a fuller understanding and appreciation of these practical challenges informs the academic discourse around RFID and offers a valuable insight to grocery retailers on how to align their technology decisions with their business practices in the attempt to fully reap the benefits of RFID. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Chronic tendinopathy injuries to the canine common calcaneal tendon are relatively common in large breed dogs and typically affect the distal portion of the tendon. In humans, poor blood supply, biomechanical faults, poor training methods and fluoroquinolone administration have all been linked with the development of Achilles tendinopathy. The most common sites for Achilles tendinopathy in humans seem to correspond with areas of poor blood supply within the tendon.</jats:p><jats:p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the blood supply of the canine common calcaneal (Achilles) tendon to determine if variations occur along the tendon. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the microvascular blood supply at varying points along the tendon.</jats:p><jats:p>Paired pelvic limbs were collected from 12 large breed dog cadavers. A 50% barium sulphate and 50% saline solution was infused into the femoral artery of one limb from each dog and radiographs were taken to outline the blood supply to the common calcaneal tendon. Indian ink was infused into the contralateral limb. The common calcaneal tendon was removed, fixed and sectioned at 1 cm intervals, from calcaneal insertion to musculotendinous junction. The ink-filled arteries and arterioles in each section were counted. Radiographs revealed fine branches from the caudal saphenous artery entering the mid-body of the tendon along its cranial border. The musculotendinous junction had additional branches from the gastrocnemius muscles. Distally, vessels radiated proximally from the calcaneus 2 to 3 cm into the tendon. Mean total vessel counts at the insertion (138.54 ± SD 31.06) were significantly higher than all other sections (p &lt;0.001). The mid-body had significantly lower total vessel counts. When the cross sectional area of the tendon was taken into account, only the insertion had a significantly higher mean vessel count/cm2 than the mid-body of the tendon. There were no other significant differences in mean vessel count/cm2.</jats:p><jats:p>Areas of poorer blood supply did not correspond with the most commonly reported site for chronic common calcanean tendinopathies, suggesting that inherent poor blood supply at the site of injury may not play a role in the pathogenesis. Atraumatic handling and minimal manipulation should be used during the surgical approach and debridement to preserve the remaining blood supply in ruptured tendons.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An equilibrium economic model for policy evaluation related to electricity generation has been developed; the model takes into account the non-renewable and renewable energy sources, demand and supply factors and environmental constraints. The non-renewable energy sources include three types of fossil fuels: coal, natural gas and petroleum, and renewable energy sources include nuclear, hydraulic, wind, solar photovoltaic, biomass wood, biomass waste and geothermal. Energy demand sectors include households, industrial manufacturing and commercial enterprises (non-manufacturing businesses such as software firms, banks, restaurants, service organizations, universities, etc.). Energy supply takes into account the electricity delivered to the consumer by the utility companies at a certain price which maybe different for retail and wholesale customers. Environmental risks primarily take into account the CO2 generation from fossil fuels. The model takes into account the employment in various sectors and labor supply and demand. Detailed electricity supply and demand data, electricity cost data, employment data in various sectors and CO2 generation data are collected for a period of seventeen years from 1990 to 2006 in U.S. The model is calibrated for the aggregate data. The calibrated model is then employed for policy analysis experiments if a switch is made in sources of electricity generation, namely from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. As an example, we consider a switch of 10% of electricity generation from coal to 5% from wind, 3% from solar photovoltaic, 1% from biomass wood and 1% from biomass waste. It should be noted that the cost of electricity generation from different sources is different and is taken into account. The consequences of this switch on supply and demand, employment, wages, and emissions are obtained from the economic model under three scenarios: (1) energy prices are fully regulated, (2) energy prices are fully adjusted with electricity supply fixed, and (3) energy prices and electricity supply both are fully adjusted.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon March's (1991) notions of exploration and exploitation, an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is conceptualized as a simultaneous pursuit of both explorative and exploitative supply chain practices. We operationalize this concept as a second‐order latent construct that captures the co‐variation between exploration and exploitation within the context of a manufacturer's supply chain management strategy. Using survey‐based data gathered from 174 U.S. manufacturers, we find that an ambidextrous supply chain strategy coincides with combinative competitive capabilities and business performance. Our empirical finding contradicts conventional wisdom that argues for tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. Instead, our empirical results are in line with an emerging complementarity view advocating that supply chain managers build practices to gain operational efficiency while simultaneously searching for opportunities to gain operational advantages. In addition, we provide insights regarding the role of combinative capabilities in mediating the relationship between an ambidextrous supply chain strategy and business performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Taking a bottom-up approach, we examine how supply network configuration at the macro-level evolves as a result of individual retailers' dynamic choice of procurement strategies at the micro-level. Employing agent-based modeling, we focus on the effects of switch cost and distributors' ordering policy on the evolution of supply network configuration. Our results show that (1) supply networks tend to evolve into a set of separate supply chains when switch cost is high and into an integrated network when switch cost is low, (2) a responsive ordering policy adopted by distributors is more conducive to the integrated network configuration than a non-responsive policy, and (3) lack of coordination among retailers in their dynamic choice of procurement strategies hurts not only the overall system performance, but also retailers themselves. More importantly, our study demonstrates the capabilities of agent-based modeling as a methodology for researching complex supply network issues. </jats:p>",

The objective was to determine the microbiological and physicochemical quality of wells in the west and east of the Cuautla-Yautepec aquifer in Mexico. Wells showed bacteriological contamination in at least one sampling. Coliform values were lower than the maximum permissible limit indicated in the Mexican Ecological Criteria of Water Quality (1000 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 ml of fecal coliforms) for supply sources. The number of isolated amoebae was low, but these were present all year round. Amoebae were found in 71.7% of the samples and belonged to 13 genera. The most frequent amoeba, Hartmannella, occurring in 44% of the samples, has been associated with eye and brain infection, but its role as a cause of infection has not been confirmed. A gradient was observed for dissolved solids according to altitude; the concentrations of dissolved solids increased in wells with lower altitudes. Total hardness values were above 180 mg/L CaCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, therefore the water is considered very hard, and both carbonate and non-carbonate hardness was detected. The average values of physicochemical parameters were below the maximum permissible limits indicated in the Mexican official norm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today supply chain management has become one of the crucial factors for gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage. Enterprises that can more effectively manage their supply chain network have a higher likelihood of success in the marketplace. To this end, companies need not only make the “make” or “buy” decisions but also differentiate across potential suppliers in order to improve operational performance, and hence, supplier selection is one of the key decisions aiding effective supply chain management. Many studies have also pointed out that the integration of product and supply chain is a key factor for profitability and efficiency. However, prior studies mostly address supply chain performance after the creation of a new product; and only a few studies discuss when and how to incorporate supply chain decisions during product design. In the studies that cover product design, product family and product platform concepts are presented as enabling vehicles for mass customization, which require a considerable investment, and hence might be out of reach for small to medium size enterprises (SME). Accordingly, there is a need to develop a methodology that can consider manufacturability and supply chain issues at the product design stage. This paper presents a graph theory based optimization methodology to tackle this problem. The supplier selection issue is considered by evaluating its impact on both engineering (e.g., process planning) and operational performance (e.g., cost and time), which are then aggregated as the supply chain performance at the conceptual design stage. A case study in the bicycle industry demonstrates the advantages of this methodology. The synchronized structure of the supply chain and the product design results in simultaneous optimization of both design and supply chain decisions during the early design stages.</jats:p>",

It can also significantly improve purchasing/procurement and production planning decisions by better estimating (for the short-term of course) the variability in demand that will be experienced by a new price for a given product, thus optimizing supply chain operations and minimizing the logistics risks often associated with marketing campaigns. Finally, the tool can also be used to estimate the short-term profitability and break-even point for a proposed new product introduced by a Virtual Enterprise in an existing market, information that greatly minimizes risks related to the introduction of new products in the market, and then to estimate the optimal introductory price for the new product.</jats:p>"

In an in-depth case study of the faltering start of an innovation trajectory in the Dutch wheat supply chain, we show that supply chain innovations should be in line with the interests of the powerful actors in the chain. The direct interests of the actors in the innovation are naturally relevant, but the less visible, indirect effects of the innovation on the power structure of the chain are also especially important. We show that if a chain innovation is expected to decrease the value of a resource on which the current power position of an actor in the chain is based, this actor is likely to resist it. Furthermore, an actor that derives power from the flexibility to choose among suppliers is likely to resist an innovation that requires collaboration and increased mutual commitment. This article also proposes strategies to overcome the resistance of powerful actors to such innovations.</jats:p>",

One of the main aspects addressed is the replenishment process which considers demand forecasting, customer orders, inventory levels, and production and transport planning. Generally, replenishment processes are carried out traditionally by no considering sharing information among the nodes and neither by coordinating the transport planning with the production planning. With this in mind, this paper mainly focuses on proposing a novel decentralized collaborative replenishment model applied to the automobile sector in order to support the decision-making process among automobile supply chain decision-makers. This has been based on the replenishment information that is already used by supply chain members. This work hypothesizes that a collaborative replenishment process could imply a reduction in inventory levels and, in turn, in inventory costs, and that the number of trucks needed to support the replenishment process would be optimized.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Differences in transaction costs (i.e. costs of information processing, monitoring and control) between firms in local supply chains as well as in an international setting may have a negative impact on competitiveness and on creation of value added. Transaction cost disequilibrium is defined as a state in which transaction costs exceed the transaction benefits from the exchange of assets. The goal of this article is to assess whether such a disequilibrium exists for European food supply chains; if so, what its effects are and how it can be reduced. Transaction cost disequilibrium will be investigated at two levels: international competition and within local supply chains. The first focuses on the competitiveness of supply chains in global markets, the second especially regards the competitive position of companies within a single supply chain. To address our research question, we gathered empirical data by means of survey questionnaires and interviews in 2007 and 2008. The results show that internationally differences in transaction costs exist, but perceived disadvantages of EU food firms towards the US are being outweighed by perceived transaction benefits (i.e. preferred higher levels of food safety). However, within local supply chains SMEs are confronted with more than average transaction and compliance costs. Transaction benefits can only partially be reaped, especially because of a lack of transparency of the origin of value added to consumers. Proposed improvements to the competitive position of SMEs - contingent upon supply chain structure and product characteristics - include up-scaling, improvement of innovative power, co-labelling as well as simplification of EU food law. </jats:p>",

The core objective of this chapter is the provision of a decision framework for enterprise formations organized as collaborative clusters, which is a sophisticated form of a virtual enterprise network. This framework, based on the ANP-BOCR model, takes into account clusters’ special characteristics the most important of which is that the supply chain entities do have a clear picture of strategies, policies, needs, strengths and weaknesses of one another. The whole approach is illustrated through a parapharmaceutical cluster case study which reveals that “common” knowledge and risks are very important in an environment where entities are sometimes partners and sometimes competitors.</jats:p>"

Its use in healthcare is comparatively new. Healthcare needs have grown and healthcare organisations become larger, more complex and more costly. There has never been a greater need for carefully informed decisions and policy. DES is valuable as it can provide evidence of how to cope with these complex health problems. However, the size of a healthcare system can lead to large models that can take an extremely long time to simulate. In this chapter the authors investigate how a technique called distributed simulation allows us to use multiple computers to speed up this simulation. Based on a case study of the UK National Blood Service they demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique and argue that it is a vital technique in healthcare informatics with respect to supporting decision making in large healthcare systems.</jats:p>"

Few studies have examined the conceptual and empirical issues involved in improving port sustainability, although port sustainability issues have recently been discussed with some urgency in the goods movement sector. This paper sets out a conceptual model of port sustainability, presents and examines multiple concepts of supply chains surrounding port activity, and identifies both institutional barriers and supply chain bottlenecks. Three different supply chain concepts for seaports are discussed: physical infrastructure chain, economic value chain, and institutional chain. Rather than a narrow focus on an individual port's operational aspects, broader, more systematic supply chain perspectives on cargo movement systems are essential to introduce port sustainability effectively to current U.S. port business practices. Actions are needed, not just from port authorities, but also from other stakeholders, including government, industries, and community groups. Coordinated activities and collaboration would significantly facilitate the implementation of sustainable models of seaport businesses and cargo movement services. </jats:p>",

Existing interoperability solutions are suitable only for large enterprises, however, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack cheap, easy to integrate and easy to customize solutions. This paper proposes a methodology that provides a guide on how to establish interoperability between enterprises through a federated approach. An interoperability service platform is designed and delivered in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper introduces the specifications of the service platform and proposes an interactive framework which is used to establish interoperability between the service platform and other on-premise applications.</jats:p>"

We find that people with high levels of education allocate to the small formal sector, while less educated workers allocate to the informal sector. While high levels of education are given more value in the relatively smaller sectors of salaried employment, observed skills like education appear to be fairly unprofitable in the larger self‐employment sector. The fact that only the small formal sector in urban West Africa both seems to absorb highly educated workers and provide high skill premiums may be an important reason for the observed low demand for education and high dropout rates.</jats:p>",

The nature of supply chain processes with inter-organizational activities, involving different enterprises in a virtual enterprise network, increases the need for control in a well-designed and structured manner. Internal Audit activities and controls can help virtual organizations to improve and operate in a more efficient manner. This chapter proposes a methodological approach for the design of the Internal Audit function for risk assessment and control identification of inter-organizational supply chain processes, using business process modelling techniques and an internal audit–oriented enterprise modelling tool.

Lee, grown in a glasshouse for 5 months at two phosphorus (P) levels (3 (P3) and 30 (P30) mg P kg–1 dry soil) were tested. Leaf appearance rate and leaf area were lower at P3 than at P30 in all species, with M. sativa being the most sensitive to P3. At any leaf age, photosynthetic characteristics did not differ between P treatments. However, Pmax and gs for all the species and Φ for Cullen species increased until full leaf expansion and then decreased. The convexity parameter, θ, did not change with leaf age, whereas Rd decreased. The estimates of leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pleaf) obtained through simulations at variable Pmax and Φ were lower during early and late leaf developmental stages and at lower light intensities than those obtained when Φ was assumed to be constant (e.g. for a horizontally placed leaf, during the 1500°C days developmental period, 3 and 19% reduction of Pleaf at light intensities of 1500 and 500 µmol m–2 s–1, respectively).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze the role of international agrofood supply chains in greening vegetable and fruit products and production in Vietnam. Mainly through contract-based procurement, the export-oriented vegetable and fruit supply chain is better structured and organized than the domestic supply chain. Exporters intervene to some degree in fruit and vegetable farming, to safeguard supply and to improve product quality. Pesticide use is one of exporters' concerns, although pesticide application remains largely controlled by farmers. Despite some endogenous innovations to improve vegetable and fruit pesticide practices, farmers and exporters are especially responding to the demands of importers. Relatively lax import regulations from the main export markets (China and Russia) are the main reason for limited achievements in less-pesticide-dependent vegetable and fruit production in Vietnam. By the same token, these limited innovations constrain farmers and exporters from exporting to more challenging markets in the EU, the US, and Japan. Hence, in Vietnam export markets have hardly induced reduction in the use of pesticides in agricultural vegetable and fruit production. </jats:p>",

However, there are few studies relating the anatomical and ultrastructural changes in response to manganese (Mn) nutritional disorders, This study examined the leaf ultrastructure of Mn-inefficient (IAC-15, Santa Rosa) and Mn-efficient (IAC-Foscarin 31) soybean (Glycine max L.) genotypes in response to three rates of Mn (0.5, 2 and 200 µmol L-1) in the nutrient solution. Symptoms of Mn deficiency developed 12 days after transplanting in IAC-15 and Santa Rosa, followed by IAC-Foscarin 31 on the 15th day. Only IAC-15 and Santa Rosa leaves showed symptoms of Mn toxicity. The Mn concentration in leaves ranged from 8.6 (deficiency) to 886.3 mg kg-1 d.w. (toxicity). There were no changes either in stomata length or stomata number per unit of leaf surface. Cytoplasm disorganization was observed in IAC-15 under Mn-excess. In this case, the cytoplasm was amorphous, densely stained and extensively disorganized, with increased vacuolation. Mn effects were not found in mitochondria and nucleus in any of the genotypes tested. Under all Mn concentrations, many lipid globules were observed in the IAC15 chloroplasts. There was an increase in the number of plastids as well as in the size of starch grains within IAC-Foscarin 31 chloroplasts as Mn concentration in the nutrient solution increased. Genotypes had marked differences in the ultrastructure organization, mainly in leaf chloroplasts grown under conditions of both Mn deficiency and toxicity (the most sensitive genotype was IAC-15).</jats:p>"

An effective modeling approach is central to refueling station location and supply planning decisions. This paper documents a research effort based on a simulation–optimization framework integrating a mixed integer program formulation and a mesoscopic simulation model. The mesoscopic simulation model was incorporated with decision rules to select refueling stations, methods to model the impact of stalled vehicles on traffic flow, and a formula to accumulate each vehicle's fuel consumption under various running speed conditions. The mixed integer program formulation is aimed at maximizing the served demand by deciding which stations to operate and how much fuel to supply given limited resources. The interplay between the simulation model and the optimization model continues until convergence. The proposed modeling approach is applied to a case study based on the I-45 corridor between Houston and Dallas, Texas, to highlight the characteristics of the proposed modeling approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Processes controlling sediment yield vary over a range of timescales, although most process‐based observations are extremely short. Lake sediments, however, can be used to extend the observational timescale and are particularly useful when annually laminated (varved) sediment is present. The sediment record at Kassjön (N. Sweden) consists of ∼6400 varves, each 0·5–1 mm thick. Image analysis was used to determine grey‐scale variation and varve thickness from which annual minerogenic accumulation rate (MinAR) (mg cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was inferred for the period 4486 BC – AD 1900. MinAR varies on annual to centennial scales and mainly reflects channel bank erosion by the inflow streams. The mineral input reflects the intensity of the spring run‐off, which is dependent on the amount of snow accumulated during the winter, and hence MinAR is a long‐term record of variability in past winter climate; other factors will be a variable response to catchment uplift, vegetation succession and pedogenesis. A major shift from low to high MinAR occurred ∼250 BC, and peaks occurred around AD 250, 600, 1000, 1350 and 1650. Wavelet power spectrum analysis (confirmed by Fourier analyses) indicated significantly different periodicities throughout the period 4000 BC – AD 1700, including 275 years for the period 4000 BC – 2900 BC, 567 years for the period 2901 BC – 1201 BC, and 350 and 725 years for the period 1200 BC – AD 1700. The long‐term, centennial scale variability (∼350 years) may reflect solar forcing (<jats:italic>cf</jats:italic> the 385‐year peak in tree‐ring calibrated <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C activity) but interestingly, there is no obvious link to high frequency forcing, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. The high resolution component of the record highlights the relevance of varved lake sediment records for understanding erosion dynamics in undisturbed forested catchments and their link to long‐term climate dynamics and future climate change.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nCumulus matrix genes are positively correlated with oocyte competence [1]. Formation of the expanded cumulus matrix during oocyte maturation is well described; however its function remains elusive. We investigated whether cumulus matrix acts as a molecular filter, based on recognised filtration properties of analogous matrices. We found that cumulus matrix controls metabolite supply to the oocyte and retains prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is critical in oocyte maturation. The uptake of fluorescently labelled hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites showed that cumulus matrix formation significantly impeded diffusion to the oocyte. Expanded in vivo matured cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs, eCG+hCG16h) resisted uptake of glucose and cholesterol compared to unexpanded (eCG44h, P &lt; 0.05), as assessed by confocal microscopy and spatial quantitation of fluorescence (P &lt; 0.05). In vitro maturation (IVM) results in pronounced compositional deficiency of cumulus matrix proteins [2] and poor oocyte quality. Glucose and cholesterol were transported more readily into cumulus cells and the oocyte of IVM COCs (matured in αMEM/5% FCS/50 mIU/mL FSH, 16 h) compared to in vivo matured COCs (P &lt; 0.05 and P = 0.08, respectively). Taking the inverse approach we found that PGE2 synthesised by cumulus cells is retained within the matrix compartment of in vivo matured COCs but IVM COCs did not retain PGE2 and secreted 4.3-fold more into the media. The relationship of retained to secreted PGE2 was significantly higher after in vivo maturation vs IVM COCs (P &lt; 0.0001). This property of the COC matrix reveals a potential mechanism whereby the prostaglandin signal intensifies through a physicochemical mechanism rather than gene regulation. This is the first demonstration that cumulus matrix regulates diffusion toward and secretion from the COC, thus excluding glucose, known to negatively affect oocyte quality, and trapping factors, including PGE2, with critical roles in oocyte maturation and fertilisation. Thus, IVM may reduce oocyte quality due to poor trafficking of metabolites and signalling molecules.\n(1) McKenzie LJ, et al.

The system consists of a 2.2 μF two-stage LC inversion generator, a 2:54 step-up transformer, a 3 nF water capacitor, and a discharge section with a few tens of centimeter length capillary. Adoption of the pulsed transformer in combination with the LC inversion generator enables us to use only one gap switch in the circuit for charging the water capacitor up to about 0.5 MV. Furthermore, step-up ratio of a water capacitor voltage to a LC inversion generator initial charging voltage is about 40 with energy transfer efficiency of about 50%. It also leads to good reproducibility of a capillary discharge which is necessary for lasing a SXRL stably. For the study of the possibility of lasing a SXRL at shorter wavelength in a small laboratory scale, high-density and high-temperature plasma column suitable for the laser can be generated relatively easily with this system.</jats:p>",

Using a transaction cost economics approach, this research shows that relational elements such as expectation of continuity reduce the transaction risks related to behavioural uncertainty or asset specificity. However, transaction costs are not only caused by transaction risks but also by the need to coordinate the individual activities of the buyer and the seller. Inter-organisational coordination is important in transactions with perishable products and products with credence attributes, such as in fresh produce supply chains. To study the impact of different relationship characteristics on the efficiency of transactions in a fresh produce supply chain, we collected and analyzed data from 122 avocado producers in Mexico. We found that information exchange and producer expectation of continuity of the relationship positively affect performance in the seller-buyer transaction. While expectation of continuity leads to lower transaction costs associated with behavioural uncertainty, information exchange facilitates the efficient alignment of interdependent activities. </jats:p>",

The average value of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) in Passaúna reservoir was significantly higher in relation to the values obtained in the other reservoirs. Spawning was total in Iraí reservoir and partial in the others. Allometric growth of the species was negative in Iraí reservoir and positive in the others. The highest condition factor value was estimated in Iraí reservoir, followed by Piraquara and Passaúna reservoirs, respectively. Females predominated in all of the reservoirs during the study period. The sex ratio per length class showed, for the three reservoirs, the predominance of males in the smaller length classes. These results verified that the species uses distinct reproductive tactics in the analyzed reservoirs and that these tactics seem to reflect the degree of stabilization of each environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traffic simulation models are frequently used to support decisions when an evacuation is planned. These models typically focus on traffic dynamics and the effect of traffic control measures to locate possible bottlenecks and predict evacuation times. However, a clear view of the crucial factors that determine evacuation time and emergent traffic states is lacking. In this paper, a structured and comprehensive sensitivity analysis identifies and quantifies the impact of variations in travel demand and network supply in the case of evacuation. The sensitivity analysis involves applying the macroscopic evacuation traffic simulation model EVAQ, in which aspects such as trip generation, departure rates, route flow rates, road capacities, and maximum speeds are systematically varied. That is accomplished using a case study that describes evacuation of the Rotterdam, Netherlands, metropolitan area. Departure rates and route flow rates are found to have a substantial nonlinear impact on network conditions and arrival pattern, particularly when the network load is relatively high, whereas trip generation and road capacities have a smaller quasilinear impact. Maximum speeds, independent of the effect on road capacities, have no significant impact on evacuation. The results, discussion, and conclusions presented can be used to identify the most important factors in (a) verifying, calibrating, and validating an evacuation model; (b) designing a network for evacuation studies; and (c) evaluating and testing the robustness of evacuation plans. </jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that increased imports of fresh produce from new sources outside the European Union could increase the risks of non‐indigenous insect pests. We use a bio‐economic model approach in which the number of species arrivals is a function of the volume of imports, whereas the volume of imports itself is a function of gross domestic product, relative import prices and seasonality. The study has identified clear trends, which show import volumes of fresh produce and species detections increasing from new supply sources. If this trend continues in the future, then the UK inspection agency should expect to confront species from new suppliers in much greater numbers, given that import volumes of fresh produce are income elastic.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Eleven fetuses were used for horizontal sections and two for sagittal sections. Section to section, we first traced the renal pyramids using a pen to understand the lobular configuration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title><jats:p>Fusion of the medullary pyramids was usually evident along the segmental borders, except for the border between the upper and middle segments. This fusion often accompanied a pair of arcuate arteries, each of which arose from a different renal segment, but shared a common corticomedullary junction to supply a single lobule. The incidence of fusion was high along the anterior border of the posterior segment as well as the border between the apical and upper segments. When the lower segmental artery entered the parenchyma distant from the renal hilus, fusion of pyramids occurred along the border between the posterior and lower segments in association with double arcuate arteries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title><jats:p>A single lobule is most likely to be shared by double segments at or near the segmental border. This morphology seems to be a result of lobule fusion during development and growth. Thus, in adults, a dual segmental supply to a single lobule seems to be more frequent than in fetuses.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This study was conducted to determine whether integration of switchgrass (<jats:italic>Panicum virgatum</jats:italic> L.) or big bluestem (<jats:italic>Andropogon gerardii</jats:italic> Vitm.) into cool‐season grazing systems would mitigate this period of low pasture productivity and quality. Cool‐season grass and legume pastures (CS‐Only) were compared to integrated big bluestem and cool‐season grass and legume pastures (CS‐BBS) and integrated switchgrass and cool‐season grass and legume pastures (CS‐SG). The seasonal dynamics of forage dry matter offered, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were used to compare the dynamics of the pasture productivity and quality in each of three treatments. Dry matter offered in the CS‐Only treatment was higher earlier in the grazing season and the peak in dry matter‐offered occurred between 20 and 30 d earlier in the CS‐Only treatment than in the other treatments. The seasonal trend for CP was generally higher and more constant for the CS‐Only treatment than for the CS‐BBS and CS‐SG treatments, which were very similar to each other. The seasonal trend for ADF and NDF was generally lower and more constant for the CS‐Only treatment than for the CS‐BBS and CS‐SG treatments, which were very similar to each other. These findings suggest that, compared to the CS‐Only treatment, the CS‐SG or the CS‐BBS treatments probably will not improve livestock gain or improve the distribution of animal grazing days throughout the summer.</jats:p>",

Water samples were collected from the estates with the private and the public water supplies. The sampling points were at the water source (S), the treatment plant outlet (TPO), and at the nearest houses (H1) and the furthest houses (H2) from the TPO. All estates with private water supply failed to meet the NSDWQ for Al with mean concentration of 0.99 ± 1.52 mg/L. However, Al concentrations in all public water supply estates were well within the limit except for one estate. The pH for all samples complied with the NSDWQ except from the private estates for the drinking water supply with an acidic pH (5.50 ± 0.90). The private water supply showed violated turbidity value in the drinking water samples (14.2 ± 24.1 NTU). Insufficient amount of chlorination was observed in the private water supply estates (0.09 ± 0.30 mg/L). Private water supplies with inefficient water treatment served unsatisfactory drinking water quality to the community which may lead to major health problems.</jats:p>"

The major goal of enteral nutrient supply to these infants is to achieve growth similar to foetal growth coupled with satisfactory functional development. The accumulation of knowledge since the previous guideline on nutrition of preterm infants from the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in 1987 has made a new guideline necessary. Thus, an ad hoc expert panel was convened by the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in 2007 to make appropriate recommendations. The present guideline, of which the major recommendations are summarised here (for the full report, see <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://links.lww.com/A1480\">http://links.lww.com/A1480</jats:ext-link>), is consistent with, but not identical to, recent guidelines from the Life Sciences Research Office of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences published in 2002 and recommendations from the handbook <jats:italic>Nutrition of the Preterm Infant. Scientific Basis and Practical Guidelines</jats:italic>, 2nd ed, edited by Tsang et al, and published in 2005. The preferred food for premature infants is fortified human milk from the infant's own mother, or, alternatively, formula designed for premature infants. This guideline aims to provide proposed advisable ranges for nutrient intakes for stable‐growing preterm infants up to a weight of approximately 1800 g, because most data are available for these infants. These recommendations are based on a considered review of available scientific reports on the subject, and on expert consensus for which the available scientific data are considered inadequate.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
