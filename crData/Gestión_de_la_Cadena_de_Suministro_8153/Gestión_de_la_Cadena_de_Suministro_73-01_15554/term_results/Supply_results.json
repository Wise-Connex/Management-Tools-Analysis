The study is divided into six parts. After a short introduction to get familiar with the topic, the second part is about international relations and compared different problems of developed with problems of developing countries. The third chapter and fourth chapter contain basic knowledge. They inform us about how tourism influences the resources as a consumer, the different forms of motivation and the resultant tourist behavior. The following two chapters give some recommendations for the future. The fifth chapter represents the importance of resource protection and how to developing these in a profitable wise and the sixth chapter specify in the creation of a special product by the perpetuation of cultural traditions.</jats:p>"

Ten specimens were injected with red‐lead and liquid soap to demonstrate the arteries radiographically. Twelve other specimens were injected with Castolite with a sprinkling of red‐lead and yellow dye. The best side of each specimen was studied by radiography and dissection. This study demonstrated: (1) a masseteric arterial plexus supplying the coronoid process and the lateral wall of the ramus with contributions from the facial, masseter, transverse facial and external carotid arteries or combinations thereof; (2) a mental arterial plexus anastomosing with the mental, submental and inferior labial arteries; (3) an inferior alveolar artery supplying most of the body of the mandible with a majority of its branches passing in an upward direction; and (4) periosteal vessels supplying the lower border of the mandible and receiving their blood supply from the blood vessels supplying the muscles attaching to these areas and the periosteum. Supplemental to the above findings were anastomoses between the submental, mylohyoid and sublingual arteries along the medial border of the mandible. Also a significant variation not previously recorded was noted in one specimen in which the sublingual artery originated from the facial artery rather than the lingual.</jats:p>",

The proximal right bundle branch was supplied by both the A-V node artery and septal branch in five hearts, only the septal branch in four, and the A-V node artery alone in one. The anterior half of the left bundle branch was dually supplied by the A-V node artery and septal branch in four hearts, entirely by the septal branch in five, and the A-V node artery alone in one.

The plants were subjected to controlled degrees of drought in surface layers, while a water table was maintained at 85 cm depth. The effect of placing monocalcium phosphate, sodium borate, and calcium carbonate (lime) in the moist subsoil (55 cm depth) was compared with that of application to surface layers, either frequently moistened or dry. Within 8 weeks of commencing surface drought the phosphorus concentration in the shoots had fallen to much lower levels than that in plants grown in surface-moist soil. Deep placement of monocalcium phosphate increased the phosphorus content and yield of the droughted plants, but the effects were greatly enhanced when the deep phosphate band was placed within a soil layer amended with lime and borate. These nutritional effects did not occur with surface-moist plants. The evidence indicated that the combined placement of phosphate, lime, and borate in the subsoil was particularly effective because of a marked increase in lateral root proliferation within the amended layer. Lime did not appear to influence phosphate availability directly through soil chemical effects.  The results emphasize the importance of subsoil nutritional characteristics in stabilizing lucerne yields over intermittently wet and dry periods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a glasshouse experiment subterranean clover plants were grown in soil at various levels of calcium nutrition. The developing burs were buried in separate soil containers to which no nutrients, calcium sulphate, calcium carbonate, or potassium sulphate were applied. When subterranean clover was growing in soil low in calcium, top yield was little affected; but bur and seed formation were greatly reduced. However, when the reflexed flowers were buried in soil to which a calcium salt had been added, bur and seed yield increases of up to 500% were obtained The increase in seed yield resulted from a greater percentage of flowers forming bur, more seed per bur, heavier seed, and less rotten seed. Similar results were obtained in a second glasshouse experiment in which a different soil was used to grow the clover. The beneficial effect of calcium ions around the developing bur was independent of the associated anions, or of the soil pH; nor could it be produced by the substitution of potassium or magnesium for calcium. It seems likely that commercial seed yields and subterranean clover persistence in many areas may be reduced by calcium deficiency in apparently lush healthy pastures. The similarity of this disorder to calcium deficiency in peanuts suggests that other crop and pasture species forming buried seed may also be especially susceptible.</jats:p>"

Plants from the two environments were similar in their percentage content of protein and cell wall materials. Young tissue from the outdoor plants was more digestible than material from the glasshouse, but the digestibility of this material was nevertheless very high in all plants. Thus, it appears that the unusually high nitrogen percentages and digestibilities which have been recorded for tropical grasses in laboratory studies by comparison with field-grown material may not be directly associated with differences in the aerial environment. This point remains to be conclusively tested under precisely controlled conditions. Increase in nitrogen supply from low to moderate levels increased digestibility by 3-5 percentage units, and had a small positive effect on the percentage of total soluble carbohydrates. Very high nitrogen supply lowered the soluble carbohydrate content of the plant tops. There was an inverse relation between tissue nitrogen concentration and the content of cell wall material. The amount of cell wall material increased progressively from the earlier- to the later-formed leaves on a tiller. When compared at a similar age, later-formed leaves tended to be less digestible. This influence of leaf position on nutritive quality is very interesting and warrants further investigation. </jats:p>"

Nitrogen supply was either high (150 p.p.111.) or low (15 p.p.m.) at three stages of development: between the double-ridge stage and floret initiation, between then and ear emergence, or after ear emergence, giving eight treatment combinations. Spikelet numbers were increased only by raising nitrogen supply at the doubleridge stage. Number of grains per spikelet also responded to treatment during the same period, but was greatest when high nitrogen was given until ear emergence. This response depended on the position of the spikelet within the ear, and the basal and terminal spikelets contributed least when nitrogen supply was low. Individual grain weight responded less to treatment than grain numbers. Nitrogen application had a large effect on leaf area duration, but the grain/leaf ratio (G) was depressed. Since their appeared to be no nitrogen effects on photosynthesis per unit flag leaf area, it is suggested that grain yield was controlled mainly by the capacity of the ear to accept carbohydrate, depending on the number of sites available for grain filling. Percentage grain nitrogen increased with lateness of nitrogen application. However, raising nitrogen supply before ear emergence and then decreasing it again also affected grain nitrogen in the ear, which suggests redistribution during grain filling</jats:p>"
