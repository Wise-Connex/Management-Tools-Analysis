A conceptual model of suppliermanagement practices and performance was developed and tested using covariance structural modeling. Survey data were gathered from first‐tier suppliers in the Korean automotive industry. The results showed that in a supply chain, the suppliermanagement practices adopted by first‐tier suppliers affected second‐tier suppliers' performance. Second‐tier suppliers' performance consequently influenced both first‐tier suppliers' quality and delivery performance. These findings suggest that best practices in supplier management should be transferred upstream in the supply chain to improve overall performance of the entire supply chain.</jats:p>",

The benefits that accrue to firms that effectively manage their supply chain partners range from lower costs to higher return on investment (ROI), to higher returns to stockholders. Yet, effective management of one’s supply chain is not easily accomplished. In this paper, we develop this capability as a core skill that will ultimately separate the winners from the losers. We develop the concept of supply chain competence and use learning as a proxy. We explore the pre‐conditions for learning to emerge and the impact of learning on supply chain performance. A number of factors that affect partner‐like behavior also affect learning. Also, learning appears to have a positive impact on performance measures relating to end‐customer satisfaction and being a more market‐focused supply chain. Learning does not appear to affect supply chain performance related to cost.</jats:p>",

The system must incorporate supply‐and‐demand information, and constantly changing information about real world events that affect the chain. This paper provides a structure for these flows through a data flow diagram (DFD) and with a case study of its application to the Alaskan North Slope Oil (ANS) supply chain. The properties of this DFD are presented for push, pull and hybrid push/pull supply chains. Management can use the DFD approach to improve supply‐chain operations. Information flows can be rationalized and streamlined and feedback loops can be defined to measure performance. IT professionals can apply the generic nature of the DFD to a wide variety of logistics activities, including warehouse and carrier operations.</jats:p>",

In particular, a computer model is proposed to simulate inventory replenishment decisions by the retailers and production decisions by the supplier under different demand patterns and capacity tightness. It is found that information sharing and ordering co‐ordination significantly impact the supply chain performance in terms of both total cost and service level. It is also found that the value of sharing information and ordering co‐ordination is significantly affected by demand patterns and capacity tightness. Guidelines are developed for companies to share information and co‐ordinate orders under different conditions. These guidelines can help companies reduce costs and improve customer service levels in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

It is increasingly important that buyers have strong relationships with their suppliers to stay ahead of competition. The establishment, development, and maintenance of relationships between exchange partners is crucial to achieving success (Morgan and Hunt 1994). The goal of this research is to further investigate the nature of buyer‐seller relationships from the buyer's perspective and to address the question — what determines the quality of buyer‐seller relationships? Many factors may contribute to the quality of a buyer‐seller relationship. Quality may depend on the nature of the organizations involved, the individuals in the organizations, and the nature of the situation. This study considers two main sets of variables, interpersonal and aspects of the relationship. Interpersonal variables describe the characteristics of individual company representatives, while aspects of the relationship variables describe the situations buyers and sellers face. A unique aspect of this study is that it considers the role both of individuals and of the organizations they represent.</jats:p>",

Supplier development practices used by buying firms include formal supplier assessment and feedback, supplier incentives, competitive pressure, and direct involvement improving performance through activities such as training and investment. Although it is apparent that such strategies and processes are used to some extent across industries, it is unclear if there are differences in supplier development approaches between product‐ and service‐based firms. The findings indicate that service firms tend to rely on the competitive pressure of market forces to instigate supplier performance to a greater extent than product‐based firms and that productbased firms tend to use assessment, incentives, and direct involvement to a greater extent than service firms.</jats:p>",

Kraljic's portfolio model, which was developed in 1983, seems to be the dominant approach in the profession. This model, however, does not provide guidelines for strategic movement of commodities and/or suppliers <jats:italic>within</jats:italic> the matrix. Based on an in‐depth case study, derived from a major Dutch chemical company, the use of portfolio techniques in purchasing has been explored and described. The results indicate that Kraljic's portfolio approach, when elaborated and tailored, indeed allows for sufficient guidance for developing effective purchasing and supplier strategies. The case study points out what supplier strategies are feasible and what conditions should be met in order to make them happen.</jats:p>",

The method takes the perspective of the purchasing and logistics manager, defines clusters of purchased items, and subsequently assigns each cluster to a suitable way of ordering and inventory management. An application of the method, resulting in an 11 percent overall supply costs reduction proposal, is presented. The application shows that the method is particularly suitable for a first, rough redesign of the existing — usually undifferentiated — way of ordering and managing inventory. In addition, the method may provide a clear format for collaboration among the various disciplines involved in the redesign process.</jats:p>",

It discusses estimation alternatives and issues, and then examines and highlights the role of VaR in the context of a commodity end user with a specific example for a foodservice business. Further, the practical implementation issues of VaR in a corporate environment in general and the purchasing function in particular are discussed. The example and discussions are widely applicable to any commodity end user (e.g., energies, metals, or food‐related commodities), providing potential applications to practitioners and research ideas to academics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Interest in supply chain management has been escalating during the last decade. Using a large sample of durable goods firms located in all major regions of the world, we extend two theoretical perspectives, namely the resource‐based view and the transaction cost economics view of the firm, to better understand the issues behind global sourcing. Both theory extensions were supported in separate by statistically significant regression results. Then, pooling predictors to represent both models together, these measures independently increase the odds of predicting global sourcing. For example, building of a firm’s technological capabilities that was captured through the levels of its R&amp;D intensity, and percentage of revenue it generated from its new products was directly related to the increased levels of a firm’s global sourcing. Transaction costs (e.g. vertical integration, inversely related; length of frozen schedules, directly related) also emerged as a significant predictor of the level of global sourcing undertaken by a firm. This suggests that firms have two alternative ways to globalize operations supply, and raises the interesting question of whether or not these two strategies might operate simultaneously.</jats:p>",

First, the United States increased earnings supplements, payable to low‐income workers, to encourage adults to find and keep jobs. Second, social assistance programs limited the duration of transfer payments and linked support benefits to workers' participation in job search, occupational training, and community work experience programs. These measures increased job holding among economically disadvantaged adults. In the 1980s and 1990s the United States also maintained strong incentives for employers to create jobs for the hard‐to‐employ. Payroll tax and regulatory burdens on employers were kept low, and the modest legal minimum wage was allowed to fall in real terms. US experience suggests that selective supply‐side policies can boost the employment rates of the hard‐to‐employ and help maintain a low rate of structural unemployment.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The physiological, metabolic and anatomical adaptations of skeletal muscle to chronic cold exposure were investigated in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), a species that defends core temperature, and Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), which may adopt a lower set point under unfavourable conditions. Animals were exposed to a simulated onset of winter in an environmental chamber, progressively shortening photoperiod and reducing temperature from 12 h:12 h L:D and 22°C to 1 h:23 h L:D and 5°C over 4 weeks. The animals were left at 4°C for a further 4 weeks to complete the process of cold-acclimation. M. tibialis anterior from control (euthermic) and cold-acclimated animals of similar mass showed a significant hyperactivity-induced hypertrophy in the rat, but a small disuse atrophy in the hamster. Little evidence was found for interconversion among fibre types in skeletal muscle on cold-acclimation, and only modest differences were seen in activity of oxidative or glycolytic enzymes in either species. However, adjustments in Type II fibre size paralleled the muscle hypertrophy in rat and atrophy in hamster. Cold-induced angiogenesis was present in the rat, averaging a 28 % increase in capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:F) but, as this was balanced by fibre hypertrophy across the whole muscle, there was no change in capillary density (CD). In contrast, the C:F was similar in both groups of hamsters, whereas CD rose by 33 % in line with fibre atrophy. Within distinct regions of the m. tibialis anterior, there was a correlation between angiogenesis and fibre size in rats, in which oxygen diffusion distance increased, but not in hamsters, in which there was a reduced oxygen diffusion distance. Consequently, the change in C:F was greatest (39 %) in the glycolytic cortex region of the m. tibialis anterior in rats. We conclude that non-hibernator and hibernator rodents improve peripheral oxygen transport following cold-acclimation by different mechanisms. In rats, an increase in fibre girth was accompanied by a true angiogenesis, while the improved apparent capillary supply in hamsters was due to smaller fibre diameters. These responses are consistent with the strategies of resisting and accommodating, respectively, an annual fall in environmental temperature.</jats:p>",

Elasticities of lost work time that incorporate both the incidence and duration of claims are centred at 1.0 for UI and between 0.5 and 1.0 for WC. These elasticities are larger than elasticities typically found in studies of wage effects on hours worked by men, probably because UI and WC lead to short‐run variation in wages with mostly a substitution effect and the programmes alter the participation margin. Some good evidence suggests that UI smooths the consumption of the unemployed and more clearly indicates that UI progressively redistributes resources. There is substantial evidence that injured workers suffer material hardships even with WC programmes, but research has not provided an overall picture of the insurance and redistributive aspects of WC.</jats:p>",

The supplier needs to incentivize its retailers to adopt stocking policies that are mutually advantageous and that result in the optimal level of market coverage. The focus is on determining the optimal stocking policies for retailers and the resulting distribution strategy given that the supplier has either unlimited or limited capacity. The results provide insights on the optimal distribution strategy and stocking policies for the supply chain. In general, the paper shows that it is optimal for the supplier to use an intensive distribution strategy (i.e., the products are stocked by all retailers). Selective or exclusive strategies are optimal only when retailers are risk averse, stocking synergies exist, and there are differences in demand or supply uncertainties across products. The analysis also shows that retailers hold larger stocks of a product which generates higher supplier margins but only when the supplier has unlimited capacity. If the supplier has limited capacity, then their margins have no effect on retailers' stocking decisions. Contrary to conventional wisdom, retailers hold larger stocks of a product that has less demand uncertainty as compared to one that has more demand uncertainty.</jats:p>",

The study findings have important implications for international public policy, such as trade policies, and for linking policy priorities with private sector requirements for specific capabilities, resources, and performance.

One example is early order commitment, wherein a retailer commits to purchase a fixed‐order quantity and delivery time from a supplier before the real need takes place. This paper explores the value of practicing early order commitment in the supply chain. We investigate the complex interactions between early order commitment and forecast errors by simulating a supply chain with one capacitated supplier and multiple retailers under demand uncertainty. We found that practicing early order commitment can generate significant savings in the supply chain, but the benefits are only valid within a range of order commitment periods. Different components of forecast errors have different cost implications to the supplier and the retailers. The presence of trend in the demand increases the total supply chain cost, but makes early order commitment more appealing. The more retailers sharing the same supplier, the more valuable for the supply chain to practice early order commitment. Except in cases where little capacity cushion is available, our findings are relatively consistent in the environments where cost structure, number of retailers, capacity utilization, and capacity policy are varied.</jats:p>",

While increasing assortment depth can increase sales, it also increases inventory‐holding costs and reduces the amount of space for other items. As space is taken from existing items to increase assortment depth, it reduces the inventory‐holding capacity of existing items on the shelf, increasing expected annual cost of lost sales. The paper presents a conceptual model of the relationships between assortment depth, category gross margins, and the logistical concerns resulting from inventory costs and out‐of‐stocks. Evidence for the significance of depth and resulting costs are provided in an examination of 100 product categories from a case study of a retail grocery chain.</jats:p>",

The study uses a structural modelling approach to assess the relative contributions of the health care supply environment on children’s anthropometric status via the pathway of maternal and child health (MCH) service use. The findings suggest that improvements in the availability of outreach clinics and the structural quality of the closest public facility would be expected to have statistically significant and large effects on the use of MCH services, and that increases in MCH service use would have a statistically significant impact on weight-for-age, but not weight-for-height or height-for-age. The overall impact of the heath care supply environment on nutritional status is assessed through a series of policy simulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigated whether a qualitative manipulation of amino acid mixture could improve the nutritional status of patients undergoing surgery. Patients received total parenteral nutrition for 2 consecutive 5‐day periods. Energy and nitrogen supplies were calculated using a modified Harris‐Benedict equation, with an energy‐to‐nitrogen ratio of 125 kcal/g nitrogen (N). The mean kilocalorie lipids‐to‐glucose ratio was 35% to 65%. There were 6 patients in the control group and 7 patients in the experimental group. The control group received the same standard amino acid solution (Vintene, Baxter‐Clintec, Maurepas, France) for the entire 10 days. The experimental group received the standard solution during the first 5 days but was switched to a more individualized solution during the last 5 days. The second solution was determined from a linear regression performed on day 3 comparing rate of infusion of each amino acid and its plasma variations after 3 hours of infusion with basal values. Amino acids were defined as oversupplied or undersupplied when not within the 95% confidence interval (above or below the curve, respectively). Daily nitrogen balance and urinary excretion of 3‐methylhistidine were measured from day 1 to day 10 in all patients. For the patients in whom these measures were made, amino acid variations except those of lysine (11 of 12), ornithine (6 of 12), alanine (5 of 12), arginine (5 of 12), and glutamate (5 of 12) were within the 95% confidence interval. During the second 5‐day period, imbalances persisted in the control group but were almost gone in the experimental group. Daily nitrogen balance was not significantly different between groups. However, when expressed as a mean over each period, nitrogen balance was significantly higher during the second period in the experimental group than in the control group: 4.5+/‐0.8 g N/d versus 0.2+/‐0.7 g N/d, p &lt;.01. The ratio of urinary 3‐methylhistidine to creatinine decreased from day 1 to day 10 in both groups. These findings suggest that the relationship between rate of infusion and plasma amino acid variation may offer a rational basis for choosing the most appropriate amino acid mixture for catabolic patients. An appropriate mixture would limit plasma amino acid imbalances and improve nitrogen retention. This therapy must now be tested in a larger population of patients.</jats:p>",

While many of the pre‐ and postfusion events have been investigated at room temperature, few researchers have investigated these processes at more physiologically relevant temperatures. We have used autaptic cultures of hippocampal neurons to investigate changes in the size and refilling rate of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles brought about by an increase in temperature from 25 to 35 °C. We have also examined temperature‐dependent changes in spontaneous and action potential (AP)‐evoked release as well as the fraction of the RRP that is released during an AP. Although we found a threefold increase in the refilling rate of the RRP at the higher temperature, there was no apparent change in the size of the RRP with increased temperature. Moreover, we observed a slight but significant decrease in the quanta released during an AP. This increased refilling rate and decreased release probability resulted in a reduction of both the degree and time course of synaptic depression during high frequency stimulation at the higher temperature. This reduction in synaptic depression was accompanied by an increased maintenance of the synchronous component of release during high frequency stimulation. These findings indicate that the dynamics of vesicular supply and release in hippocampal neurons at room temperature are significantly different at near physiological temperatures and could affect our present understanding of the way in which individual neurons and networks of neurons process information.</jats:p>",

We demonstrated that changes in cache retrieval accuracy can also be triggered by experimental variation in food supply: captive mountain chickadees (<jats:italic>Poecile gambeli</jats:italic>) maintained on limited and unpredictable food supply were more accurate at recovering their caches and performed better on spatial memory tests than birds maintained on <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic> food. In this study, we investigated whether these two treatment groups also differed in the volume and neuron number of the hippocampal formation. If variation in memory for food caches correlates with hippocampal size, then our birds with enhanced cache recovery and spatial memory performance should have larger hippocampal volumes and total neuron numbers. Contrary to this prediction we found no significant differences in volume or total neuron number of the hippocampal formation between the two treatment groups. Our results therefore indicate that changes in food‐caching behavior and spatial memory performance, as mediated by experimental variations in food supply, are not necessarily accompanied by morphological changes in volume or neuron number of the hippocampal formation in fully developed, experienced food‐caching birds. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
