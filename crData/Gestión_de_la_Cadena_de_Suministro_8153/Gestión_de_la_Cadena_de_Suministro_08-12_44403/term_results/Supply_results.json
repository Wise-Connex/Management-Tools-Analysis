      "abstract": "<jats:p>Past studies in supply chain management have focused on dyadic relationships (e.g., buyer–supplier), as all relationships in a network begin with a dyad. However, dyads do not capture the essence of a network. We posit in this paper that triads are the fundamental building blocks of a network. To begin considering triads in supply networks, we build on two extant bodies of literature — the buyer–supplier relationship and supplier–supplier relationship literature which offer us the context of buyer–supplier–supplier triads. By doing so, we are taking the first step toward cracking the internal dynamics of triads in supply networks. To build theoretical propositions, we apply balance theory and the structural‐hole concept. We identify nine triadic archetypes of buyer–supplier–supplier relationships and state key propositions that aid in decision making in supply networks.</jats:p>",

The study presented here demonstrates the use of molecular analysis based on fingerprints of DNA extracted from drinking water bacteria as a valuable monitoring tool of DWSS and was exemplified for a DWWS in Northern Germany. The analysis of the bacterial community of drinking water was performed by a set of 16S rRNA gene based fingerprints, sequence analysis of relevant bands and phylogenetic assignment of the 16S rRNA sequences. We assessed the microflora of drinking water originating from two reservoirs in the Harz Mountains. The taxonomic composition of the bacterial communities from both reservoirs was very different at the species level reflecting the different limnological conditions. Detailed analysis of the seasonal community dynamics of the tap water revealed a significant influence of both source waters on the composition of the microflora and demonstrated the relevance of the raw water microflora for the drinking water reaching the consumer. According to our experience, molecular analysis based on fingerprints of different degrees of resolution can be considered as a valuable monitoring tool of DWSS.</jats:p>",

The SED team believes that by applying CMM could promote the following three outputs at the end of its projects: Sustainability:to have last longser and improve community maintenance of constructed systems.Self-reliance:to increase the awareness and capability of communities to solve their own health problems (related to waterborne diseases).Access:to enable communities to access their own resources for operating and maintaining VWS facilities, due to limitation resources from outside sources (Government and or donors).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Community Management Method (CMM)</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>CMM is strategy applied by TOTAL E&amp;P INDONESIE in its projects to promote a sustainable village water supply facilities constructed by community. The SED team considers CMM as an interactive facilititation process which involves representation members of the community in every aspect of water project: community organization, community decision-making, surveying, designing, planning, budgeting, financing, implementing, constructing, water user-free collections, and operation and maintenance activities.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Characteristics of Community Management Method</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The SED considers the following aspects, which mark the implementation of CMM in a VWS project. Community Development Motivators (CDM) acts as FACILITATORS, not as implementers. A facilitator encourages, motivates, and provides relevant training and technical assistance which communities require for good decision-making.Communities are empowered to make decisions, which affect the design, implementation and long-term sustainability of their VWS systems. CDM provides technical and managerial information, which enables COMMUNITY DECISION-MAKING.COMMITTEES are established in communities to facilitate capacity building and community management process.Communities are expected to provide CASH, community contribution, whose purpose is to enhance community sense of ownership and thereby enhance community responsibility for the long-term sustainability of VWS systems.Communities are expected to provide for recurrent of operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) COST through user-fee collections.2 IPTC 12815Emphasis is on SOCIAL PROCESS not technical product.Emphasis is shifted from supply to a demand-managed program design, community demand is, inter alia, by the community_s willingness to form active decision-making committees and to engage in RESOURCE MOBILIZATION (i.e. to pay the community contribution).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>How to Implement Community Management Method</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The SED team classified activities in implementing CMM into 4 (four) stages. The flow and summary of activities in each stage are explained below. PREPARATION STAGE _ meeting with community leaders to introduce the project and its CMM strategy. Conduct technical surveys and analysis the data with community. Conduct a community meeting to inform the project cost and roles and responsibility of each party (Community, Local Authorities and Donors). Establishment of community based organization (Committee) as leader in project implementation. Training for committee members as necessary.PLANNING STAGE _ Activity are focused on project management and organization planning. Committee with project staff facilitates hygiene and sanitation messages development. Based on the design, Committee will develop resources mobilization and VWS facilities construction plans.IMPLEMENTATION STAGE _ In this stage, Committee will implement activities planned in Planning Stage. These include mobilization of cash from community members and local materials such as sand and stones, if available locally, and procurement, delivery and inventory control of material. Once materials and labor have been mobilized, construction begins. In this stage technical training is also conducted as required.SUSTAINABILITY STAGE _ As the end of the construction project stage, community will establish an operation and maintenance committee. The Committee will turns develop the rules and regulations and request approval from community in the community meeting. Committee will also determine the user fee. Committee will also develop a water resource protection.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Support Required to Implement CMM in VWS Projects</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Staff training and support CDM themselves require adequate preparation in adult education and community development principles that are basic to the success of the CMM. Technology Options, technology options for VWS system must be affordable, meet quality standards, yet fall within the technical capabilities of communities (to operate and maintain as well as to self-finance if the systems need repair). Time, special preparation and project implementation take more time under the CMM, as compare with one-year project cycle of the regular project of Community Participation Method (CPM). Commitment to gender in development, women must be included in decision-making roles on village committees. Women have a primary interest in sustaining VWS project because they benefit directly from the timesaving convenience and improved health of children resulting from VWS Development systems. Teamwork, CMM is best implemented in a team work Method. Two or three staff should work collaboratively facilitating the project implementation, although each staff has his / her responsible project sites.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Note:</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Based on experiences during the implementation of Muara Jawa Ilir (one of village project location) water supply project, CDM (Staff) identified the following advantages:Improve community self-reliance.Involves community in decision-making.Increase capability of community organization as decision-making bodies.Enables community to participate in the management of VWS project.Enables community members to be project implementers (rather than passive recipients).Gives community a strong ownership of VWS project.Enables communities to identify and mobilize local resources (cash and labor).Improves community ability to liaise with outside agencies.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The Muara Jawa Village water supply system project was implemented in 2003, served 300 families, employed 5 people, and up to now (2008) the system is still wellfunctioning and maintained.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The content analysis of these job advertisements provided us with a list of supply chain topics, such as inventory management and supply management, and general skills, such as communication and leadership; it also showed the proportion of advertisements requesting these skills. We measured the relative coverage of the same supply chain topics in MBA-level supply chain electives and operations management core courses in 21 of the top 50 business schools in the United States by analyzing the course descriptions and the cases used in these courses. This enabled us to compare the relative importance of supply chain topics to employers on the “demand” side with the relative importance of supply chain electives in MBA curricula on the “supply” side in these schools. Our analysis indicated that the supply usually matches demand; however, there may be an undersupply of practice- or process-oriented topics, such as forecasting, procurement, supplier and vendor management, and contracts and negotiation. In addition, there may be an oversupply of conceptual and strategy-oriented topics, such as product design, supply chain design, and emerging information technology and management information. </jats:p>",

(MES) has been conducting research and development on natural gas hydrate (NGH) technology since 1990s. Since NGH can be stabilized at 253K and is easy to handle, NGH is expected to be an alternative natural gas transportation medium against currently available system including liquefied natural gas (LNG), for the initial investment is considered lower under the certain conditions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Based on the research and development, MES stepped further to practical stage and has been implementing a joint project, which involves an NGH production plant of 5 tpd (NGH)(under commissioning), together with The Chugoku Electric Power Co., Inc. (CEP) with assistance of New Energy Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a governmental institute of Japan since 2006. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate natural gas land transportation by means of NGH. In parallel, MES has been studying feasibility study of NGH ocean transportation chain together with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) and their joint company named NGH Japan Co., Ltd. (NGHJ). The study has been conducted on certain cases in Southeast Asia in cooperation with six leading Japanese companies and with assistance of Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>According to the study, NGH ocean transportation chain can be considered economical compared with conventional LNG system under some conditions including the capacity and distance of natural gas to transport. Furthermore, MES, Mitsui and NGHJ are drawing a plan of pilot marine transportation project with 100 to 200 tpd (NGH) production. If it could be materialized, NGH supply chain will take a step closer to commercialization.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>NGH will provide a new option to monetize small to medium or stranded gas fields that are left undeveloped with existing technology due to its low economical efficiency, and the diversification of distribution method will also contribute to stably deliver low-cost natural gas to the districts where are isolated from current gas supply chains.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Since the idea of ocean transportation of natural gas by means of NGH utilizing so called \"self-preservation effect\" was advocated by Dr. Gudmundsson of Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 1996, various kinds of research on NGH ocean transportation chain have been made in all over the world, as in the case of Marathon Oil Corporation which constructed a test plant of NGH production and started its experimental operation in the United States. MES has been continuously investing in research and development for NGH technology, just like as it has been conducting its research and development on NGH production process, carrier ship, and re-gasification process, etc. since 2001, and as it constructed the experimental plant for process development (Process Development Unit: PDU) and the research and development facility for mixed gas based process incorporating a pelletizer (Bench Scale Unit: BSU) and continued their experimental operation.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

A hierarchical approach to water conservation—reducing consumption as a priority, then considering internal re-use of water and replacement of potable water with alternative sources—should be the key principle in sustainable water management. The application of this approach relies on a sound understanding of water consumption at a site: where water is used, why, when and how. This entails smart- and sub-metering of the water supply and detailed analysis of site activities to produce a site water balance. The hierarchical approach can then be applied, and conservation options can be costed to assess financial viability. ‘Packaging’ measures with different payback times together should be considered, along with funding support available. Based on implemented projects in Australia, an estimated 30% of potable water consumption within the commercial and industrial sectors could be saved at attractive payback periods. By adopting this integrated water conservation and management approach the same outcomes can be achieved with less potable water consumption. Appropriate source substitution is a pillar of sustainable water supply, providing water at less environmental, social and financial cost than the alternatives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Potable water treatment in the state of Western Australia is challenged in many instances by the presence of high and variable levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particularly in surface water supplies. In recent years the effects of climate change on local sources, in combination with the ever-present requirement for on-going disinfection effectiveness and disinfection by-product regulation has driven the need for the development of innovative, sustainable processes for the removal of DOC. Extensive pilot plant studies over a number of years have demonstrated the effectiveness of biological filtration for cost-effectively managing a variety of high DOC source waters, consequently biofiltration is seen as a process of choice for organics removal in drinking water in Western Australia. Although there are a number of indicators for measuring the efficacy of organic carbon reduction across biological treatment processes (e.g., DOC concentration, SUVA, etc), none currently are able to reliably inform on the change in the “non-refractory” organic carbon component of DOC (i.e. biodegradable dissolved organic carbon [BDOC]) which arises from microbiological metabolic activity in the biological treatment process. Knowledge of this parameter is of critical importance to the understanding of biological stability of the finished water entering a distribution system. We have therefore investigated a number of analytical procedures in order to develop a robust test method to accurately quantify this important aspect of biofilter performance. The paper reports a comparison between conventional and rapid methods for the determination of BDOC using immobilised biofilms enriched on deep aquifer water. Effective sample collection, preparation and method of analytical analysis, method validation using natural source water with and without addition of standard amounts of assimilable organic carbon (e.g. acetate), and reproducibility of test results are discussed.</jats:p>",

Modelling this, the main difficulty consists in the selection of significant core models among the enormous number of known substances and regulatory mechanisms, which are afflicted with considerable incertainties in general. We investigate general supply chains and deduce indispensable elements in the regulatory mechanisms from available observations. A critical selection of system properties and underlying mechanisms enables us to simulate observations, which cannot be explained by the classical glucastatic and lipostatic theory. These observations are e.g. the nearly constant energy level in the brain, the different response of the periphery and the brain to atrophic periods and finally, the development of diabetes.

Three planning methods are compared. The first emulates the traditional way of planning. The two other coordinate plans of the supplier and of all the buyers according to the Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) approach. The monolithic method solves a single model describing the entire optimization problem. The sequential method copies the imperfect VMI practice. All three methods are implemented by means of Mixed Integer Programming models. The results presented prove that the right choice of planning method is very important for overall cost of the supply chain. In contrast to the previous research, it turned out that information sharing without full coordination may even lead to increase in the overall cost. For some companies applying the VMI approach, developing exact models and solving them almost optimally may therefore be very important.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drought across swathes of Australia, highlights our need for water conservation in addition to seeking new sources of water (demand and supply-side resource options). Water conservation or efficiency improvement is currently a non-systematic process along the lines of ‘if we do such and such then we will save so much water’. Such an approach is ad-hoc and only has the appearance of being ‘quantitative’. We would class it as qualitative, or maybe advanced qualitative water conservation. True quantitative or structured water auditing of non-domestic water consumption is an iterative, systematic and documented process of obtaining reliable use data, validated by a closure approach. Opportunities are identified for water use reduction, water reuse, recycling and for water resource substitution. Financial assessment of savings in cost against cost of measures will provide a payback period. A water management strategy or Water Management Plan (WMP) as it is known in Victoria, Australia, is devised which is consistent with legal requirements, the enterprise's environmental policy and its movement towards sustainable development. Regulators have legislated for mandatory WMPs and audits in Victoria, but this is the only state so far to do this. Mandatory water auditing should be an uncontested choice as it can only provide a win:win situation regulation to the private sector.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We argue that only the systematic process provided by structural water auditing constitutes quantitative water conservation. Further, statutory obligation for water users to engage in the water auditing process will give the broad, systematic quantitative information, and based upon which optimal water management strategies or WMPs can be devised. This will ensure a rational approach to our future water needs and the needs of our environment. It is anticipated that voluntary auditing in the arenas not mandated will increase in the long term if this is done.</jats:p>",

The chip core is a miniature transformer with a nano-ferrofluid magnetic core. The chip embedded transformer can convert harvested energy from its solar cell to variable voltage output for driving multiple loads. This chip system yields a simple, small, and more importantly, a battery-less power supply solution. The sensor node is equipped with multiple sensors that can be enabled by the energy harvesting power supply to collect information about the human body comfort degree. Compared with lab instruments, the nodes with temperature, humidity and photosensors driven by harvested energy had variation coefficient measurement precision of less than 6% deviation under low environmental light of 240 lux. The thermal comfort was affected by the air speed. A flow sensor equipped on the sensor node was used to detect airflow speed. Due to its high power consumption, this sensor node provided 15% less accuracy than the instruments, but it still can meet the requirement of analysis for predicted mean votes (PMV) measurement. The energy harvesting wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed in a 24-hour convenience store to detect thermal comfort degree from the air conditioning control. During one year operation, the sensor network powered by the energy harvesting chip retained normal functions to collect the PMV index of the store. According to the one month statistics of communication status, the packet loss rate (PLR) is 2.3%, which is as good as the presented results of those WSNs powered by battery. Referring to the electric power records, almost 54% energy can be saved by the feedback control of an energy harvesting sensor network. These results illustrate that, scavenging energy not only creates a reliable power source for electronic devices, such as wireless sensor nodes, but can also be an energy source by building an energy efficient program.</jats:p>"

Temperature-controlled jar-tests (0.1 to 17.0°C) were used to evaluate optimisation of a plant using alum coagulation at pH 6.0 followed by activated silicate addition. pH adjustment was assessed during coagulation and flocculation (i.e. before and after activated silicate) in order to control residual Al by precipitation without affecting turbidity and natural organic matter (NOM) reductions. The effects on NOM reduction were marginal until pH 6.4 in all conditions tested. Turbidity reductions by sedimentation considerably worsened when increasing pH, especially at the lowest temperature. Experimental conditions to eliminate this negative effect were found to be by increasing the pH after silicate addition (from the coagulation pH of 6.0 to between 6.1 and 6.3). By pH adjustments after silicate addition, up to 90% decrease in dissolved Al could be obtained at pH ∼6.8 (from 180 to ∼20 μg/L) at low temperatures. At this pH level, however, turbidity reduction reached minimal values (10–20%) while NOM reduction was clearly affected, indicating partial NOM re-dissolution. Slight pH adjustments of coagulation pH (up to 6.1) or flocculation pH (up to 6.3—after silicate addition) promised significant dissolved Al minimization (down to ∼50 μg/L) without compromising turbidity or NOM reductions.</jats:p>",

The model had considered attachment, detachment, and propagating factors. The attachment and detachment factors are divided into “cell to cell” and “cell to substratum”. Factors for biofilm growth included two possibilities, which was “lateral growth” and “vertical growth”. Data set of the biofilm biomass from a laboratory scale water distribution system was measured. The data and the model simulation curves were compared so as to justify the performance of the model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results show that several sets of parameters could be identified. From the simulation of biofilm biomass in the pipeline, the microbial growth related with the incubation time. Due to nutrients being restricted, the biomass of biofilm in the water distribution system did not continue to grow and reached a maximum at about Day 40. From the simulation results, it was suggested the time of cleaning the water distribution pipeline be shortened to one or two months.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The model was applied to simulate the tap water biofilm in the pipeline of Kaohsiung city, the second largest in Taiwan with 1.5 million population. The results revealed various levels of risks and the proportionality between the biomass in the water and the growth rate of biofilm. However, most households had the purifying facility of a reverse osmosis system. From the simulation, the facility proved its effectiveness for preventing the intervention of bacteria from the biofilm formation in the distribution pipelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Linked to potential health problems and toxicity to crops, boron is present in seawater at concentrations of ranging from 4 to 7 mg/L, and not readily removed by reverse osmosis technology. Commercially available seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes possess a wide range of rejection characteristics for boron in seawater under ambient temperature and pH, ranging from approximately 50% for low-energy membranes to greater than 90% for the newest high rejection membranes. This level of rejection is typically insufficient to reduce boron concentrations in natural seawater to less than recommended levels. Current World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water concentrations for boron are limited to 0.5-mg/L. Two techniques utilized to mitigate boron concentrations are (1) increasing the dissociation of boric acid by increasing pH prior to SWRO; and, (2) utilizing a second pass reverse osmosis system, potentially coupled with pH adjustment. Utilizing these techniques, the authors tested commercially available SWRO membranes from three different manufacturers utilizing feed water alkalization, coupled with a second pass system. Utilizing feed water alkalization alone, the authors found that all three SWRO membranes were able to produce permeate complying with WHO regulations. Using second pass RO, a boron concentration of less than 0.5 mg/L was achieved for feed pH greater than 6, and less than 0.1-mg/L for pH of 10.</jats:p>",

Raw water with a high content of organic matter, typical for Norwegian surface water sources, was treated in this study using a ceramic microfiltration membrane system. Three different pre-treatment options were investigated, a classical two-stage flocculation, a simplified one-stage fast mixing step and an inline flocculation treatment, using an iron chloride coagulant. DOC removal was similar (76–81%, 5.5 mg C/L in raw water) in all compared setups. The more compact, energy efficient inline configuration was investigated further, varying flux (140 and 220 LMH), pH (4.5, 5.5 &amp; 6.5), G-value (60 and 300 s−1) and HRT in the pipe (7 and 30 s), while monitoring DOC removal, fouling rate and residual iron concentrations. DOC removal was strongly pH dependent; 70% at pH 4.5, and 47% at pH 6.5. At high flux of 220 LMH the membrane fouled quickly and sustainable operation was not possible. At 140 LMH fouling was much less and no severe fouling was observed during the experimental period. Residual metal concentration was found to be the limiting parameter in the design and operation of the process configuration. Metal concentrations below the regulation limits (200 μgFe/L) were only achieved at pH 6.5. Reversible fouling was only observed at higher pH values.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring future drinking water supply requires a tough management of groundwater resources. However, recent practice of economic resource control often does not involve aspects of the hydrogeochemical and geohydraulical groundwater system. In respect of analysing the available quantity and quality of future raw water, an effective resource management requires a full understanding of the hydrogeochemical and geohydraulical processes within the aquifer. For example, the knowledge of raw water quality development with time helps to work out strategies of water treatment as well as planning finance resources. On the other hand, the effectiveness of planned measurements reducing the infiltration of harmful substances such as nitrate can be checked and optimized by using hydrogeochemical modelling. Thus, within the framework of the InnoNet program funded by Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, a network of research institutes and water suppliers work in close cooperation developing a planning and management tool particularly oriented on water management problems. The tool involves an innovative material flux model that calculates the hydrogeochemical processes under consideration of the dynamics in agricultural land use. The program integrated graphical data evaluation is aligned on the needs of water suppliers.</jats:p>",

Lessons from past programmes could help the design and implementation of future rural water supply and sanitation interventions as both a means and an end for sustainable and resilient communities, especially in disaster-prone areas. A study was carried out in the disaster-prone Binga District of Zimbabwe to ascertain whether rural water supply has helped in enhancing community resilience. The findings support the argument that, in addition to ‘hard’ technical inputs and ‘soft’ local human resource inputs, rural water supply is only effective if introduced with the ‘right’ reasons identified and made to operate sustainably, rather than for cost-cutting reasons. The latter is likely to reduce rather than enhance and sustain disaster resilience built by communities over centuries.</jats:p>",

The authors use data from the Health and Retirement Study linked to state identifiers to estimate the responsiveness of the labor supply of older workers to the wage and features of the tax code, both on the probability of participating in the labor market and on hours of work for those who choose to work. The authors find that a 10% increase in the wage is associated with a 5% increase in participation, and they estimate slightly larger responses to marginal tax rates. These results suggest that government policies could increase the labor supply of older individuals by changing the returns to work through the tax code. </jats:p>",

Yet while the EU Commission was entering largely uncharted territory, US authorities seemed guided by relevant legislation and case law that has no equivalent in Europe. Still, the US experience so far also shows that public outcries over high–profi le cases are no substitute for a dispassionate assessment of conflicting incentives, inconsistent regulatory standards and essential welfare trade–offs. In fact, it suggests the need to reconsider fundamental policy options and to establish efficient rules so as to ensure a competitive supply of innovative drugs. Contemplating the US experience, this article is organised in five parts. By way of introduction, Part I links US healthcare expenditures, drug research costs and elements of drug regulation and reimbursement to identify four corporate imperatives for product positioning and life–cycle management. Part II focuses on the economics of innovation and intellectual property rights and the need to challenge patents. Part III outlines the structure of the Hatch–Waxman Act, intended to speed up generic substitution, and discusses the evolution of US court decisions on patent settlements in the wake of it. Part IV offers some considerations for modifying the application of Hatch–Waxman rules as well as the processes for contesting patents and pharmaceutical product markets. Part V sums up and links back to the current EU initiative</jats:italic></jats:p>",

This paper considers the spatial and temporal variability of raw and clarified water arising from 16 surface water treatment works in the Midlands region of the UK. A wide range of investigation techniques are applied in order to develop effective strategies for the treatment of NOM-rich water. For the first time, rigorous data mining techniques are applied to a major dataset in order to examine potential inter-relationships between a wide range of quality parameters including, inter alia, total organic carbon (TOC), UV254, coagulation pH, resin fractionation (hydrophilic acids (HPIA), hydrophobic acids (HPOA), hydrophilic non-acids (HPINA)) and total THM formation potential (TTHMFP). This paper focuses on the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to develop robust algorithms for the prediction of TOC removal and hence THM formation. Results show that raw water characteristics can be categorised into three main types, according to their HPOA content and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA.). PCA identified possible THMFP precursors, according to raw water type verified by strong statistical relationships.</jats:p>",

With the help of an intertemporal dynamic consumer model based on the Faustmann tradition, the effects of utility in situ, non-forest income and credit rationing are investigated: The higher the utility in situ and the non-forest income, the higher is the quantity of the long-term timber supply and the lower the quantity of short-term timber supply. The higher the timber price and the market interest rate, the lower the quantity of the long-term timber supply and the higher the quantity of short-term timber supply. Credit rationing leads to essential modifications of those results. The found results also differ strongly from analyses of the pure case of intertemporal profit maximizers. In the second part inductive-empirical studies concerning timber supply of non-industrial private forest owners are presented as well. Reference is made to two papers with review characteristics in which cases from North America and Scandinavia are analysed. In the third part the results of the two different methods are compared and the relations of these two methods are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the fact that deduction shall not equalize theory and the inductive-empirical method shall not be synonym for reality or practice. Instead inductive-empirical research is also theory. Finally it is explained that the low quantity of short-term timber supply by non-industrial private forest owners is not a result of market failure but of a more complex competition among the different usages of forests that emerged in modern societies.</jats:p>",

NEWater, a high grade reclaimed water, is key in achieving water sustainability through the multiplying effect of water reuse. In addition to being used for direct non-potable use (DNU) in wafer fabrication processes and other industrial processes, NEWater is being injected into surface reservoirs for indirect potable use (IPU). To ensure the safety of NEWater for IPU, PUB has adopted a multi barrier safety approach. The multi safety barrier approach starts from source and extends to taps in households in stages, namely source control; greater than 85% of wastewater from domestic source; comprehensive secondary wastewater treatment; microfiltration (MF) process, reverse osmosis (RO) process and ultra-violet (UV) disinfection in NEWater production; natural attenuation in surface reservoirs; as well as conventional water treatment process of coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration and disinfection. The approach is further enhanced by a comprehensive water quality monitoring programme that includes emerging contaminants of concern and a strict operating philosophy. The water quality test results are in turn reviewed by experts from local universities as well as overseas experts of international standing. Over the years of operations, NEWater has been found to be well within WHO Drinking Water Guidelines and USEPA Drinking Water Standards and each safety barrier has a significant role to play in ensuring the safety of NEWater for IPU.</jats:p>",

Vaccination is a primary weapon for fighting influenza outbreaks. The influenza vaccine supply chain has characteristics that resemble the newsvendor problem but possesses several characteristics that distinguish it from many other supply chains. Differences include a nonlinear value of sales (caused by the nonlinear health benefits of vaccination that are due to infection dynamics) and vaccine production yield issues. We show that production risks, taken currently by the vaccine manufacturer, lead to an insufficient supply of vaccine. Several supply contracts that coordinate buyer (governmental public health service) and supplier (vaccine manufacturer) incentives in many other industrial supply chains cannot fully coordinate the influenza vaccine supply chain. We design a variant of the cost-sharing contract and show that it provides incentives to both parties so that the supply chain achieves global optimization and hence improves the supply of vaccines.</jats:p>",

The assessment was conducted in batch, isotherm setup with changes in types and concentrations of QACs, modification pH, additions of H2O2 during modification, and adsorption pH. IOCS modification with long chain QACs, including hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) and hexadecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (HDBDMA) significantly increased the adsorption of NOM, while coating IOCS with short chain QAC, tetrapropylammonium chloride (TPA) had no positive effect. The enhancement increased with increasing pH and increasing QAC concentration used during modification. Co-additions of long chain QACs with H2O2 during modification could further improve NOM adsorption. Modification of IOCS with 10.0 mM HDTMA at pH 9.9 with the 0.2% H2O2 addition doubled NOM adsorption capacity on IOCS at pH 9.1. The results presented here suggest that the modification of IOCS using long chain QACs can enhance NOM removal by IOCS during drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

The primary challenge in developing the process is the severity of both external and internal concentration polarizations, which significantly reduce the water flux across the highly selective membrane. This study investigates the impact of concentration polarization on flux behaviour. A model adopted from the boundary layer concept was used to describe the external concentration polarization effect. A previously developed model for the internal concentration polarization was further improved from the governing convective-diffusion equations, to achieve a better transport model that was in excellent agreement with experimental flux data. Laboratory experiments were carried out to account for both the external and internal concentration polarization and the associated water flux was verified with the improved models. Results showed excellent agreement for both models, which were used to describe external and internal concentration polarization, and these modified models were more accurate than previously used models.</jats:p>",

The resultant technical findings on membrane foulants enable the development of low-fouling membranes and reflect a streamlined process for water purification with stable productivity. This study shows the relationships between the fouling rate of PVDF microfiltration (MF) membranes and NOM characteristics in Lake Biwa (Japan) detected by DAX fractionation and GPC-TC. The amount of the specific NOM (hydrophilic acid: HiA from DAX fractionation) is correlated with the increasing rate of filtration resistance, and the membrane foulants consist of aliphatic carboxylates and calcium ions. From the GPC-TC measurements, the specific NOM around 2,000 Da partially remains on the membrane to indicate a primary ingredient of foulants, while the high-molecular weight NOM (MW &amp;gt; 40,000) is removed without trace by the backwashing process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Channel incision into bedrock plays a critical role in mountain landscape evolution. A bed that is completely alluviated cannot undergo incision. As a result, incision driven by the collision of bedload grains and bedrock requires transport at below‐capacity conditions (for example, where the bed is partially covered by alluvium). In a mechanistic model of bedrock incision, it is important to have a formula describing the relationship between the bedload transport rate and the degree to which the bed is covered by sediment. The purpose of this work is to understand the mechanisms underlying the degree of bed exposure in bedrock rivers by means of an experimental study. A number of experiments with various hydraulic and morphological bed conditions were performed in order to characterize this model. Here we focus on planar bedrock beds with some roughness. The results suggest that the sediment supply, channel slope, hydraulic bed roughness, the degree of areal coverage, and thickness of antecedent gravel in the channel, as well as the presence of boulders in the channel are major factors controlling bedrock exposure. For sufficiently low ratios of sediment supply to transport capacity, it was found that bedrock roughness can play a role in determining the degree of bedrock exposure. For higher sediment ratios, on the other hand, the composite roughness associated with grain roughness, bars, and/or antidunes dominates, so that the underlying bedrock roughness no longer affects the degree of exposure of the bed. For lower bed slopes (i.e., less than 0.015, based on our experimental setting), bedrock exposure decreases more or less linearly with increasing values of the ratio of sediment supply rate to capacity rate. For higher bed slopes (i.e., more than 0.015), there is a range of lower values of the ratio of sediment supply rate to capacity rate where a bedrock surface becomes fully exposed without any alluvial deposit. For a given bedrock roughness, this range expands solely with increasing slope regardless of shear stress. Within the upper range of values of the ratio of sediment supply to capacity rate a linear relationship between the degree of bedrock exposure and this supply to capacity ratio still prevails. The addition of model boulders (can be viewed as very high hydraulic bed roughness) to the channel has been found to suppress the overexposure of bedrock, and so restore a linear relation between the degree of exposure and the ratio of sediment supply rate to capacity rate. Formulations for estimating bedrock exposure as a function of sediment supply to capacity ratio under different river channel characteristics are proposed. A linear relation between the degree of alluvial cover and the ratio of sediment supply rate to capacity rate is a previously proposed model. The present study expands the result for other cases including runaway alluviation. Some landscape evolution models assume an abrupt shift between fully exposed bedrock and complete alluviation, whereas others assume the linear relation. The present study shows that both formulations are valid under different settings of river characteristics.</jats:p>",

This is in line with the study's main intention of assessing the determinants or drivers for effective SCM of small businesses and their impact on the attainment of competitive advantage. The findings suggest an interesting perspective on SCM and distribution channel functions among SMEs where elements of information sharing cooperation and integration are linked to competitive advantage. The correlation amongst the three independent variables of cooperation, information sharing and integration with competitive advantage are all significant, depicting the relevancy for SMEs to focus on these relational elements. The highest correlation is noted between information sharing and integration and this definitely makes sense as SMEs strive to integrate their functions that are moving towards the attainment of common goals. Thus, the more integrated the functions amongst supply chain and distribution partners, the more likely that information would be shared amongst them. However, it is interesting to note that the predictive ability of the relational elements of cooperation, information sharing and integration on competitive advantage is not supported through the regression analysis. In other words, the existence of cooperation, information sharing and integration amongst supply chain and distribution channel members do not necessarily predict that competitive advantage will be attained. There are perhaps other factors that should be considered besides relational elements that influence competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Source waters containing high concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM) have conventionally been treated using metal salts (normally Fe3 +  and Al3 +  based products). The main reason for NOM removal in potable water production is to prevent disinfection by-products (DBPs) from forming during disinfection processes. Using a common water source containing up to 15 mg L−1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NOM removal was assessed using 1) advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (ultra-violet light/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) and Fenton's reagent (FR)); 2) a novel coagulant ZrCoag® (Zr4 + ); and, 3) ion-exchange (magnetic ion-exchange resin, MIEX®) combined with coagulation at reduced coagulant doses. These results were compared with optimised conventional coagulation using ferric sulphate (Fe). High levels of NOM removal were achievable, with between 7–11% increased DOC removal for the advanced treatments over coagulation with Fe3 + . The formation of DBPs (trihalomethanes) for the treatment systems were compared. There were also significant differences in the properties of the floc formed for the different treatment systems. Flocs formed after coagulation following pre-treatment with magnetic resin and coagulation using Zr4 +  resulted in significantly larger flocs compared with Fe3 +  coagulation by 37 and 27% respectively. Flocs formed using FR were smaller than Fe3 +  coagulant flocs by 28%. The paper discusses the practical implications of using the different advanced treatment processes to achieve incremental increases in overall NOM removal when compared with conventional coagulation.</jats:p>",

They begin a dive positively buoyant due to the large volume of air carried in their ventral air-stores, but rapidly enter a protracted period of near-neutral buoyancy before becoming negatively buoyant. This dive profile is due to haemoglobin found in large tracheated cells in the abdomen. Fibre optic oxygen probes placed in the air-stores of submerged bugs revealed that oxygen partial pressure (PO2)dropped in a sigmoid curve, where a linear decline preceded a plateau between 5.1 and 2.0 kPa, before a final drop. Buoyancy measurements made by attaching backswimmers to a sensitive electronic balance showed the same three phases. Inactivating the haemoglobin by fumigating backswimmers with 15% CO eliminated both buoyancy and PO2 plateaus. Oxygen unloaded from the haemoglobin stabilises the air-store during the neutrally buoyant phase after a decrease in volume of between 16% and 19%. Using measurements of air-store PO2 and volume, it was calculated that during a dive the haemoglobin and air-store contribute 0.25 and 0.26μl of oxygen, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the way that obsidian craftsmen at Xochicalco, Mexico obtained the raw material needed to produce prismatic blades at the site between A.D. 650 and 900. The paper models seven different forms of direct, indirect, and institutional procurement that craftsmen could have used to obtain this obsidian. These seven procurement models are evaluated using two types of information collected from four domestic workshops: (1) source analysis (NAA, PIXE) to identify where obsidian came from, and (2) technological analysis to determine the form in which obsidian entered workshops. The results indicate that Xochicalco craftsmen most likely were provisioned through itinerant craftsmen who periodically visited Xochicalco. Pressure cores nearing exhaustion were sold to Xochicalco craftsmen who rejuvenated them to produce additional prismatic blades using a hand-held blade removal technology. The results indicate that: (1) different forms of craft provisioning can be differentiated when multiple forms of data are incorporated into the distributional approach, (2) independent domestic craft specialists were the foundation for Mesoamerican economy and were individually responsible for the procurement of raw materials and the distribution of finished products, and (3) neither state institutions, nor the elite who directed them, were involved in the procurement of obsidian for craft specialists who produced valued tools.</jats:p>",

These suggest bed patchiness that is interpreted in the context of inherent grain size bimodality, localized hydraulic sorting due to spatially heterogeneous (and low) sediment supply, and local deviations in channel gradient. The data also show that tributaries have a minor impact on main stem downstream fining due to basin shape and tectonic history. In addition, subaqueous channel sediments were observed to be finer than nearby sediments collected from exposed bars, which may indicate a narrow active zone of transport where bars are disconnected from sediment movement. This research has implications for bed material collection and theories of downstream fining.</jats:p>",

This paper analyzes the relationship between an automaker, constituted in the form of an industrial condominium, and a systemist supplier operating inside the automaker's plant, exploring the impacts and innovations in the way production is organized and in how the supplier's performance is measured.

The algae were cultured under controlled and axenic conditions throughout all four growth phases and samples taken during these phases were subjected to chlorination to determine disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potentials. Algal cells and extracted extracellular organic matter (EOM) of Anabaena showed a comparable ability to form THM and HAA compounds as humic and fulvic acids. Overall yields of total THM (4) and HAA (9) compounds were closely related to the growth phase, with peak formation in the late exponential-stationary phases. Specific (normalized) DBP yields (yield/unit C) were in the range of 2–11 μmol/mmol C for TTHM and 2–17 μmol/mmol C for THAA. The presence of bromide appeared to increase TTHM formation and decrease THAA formation, thereby leading to a shift in the DBP species from HAA to THM compounds. The distribution of HAA species varied with growth phase. Monochloroacetic acid was found to be the dominant HAA species during the lag and early exponential phases, and a prominent compound in the later growth phases.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the paper develops a differential game model involving operations and marketing activities that are performed by a manufacturer and a retailer in a simple two-member supply chain. We consider a particular single brand of the manufacturer. The manufacturer decides on production volume, production process improvement and national advertising efforts, while the retailer decides her purchase volume by the manufacturer and her pricing policy toward the final consumers. A revenue sharing contract is employed in the non-cooperative setting. Among the issues addressed on the manufacturer side are the trade-off between production and process improvement activities, the path of inventory over time, and the trade-off between attracting new customers and improving the loyalty of current customers. For the retailer we study the inventory and price evolution over time. </jats:p>",

In severely S deficient plants (0.05 mM), Se acted as a toxic element, alfalfa was the most susceptible plant that died at this treatment. However, in plants supplied with near adequate (0.5 mM) or adequate (1.0 mM) S, Se acted as a growth promoting element. The most pronounced stimulation of growth was observed in cabbage and the lowest in alfalfa. Increasing S concentration in the medium, reduced Se uptake and transport. In contrast, S uptake and transport increased in response to Se addition. Se volatilization was higher in alfalfa than cabbage and kohlrabi when expressed on unit shoot dry weight or leaf area basis, but not when expressed per plant. Results suggested that Se supplementation of plants supplied with adequate S, not only had beneficial effects on plants growth but also can have application in enrichment of livestock fodder and human food.;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Owing to the strong oxidation potential, ozone has been used widely in advanced water treatment. However, degradation and oxidation efficiencies of NOM (Natural Organic Matter) by the traditional ozone contact system are normally believed to be low. Oxidation efficiency of NOM by the PHOC (Pressurized High Ozone Contact) method was compared with that by the MOC (Mechanical Ozone Contact, the traditional system) method for the drinking water treatment. Sand filtered water of the drinking water treatment plant was used for experimental samples. Removal rates of UV254 absorbance, KMnO4 consumption and DOC by the MOC system were 18.4%, 2.39%, and 2.72% respectively with 1 mg-O3/L. On the other hand, removal rates of KMnO4 consumption, TOC, DOC, UV254 absorbance and SUVA by the PHOC system were 8–20%, 7.52–34.4%, 6.65–18.2%, 37.4–60.8% and 33.8–60% with 1–3 mg/L of ozone concentrations. Concentration of BDOC after ozone application was 0.003–0.044 mg/L by the MOC method, while 0.084–0.044 mg/L by the PHOC method with 1–3 mg/L of ozone concentrations. Concerning molecular weight distribution, fractions of NOM below 1 kDa were increased by the PHOC method of ozone application. Analysis shows that the reason for overall enhancement of the treatment efficiencies by the PHOC system is because contacting surface area of numerous micro ozone bubbles was increased dramatically in the PHOC system, and oxidation potential was enhanced by increased ozone concentrations in the ozone contact tank. Thus, it is understood that the PHOC method is a more efficient system for ozone application than the traditional MOC system in drinking water treatment process.</jats:p>",

Annual number of owl nests showed a 3 year cyclicity, which as predicted, corresponded to the length of the vole cycle in the region. Mean annual brood size also fluctuated and was positively dependent on the vole supply during the same spring. In this region, there has also been a decline in vole numbers in recent decades, from high-amplitude cycles in the 1970s to subsequent low-amplitude cycles. Correspondingly, and as predicted, mean annual brood size of the owls also declined, although only during the third years of the vole cycle when vole supply in spring and brood size of the owls is at its highest level in high-amplitude cycles. We predict that in the long run the vole decline, associated with increasingly milder winters, and the reduction of the brood size of the owls, especially in years of high owl breeding success, will have serious implications for the population of great grey owls in Scandinavia. </jats:p>",

Our specific interest in DOM in natural waters is several-fold: 1) the photochemical formation of reactive oxygen species, 2) photobleaching of the DOM in coastal oceans, and 3) using chromophoric DOM (CDOM) as a tracer of water masses and in carbon cycling. Our interest in water treatment is that DOM is the major sink of hydroxyl radicals employed in advanced oxidation processes for the destruction of pollutants and thus adversely affects the efficiency of the process. We are using the techniques of radiation chemistry to explore the fundamental free radical and redox chemistry of DOM. We have initiated a study of the free radical reactions of DOM using isolated fractions of Suwannee River fulvic and humic acids and isolates from various anthropogenic sources. We are also investigating the use of model compounds in an attempt to understand the free radical transients formed from DOM either as a result of free radical reactions or photochemical reactions.</jats:p>",

A synthesis of the evidence gathered for the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) shows the connections between women’s wellbeing and water supply, sanitation facilities and hygiene practice. The paper shows that if women’s interests relating to water and sanitation provision are at the centre of planning and implementation of programmes, this has a direct impact on women’s life experience, their potential and opportunities.

EEM and HIX techniques were applied to lacustrine, riverine, and effluent organic matters. EEM spectra suggest that algal activity and the thermocline formation are critical to composition and distribution of DOM in Lake Biwa. Lake Kasumigaura DOM is evenly distributed over the lake. The effects of allochthonous sources are more conclusive for Lake Kasumigaura DOM than for Lake Biwa DOM. Seasonal and vertical variations in HIX were observed in Lake Biwa similar to results by EEM approach. Upstream DOMs were mostly humified fulvic acid originating from forest soil. DOM from a paddy field and municipal wastewater had the lowest HIX value and consisted mainly of less humified, fresh organic materials. Lacustrine and effluent DOMs demonstrated the same extent of humification in watersheds of Lake Biwa and Lake Kasumigaura. Allochthonous sources such as elution from a paddy field and municipal wastewater are more responsible for the composition of Lake Kasumigaura DOM compared to that of Lake Biwa DOM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Few urban water supplies in towns and cities in India and Pakistan approach the goal of continuous supply. Available water quality data suggest that most consumers receive contaminated water. Conditions have worsened over time—the average daily period of water supply in India is now much shorter than in the 1980s. Pressures are often poor, particularly in low-income areas, where residents may resort to ‘pit taps’ to access water. Possible responses to this situation are examined. The standard response of government line agencies, to build new facilities and increase production capacity, is inadequate since the real problems often lie in the management of existing facilities. An attempt to apply a more strategic approach in one medium-sized town in Pakistan is described and assessed. Based on this, the paper argues that improvements in service delivery require basic changes in structures and systems for urban water supply provision. The issue is how to bring about these changes. The fairly radical approach advocated by the World Bank has theoretical and practical limitations. The paper argues that less radical options, rooted in realistic assessment of constraints and opportunities, may offer a more promising way forward. Examples of such options are given. </jats:p>",

The current treatment concept comprises enhanced coagulation followed by sludge blanket clarification, filtration, ozonation and Granular Activated Carbon filtration (GAC). A final disinfection with chlorine is applied. The enhanced coagulation, applied to achieve maximum NOM removal, requires a lot of chemicals and produces a lot of solid waste. In spite of this, the treated water still has a relatively high TOC content, resulting in a limited biostability. This disadvantage incited VMW to investigate an alternative treatment scheme consisting of magnetic ion exchange resin, ultrafiltration, ozonation, GAC filtration and chlorine disinfection. The alternative treatment scheme was operated over a two-year period in a pilot plant with a capacity of 50 m3/h, and its results with respect to water quality, chemical demand and operational costs were compared with those of the full-scale plant. The pilot treatment gives rise to an improved removal of NOM, which can be attributed mainly to the magnetic ion exchange resin process. This was shown to have a beneficial effect on both the biostability of the treated water and on the formation of disinfection by-products. The costs associated with the magnetic ion exchange resin process, which can be attributed mainly to resin loss and regeneration, are counterbalanced by cost savings due to lower chemical demand and solid waste formation.</jats:p>",

Recently, a new method has been developed for the characterization of DOM under ambient conditions, called the Polar Rapid Assessment Method (PRAM). The PRAM allows characterization and temporal and spatial comparisons under environmentally relevant conditions of pH and ionic strength. This study first modifies the PRAM method to 3 probes for high sample throughput by using a subset of the SPE sorbents to interpret DOM polarity by DOC and UV detection. Then the modified PRAM is compared to the XAD resin polarity method and finds a similarity in hydrophobic assessment but different results for the hydrophilic DOM. This study then evaluates the use of PRAM as a tool to evaluate water treatment processes and the character of size fractions of DOM. The PRAM is shown to be a very useful tool to evaluate and thus optimize treatment efficiency and removal of DOM.</jats:p>",

Considerable progress has been made over the past several decades on the development of lower‐cost technologies that are easier for communities in developing countries to maintain and also on improving project design and implementation to enhance sustainability of outcomes. Less attention has been given to the necessary and sufficient supports for water system maintenance in the postconstruction period. This study explores the contribution of various types of postconstruction support (PCS) to the sustainability of rural water supply systems in Bolivia. Using regression and matched pair statistical analyses, the effects of PCS on water system performance and user satisfaction with service are modeled. Communities that received management‐oriented PCS visits from external agencies, and those whose system operators attended training workshops, had better performing systems than communities that received no such support. Engineering‐oriented PCS visits to communities had no measurable impact on system functioning or user satisfaction.</jats:p>",

To mitigate this effect, the authors propose a procedure to calculate the optimal allocation of wind power plants over an extended territory to obtain a low temporal variability without penalizing too much the overall wind energy input into the power system. The procedure has been tested over Corsica (France), the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean Basin. The regional power supply system of Corsica could be sensitive to large fluctuations in power generation like wind power swings caused by the wind intermittency. The proposed methodology is based on the analysis of wind measurements from 10 anemometric stations located along the shoreline of the island, where most of the population resides, in a reasonably even distribution. First the territory of Corsica has been preliminarily subdivided into three anemological regions through a cluster analysis of the wind data, and the optimal spatial distribution of wind power plants among these regions has been calculated. Subsequently, the 10 areas around each station have been considered independent anemological regions, and the procedure to calculate the optimal distribution of wind power plants has been further refined to evaluate the improvements related to this more resolved spatial scale of analysis.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a description of NOM in surface and drinking water, in groundwater and in seawater is presented. Water samples representing these environments were collected and characterized using multiple NOM characterization techniques, including fluorescence excitation emission matrices (F-EEM) and size exclusion liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). The results show that the raw surface water as well as the treated water comprises mainly (&amp;gt;70%) of humic substances. The biopolymers, which are more readily biodegradable, contribute up to 2% of the NOM in the raw water but this is completely removed after treatment. For sea water samples, humic substances represent about 50% of the dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), while the fraction with size bigger than 20 kDa (biopolymers) represents about 7%. During soil passage, there was preferential removal of non-humic substances (i.e., biopolymers) from wastewater effluent-impacted surface water while the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), which reflects the aromatic characteristics of organics in a sample, showed an increasing trend along the depth of the soil column. This is a consequence of the removal of non-humic substances (biopolymers) which results in an increase in aromaticity.</jats:p>",

Precipitation estimates were taken from the Parameter‐Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). Evapotranspiration was estimated using two models, the Advection‐Aridity model and the Zhang model. The evapotranspiration models were calibrated using precipitation and runoff data for 655 hydrologically undisturbed basins, and then tested using estimates of natural runoff for the 18 water resource regions (WRR) of the 48 contiguous states. The final water supply coverage reflects a mixture of outputs from the two evapotranspiration models. Political, administrative, and land cover boundaries were mapped over the coverage of mean annual water supply. Across the entire study area, we find that 53% of the water supply originates on forested land, which covers only 29% of the surface area, and that 24% originates on federal lands, including 18% on national forests and grasslands alone. Forests and federal lands are even more important in the West (the 11 western contiguous states), where 65% of the water supply originates on forested land and 66% on federal lands, with national forests and grasslands contributing 51%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper introduces a feature-extraction method to characterize gas turbine engine dynamics. The extracted features are used to develop a fault diagnosis and prognosis method for the fuel supply system in gas turbine engines. The engine start-up profiles of the core speed (N2) and the exhaust gas temperature collected with high-speed sampling rate are obtained and processed into a more compact data set by identifying critical-to-characterization instances. The fuzzy-clustering method is applied to the smaller number of parameters, and the fault is detected by differentiating the clusters matching the failures. In this work, the actual flight data collected in the field was used to develop and validate the system, and the results are shown for the test on nine engines that experienced fuel supply system failure. The developed fault diagnosis system detected the failure successfully in all nine cases. For the earliest detection cases, the alarms start to trigger 26 days before the system completely fails and 7 days in advance for the last detection. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contingency logistic supply chain design and performance are very important for rare events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other emergency conditions. Although there is ample work on the evaluation of supply chain systems in terms of their profitability and efficiency, there is little work on the effectiveness of the response time of the supply chain, as well as quantitative measures for the robustness of the design and the reliability of the supply chain. Depending on the contingency, the perceived risk may be different for different situations. The level of risk aversion is dependent on the decision maker and the uncertainties associated with the supply and demand for the contingency. In this study the risk associated with shortages due to the uncertainties in supply and demand in the supply chain are modelled using distortion. In addition, a numerical analysis is performed and the sensitivity of the parameters in a contingency logistic supply chain is analysed. Methods to improve the effectiveness of the contingency operation are examined by efficiently allocating available resources, supplies, and time, as well as modelling the decision maker's perception associated with the failure of a particular node. An array of optimization models are formulated and discussed. Each of these models enables a decision maker to examine a variety of trade-offs in a contingency logistics supply chain. For example, one model examines the acquisition of mitigation strategies and the reallocation of resources while taking into consideration the decision maker's risk aversion. The main contribution of this paper is the establishment of an analysis framework for modelling and analysing the risk and reliability of contingency logistic supply chains. </jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to fully budget annual water availability for water supply (precipitation − evapotranspiration + groundwater supply + return flow) and demand from commercial, domestic, industrial, irrigation, livestock, mining, and thermoelectric uses. The Water Supply Stress Index and Water Supply Stress Index Ratio were developed to evaluate water stress conditions over time and across the 666 eight‐digit Hydrologic Unit Code basins in the 13 southeastern states. Predictions from two Global Circulation Models (CGC1 and HadCM2Sul), one land use change model, and one human population model, were integrated to project future water supply stress in 2020. We found that population increase greatly stressed water supply in metropolitan areas located in the Piedmont region and Florida. Predicted land use and land cover changes will have little effect on water quantity and water supply‐water demand relationship. In contrast, climate changes had the most pronounced effects on regional water supply and demand, especially in western Texas where water stress was historically highest in the study region. The simulation system developed by this study is useful for water resource planners to address water shortage problems such as those experienced during 2007 in the study region. Future studies should focus on refining the water supply term to include flow exchanges between watersheds and constraints of water quality and environmental flows to water availability for human use.</jats:p>",

This work studies the effect of foliar urea sprays (15 g L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) at different frequencies on the antioxidant metabolism and fruit quality of sweet pepper fruits under N‐limited nutrient solution (3.5 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) and fully N‐supplied (12.5 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) plants.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold>Foliar applications of urea in root N‐limited plants increased the total N concentration in the fruits and no significant differences were found with respect to control fruits (plants fully supplied with N by the roots). Fruit color was significantly affected by the urea sprays, and at the highest frequency (twice a week) the largest overall color difference (Δ<jats:italic>E</jats:italic>) with respect the non‐sprayed fruits was obtained. Foliar urea increased anthocyanin concentration to control values but flavonoids were only affected at the highest application frequency. N deficiency induced oxidative stress but foliar application of urea altered this response, significantly diminishing catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold>Sweet pepper fruits showed a significant and positive response to foliar fertilization on the studied parameters, compensating to a major extent the reduction of N by the roots. In addition to the environmental issues in reducing N contamination, fully monitored automatically sprayed foliar fertilizer could utilize N more efficiently and at lower cost than applying the full recommended rate of other N fertilizers to the nutrient solution, providing flexibility in correcting N nutrition in the plant, and especially the control of nutrient supply independent of the water supply.

The detailed model evaluates emergency restoration period of water supply pipeline network using the actual network data and the several restoration strategies that was provided from the experiences of past earthquakes. The simplified model also evaluates restoration period by strategy restoring from the side of distribution reservoir using the 1 km grid data of pipeline length of pipe type and diameter estimated from population data of reference area and water-supply pipeline expansion data. Using actual data of water supply pipeline network of three waterworks bureaus in Japan, we studies the accuracy of grid data of the proposed pipeline length modeling of the simplified model. Finally the efficiency and accuracy of approximate restoration period using the simplified model are confirmed by comparing with the results of two models about damage estimates and restoration periods.</jats:p>",
