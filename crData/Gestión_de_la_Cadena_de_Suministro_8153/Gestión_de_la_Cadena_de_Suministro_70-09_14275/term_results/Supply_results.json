The tissues were fixed in 2% osmic acid solution, embedded in Epon and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions.</jats:p><jats:p>It was found that the endothelial basement membrane of the arterial segment of the anastomosis was discontinuous. The anastomosing artery possessed subendothelial cushions of longitudinal smooth musculature which expanded into a thick uniform layer before the artery joined the vein. The fine morphology of these muscle cells did not show epitheloid modification. An elastic membrane of a peculiar structure separated the subendothelial musculature from that of the tunica media. The membrane was continuous with the internal elastic membrane of the proximal artery and with the adventitial elastic mesh of the vein. The anastomosis was supplied by a non‐myelinated periarterial nerve plexus which contained cholinergic and adrenergic axons characterized by agranular and fine granular vesicles respectively. The wall of the vein was devoid of musculature and nerves. It mainly consisted of elastic meshes interspersed with bundles of collagen fibers and occasional fibrocytes.</jats:p><jats:p>It was suggested that the musculature of the tunica media of the artery was controlled by the cholinergic and adrenergic nerves of the autonomic system, and by the sensory nerves in the form of axons reflexes. The subendothelial musculature was controlled by agents carried in blood and was not influenced by the adventitial nerves.</jats:p>",

A section of The Act requires persons taking more than 10,000 imperial gallons per day of water for purposes other than domestic, stock or fire‐fighting to have a permit and to take the water in accordance with specified terms and conditions. Construction of some new wells, sewers, and roads to meet the needs of urban development has caused interference with both ground‐ and surface‐water supplies. In cases of serious interference, the Commission has required that steps be taken to restore water supplies or prevent continued interference. Two cases are described where municipalities in the Toronto area restored supplies to overcome serious interference with several private wells and streamflow during testing and operation of a 500‐imperial gpm municipal well adjacent to a normally effluent stream, and varying degrees of interference with private wells caused by dewatering at rates up to 2000‐imperial gpm for the installation of a trunk sewer.</jats:p>",
