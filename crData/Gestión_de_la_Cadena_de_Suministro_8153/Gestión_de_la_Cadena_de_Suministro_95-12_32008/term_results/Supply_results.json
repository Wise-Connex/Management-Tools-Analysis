I also explained that the permanent deceleration in economic growth in the early 1970s was caused by changes in the internal structure of the Japanese economy, rather than by the oil embargo of 1973. It would be unreasonable to suppose, however, that a sharp increase in the real price of inputs would have no impact on the macro economy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inflation is a burning issue in Pakistan. It is generally felt\n      that for several years Pakistan has had a double-digit inflation. The\n      public sector has used a mix of policies to control inflation, and it is\n      also held responsible for its creation. The consumer price index (CPI)\n      increased over 11 percent in 1981-82, and over 12 percent in 1990-91.\n      Similarly, sensitive price index (SPI) increased over 15 percent in\n      1981-82, and over 12 percent in 1990-91. The GDP deflator was also\n      double-digit for several years. Inflation not only affects sectoral\n      allocation and distribution of income but also generates poverty. A\n      prescription might not be appropriate until the roots of the disease are\n      carefully investigated, which is the very reason for carrying out this\n      study. Studies by Hossain (1990) several others concluded that inflation\n      is a monetary phenomenon in Pakistan, while Bilquees (1988) showed that\n      structural factors explained the inflationary process in Pakistan. It is\n      widely disagreed whether money supply is exogenous or endogenous. Vogel\n      (1974), criticising the monetarist approach, argued that further\n      research is needed on the determination of money supply. Given this\n      background, this study is intended to identify the variables leading to\n      inflation; the nature of money supply, endogenous or exogenous, is also\n      analysed. Section 2 of the study provides a brief review of the\n      literature. A model is developed to study the relationship among fiscal\n      deficit, money supply, and inflation. Section 3 contains a description\n      of the empirical results. Section 4 provides the conclusion and policy\n      implications.</jats:p>"

Despite the potential ameliorative effect of wages in addressing economic need, few studies have investigated the work behavior, retirement, and retirement income of unmarried older women. Using a nationally representative sample from the March 1989 Current Population Survey, this study addressed two research questions: What factors significantly affect divorcées', aged 55 and older, labor supply? Are these effects different for divorced as compared to other unmarried women? A sample selection model of labor supply indicated that wages, education, pension wealth, and asset wealth are significant predictors of labor supply for both the divorced and the other unmarried women, although the strength of these effects differed. Medicaid coverage had a significant effect for the divorced women only. The results suggest that wages are a limited, yet important, resource for unmarried older women, especially for older divorcées. </jats:p>",

Textural, geochemical and mineralogical analyses show that the dune sands were mainly derived from Colorado River sands during episodes when the Colorado River drained west to the Salton Basin instead of south to the Gulf of California. A model is presented which relates episodic aeolian deposition in the Algodones dunefield to the growth of the resulting lake under a persistent, intense north‐westerly wind regime and to subsequent desiccation of the lake following diversion of the Colorado River to the Gulf of California. Late Holocene radiocarbon ages for relict lake shoreline deposits correlate with documented episodes of extreme flooding and increased winter storminess across the south‐western United States. These conditions are likely to have been the cause of intensified north‐westerly winds which coincided with high stands of Lake Cahuilla. Although diversion of the Colorado River to the Salton Basin occurred at least three times during the late Holocene, it is evident that the river did not change its course in response to the majority of the floods. It appears that the critical control on diversion of the river was the difference in gradient between courses leading to the Salton Basin and Gulf of California, which in turn was influenced by fluvial deposition and tectonic activity. Flooding was able to cause diversion of the Colorado River to the Salton Basin only when the difference in gradient between the two courses was relatively small.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines an optimization approach to identifying short‐run timber supply function coefficients when the form of the supply function is known. By definition, a short‐run timber supply function is a functional relationship between the optimal harvest level in each period (e.g., each year) and the actual forest‐market state in the same period. The short‐run timber supply function represents the optimal harvest decision policy, and therefore, the problem of optimal harvesting can be formulated as a problem of determining this function. When the form of the supply function is known, the problem becomes one of identifying the coefficients of the supply function. If the management objective is to maximize the expected present value of net revenues from timber harvesting over an infinite time horizon, and the timber price process is, in a sense, stationary, the supply function coefficients correspond to the optimal solution to an anticipative optimization problem. In this case, the supply function coefficients can be determined by maximizing the expected present value of the net revenues from timber harvesting, where periodic harvest levels are determined using the supply function. Numerical results show that the short‐run supply functions determined using this approach gives good approximations of the true supply function.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because fungal cell walls are shaped during construction, factors that regulate wall biogenesis must play a decisive role in morphogenesis. By delivering ingredients for wall formation in vesicles, fungi have a de facto mechanism to mold their own shape. The gradients in wall formation required for cell morphogenesis ensue from the pattern of vesicle discharge. A vesicle-based, mathematical model of fungal morphogenesis revealed that a relatively simple process could establish these gradients. The model and its underlying hyphoid equation assumes that wall-building vesicles emanate from a vesicle supply center (VSC). The VSC serves as an organizing center from which vesicles would move radially to the cell surface in all directions at random. VSC displacement is then an immediate cause of morphogenesis: a sustained linear displacement of the VSC would generate a polarized pattern of exocytosis required to make a hypha. The model predicts that the Spitzenkörper functions as a VSC. We have tested this prediction by analyzing instances where dislocations in Spitzenkörper position result in hyphal deformations. When the VSC was programmed to duplicate the movements of the Spitzenkörper before, during, and after a deformation, the resulting shapes mimicked closely the observed deformations. These correlations support the contention that the position and movement of the VSC determines the morphology of the fungal cell wall. The computer model has been refined to incorporate transverse random oscillations of the VSC to simulate more realistically the meandering shape of fungal hyphae. The model predicts that hyphal ring formation results from a sustained directional bias to the transverse oscillations of the Spitzenkörper. Key words: hyphal morphogenesis, Spitzenkörper, vesicle supply center, mathematical model, hyphoid equation, hyphal curvature.</jats:p>",

The tourist movements cause a significant consumption of various products and services which is predominantly realised through the hotel - catering activities and commerce, and it is particularly caused by the agro-industrial system.

Thanks to the multitude of its economic and non-economic functions, tourism influences directly and indirectly many factors of the agro-industrial system and commerce. It is certain that one of the elementary factors of tourism is the market of agricultural food and other products. Therefore tourism should be understood as a market category that is especially stimulated for the expressed orientation under the considerably more favourable conditions than the regular export. In order that the interests of all participants, who in the reproduction chain from the supply for the tourist market, could be realised, a co-ordinated harmony of activities is necessary, and particularly of the hotel and catering business, agro-industrial system and commerce. Those activities should be based upon the business concept of marketing which brings the tourist consumer and his/her needs, wants, habits and preferences in focus.

This paper examines the disincentive to supply labor which arises from housing market disequilibrium. The disequilibrium is measured by four variables. One is a measure of density, while the others are based upon the number of persons in official housing queues. Each of the variables is negative and significant in the two‐stage least squares estimates of labor supply. Estimates disaggregated by skill‐class are also presented. Housing market disequilibrium has the greatest impact on the labor supply of the least skilled.</jats:p>",

Plants were grown in nutrient solution plus mixed sulphate salts with low or high calcium supply and in nutrient solution alone (control), using a hydroponic system in a growth chamber. Salt stress had greater deleterious effects on growth, morphology, and anatomy of 'Harrington' than wild barley. Additional Ca supply markedly improved these parameters in 'Harrington' but not in wild barley, suggesting a greater responsiveness to Ca in the cultivated species. The wild barley population had greater leaf and tiller numbers per plant but smaller leaf area and dry mass than 'Harrington' in control solution. After 20 days of salt treatment, 'Harrington' showed a greater reduction in tiller and leaf number, shoot height and root length, and tissue dry mass than wild barley. Calcium-deficiency symptoms were found in 'Harrington' leaves in the low Ca salt treatment but not in wild barley. On the other hand, shoot height and dry mass growth were significantly increased in 'Harrington' by high Ca salt treatment, suggesting that 'Harrington' was more responsive to supplemental Ca than wild barley.

There was a strong statistical association between cases and residence in an area supplied from two groundwater sources. In a case-control study, a strong association between having drunk unboiled tap water from these sources, and a dose-response relationship were found. Oocysts were not detected in the water supply. During very heavy rainfall one source of water was found to drain surface water directly from a field containing livestock faeces, thereby bypassing natural sandstone filtration. Exceptionally heavy rainfall occurred at the probable time of infection. After withdrawal of the original water supply, the outbreak rapidly subsided. It was concluded that there was very strong evidence that this outbreak was waterborne. This, the second documented outbreak of cryptosporidiosis attributable to a groundwater supply, demonstrates that infection can be transmitted from a disinfected groundwater source despite apparently satisfactory treated water quality. We recommend that guidelines for protection of groundwater are implemented, raw groundwater should be routinely monitored for microbiological contamination, and the structure of all sources and waterworks should be assessed in risk surveys of water catchment areas.</jats:p>",

In experiment 1, the food allowance was given in one, two or three meals per day. In experiment 2, the food allowance was given in two meals per day and comprised ingredients which supplied glucose at different rates (starch, glucose/starch, starch/guar gum). The pigs' posture and behaviour were recorded in three 1-h periods during the day on 2 days consecutively during the <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic> feeding period (time period 1) and on pairs of days on three (periods 2, 3 and 4: experiment 1) or two (periods 2 and 3: experiment 2) subsequent occasions during food restriction. The meal frequency or estimated rate of glucose supply had no significant effects on posture or behaviour. In both experiments activity increased with the duration of food restriction. In periods 1, 2, 3 and 4 of experiment 1 the proportions of observations spent were: standing 0·244, 0·260, 0·706 and 0·728 (s.e.d. 0·0346); nosing 0·073, 0·094, 0·229 and 0·253 (s.e.d. 0·0169); rooting 0·032, 0·037, 0·108 and 0·133 (s.e.d. 0·0133).

In experiment 1 feeding rate increased with duration of restriction (P &lt; 0·001), but was unaffected by treatment.

The second section of the paper searches in the literature a basis for the 300% level and provides a criticism of the method proposed at GATT to compute tariff equivalents. Based on some earlier work, an alternative estimate of the tariff equivalent of cheese import quotas is presented in the third section of the paper.

Golf) was grown at different nitrate supply rates, controlled by using the relative addition rate technique, in order to elucidate the relationship between nitrate‐N supply and root and shoot levels of abscisic acid (ABA). The plants were maintained as (1) standard cultures where nitrate was supplied at relative addition rates (RAs) of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.18 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and (2) split‐root cultures at RA 0.09 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> but with the nitrate distributed between the two root parts in ratios of 100:0, 80:20 and 60:40. Time‐dependent changes in root and shoot concentrations of ABA (determined by radioimmunoassay using a monoclonal antibody) were observed in both standard and split‐root cultures during 12 days of acclimation to the different nitrate regimes. However, the ABA responses were similar at all nitrate supply rates. Further experiments were performed with split‐root cultures where the distribution of nitrate between the two root parts was reversed from 80:20 to 20:80 so that short‐term effects to local perturbations of nitrate supply could be studied without altering whole‐plant N absorption. Transient increases in ABA concentrations (maximum of 25 to 40% after 3 to 4 h) were observed in both subroot parts, as well as in xylem sap and shoot tissue. By pruning the root system it was demonstrated that the change in ABA had its origin in the subroot part receiving the increased nitrate supply (i.e. switched from 20 to 80% of the total nitrate supply). The data indicate that ABA responses are easily transmitted between different organs, including transmission from one set of seminal roots to another via the shoot. The data do not provide any indication that long‐term nitrate supplies or general nitrogen status of barley plants affect, or are otherwise related to, the average tissue ABA concentrations of roots and shoots.</jats:p>",

Two distinct root precipitates were observed (see ‘Appendix’ for a tabulated summary of symptoms). Energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that an ochreous precipitate was probably a hydrated ferric oxide whilst a pale yellow or yellow‐grey one was an Fe‐P solid, possibly a ferric phosphate. Ochre precipitates were found almost exclusively cm the roots of Fe‐tolerant species and were particularly intense on the most tolerant ones, Monocotyledonous species (generally more Fe‐tolerant than dicotyledonous species and with higher root porosities), tended to produce ochre most freely. The Fe‐P precipitate was frequently found on roots of the less tolerant species and was particularly abundant on the most sensitive ones. Blackening of roots (with flaccidity I, another common response of roots of Fe‐sensitive plants exposed to large Fe concentrations, was not a result of any obvious external precipitate. There was no evidence that differential pH changes induced by roots helped to determine either Fe tolerance or the nature of the root precipitate observed. Roots of all species tested caused the pH of an agar medium to rise. Elevated Ft‐ supply resulted in greater external acid phosphatase activity in roots of two test species. The increase corresponded with the species' mean relative growth rate (RGR) (and presumed P requirement), and with me fertility of sites in which it grows. Chemical analyses of shoots and roots of four species of differing Fe tolerance showed that, with increasing Fe supply, mean shoot Fe concentrations increased significantly whereas for most other elements (except Na and Zn) a significant reduction in concentrations in the shoot was observed. Mean root concentrations of most elements also fell significantly with increasing Fe supply, though for three of the four test species there was a significant increase in root P concentrations. It is clear that only some wetland plant species form ochreous root precipitates when grown in Fe‐rich conditions, and have an effective Fe‐exclusion mechanism. Growth of those species that lack this capacity is affected adversely by high Fe concentrations. This might be owing both to direct effects of Fe uptake and to indirect effects, particularly of Fe upon P metabolism. No evidence was found to suggest chat the Fe‐tolerant species examined could accommodate higher tissue Fe concentrations than the Fe‐sensitive species.</jats:p>",

First, what degree of explicitness will the courts require and, secondly, does this ‘clarity’ rule apply where the contracting party is only liable in negligence? As regards the former, there is probably no need to specifically mention fault or negligence, but equally general words, such as those used in White v John Warwick, will not be sufficient. A common drafting ploy is to use some expression such as ‘all loss however arising’ or ‘all damage or injury howsoever caused’. As regards the latter, it was originally thought that a clause in general terms necessarily did cover negligence since there was nothing else for it to attach to. In Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Co Ltd, the plaintiff left 10 large Irish linen handkerchiefs with the defendants to be cleaned. The defendants lost the handkerchiefs. The plaintiff claimed the cost of replacing the handkerchiefs. In their defence the laundry pleaded a clause in the agreement that ‘the maximum amount for lost or damaged articles is 20 times the charge made for laundering’ (an amount less that half the plaintiff’s claim). The Court of Appeal allowed the defence and overruled the decision at first instance in favour of the plaintiff: Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Co Ltd [1945] KB 189, CA, p 192"

The s 11(1) test differs from the reasonableness of reliance test adopted by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (to which this part of the 1977 Act otherwise bears a reasonably close resemblance) and has generated a fair amount of controversy. Interestingly, the 1977 Act here adopts the proposal of the Scottish Law Commission Report (1975, para 177), the English Commission having proposed a continuation of the existing reliance test (para 183). The English Law Commission felt that judicial discretion, to take account of all circumstances, pre and post-contract, should not be curtailed. The Scottish Commission reasoned that a reliance test might undermine the planning of relationships and the allocation of risk(s), normally associated with commercial contracts. Whatever else, it seems entirely clear that (unless some form of severance is possible) a clause which, as drafted, is unreasonably wide (on a ‘reasonable’ construction!) will not be saved merely because it operates fairly in the particular circumstances. This is a clear encouragement for careful and conservative contract planning and drafting.
