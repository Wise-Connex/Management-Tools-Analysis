      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seedlings of tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatica L.) and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich.) were cultured in saturated—aerated, saturated, and unsaturated soil. Experiments were designed to (1) measure and evaluate the relative reaction of tupelo and cypress to various soil—moisture conditions (2) determine the effects of aeration and water availability on plant moisture stress and growth; and (3) compare effects of two forms of nitrogen fertilizer (urea and nitrate) on growth. On the basis of height and dry weight, both tupelo and cypress grew best in saturated—aerated soil. Growth was better in saturated soil than in unsaturated soil, but only when water in the unsaturated soil decreased substantially below field capacity before rewatering. Plant moisture stress was determined by a pressure—bomb technique. For tupelo, average daily maximum tensions were 7.2 and 7.0 atm (atm = 1.013 bar) with saturated and unsaturated soil, respectively; for cypress, comparative tensions were 10.9 and 8. 5 atm. When soil moisture decreased from field capacity to the wilting point, the daily maximum tension in plants increased from 7.0 to 12.8 and from 8.5 to 17.6 atm in tupelo and cypress, respectively. Growth of plants was related to the cumulative effect of their internal moisture stress. When tupelo plants were subjected to 595 atm—days (daily maximum tension X number of days with that tension), height growth was 37% and dry weight 40% less than plants subjected to 490 atm—days. Fertilization with urea produced more growth than fertilization with nitrate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of three Fe levels (0.1, 0.5, 2.5 ppm) and four Mn levels (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0 ppm) in all combinations in nutrient solutions were studied in the greenhouse with barley plants. At the anthesis stage, the dry matter yield increased with increasing Fe supply when the Mn level was below optimum (0.005 ppm) or approximately optimum (0.05 ppm). At maturity, the yields of kernels and straw increased with increasing Fe supply regardless of the Mn level. Mn deficiency symptoms were evident at the lowest Mn level and were not influenced by the Fe supply. Dry matter yields at the two highest Mn levels were lower than those at the 0.05-ppm Mn level at both the anthesis and mature stages. Mn toxicity symptoms were evident only at the highest Mn level. The critical Mn concentration in the four uppermost leaf blades associated with reduced dry matter yield was approximately 15 ppm regardless of the Fe supply. The critical Mn concentration in leaves plus stem was slightly lower than that for leaf blades only. Similar results were obtained with two barley cultivars. It was concluded that increasing the Fe supply does not reduce Mn availability or concentration in barley plants when the Mn supply ranges from below to approximately optimum but may do so when the Mn supply is above optimum. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Healthy living conditions require pure and adequate supplies of air and water, the satisfactory and hygienic disposal of solid liquid and gaseous wastes, and the control of all forms of pollution. Public Health Engineering, or Environmental Health Engineering as it is sometimes called, comprises the construction and operation of the works needed to maintain such conditions. Whether we be dealing with the supply of water, the disposal of garbage, or the suppression of noise or smoke, a combination of internal and external works is almost invariably needed to obtain the required results, and I think this paper will be found to be very largely complementary to the other papers heard today. The principal public health engineering services inside buildings include water storage and distribution systems, sanitary installations, space-heating systems, air-conditioning installations, and refuse-collection systems. The major external works include schemes for the abstraction, treatment and distribution of water, for foul and storm drainage, for the disposal of sewage and trade effluents, and for the conveyance and disposal of refuse.</jats:p>",
