Nasal mucosa was found to receive collateral flow from contralateral terminal internal maxillary artery (about 5 to 10% of normal flow) and branches of subclavian arteries (about 36% of normal flow). 4. Nasal mucosa was found to have two venous systems: the low‐flow (12 +/‐ 1.0 ml min‐1; both sides) and low‐pressure (7 +/‐ 0.6 mmHg) sphenopalatine veins draining the posterior nasal cavity and the high‐flow (30 +/‐ 1.4 ml min‐1; both sides) and high‐pressure (17 +/‐ 1.0 mmHg) dorsal nasal veins draining the anterior nasal cavity. 5.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When systemic delivery of O2 [QO2 = cardiac output X arterial O2 content (CaO2)] is reduced, the systemic O2 extraction ratio [(CaO2-concentration of O2 in venous blood/CaO2] increases until a critical limit is reached below which O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by delivery. Many patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome exhibit supply dependence of VO2 even at high levels of QO2, which suggests that a peripheral O2 extraction defect may be present. Since many of these patients also suffer from serious bacterial infection, we tested the hypothesis that bacteremia might produce a similar defect in the ability of tissues to maintain VO2 independent of QO2, as QO2 reduced. The critical O2 delivery (QO2crit) and critical extraction ratio (ERcrit) were compared in a control group of dogs and a group receiving a continuous infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 x 10(7) organisms/min). Dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated with room air. Systemic QO2 was reduced in stages by hemorrhage as hematocrit was maintained. At each stage, systemic VO2 and QO2 were measured, and the critical point was determined from a plot of VO2 vs. QO2. The mean QO2crit and ERcrit of the bacteremic group (11.4 +/- 2.2 ml.min-1.kg-1 and 0.51 +/- 0.09) were significantly different from control (7.4 +/- 1.2 and 0.71 +/- 0.10) (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that bacterial infection can reduce the ability of peripheral tissues to extract O2 from a limited supply, causing VO2 to become limited by O2 delivery at a stage when a smaller fraction of the delivered O2 has been extracted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",

However, 93% of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N was transported to the shoot as nitrate and only 6% in amino compounds, indicating the more direct routing of newly absorbed nitrogen to the shoot via the former. Leaf NRA was seven‐fold greater than that of the root, confirming the shoot as the major site of nitrogen assimilation in plants fed only nitrate. In ammonium‐only fed plants, 84% of xylem N was found in organic form (66%<jats:sup>16</jats:sup>N), the remainder translocating as ammonium, identifying the root as the major site of ammonium N assimilation. In ammonium + nitrate fed plants, 64% of xylem N was present as organic N (55%<jats:sup>16</jats:sup>N), 34% as nitrate (43 %<jats:sup>16</jats:sup>N), indicating shared N assimilation between shoot and root, with root assimilation predominating. In plants receiving nitrate, glutamine was the major N compound translocated, in plants receiving only ammonium, asparagine predominated. GS activity was approximately the same in root and shoot and showed no response to N source.</jats:p><jats:p>The significance of these results is discussed with respect to the reported increased productivity of maize fed a mixed nitrate‐ammonium N source.</jats:p>",
