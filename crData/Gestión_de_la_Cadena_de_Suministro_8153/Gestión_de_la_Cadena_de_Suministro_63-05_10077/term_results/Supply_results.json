Although many of the arguments presented are at variance with the present practice governing the use of existing water supplies and the development of new supplies, they indicate that certain “reforms” now in process (for example, changes taking place in water law) and supposedly directed to an improvement in the decision‐making practice, will actually make things worse. In other words, this study indicates that a major change, rather than merely a marginal modification, in the trend of current practice and thought on water supply problems is in order.</jats:p>",

The variations of the anatomy of the anterior-inferior cerebellar artery in cats and humans are discussed. A perfusion method utilizing radioopaque material in cats is described and may eventually be utilized in the study of the dynamic circulation of the cochlea. This arterial supply should be well-understood before significant neurophysiologic recordings are reported in this laboratory animal.</jats:p>",
