      "abstract": "<jats:p>With close to 22 percent of aggregate industry sales tied up in inventories in the entire supply chain network, what is it that ails Indian industry? Is it the way Indian supply chains are configured – their orientation to processes to streamline business activities; their fusion of information technology to speed up business transactions; their approach to supply chain strategy to improve bottom line results – that has restricted them from achieving global standards? The article, based on a recently concluded nationwide study titled “Supply chain management practices in Indian Industry: 2000”, throws up glaring facts about the current architecture of supply chains in India. The article concludes that though some Indian organizations are moving fast towards improving supply chain efficiencies, most of them are still far from realising its effect on business performance.</jats:p>",

The challenge of achieving these objectives is complicated because they are inextricably related and often conflicting. Moreover, when all the factors that can disrupt the supply chain are considered-weather, maintenance, equipment failures, tidal and darkness restrictions, seasonal demand patterns, marketing scenarios and more-it becomes almost impossible to assimilate the overall system. By using simulation modeling to analyze these factors holistically, managers can maximize LNG supply chain efficiency and improve profitability.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Using discrete event simulation software to model the complexities of manufacturing systems has provided world-class companies with the ability to more precisely envision the benefits and consequences of change prior to implementing decisions. Visual interactive simulation modeling has been used since the early 1980s to quantify the true performance of a facility, enabling alternative proposals to be evaluated to ascertain their true worth. This has enabled, and continues to enable, decision-makers to identify and address unforeseen issues and exploit commercial opportunities. In a marketplace driven by increasing competitive pressures with the ongoing need to reduce capital and operational costs, the ability to \"run the plant before it is built\" through simulation modeling ensures that the world's leading manufacturers \"get it right first time.\" There are many case studies that evidence how millions of dollars have been saved through the realization of the following benefits:</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Fully Validated Capital Proposals</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>- the ability to quantifythe business benefit that will be achieved through the purchase and commissioning of new equipment to either increase efficiency or increase capacity.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Capital Avoidance</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>- the ability to determine that the resultant performance of a proposed investment will not deliver the benefits that were envisioned. This may apply to all of the equipment in the proposal or a subsection of the equipment. In the latter case, this may be due to over-engineering or the provision of excessive redundant capacity.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Cost Reduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>- the ability to understand how operational expenditure can be reduced by modifying current practices and operating policies. This typically involves saving labor and material costs through greater agility. Similarly improved performance can reduce or eliminate contractual penalties and leverage reward when such schemes are in place.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Improved Asset Utilization</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>- the ability to identify how existing assets can be used in a more efficient way by changing operating practices. This has led to increased capacity and reduced unit costs.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Until quite recently, simulation modeling was seen as a practice better suited to manufacturers. However, advances in simulation technology that have improved run speed, ease of use, flexibility and the ability to reflect systems where interdependency between interacting aspects coexists in conjunction with complex constraints, has enabled a wider variety of industries to take advantage of this innovative approach to add value through their supply chains. This paper examines how the world's leading gas companies are now harnessing the power of simulation modeling to improve the quality of their decision making, and consequently realize benefits running into hundreds of millions of dollars.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

During Snow’s lifetime few in London were so fortunate. Many continued to haul water from a neighborhood pump, and those who had water piped to their residence frequently received it, albeit with intermittent flow, in cisterns or butts in a courtyard rather than inside. Nevertheless, a water supply directly to one’s house was a much desired commodity in London, and private companies had competed for the opportunity to provide it since the previous century. In 1817, however, this open market was replaced by a regional patchwork of monopolies within which a single company laid pipes. When water rates under this cartel system rose considerably, limited competition was reintroduced in the mid-1830s. In north London the Hampstead and New River water companies were permitted to lay pipes in the same streets and solicit customers. In south London the Lambeth and Kent water companies were given similar access to neighborhoods previously reserved for the South London Water Works. Elsewhere, the monopoly system remained in force.</jats:p>",

Therefore, continuously tracking performance of suppliers and an appropriate selection mechanism is one of the crucial activities in supply chain management. This paper presents an intelligent generic supplier management tool (GSMT) using the case‐based reasoning (CBR) technique for outsourcing to suppliers and automating the decision making process when selecting them. The development of GSMT and how the CBR technique is applied is then given, followed by an application of GSMT in Honeywell Consumer Products (Hong Kong) Limited.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents issues critical to the development and successful implementation of computer simulation models for ship component manufacturing within a naval shipyard environment. More specifically, it addresses the need for a supply chain approach to developing simulation models for use as a management tool. The problem domain is the naval shipbuilding industry, which is different from industries associated with traditional manufacturing. Due to the tremendous number of components associated with naval warship construction and the extreme length of the build cycle, managing such an enterprise presents a formidable challenge. As Northrop Grumman Newport News strives to be a lean enterprise, managers will need new tools to address the lean initiatives of the many shops and construction areas within their domain. In this paper, it is suggested that the application of computer simulation using a component supply chain approach could provide management with a powerful tool to improve efficiency. A three-phased approach for the development of an enterprise supply chain model is presented. In the first phase, individual simulation models are developed for manufacturing and material support functions. The second phase addresses the linking of the models into small model networks. In the third phase, additional models are developed and more sophisticated networking strategies are utilized.</jats:p>",

Since comparative costs and market shares are distorted by subsidies, especially for agricultural products, traditional approaches show inconsistent results. Discusses competitiveness in a dynamic way, based on comparative capacity of agribusiness chain co‐ordination. In order to study the competitive structure of the meat system in Brazil, this study followed the methodology adopted by Farina and Zylbersztajn, applied to different food systems. The traditional studies are based on methodologies that do not make clear the specific aspects of coordination as a source of competitive advantages. Aims at reinforcing the relation between coordination and competitiveness. The main conclusion is the need to create coordination devices to attend the demands in terms of quality, traceability, standardization and certification which are key elements to building dynamic capabilities to the insertion of the region on the global beef market.</jats:p>",

The reliance on subcontractors has put much stress on the main contractor‐subcontractor relationship. As main contractors have realised that the greatest potential for cost savings lies with the subcontractors, the prevalence of unfair practices has increased. This paper describes a procurement approach, utilising limited competition, developed by a major UK main contractor in order to improve its relationships with subcontractors. The approach developed was based on research which identified: what the main contractor’s professional employees want from subcontractors; what subcontractors want from main contractors; and a study to compare the main contractor’s performance with that of its competitors. It was concluded that this approach offers a number of benefits for the client, the main contractor, partnering subcontractors and professional consultants, such as, lower costs, improved team approach and less confrontation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Besides its effect on potato yield, water also has a significant impact on yield quality. Excess water (too much precipitation, over-irrigation) and the lack of water (lack of precipitation or irrigation) both trigger stress in the plant and can significantly worsen the quality of the yield (seed potato) and deteriorate the health of the plant and the seed potato. Excess precipitaton or irrigation water leaches nitrate-nitrogen under the rhizosphere, consequently, the amount of available nitrogen decreases leading to the deficiency of N in potato. If water cover (the maximally saturated state of soil) exceeds 8-12 hours, it can cause root destruction (because of the lack of oxygen), which leads to the wilting and later to the death of the plant. Abundance of water caused by excess precipitation or irrigation is a major problem primarily on sandy loam, loam and clay loam soils with bad structure and water management qualities, but also on any soils, which are over-irrigated or irrigated at an improper time. Symptoms of the lack of water are detectable mostly when the available water content of the soil (disponible water) decreases under 60-65%.In the present year, there was a lack of precipitation on the Great Plain, which can be compensated by proper irrigation. Unfortunately, this problem is further intensified by the high temperature, which results in faster ripening and accompanied with fluctuating soil moisture content, in the formation of secondary tubers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider the classic N-stage serial supply systems with linear costs and stationary random demands. There are deterministic transportation leadtimes between stages, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. The optimal inventory policy for this system is known to be an echelon base-stock policy, which can be computed through minimizing N nested convex functions recursively. To identify the key determinants of the optimal policy, we develop a simple and surprisingly good heuristic. This method minimizes 2Nseparate newsvendor-type cost functions, each of which uses the original problem data only. These functions are lower and upper bounds for the echelon cost functions; their minimizers form bounds for the optimal echelon base-stock levels. The heuristic is the simple average of the solution bounds. In extensive numerical experiments, the average relative error of the heuristic is 0.24%, with the maximum error less than 1.5%. The bounds and the heuristic, which can be easily obtained by simple spreadsheet calculations, enhance the accessibility and implementability of the multiechelon inventory theory. More importantly, the closed-form expressions provide an analytical tool for us to gain insights into issues such as system bottlenecks, effects of system parameters, and coordination mechanisms in decentralized systems. </jats:p>",

It is generally acknowledged that in today's dynamic and turbulent environment, firms have to develop capabilities that allow them to be very flexible and agile, and at the same time, be able to incorporate new (product and process) technologies that enable them to develop and exploit better practices in supply chains. This flexibility and agility calls for companies to increase their effectiveness, exploit synergies, and learn throughout all areas of their operations. This research extends a model developed by Australian and European researchers who examined learning in the product innovation process. The research developed a model of continuous innovation in the product development process and a methodology for mapping learning behaviours (termed the CIMA methodology) that was the starting point for this project. This paper focuses on ten case studies of Australian and Singaporean companies operating distribution centres.</jats:p>",

In lack of phosphorus more degree days are needed for flowering then in case of well P-supply. 2. The effect of P is seen not on leaf initialisation (i.e. final eaf number is the same) but rather on the phyllochron interval. 3.

The soil of the experiment is calcerous chernozem soil. Five fertilisation steps were applied. Besides the control the smallest rate was 40 kg N; 25 kg P2O5; 30 kg K2O of active ingredients. The largest rate was five times more than the smallest one: 200 kg N; 125 kg P2O5; 150 kg K2O, which is equal to 475 kg mixed active ingredients. The NPK treatment significantly influenced the macrolement content in several cases. The N content was the lowest in the control treatment. Compared to this the fertiliser treatments significantly increased the N content of hybrids. However the highest amounts of potassium and phosphorus could be measured in the control and the lowest amounts could be measured at the N 200+PK kg/ha treatment.The Ca content of hybrids was the highest in the N 120+PK kg/ha treatment, while their Mg and Zn content was the highest in the control treatment. The lowest amounts were weighed in the N 200+PK kg/ha treatments, that in several cases resulted in statistically proved decreasement compared to the control or the lower fertilizer doses. Considering the two mesoelements and Zn the most favourable results were obtained in the case of the Norma SC and DK 366 SC hybrids.Summing up what has been said moderate amounts of fertiliser doses (N 40-120+PK kg/ha) had a favourable influence on the micro- and macroelement content of hybrids.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Dual supply voltage scaling (DSVS) for logiclevel power optimization at the has increasingly attracted attention over the last few years. However, mainly due to the fact that the most widely used design tools do not support this new technique, it has still not become an integral part of real-world design flows. In this paper, a novel logic synthesis methodology that enables DSVS while relying entirely on standard tools is presented. The key to this methodology is a suitably modeled dual supply voltage (DSV) standard cell library. A basic evaluation of the methodology has been carried out on a number of MCNC benchmark circuits. In all these experiments, the results of state-of-the-art powerdriven single supply voltage (SSV) logic synthesis have been used as references in order to determine the true additional benefit of DSVS. Compared with the results of SSV power optimization, additional power reductions of 10% on average have been achieved. The results prove the feasibility of the new approach and reveal its greater efficiency in comparison with a well-known dedicated DSVS algorithm. Finally, the methodology has been applied to an embedded microcontroller core in order to further explore the potentials and limitations of DSVS in an existing industrial design environment.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scaling of CMOS technology causes the power supply voltages to fall and supply currents to rise at the same time as operating speeds are increasing. Falling supply voltages cause noise margins to decrease, while increasing current and frequency makes supply noise injection larger, especially noise caused by inductance in the supply lines. Creating power distribution systems is one of the key challenges in modern chip design. Decoupling capacitance helps reduce inductance effects, but there is often a peak in the supply impedance that occurs at a resonant frequency caused roughly by the package inductance and the chip decoupling capacitors. This frequency is on the order of 100MHz, which is much lower than the operating frequency of the processor. We propose pipeline damping, an architectural technique which controls instruction issue to guarantee bounds on current variation around the frequency of the supply resonance, thus reducing the resulting supply noise. Damping is a cheaper alternative to expensive, circuit-based noise-reduction techniques. We make the fundamental observation that limiting the current flow change (di) within resonant time period (dt) controls di/dt without large performance loss. Damping guarantees bounds on current variation while allowing processor current to increase or decrease to the magnitude required to maintain performance. Our results show that a damped processor guarantees a 33% reduction in the worst-case current variation with an average performance degradation of 7% and average energy delay of 1.09 compared to an undamped processor.</jats:p>",

There are six key responsibilities or dimensions of CSR and CSR is really how to manage these six responsibilities. Companies employing such a new values‐based business approach have found that it can improve financial performance, increase employees’ motivation and commitment to work, and enhance customer loyalty and corporate reputation. The model in use (theoretical language), is able to explain the impact of CSR with the help of a bundle of dependent variables. Measuring CSR also affects additional benefits.

Continental collision in Alpine orogenic belts lasted from Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary times. The progressive contraction of oceanic crust caused the uplift of previously rifted continental margin and platforms and the formation of foredeep flysch basins. Detrital Cr-spinels are widespread in Eocene sandstones of the Brkini, Istrian and Krk Island foredeep flysch basins. On the basis of their TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> content and FeO/Fe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> ratio, spinels derived from peridotites and mantle-derived magmatic rocks were distinguished. The first are statistically more abundant and are considered to have been derived from type I and II peridotites. The second appear to be mainly related to backarc basin products. These results suggest that Cr-spinels were derived from the erosion of the Internal Dinarides, where type II and III peridotites are present, and also from the Outer Dinarides, where type I peridotites crop out.</jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that adding growth‐limiting nutrients to mesotrophic grasslands that were in shortage of either N (N:P ratio&lt;10) or P (N:P ratio&gt;14) would lead to an increase of plant diversity. Thereto, we studied the effects of long‐term (11 yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on soil nutrient pools, vegetation nutrient dynamics and biodiversity in a riverine grassland in the Netherlands with a low soil N:P ratio (N shortage) and a peat grassland with a high soil N:P ratio (P shortage), respectively. Eleven years of nutrient addition hardly had any effects on the total stocks of C, N and P in the soils of both sites, due to the large size of the soil nutrient pools already present and to the management at both sites (annual hay‐making and ‐removal). However, in the riverine grassland the treatments increased the cycling of the small pool of labile N and P compounds resulting in large increases in annual fluxes of especially N. In the unfertilised controls, species establishments balanced more or less species losses during an 11 year period, thus leading to a dynamic equilibrium of the species pool. However, contrary to our hypothesis, addition of the growth‐limiting nutrient led at both sites to a reduction of species diversity even when total biomass remained below critical levels. Species diversity and species evenness were strongly determined by N mineralisation and to a lesser extent by total soil N and extractable P, respectively. Total aboveground biomass of the vegetation was determined by total soil N.</jats:p><jats:p>Our study shows that patterns found in correlative studies of the relation between plant diversity and soil and vegetation N:P ratio can not be translated into successful experimental manipulations to enhance biodiversity. The most likely explanation is that colonization limitation occurred in the fertilized plots and that not sufficient diaspores of potentially new species could reach and/or colonize the plots to compensate for the species extinctions as a result of increased nutrient supply.</jats:p>",

As K interacts with Ca and Mg, liming can interfere in K movement in the soil, affecting eventually the plant nutrition. The objective of this work was to study the effect of dolomitic lime and 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 g kg-1 of K on the supply of K to cotton roots. Cotton plants were grown up to 40 days in 5 L pots containing a Dark Red Latosol (Typic Haplusthox) with 68% and 16% of sand and clay, respectively. There was an increase in dry matter yields and in K accumulation due to K fertilization. Root interception of soil K was also increased by K application, but was not affected by lime. Mass flow and diffusion increased linearly with K levels up to 60 mg kg-1, in pots with lime. In pots without lime the amount of K reaching the roots by diffusion increased up to 45 mg kg-1, but decreased at the highest K level. Accordingly, there was more K reaching the roots through mass flow at the highest K level. This happened because there were more fine roots in pots without lime, at the highest K level. As the roots grew closer, there was a stronger root competition leading to a decrease in the amount of K diffused to cotton roots.</jats:p>",

Nurses in NHS Walk-in Centres (WiCs) now supply and administer antibiotics in accordance with patient group directions (PGDs). The aim of this study was to investigate the process of antibiotic supply from WiCs. Antibiotic PGDs from ten WiCs were selected and medical notes of 50 patients who received an antibiotic at these WiCs were examined to determine compliance with PGD specifications. No consistency of approach in format and content of PGDs was found. PGDs from six WiCs complied with 15/20 or fewer PGD requirements. In the examination of patients’ records, 65% of all relevant PGD requirements were explicitly recorded. The breadth and variability of PGDs demonstrates local needs and priorities; however, low compliance levels with PGD requirements provide cause for concern. This article discusses the legality of PGDs, equity in both service provision and advice offered, compliance of medical notes with PGD requirements, implications for patients and WiC nurses, and training implications. Incomplete documentation makes it impossible to verify the quality of care provided across and within WiCs. It also suggests that uncertainty remains around the supply of medicines under PGDs. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the rich theoretical base of TCT has seen limited application in the operations and supply chain management research. This article seeks to change that by providing a cogent synthesis of TCT, its assumptions, constructs, and propositions. It also summarizes existing empirical work in management and other disciplines that draws from the TCT perspective and examines relationships in manufacturing organizations. A measurement model of transaction costs is subsequently presented using data from 203 manufacturing firms in the OEM electronics industry. Guidelines and recommendations for researchers are then presented regarding both the uses of the theory and its measurement. It is hoped that this study will stimulate work in the important areas of inter‐firm relationships that draw from this rich but underutilized theoretical lens, and thereby add another perspective to the knowledge base in related areas of the operations and supply chain management fields.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effects of experimentally reduced total phosphorus concentrations (TP) from 2.4 to 0.6 µmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> on plankton community in a shallow lake were evaluated from the proportion between dissolved reactive P (DRP), dissolved nonreactive P (DOP) and particulate organic P (POP), and the stoichiometry among particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON), and POP. In both triple ratios, DRP:DOP:POP and POC:PON:POP, we used POP as a key component to indicate shifts between P fractions and between nutrients in particulate organic matter. The enhanced P accumulation by the planktonic assemblage by 14% at reduced P supply was achieved by two steps, in the first year mainly at the expense of DOP and in the second year by DRP. The evidence that this increase of %POP of TP reflects the adaptive P utilization of the organisms under low P supply was substantiated by significant relationships between P fractions and changes in the community. A higher %POP of TP was associated with higher specific alkaline phosphatase activity and with tighter coupling between producers and consumers respectively—that is, driven from both the nutrient‐producer and the producer‐consumer interface. A lowered %DOP of TP was significantly related to smaller overall loss rates for the carbon pool of bacteria and algae, whereas %DRP of TP was correlated to the decrease of the biomass of most organism groups. Stoichiometric shifts toward a P‐rich assemblage under low TP have been justified by compositional shifts from N‐rich cyanobacteria to P‐rich eukaryotic algae and bacteria. The shifts toward POP in both triple ratios strongly indicated that the plankton community acted as a sink for phosphorus under reduced total pool size.</jats:p>",

The expected frequency of infectious donations can be estimated and these estimates may be used to contribute to monitoring of blood safety and used in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion‐transmitted infections.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Materials and Methods</jats:bold> The prevalence and incidence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to HCV and HIV (anti‐HCV and anti‐HIV, respectively) in donors in England, between 1993 and 2001, were used together with data about the length of negative ‘window‐periods’ of current assays for each of these markers and data about test performance, to estimate the number of infectious donations that enter the blood supply. The risks were calculated separately for donations from new donors and from repeat donors, and for the three time periods 1993–95, 1996–98 and 1999–01.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold> The estimated frequency of infectious donations entering the blood supply in England, between 1993 and 2001 was 1 in 260 000 for HBV and 1 in 8 million for HIV. For HCV, the frequency of infectious donations was 1 in 520 000 during 1993–98 and fell to 1 in 30 million during 1999–2001 when all donations were tested for HCV RNA. The frequency of HBV‐ and HCV‐infectious donations entering the blood supply fell over these 9 years: the frequency of HIV‐infectious donations remained essentially unchanged. The risk from donations from new donors was found to be approximately sevenfold higher than the risk from donations from repeat donors.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold> The risks of HBV‐, HCV‐ or HIV‐infectious donations entering the blood supply in England are very low, and have decreased since 1993. Although the accuracy of these estimates is imperfect, mainly owing to uncertainty in some assumptions and to small numbers of infections, they provide some quantification of the risk of HBV, HCV or HIV transmission by transfusion, and allow comparison of the magnitude of these risks for each infection and over time. The methods we have used have been developed and improved from previously published methods.</jats:p>",

To investigate seasonal changes in the effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the growth of rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.) crops, a free air CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment (FACE) experiment was conducted at Shizukuishi, Iwate, Japan in 1998–2000. The target CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration of the FACE plots was 200 µmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> above that of ambient. Three levels of nitrogen (N) were supplied: low (LN, 4 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>), medium [MN, 8 (1998) and 9 (1999, 2000) g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>] and high N (HN, 12 and 15 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>). For MN and HN but not for LN, elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased tiller number at panicle initiation (PI) but this positive response decreased with crop development. As a result, the response of green leaf area index (GLAI) to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> greatly varied with development, showing positive responses during vegetative stages and negative responses after PI. Elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decreased leaf N concentration over the season, except during early stage of development. For MN crops, total biomass increased with elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, but the response declined linearly with development, with average increases of 32, 28, 21, 15 and 12% at tillering, PI, anthesis, mid‐ripening and grain maturity, respectively. This decline is likely to be due to decreases in the positive effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on canopy photosynthesis because of reductions in both GLAI and leaf N. Up to PI, LN‐crops tended to have a lower response to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> than MN‐ and HN‐crops, though by final harvest the total biomass response was similar for all N levels. For MN‐ and HN‐crops, the positive response of grain yield (ca. 15%) to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was slightly greater than the response of final total biomass while for LN‐crops it was less. We conclude that most of the seasonal changes in crop response to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> are directly or indirectly associated with N uptake.</jats:p>",

The adult <jats:italic>Suncus</jats:italic> pancreas is clearly separated into right and left lobes that are not fused. The right lobe of the <jats:italic>Suncus</jats:italic> pancreas is located in the dorsum of the duodenum and to the right of the common bile duct independently. The right lobe is supplied by branches of the superior mesenteric artery, and is innervated by branches that originate from the superior mesenteric plexus and run along the arterial branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The left lobe occupies 9/10 of the entire pancreas and is located to the left of the common bile duct. It is supplied mainly by branches of the splenic and common hepatic arteries, and is innervated by branches that originate from the celiac plexus and run along the splenic and common hepatic arteries. According to previous studies on the blood supply and innervation of the human pancreas, the right and left lobes of the <jats:italic>Suncus</jats:italic> pancreas correspond to the pancreatic parts derived from the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds. The current results suggest that the <jats:italic>Suncus</jats:italic> pancreas is a suitable experimental model for studying the development of the human pancreas.

It was found that the discouraged workers’ effect dominated the added workers’ effect in both the West Bank and Gaza labor force. Also, it was found that the effect of real wages policies was significant on labor supply in the West Bank owing to the high uncompensated wage elasticity of labor supply. However, wage policies did not affect labor supply in Gaza. Further, labor supply elasticity, with respect to labor demand, was relatively high which indicates that policies aimed at reducing unemployment should focus on job creation, but not on policies affecting labor supply. Finally, the results showed that current labor supply was positively related to labor supply in the previous period.</jats:p>",
