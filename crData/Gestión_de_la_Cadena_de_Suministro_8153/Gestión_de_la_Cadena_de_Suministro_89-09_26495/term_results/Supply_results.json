Hydrogen can be obtained from a customer‐owned hydrogen plant or as a merchant product supplied by an industrial gas supplier. The merchant product can be delivered in trailers as gas, liquid‐high (up to 2,200 psig), low pressure (up to 130 psig), or supplied over the fence from a pipeline or hydrogen generating plant. Several factors must be considered in selecting an optimum supply, including availability and cost of capital and of operating labor, use patterns, average demand, instantaneous demand, use pressure, growth projections, and purity requirements. Recent field test data have shown that increased hydrogen purity can improve the hydrogenation processes.</jats:p>",

Export was greatly reduced under treatments which reduced phloem supply to the nodule. A water budget for nodules suggested that the delivery of water to the nodule via mass flow in the phloem was comparable to that required for export of ureides from the nodule in the xylem from the nodule. Therefore, we suggest that xylem export from nodules is related to the phloem supply to the nodule rather than to the transpirational flux in the parent root. This suggestion is related to the reported decreases in nodule permeability to gases under conditions of phloem deprivation.</jats:p>",

Plants were treated continuously with one of three levels of N supply (30, 100 or 170ppm N). Leaf expansion in terms of lamina area of individual leaves and leaf area per plant, and chlorophyll content of leaves during both growth phases were increased significantly by N supply up to 100 ppm N, which was found to be the optimum level for oilseed rape. N supply of 30 ppm N resulted in N stress while 170 ppm N represents an excessive supply. N supply of 100 ppm N enhanced leaf expansion during H–6 weeks after transplanting by 88–260 % over that of 30 ppm N. Lamina areas of younger leaves responded to N nutrition better than did those of older leaves. Leaf area per plant increased 155–194 % due to increasing N supply but leaf number was increased less remarkably (by 25–44 %). N supply enhanced the contents of leaf chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic>, chlorophyll <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>, and total chlorophyll but had very little influence on chlorophyll <jats:italic>a/b</jats:italic> ratios; except that increasing N supply tended to reduce these ratios.
