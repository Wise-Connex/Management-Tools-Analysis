Often, the concerned companies have failed to give appropriate and immediate information to consumers. This article discusses the measures that one food company – Tesco – has taken. Its approach deals with setting up effective guidelines for managing its relationships with meat suppliers. These guidelines make it possible for Tesco to inform consumers appropriately and immediately about serious food scares and to address consumers’ concerns over animal welfare and environmental issues. The article also describes how the meat supplier‐Tesco relationships are being evaluated using the so‐called key performance indicator process. Specific initiatives include different animal, feeds and medicines policies, as well as meat assurance schemes; these policies and schemes have been implemented by both Tesco and the meat suppliers. The benefits of Tesco’s approach to its suppliers and consumers are considered and include the ability to deliver higher value products. The article suggests a number of avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

SCEM attempts to identify, as early as possible, the resulting deviations between the plan and its execution across the multitude of processes and actors in the supply chain to trigger corrective actions according to predefined rules. Despite SCEM's well documented attractiveness for practitioners, it has received little attention as a field of academic research. This paper provides an introduction into SCEM from three complementary perspectives: SCEM as a management concept; as a software solution; and as a software component. Each is analyzed in detail and potential fields of research on SCEM are presented.</jats:p>",

The factors include: the strategic orientation of the outsourcing organization; its perception of 3pls' roles within the logistics strategy; the nature of the resultant client‐3pl relationship; and, the extent to which logistics is outsourced. The supply chain impact of these factors are evaluated based on the findings from case study research.

To help position the concept of collaborative planning, various collaborative initiatives such as vendor‐managed inventory (VMI) and continuous replenishment (CR) and collaborative planning (CP) are reviewed.

The challenge is to determine a cost-effective flexibility configuration that is able to meet the demand with high likelihood. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the benefits from flexibility in multistage supply chains. We find two phenomena, stage-spanning bottlenecks and floating bottlenecks, neither of which are present in single-stage supply chains, which reduce the effectiveness of a flexibility configuration. We develop a flexibility measure g and show that increasing this measure results in greater protection from these supply-chain inefficiencies. We also identify flexibility guidelines that perform very well for multistage supply chains. These guidelines employ and adapt the single-stage chaining strategy of Jordan and Graves (1995) to multistage supply chains. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This study is focused on discovering important trading partner selection criteria that are relevant in electronic data interchange (EDI)-enabled relationships. Increasing implementation of integrated supply chain management (SCM) and collaborative commerce initiatives call for the cultivation and maintenance of long-term strategic partnerships such as those engendered by EDI. There is a body of evidence showing that hub firms (i.e., firms that initiate technology-enabled partnership networks) are, in fact, getting more selective about their trading partners. However, there is a need to understand specific trading partner attributes that are more likely to ensure successful long-term relationships. Using the survey technique, this study elicited respondents from customer and supplier firms engaged in EDI applications; the final respondent sample ended up with a pool of firms primarily in the manufacturing sector. Factor analysis uncovered six trading partner selection factors which both customer and supplier firms thought were critical in selecting partners: strategic commitment of top management; readiness for high-level EDI; joint partnering; trading partner flexibility; communications; and EDI infrastructure.</p>",

Supply chain management (SCM) is an application of EC, and therefore, the impact of EC can be seen throughout the supply chain (SC). This study explores the effectiveness of replenishment using the Internet (i.e., website retailing) when comparing different replenishment options, by analyzing the distributor-retail outlet and retail outlet-customer links in the SC. Moreover, this research studies customer buying habits as well as inventory management strategies when products are purchased via a website. Five-hundred-and-fifteen products are analyzed over time (monthly) in order to identify replenishment issues when conducting business (e-business) from a website (eTailing).</p>",

There are some small lakes and rills in this water system. The ecologically most valuable part of the water system is the low-lying Tímár meadow. Lakes and rills of the water system do not get any water supply by floods in one third of the year, and get floods only from the Bodrog River in one quarter of the year. Through more than half of the year, the water system does not get any water supply from the Tisza River. It would be desirable to get a more frequent water supply from the Tisza River into the water system, because, despite the facts that Tisza River is also polluted, its water quality and biodiversity are higher than those of Bodrog River. Duration of water supply of lakes and rills may be increased by lowering the bottom sill of the natural flood-diversion channel. In case of lowering the bottom sill by about 1.0-1.2 m, rate of the years without any water supply would decrease from 28% to 21%, while the rate of the years in which the water system gets any water supply in flood period directly from the Tisza would increase from 34% to 72%. More frequent water supply of floods from Tisza River would gradually improve ecological conditions of the water system.</jats:p>"

The rates of inflation and deflation are approximated by exponential decay functions having time constants of about 6 years and a few days, respectively. This behavior is consistent with a deep, constant‐pressure magma source connected to a shallow reservoir by a magma‐filled conduit. An elastic deformation model indicates that the reservoir is located about 6 km below sea level and beneath Westdahl Peak. We propose that the magma flow rate through the conduit is governed by the pressure gradient between the deep source and the reservoir. The pressure gradient, and hence the flow rate, are greatest immediately after eruptions. Pressurization of the reservoir decreases both the pressure gradient and the flow rate, but eventually the reservoir ruptures and an eruption or intrusion ensues. The eruption rate is controlled partly by the pressure gradient between the reservoir and surface, and therefore it, too, decreases with time. When the supply of eruptible magma is exhausted, the eruption stops, the reservoir begins to repressurize at a high rate, and the cycle repeats. This model might also be appropriate for other frequently active volcanoes with stable magma sources and relatively simple magma storage systems.</jats:p>",

NIPF owners could raise harvests to near historical peak levels. These harvests would entail oscillating long-run inventories under the market projection and stable to declining inventories in the even-flow case. Average clearcut age would decline over the projection. Forest industry management would shift toward plantations with thinning and early density control. NIPF management would continue to depend on natural regeneration with increased use of commercial thinning. Simulated riparian protection policies lower harvest roughly in proportion to the land base reduction, raise log prices, and drive up the price of land not subject to restrictions. The present value of future net returns to private timberland owners would decline. A policy to extend the minimum age of clearcut harvest could have large near-term impacts on both industrial and NIPF owners. Prices rise sharply, and harvest declines in the near term. In the longer term, the policy acts like an enforced supply expansion, raising harvest and depressing prices. Timberland owners lose both in terms of income and in the reduction of bare land values due to lower product prices and harvest timing restrictions. West. J. Appl. For. 18(3):166–174.</jats:p>",

Due to the limited diffusional gas exchange, embryos grow in an environment of low oxygen. O2 levels within embryo tissues were measured using microsensors and are lowest in early stages and during night, up to 0.4% of atmospheric O2 concentration (1.1 μm). Embryo respiration was more strongly inhibited by low O2 during earlier than later stages. ATP content and adenylate energy charge were lowest in young embryos, whereas ethanol emission and alcohol dehydrogenase activity were high, indicating restricted ATP synthesis and fermentative metabolism. In vitro and in vivo experiments further revealed that embryo metabolism is O2 limited. During maturation, ATP levels increased and fermentative metabolism disappeared. This indicates that embryos become adapted to the low O2 and can adjust its energy state on a higher level. Embryos become green and photosynthetically active during differentiation. Photosynthetic O2 production elevated the internal level up to approximately 50% of atmospheric O2 concentration (135 μm). Upon light conditions, embryos partitioned approximately 3-fold more [14C]sucrose into starch. The light-dependent increase of starch synthesis was developmentally regulated. However, steady-state levels of nucleotides, free amino acids, sugars, and glycolytic intermediates did not change upon light or dark conditions. Maturing embryos responded to low O2 supply by adjusting metabolic fluxes rather than the steady-state levels of metabolites. We conclude that embryogenic photosynthesis increases biosynthetic fluxes probably by providing O2 and energy that is readily used for biosynthesis and respiration.</jats:p>",

A hydroponic study was therefore conducted to examine the effects of different levels of phosphate and arsenate [As(V)] on As speciation and distribution in tolerant and non-tolerant clones of Holcus lanatus. Speciation of As in tissue (using high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) revealed that the predominant species present were the inorganic As species (As(V) and arsenite [As(III)]), although small levels (&amp;lt;1%) of organic As species (dimethylarsinic acid and monomethylarsonic acid) were detected in shoot material. In roots, the proportion of total As present as As(III) generally increased with increasing levels of As(V) in the nutrient solution, whereas in shoots, the proportion of total As present as As(III) generally decreased with increasing levels of As(V). H. lanatus plants growing in the high-phosphorus (P) (100 μm) solution contained a higher proportion of As(V) (with regard to total As) in both roots and shoots than plants supplied with low P (10 μm); in addition, tolerant clones generally contained a higher proportion of As(V) with regard to total As than non-tolerant clones. The study further revealed that As(V) can be reduced to As(III) in both roots and shoots. Although the reduction capacity was limited, the reduction was closely regulated by As influx for all treatments. The results therefore provide a new understanding about As metabolism in H. lanatus.</jats:p>",

The mixture consisted of methyl propyl ketone, ethyl 3‐ethoxy propionate, n‐butyl acetate, toluene and p‐xylene. In order to quantify nitrogen requirements, a series of experiments was conducted under various nitrogen‐limited and nitrogen‐rich conditions. Overall, increasing nitrogen availability improved the total VOC removal efficiencies from approximately 70% to 99%. At the lowest available nitrogen condition, most of the ethyl 3‐ethoxy propionate and n‐butyl acetate, as well as approximately 75% of the methyl propyl ketone were removed in the bioreactor, but toluene and p‐xylene were not biodegraded. Increasing the nitrogen availability improved the biodegradation of methyl propyl ketone. Substantial degradation of toluene and p‐xylene occurred in this study only after the molar ratio of the aromatic compounds to the other constituents in the waste gas stream increased above 2.0. Elimination capacity tests performed with the VOC mixture and each individual VOC indicated that the presence of other VOCs inhibited the biodegradation of toluene and p‐xylene. These findings imply that substrate inhibitions limit the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly when the available nitrogen in the packing media is low.</jats:p>",

For a typical 210‐hectare UK combinable crop farm, adopting a 50 per cent set‐aside cropping plan is optimal when the price of cereals is below £62/tonne (98.50/tonne). If widely adopted, 50 per cent set‐aside will lead to a substantial fall in the supply of cereals and would lead the industry supply curve for cereals to move leftward and become more elastic over a certain price range.

We studied a medical device producer that has established a new medical information product group (MIPG) within their NPD organization to create software features that are bundled with their core physical products. The MIPG has conceptualized these software features as multiple software development projects, and then coordinated their realization largely through the use of external software suppliers. This case study centers on the question: how can firms effectively coordinate such product development processes?</jats:p><jats:p>Our analysis of case evidence and related literature suggests that such product bundling processes, when pursued through design supply chains (DSC), are more complex than is typical for the development of streams of either physical products or software products individually. We observe that DSC coordination transcends the requirements associated with traditional “stage‐gate” NPD processes used for physical product development. Managers in DSC settings face a tension inherent to distributed work: keeping internal and external development efforts separate to exploit the design capabilities within a network of software suppliers, while ensuring effective delivery of a stream of bundled products. Many managers face this coordination tension with little, if any, prior knowledge of how to create a streamlined and effective DSC. Our research indicates that these managers need to make a series of interrelated decisions: the number of suppliers to qualify and include in or exclude from the DSC; the basis for measuring and modifying the scope of the suppliers' work; the need to account for asymmetric cost structures and expertise across the DSC; the mechanisms for synchronizing development work across elements of the DSC; and the approaches for developing skills—both technical and administrative—that project managers need for utilizing in‐house competencies while acquiring and assimilating design know‐how from external development organizations. When managers take a flexible approach toward these decisions based on a modular set of software development projects, they can improve their NPD outcomes through technical and organizational experimentation and adjust their own resource deployment to best utilize the suppliers' capabilities within their DSC.</jats:p>",

Each volcano records: (1) intrusion of a basanitic parent magma to lower- to mid-crustal levels and its subsequent fractionation to form a tephritic residual melt; (2) subsequent transection of this reservoir by a second batch of basanitic melt, with tephrite rising to the surface at the head of the propagating basanite dyke. Eruption at the surface then yields initial tephrite, typically erupted as pyroclasts, followed by eruption and shallow intrusion of basanite from deeper in the dyke. By analogy with similar tephrite–basanite eruptions along rift zones of intraplate ocean-island volcanoes, we infer that fractionation to tephrite would have required decades to centuries. We conclude that the two studied continental monogenetic volcanic fields demonstrate a consistent history of early magmatic injections that fail to reach the surface, followed by capture and partial eruption of their evolved residues in the course of separate and significantly later injections of basanite that extend to the surface and erupt. This systematic behaviour probably reflects the difficulty of bringing small volumes of dense, primitive magma to the surface from mantle source regions. Ascent through continental crust is aided by the presence in the dyke head of buoyant tephrite captured during transection of the earlier-emplaced melt bodies.</jats:p>",

Experiments ranged from small‐scale core perfusions with defined compounds (glucose, bovine serum albumin) to mesocosms receiving natural leaf leachate or water from different streams. Response variables included bacterial production, oxygen consumption, extracellular enzyme activity, and community similarity as manifest by changes in banding patterns of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All DOM manipulations generated responses in at least one metabolic variable. Additions of both labile and recalcitrant materials increased either oxygen consumption, production, or both depending on background DOM. Enzyme activities were affected by both types of carbon addition with largest effects from the labile mixture. Cluster analysis of RAPD data showed strong divergence of communities exposed to labile versus recalcitrant DOM. Additions of leaf leachate to mesocosms representing hyporheic flowpaths caused increases in oxygen consumption and some enzyme activities with weaker effects on production. Community structure was strongly affected; samples from the leachate‐amended mesocosms clustered separately from the control samples. In mesocosms receiving water from streams ranging in DOC (0.5–4.5 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), there were significant differences in bacterial growth, oxygen consumption, and enzyme activities. RAPD analysis showed strongest clustering of samples by stream type with more subtle effects of position along the flowpaths. Responses in community metabolism were always accompanied by shifts in community composition, suggesting carbon supply affects both functional and structural attributes of hyporheic bacterial communities.</jats:p>",

Variations in sperm whale movement patterns and behavior were related to changes in prey abundance (jumbo squid, <jats:italic>Dosidicus gigas</jats:italic>) determined by fishery statistics. Photo‐identification data revealed that seven female sperm whales moved into the Gulf of California from the Galapagos Islands, traveling up to 3,803 km. These are among the longest documented movements for female sperm whales. There were significant differences in speed and distance traveled during a dive cycle between 1998 and 1999 (low and high squid abundance). In 1999 there were also significant differences in small‐scale movements and behavior between the northern and the southern part of the study area (high and low prey abundance). These results suggest that when food resources are low, sperm whales travel in straighter lines, dive for longer periods, travel larger distances during dive cycles, and at higher speed. In 1999 there were significant differences in time spent socializing in areas of high prey abundance versus areas of low abundance. All of these changes in behavior were consistent with increased foraging effort when squid abundance was low. A high proportion of mature males and first‐year calves were observed in the Gulf of California, suggesting that it is an important sperm whale breeding ground.</jats:p>",

On 18 July, a new vent formed at 2100 m elevation, at the southern base of the Montagnola, followed on the next day by the opening of a vent further upslope, at 2550 m (eccentric eruptive system). The eruption lasted for 3 weeks. Approximately 80% of the total lava volume was erupted from the 2100 m and the 2550 m vents. The collected structural data suggest that the Cisternazza graben developed as a passive local response of the volcanic edifice to the ascent of a north–south eccentric dyke, which eventually reached the ground surface in the Montagnola area (18–19 July). In contrast, the two narrow fracture zones radiating from the summit are interpreted as the lateral propagation, from the conduit of the SE Crater, of north–south- and NE–SW-oriented shallow dykes, 2–3 m wide. The evolution of the fracture pattern together with other volcanological data (magma ascent and effusion rate, eruptive style, petrochemical characteristics of the erupted products, and petrology of xenoliths within magma) suggest that the eccentric and central–lateral eruptions were fed by two distinct magmatic systems. Examples of eccentric activity accompanied by central–lateral events have never been described before at Etna.\n          </jats:p>",

The first concept, the ‘continuum of first-tier suppliers’, contends that only certain ‘first-tier’ suppliers will be able to compete within a modular environment, whilst the second concept, ‘value-added second tier’ examines the role (in many cases, the enlarged role) that second-tier suppliers are likely to play within a modular landscape. </jats:p>",

The electrical and optical properties of these multilayer films depend largely on the surface characteristics of the transparent conducting oxide thin films. A smoother surface on the transparent conducting oxide thin films makes it easier for the metal layer to form a continuous film, thus resulting in a higher conductivity and visible light transmittance. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) films were co-deposited using a dual magnetron sputter and a bipolar pulse power supply to decrease the surface roughness of the transparent conducting oxide films. The symmetric pulse mode of the power supply was used to simultaneously sputter an In2O3 (90 wt %) : SnO2 (10 wt %) target and a ZnO target. We varied the duty of the pulses to control the ratio of ITO : ZnO in the thin films. The electrical and optical properties of the films were studied, and special attention was paid to the surface roughness and the crystallinity of the films. By co-depositing ITO and ZnO at a pulse duty ratio of ITO:ZnO=45:45 using a dual magnetron sputter and a bipolar pulse power supply, we were able to obtain amorphous transparent conducting oxide films with a very smooth surface which had a Zn-rich buffer layer under a In-rich surface layer.

Except for pH, coefficients of variation of soil properties within a domain ranged from 17 to 43%. Similar ranges were measured for grain yield and plant nutrient uptake in nutrient omission plots, which served as crop‐based estimates of indigenous N, P, and K supply. Soil properties showed little association with plant nutrient uptake or grain yield in nutrient omission plots. Mean grain yields in nutrient omission plots increased in the order 0‐N (3.9 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) &lt; 0‐K (5.1 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) ≤ 0‐P (5.2 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>).

Grain yield and nutrient uptake in omission plots were mostly higher in high‐yielding than in low‐yielding climatic seasons. No changes in indigenous N supply occurred for periods of 4 to 6 yr in the same seasons. Grain yields in nutrient omission plots were strongly correlated with each other and also with the yield in the fertilized farmers' fields. Fertilizer recommendations should be fine‐tuned to spatial domains with relatively uniform agroecological characteristics, cropping practices, and socioeconomic conditions. Within such domains, season‐specific management of the IS variability can include field‐specific approaches.</jats:p>",
