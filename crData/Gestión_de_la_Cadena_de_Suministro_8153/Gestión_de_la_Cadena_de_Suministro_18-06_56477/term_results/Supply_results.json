A better understanding and application of green supply chain management practices by SMEs could enable such enterprises to improve their performance and succeed in their operations.Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the relationship between green supply chain management, environmental performance and supply chain performance in South African SMEs.Method: A conceptual model was proposed and subjected to empirical verification using data collected from SMEs based in Gauteng province. The structural equation modelling procedure was used to test hypotheses in the proposed relationships in SMEs within different industries.Results: The results of the study indicated mixed outcomes. No relationships were found between environmental performance and two green supply chain dimensions, namely green purchasing and eco-design. However, the remaining dimensions of green supply chain management, namely reverse logistics and legislation and regulation, positively and significantly predicted environmental performance. In turn, environmental performance positively and significantly predicted supply chain performance.Conclusion: Integrating green supply chain management practices, especially reverse logistics and adherence to legislation and regulation into the SME business strategy, leads to the improvement of environmental and overall supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Disruptions should be successfully managed if organisations are to thrive in today’s ever-changing world.Purpose: This study explored supply chain disruptions of third-party logistics service providers (3PLs) and their clients based in South Africa by investigating the disruptions these organisations face, and how they go about managing them.Method: A generic qualitative research approach was used to gather data by conducting semi-structured interviews with 22 participants, which comprised 11 3PLs and 11 client organisations operating in South Africa.Findings: This study classified disruptions as intra-, inter- and extra-organisational. South African 3PLs and their clients face the majority of their disruptions either intra- or inter-organisationally. The focus of 3PLs and clients has shifted from risk management to disruption management. The findings show that 3PLs and their clients based in South Africa prefer disruption learning over traditional risk management as a method to better manage future disruptions.Conclusion: This study contributes to existing literature by providing insight into the specific supply chain disruptions that 3PLs and their clients based in South Africa face, according to the disruption location in the supply chain and how 3PLs and clients manage supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Today’s systems capture a tremendous amount of supply chain (SC) related data. To take advantage of this capability firms must transform this information into better decisions and improved performance. The ultimate goal is to transform this mass of unstructured data into useful performance indicators and diagnostics that result in improved service, lower costs and lower inventory. Those firms who can successfully transform data into actionable business intelligence will gain a sustainable competitive advantage. The vision to use SC analytics effectively must include people, process and technology. Integration of the three is critical to maximise results. To begin the journey you must first identify what data is needed and how it should be structured. For example, the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR)1 Model provides a comprehensive set of performance indicators at both the business and operational levels. It links top-level metrics like ‘perfect order fulfillment’ with lower-level measures and diagnostics like ‘production schedule adherence’. Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard – Translating Strategy into Action2 helps in translating the firm’s vision and strategy into a set of performance measures. The four perspectives of the scorecard (financial, customer, internal and learning) help to balance long-term and short-term goals. Adapting such things to the individual business model is an important step in the analytics process. BASF has used both of these concepts in performance measurement for many years. BASF, a firm with over 400 SAP plant codes and 85 strategic business units, began the effort to further leverage ‘big data’ with two major projects. The first replaced regional data warehouses with one global business warehouse. Many applications were transferred to the new environment. The second major project (Project ONE) converted all of BASF globally to one version of SAP R3. Like most firms, BASF had implemented SAP R3 over a period of years. Therefore, different regions had different versions, making data and communication difficult or even impossible. BASF was the first such company to transform to one version globally. All the various analytics types (predictive, descriptive, optimising) are applicable to SC management. Selecting the correct analytics and creating detailed definitions need to occur before software programming. This process must be end-user-driven. The technology needs to include ease-of-use as a primary objective. Change management (communication, education, validation) must be included in the project plans, as resistance to such a major transformation is to be expected.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Amazon is setting very high standards for the entire retail industry with the market-leading ecommerce innovations they are implementing across their delivery logistics infrastructure, as well as the technologies behind it. As customer spend rapidly shifted over the past decade towards online commerce and away from physical stores, customer expectations around convenience, choice and speed of delivery have also changed drastically. The boom of on-demand technologies such as real-time tracking, alongside the widespread adoption of smartphones, means that retailers across the world need to quickly adapt in order to stay relevant with their customers. The implications of this shift towards customer-centric deliveries affect the entire retail supply chain, which needs to be redesigned to ensure companies gain maximum operational efficiency while providing an exceptional customer experience. This new retail landscape is having a huge impact on both the micro and the macro level. On the one hand, retailers need to optimise their fleets, delivery partners, warehouses, stores and customer service. On the other hand, regulators need help creating cities that provide the optimal infrastructure to efficiently manage the flow of goods. The last mile in particular is becoming one of the toughest challenges for retailers to support, and they will need to embrace technology that helps them manage their operations while maintaining a healthy bottom line. It is not a simple task to reach all customers wherever they are, whenever they want — especially in countries or cities with low population density. However, as delivery companies, in-house fleets and crowdsourced resources become more aware of these challenges, we will see the emergence of new models that efficiently utilise multiple tools, technologies and resources. The entire industry is working towards achieving flawless orchestration of a fully-transparent, fully-optimised supply chain, which is driven as much by cost-efficiency as it is by providing end-customers with exceptional brand experiences.</jats:p>"

Network theories provide a broad base for understanding how firms, functions, and teams work together but at the foundation of all networks are individuals and their connections (ties). This research elaborates on supply chain integration through the lens of network theory, focusing on frontline individuals’ decision‐making and behaviors as the foundation for understanding cross‐functional integration and firm‐level outcomes. Two studies, utilizing social network and inductive qualitative methods drawing on grounded theory and ethnography, show that the execution of marketing and supply chain strategies is dependent on the empowerment and integration of a manufacturer's frontline employees in retail supply chains. Empowerment is found to be the result of a network of multiple relationships. Tension mounts when frontline employees are disconnected from cross‐functional management sources in their organization and instead turn to each other to solve problems that arise in their retail channels. The results highlight the importance of relational embeddedness and empowerment in affecting internal supply chain integration.</jats:p>",

On top of the habitual suspects they are usually being measured by — service performance, order-to-delivery time, product cost and inventory investment — they have had to struggle with controversial trade-offs since their roles first existed. This battle became even more difficult to deal with when incorporating today’s new levers and trends, social and environmental pressures or a broad variety of alternatives for SC digitalisation. This paper will review how this new landscape has changed, making it extremely difficult to orchestrate, what new drivers and capability focus SCM needs to develop and how, due to the nature and the playground of those tradeoffs, a bimodal management philosophy is a must. The paper concludes with a practical case example that demonstrates the robustness of such an approach. We expect to validate the underlying foundation for sustainably managing future scenarios in a disruptive world and leverage the role of the supply chain in the business not only as a cost centre, but also as a differentiating capability to better compete in the market — a bimodal perspective.</jats:p>"

As an alternative, this study presents a paradox perspective and argues that sustainability and other business aims are not always compatible, particularly in an emerging market context. Often, paradoxical tensions originate in conflicts between the socioeconomic environment of emerging market suppliers and their Western customers’ demands for both cost competitiveness and sustainability. We argue that Western buying firms can play a key role in moderating such tensions, as experienced by emerging market suppliers. Specifically, we explore how purchasing and sustainability managers within buying firms make sense of and respond to paradoxical tensions in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCM</jats:styled-content>. We conduct an in‐depth case study of a Western multinational company that sources substantially from Chinese suppliers. While we found strong evidence for a persisting instrumental perspective in the sensemaking and practices of purchasing and sustainability managers, we also observed an alternative response, primarily by sustainability managers that we labeled as “contextualizing.” Contextualizing can alleviate the tensions otherwise present in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SSCM</jats:styled-content> by making sustainability standards more workable in an emerging market context, and it can help individual managers to move toward paradoxical sensemaking.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dairy industry plays a vital role in enriching the socio-economic status of rural India, particularly in women empowerment. In general, either a structure or subcomponents of dairy supply chain is discussed in the literature, but the rational (why, what, how) is missing. Further, the structured-literature-review (SLR) of dairy supply chain management (DSCM) practices is scarce. This paper presents an SLR of articles published in the context of DSCM practices. The paper further assesses the extent to which the SLR approach can be applied to DSCM so as to produce a consistent knowledge stock by evolving a context-sensitive study. The key challenges discussed in reviewed articles are highlighted. Authors selected the articles published in peer-reviewed journals and categorized the articles published in recent eleven years into three main subjects of supply chain i.e. distribution management (DM), risk management (RM), and decision-making strategies (DMS). The findings of this study show that the food safety, product quality, and associated economic benefits in dairy industry can be achieved through technological innovation, eradication of uncertainties, and introducing the global SCM practices into lean and green initiatives.</jats:p>"

Three modal shift scenarios, defined over a 15-year forecast period, combined with road efficiency improvements, inform the heavy goods vehicle fleet for different vehicle types to serve the estimated future road freight transport demand.Findings: The largest portion of South Africa’s high and growing transport demand will remain on long-distance road corridors. The impact can be moderated through the concurrent introduction of domestic intermodal solutions, performance-based standards in road freight transport and improved vehicle utilisation. This presupposes the prioritisation of collaborative initiatives between government, freight owners and logistics service providers.Research limitations: (1) The impact of short-distance urban movements on fleet numbers is not included yet. (2) Seasonality, which negatively influences bi-directional flows, is not taken into account owing to the annual nature of the macroeconomic data. (3) The methodology can be applied to other countries; the input data are however country-specific and findings can therefore not be generalised. (4) The future possibility of a reduction in absolute transport demand through, for example, reshoring have not been modelled yet.Practical implications: Provides impetus for the implementation of domestic intermodal solutions and road freight performance-based standards to mitigate the impact of growing freight transport demand.Societal implications: More efficient freight transport solutions will reduce national logistics costs and freight-related externalities.Originality: Develops a methodology for forecasting the heavy goods vehicle fleet within the context of total freight transport to inform government policy and industry actions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the market demand becomes more diversified and dynamic, the requirements for manufacturing systems feature a high degree of flexibility, low cost, low volume, and short delivery times. One emerging way for such flexible manufacturing is so-called “factory-in-a-box,” by which production modules are installed in a container and transported by a vehicle. The factory-in-a-box manufacturing poses a unique challenge to manufacturing supply chain network since the ease of supply chain reconfiguration when the vehicle moves to a different production site has become a major concern in addition to transportation cost and delivery time. The supply chain design is further complicated by the fact that it is coupled with subassembly planning in manufacturing, which determines appropriate subassembly modules assigned to suppliers. As such, it is critical to understand the interaction between supply chain network reconfigurability and subassembly planning. This paper develops a model using a set of decision variables to jointly characterize the topology of supply chain network and subassembly planning. A binary nonlinear programming model has been developed for the concurrent optimization of subassembly planning and supply chain network with the consideration of reconfiguration of the supply chain structure. One numerical case study was conducted to demonstrate the proposed model by providing a quantitative guideline of reconfiguring supply chain network when the final production site (on a vehicle) changes locations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s world competition, companies are always in search for new ways to improve the performance of their supply chain, and gather knowledge and skills to reduce time, improve quality and increase productivity. In recent years, Mongolian construction companies started to recognize the importance of supply chain. But there is a limited research and literature on the way how to successfully manage and measure the supply chain performance in Mongolia. The thesis addresses the theory and practice of factors affecting on supply chain performance on the sample of Mongolian construction companies. The study tries to define which factors influence on supply chain performance and which one has the most critical impact in the case construction companies. This study utilized 71 valid responses from 200 surveyed companies in the multiple regression analysis. The findings indicate that supply chain relationship significantly mediates information technology with supply chain performance, whereas environmental uncertainty negatively effects the performance. In addition, the results demonstrate that the supply chain relationship factor is the most critical predictor of supply chain performance. Hence, companies should control the supply chain and gain experience from their mistakes on every stage of supply chain process, and utilize the knowledge in the next phase.\r\nThe answers of suggested research questions are as follows. The first research question was with which factors can the performance of the supply chain in the construction companies be measured? The results show that information technology, supply chain relationship, environmental uncertainty have positive impact on supply chain performance. The second question was with which factors are most effective in influencing supply chain performance. The results reveals that the most critical factor influencing supply chain performance in Mongolia is supply chain relationship. Since there was no formal information about supply chain performance in Mongolia, this study gives considerable information about supply chain performance in Mongolian companies. Also, it contributed to the limited research on supply chain system in Mongolia and tries to develop a framework for the relationship between affected factors and supply chain performance in case of Mongolian companies. Consequently, it provides insight for experts who would invest in supply chain systems. The result of this study pointed out critical factors for supply chain performance that claim more consideration from managers and engineers to implement supply chain performance successfully.\r\nThe results of this paper reveal that companies should start the planning stage with a plan detailing the supply chain from it indicators that needed to evaluate success. Without clarifying supply chain desired it companies would not be aware that whether they implementing successfully or not. Without clear indicators and adequate parameters, it is impossible to measure supply chain. Supply chain relationship is proved that it has the strongest influence on supply chain performance. This result asserts the assessment of existing supply chain relationship is required for reaping supply chain performance. Assessments of existing supply chain relationship includes assessing whether the company has supply relation team, building stronger relationships will bring extra security because collaboration with customers and suppliers demonstrates understanding, concern and the desire to work with them over the longer term. Supply chain practitioners continue to press managers to form closer, longer-term relationships between customers and fewer suppliers as the only response to increasing market sophistication and globalization.</jats:p>",

The globalization of competition, the reduce in product life cycle, time depending competition and quick exchanges make the firms think about re-designing their supply chains. With the view of these evolutions, firms decided that they must use information technologies in their SCM. \r\nIn future, information flow will be the key factor to determine the levels and the difference between firms. Information flow occurs with the integration of information technologies with the systems. The success factor for a firm is to add value from gathering, operating and dispatching information and develop the work model to have this value. Processing this model depends on achieving information sharing between supply chain members.\r\nInformation sharing is a critical factor between supply chain members. The data shared between supply chain members becomes useful information for the members.\r\nSo, determining the shared data and measuring this share is an important issue. This study includes information sharing measurement model between integrated supply chain members. The model starts with gathering data with a survey and continues converting these quantitative data’s to qualitative data’s by structured equations. The qualitative data’s used in an artificial intelligence method, inductive learning. Rules extraction is made by an inductive learning method, RULESX. With these rules, information sharing among supply chain members can be measured and suggestions can be made to firms for improving their SCM’s. This model is sector-independent and can be easily applied.</jats:p>",

As environmentally sensitive consumers press for water-friendly products, freshwater resources’ preservation has emerged as a major challenge for leading corporations that are incorporating water management initiatives into their social responsibility agendas to foster the sustainability of their supply chain networks. With respect to the scientific community, although research on water footprint assessment is increasing rapidly, the lack of a systemic integration of the water footprint aspect into the whole spectrum of the supply chain operations is evident. In this context, this Special Issue focuses on the investigation of the impact of water stewardship policies on water use and scarcity minimisation, sustainability performance and supply chain configuration.</jats:p>"

Following on labour’s heels will be issues such as e-commerce, high volumes of single-item orders and a lack of end-to-end supply chain visibility. Cumulatively, these issues are making life difficult for supply chain and logistics managers that at the same time are being asked to do more with less. Currently there is also a lot going on ‘under the covers’ of the typical logistics operation. Innovative technology, Industry 4.0, and overall digital transformation are all working to change the way supply chains are designed and utilised. While some leading-edge companies are investing in and benefitting from these innovations, many more are using antiquated methods and dated strategies (eg manual systems, spreadsheets and manual processes in the warehouse and yard), to run their supply chains. ‘As markets demand not only efficiency but agility and flexibility from supply chains, next-generation models are successfully combining automation and digital technologies to drive superior performance’, MHI reports ‘While this digital ecosystem is creating cost savings, innovation, and win-win opportunities along supply chains, it is also accelerating the pace of change, creating disruption and raising competitive pressures’.2 In this paper, we explore the use and applicability of autonomous vehicles and drones — computer-guided vehicles that can move without the need for human control, either on the ground, in a vehicle or in the air — to more effectively and efficiently manage digital inventory; show how one retailer is using drones to improve its digital inventory management; and explain how such technologies are being used to improve operational efficiencies, reallocate resources and improve employee safety in warehouses, yards, and stores.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent past, multiphase power generation, power transmission, and electrical drive system are the main focus of research due to their several advantages over three phase. Multiphase drives have better performance over three-phase drives. A multiphase transformer is required at the input of a fixed frequency multiphase drive, rectifier circuit for HVDC applications and multiphase generation and transmission systems. This paper investigates a static three to seven phase conversion technique and presents a design of transformer and control strategy to analyze the effect of unbalanced supply on a three phase to seven phase transformer. The transformer so designed takes three phase as input and seven phase output is obtained at the secondary terminals. The paper also discusses input-output unbalancing. A complete design, analysis, simulation of the proposed technique and experimental validation is presented in this paper. Experimental and simulation results prove that the presented design produced a seven-phase from a tree-phase ac power. Input unbalance is reflected to output but is less than the input unbalance. A seven phase output is not produced if one phase of input is open and the transformer has more than three limbs for flux to flow. A balanced seven phase output in steady state is produced even in one phase open condition for a three limb core type transformer. A new definition of sequence components of an unbalanced seven phase system is defined in this paper.</jats:p>"

However, highly desirable network effects lead to one company monopoly over the whole marketplace. To prevent this effect, authors are proposing and devising a decentralized agent-based electronic marketplace for supply chain ecosystem. The goal of our research is to improve overall supply chain service quality by allowing companies’ agents to evaluate the service quality of their partners through the history of their transactions. Consequently, since in their procurement activities more informed decisions are being made instantaneously, continuously and autonomously at each node of a supply chain, supply chain service quality is being improved along the whole supply chain.</jats:p>",

The study, among other things, established that most frequent activities are those implemented in the area of product policy, while the least frequent activities are those implemented in the line of producer-supplier activities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Flemish Pass is a region off the coast of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in which large oil discoveries have been made in recent years, making it a promising site for future offshore oil and gas developments. The site is located approximately 200 kilometers North-East of the currently producing Jeanne D’Arc Basin. This results in some additional challenges, including: higher waves and rougher seas on average, longer transit time from shore to any potential production facilities, and an increased risk of sea ice. Crew transfers from Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs) to current production platforms offshore Newfoundland and Labrador are typically accomplished with a FROG-6 personnel-transfer capsule lifted by a platform-board crane. In current practice, for fixed platforms, this is only done when there is a Significant Wave Height (Hs) of 4.0 m or less, regardless of the OSV being used. In the winter months, this general-purpose approach does not allow for an acceptably high operational fraction of time in which crew transfers could be completed in the Flemish Pass.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The FROG-6 capsule has designated operational limits based on the relative velocity between the capsule and the vessel deck, which will vary based on ship size, loading condition, and sea-state. Considering this, a series of geometrically similar OSV hull forms are created to represent the range of currently operating vessels. The developed models are between 70.0–90.0 m long, have a maximum breadth between 17.0–22.0 m, and block coefficients ranging from 0.65–0.79. Using ShipMo3D, a potential flow / panel code seakeeping solver, a 20 minute time history of ship motions is determined for all the modelled OSVs, across the range of sea-states realistically expected in the Flemish Pass. Then, a MATLAB script is used to transform these motions into deck velocities. From these results, the operational limits for crew transfer can be re-defined as a function of ship size, loading condition, and sea-state. This results in higher operability percentages than those achieved from using the flat wave height limit alone, with relatively large variations between differently sized and loaded ships. Further work must be done to officially implement new limits, such as: analysis of additional wave period and height combinations, further analysis of the time between limit exceedances, computational fluid dynamics simulations, “smart crane” modelling, and/or full scale sea trials.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Trust is an essential governance mechanism in present-day supply networks, where many independent parties have to coordinate their activities. It is often assumed that trustful behavior at least partly depends on the inner dispositions of actors. Other theories suggest that this behavior is an emergent property of the supply network, generated by the interactions between the actors in the network. Half a century ago, the social figuration theory of Norbert Elias was the first formulation of such a theory. This research tests this emergent property theory in a series of simulation-based thought experiments. A generic agent-based model of buyer-supplier interactions in a build-to-forecast supply chain is used as a dynamic hypothesis to test this theory. The inner dispositions of the actors towards trust and opportunistic behavior can be changed here. Current trust levels are influenced by these inner dispositions, but are also changed by the perceived behavior of the other party. Trust levels of the actors also determine their behavior. In the simulation this creates vicious or virtuous cycles of mutual trust and performance, so called relationship spirals. Model analysis shows that beyond a certain level of external volatility, the development of trust on both sides no longer bears any direct relation to the inner dispositions of the network parties. This confirms the dynamic hypothesis. It also again establishes the strength of Elias’s original social figuration theory.</jats:p>",

I use a unique data set of weekly gasoline prices across 44 Canadian cities to analyze how the existence of variation in the available modes of transportation for gasoline between cities (via pipeline, marine tanker, rail or truck) accounts for observed price differences across locations. I find that the supply network is significant – cities connected by lower cost-per-unit methods like pipelines or seaports exhibit smaller mean- and weekly-price differences than those connected only by road or rail, after controlling for distance, regional effects and market size. A pipeline connection results in a reduction in weekly price dispersion equivalent to a 53% reduction in distance between cities, while a maritime connection has the equivalent effect of a 38% reduction in distance between cities.</jats:p>",

Resilience is the outcome of fully integrating a proactive, enterprise-wide, multidisciplinary and holistic risk management approach into the organisation’s business management processes. Resilience is an aspirational objective — there is no endpoint, nor is there a one-size-fits-all solution. Resilient organisations promote an inclusive culture of risk thinking throughout the organisation and its supply chain. By integrating a proactive approach to managing risk, organisations can become more agile, adaptable and responsive to changes in their operating environment.</jats:p>"

They work in a situation with: non-stationary probabilistic demand; production capacity in regular hours and overtime; shortage leads to lost sales; limited internal storage space; and ordering costs resulting from machine preparation are negligible. In the first approach, we consider the problem as linear and deterministic. In the second, safety inventories are used to fill a probabilistic demand, but the possibility of stockout is not considered. The third approach estimates shortage resulting from demand uncertainty. The last two approaches use iterative processes to re-estimate unit holding cost, which is the basis to calculate safety inventories in each period of the horizon. Using Microsoft Excel Solver, with linear programming and nonlinear search functions, a hypothetical example (but strongly based on real-life companies) and some scenarios permit concluding that developing more realistic and complex models may not provide significant benefits.</jats:p>"

However, measurement by LC-OCD is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, continuous measurement of biopolymer concentration by LC-OCD is not feasible. For this reason, we have not been able to monitor biopolymer continuously and control membrane fouling. The purpose of this study is to find a new fouling index (FR) to control membrane fouling without measuring the biopolymer concentration. Then, we tried to find a correlation between biopolymer and other water components by a multiple regression analysis. As the result, we have suggested the new fouling index (FR) which consists of the sum of the fluorescence intensity within the Region III domain measured by excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon measured by the total organic carbon (TOC) measurement. TOC and EEM are measured easily and continuously. Thus, we can control membrane fouling by monitoring the FR continuously.</jats:p>",

Therefore the so called Cellular Approach is combined with the approach of Agent-Based Modelling.Design / Research methods: The model is built as a bottom-up approach for integral load management. Thus, supply factors such as limitations in generation are integrated directly and display flexibility. Thereby each market participant has its own economic interest. By the use of specific behaviour patterns and learning effects each agent in the model can act individually. This enables the market model to simulate how actors behave in changing situations. Conclusions / findings: The model shown in this paper provides an alternative to considerations of energy supply systems via equation-based optimization models. The combination of these two approaches enhances to observe two central aspects of the German energy turnaround, decentralisation and the consumers changing role at the energy market. Originality / value of the article: The Cellular Approach offers potential benefits for integrating renewable energy sources in regional power supply. Often discussed on a technical level, this paper focuses on the economical side of this topic. Moreover, differing to other research activities usually using optimization techniques, an Agent-Based Model is formulated to simulate a regional energy market. In the combination of a supply system primarily based on renewable energy sources and enhanced with different types of energy storage it is possible to simulate a supply system of the future.</jats:p>"

By introducing entropy to calculate the transportation concealment degree, we investigate the issue about concealed military supply transportation on the whole road network and propose an optimal flow distribution model. This model’s objective function is to maximize the concealment of military supply transportation. After analyzing the road network, classifying different nodes, summarizing the constraint conditions based on the properties and assumptions in the transportation process, and combining the general parameter limits, the optimal flow distribution model is further transformed into a calculable non-linear programming model. Thus, based on this non-linear programming model, we can obtain the optimal distribution scheme of military supply transportation from the perspectives of network analysis and concealment measurement. Lastly, an example of military supply transportation in Jiangsu province, China is illustrated to prove the feasibility of the proposed model. The managerial implication is that by utilizing the proposed flow distribution model, military supplies can be efficiently transported to the required destinations based on maximizing the concealment degree. Not only this model can be utilized in the real military supply transportation, it can be also applied in other transportation fields which require time efficiency and concealment.</jats:p>"

PSV model allows considering the influence of cargo spaces on the main characteristics and operational parameters of the ship. It covers the main design aspects of PSVs: general arrangement; lines plan; resistance in open water and ice; engine and propeller characteristics; hydrostatics; capacity and mass calculation. The pseudo-optimal tactical planning algorithm is intended to build the plan of voyages and to set the size of fleet considering the structure of cargo flow.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As the test example, we examine a task of servicing the group of platforms in the Kara Sea. The case study shows that cargo flow structure has a high influence on the efficiency of PSVs in case of high-load operation; while a widespread “deck-cargo” approach is unable to consider this aspect because it ignores the vessel’s carrying capacity and payload. The conclusion about a higher efficiency of PSV compared to AHTS with the same displacement was drawn.</jats:p>",

Microorganisms can be treated by disinfection processes or by inducing a biofilm, but particulate matter can only be easily removed with effective storage tank design parameters. In this study, therefore, the effects of rainwater tank design parameters on the treatment of particulate contaminants are analyzed. The J-type inlet pipe seems to maintain stable rainwater quality by suppressing the resuspension of bottom sediments during rainfall inflow. The intermediate wall can prevent sediment from spreading to the whole storage tank, and provide functions such as securing the stable water quality of the outflow area and managing sediment flow to the inflow region. The baffles can simplify tank management such as sediment drainage and tank cleaning by leading to more sedimentation of particles in the unit area. Based on the water quality monitoring results of pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), and turbidity at the field scale, it is possible to supply a certain quality of water by optimizing tank design parameters alone even if particulate contaminants flow into the rainwater tank.</jats:p>",

To ensure both China’s present and the future energy supply, it is essential to evaluate and forecast the energy supply level. However, forecasting the energy supply security level is difficult because energy supply security is dynamic, many factors affect it and there is a lack of accurate and comprehensive data. Therefore, based on previous studies and according to the characteristics of energy supply and the social development of China, first, the authors apply a comprehensive evaluation method to quantify the energy supply security. Second, based on the ARIMA-XGBoost hybrid model, the authors create two novel approaches for forecasting the energy supply security level of China. The authors find that: (1) energy supply security is dynamic, and green development has become the theme of China’s energy development. The energy industry urgently needs to provide more high-quality ecological energy products to meet the people’s desire for a beautiful ecological environment; (2) since the mean absolute percentage errors are below 4.5% when forecasting the energy supply security indicators, the ARIMA-XGBoost hybrid model is more accurate for forecasting China’s energy supply security level and (3) the security level of China’s energy supply has developed periodic features; the ESSI can improve by about 0.2 every five years, but, due to the low starting point and multiple types of constraints, it is difficult to reach the safety level in a short time.</jats:p>"

We consider a two-stage scenario where, at the beginning of stage 1, the supplier reserves production capacity based on historic data in advance, stage 2 comes to us after some leadtime, both the supplier and the retailer update the demand information, the retailer then places an order not exceeding the reserved capacity based on the selling-pricing discount dependent demand. We make optimal decisions on the reserved capacity in stage 1, selling price discount and order quantity in stage 2. In this supply chain, the pattern in stage 2 is figured out first, and then stage 1 is cleared as well. Then we present a numerical example to give some insights.

Scientific data on the course and location of arteries participating in the blood supply of the umbilical region are summarized. Particular attention is devoted to the description of superficial, superior and inferior epigastric arteries and umbilical arteries. The issues of intervascular connections between the named arteries and other blood vessels are discussed including information on various anastomosis variations and their extent. Various existing viewpoints regarding the location and depth of anastomoses between the vessels essential for blood supply of the umbilical region are presented as well as the layers, through which the main arteries pass, and the character and level of their branching. Features of arterial blood supply of the umbilical region in newborns are also noted. The paper contains data on the role of umbilical arteries in the umbilical region supply in children of that age. It is demonstrated that blood supply of the umbilical region in newborns still poses issues that are insufficiently researched and solved, such as assessing functional capacity of the umbilical arteries, revealing histotopographic peculiarities in the location of blood vessels within the layers and various segments of the umbilical region, topographic and anatomic identification of the segments that are most and least supplied with arterial vessels in that part of the abdominal wall.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The US truckload transportation market, like many markets, can be characterised as an ongoing rebalancing between supply and demand — or in this case, the number of trucks (and drivers) to haul goods and the demand for those trucks to meet current market demand. This creates a cycle that swings from relative capacity shortage, where there is more demand relative to supply which drives market rates higher, to relative capacity surplus, where there is more supply available relative to demand which drives rates lower. The term ‘relative’ is an important one as the simultaneous rate of change on both sides of the marketplace ultimately drives market rate activity. But as this article will go on to describe, the simultaneous rates of change in supply and demand are rarely in a state of relative equilibrium. It is this dynamic that creates a recurring pricing cycle observed to display at least some level of consistency and can therefore be used to predict the future — but only if you understand the past and the present. In other words, the US truckload market operates as a machine with certain mechanical properties that tend to produce similar outputs given similar inputs. The real world is governed by economic and geopolitical uncertainty, shifting technology and regulatory landscapes, and human psychology that often drives irrational behaviour, so those mechanical properties and input signals can be exceedingly difficult to separate from the noise. However, with enough historical transaction data, market visibility, and insight, this paper proposes that it can be done; the past can be used to predict the future with at least some level of directional certainty, as long as the fundamental structure of the marketplace remains intact.</jats:p>"

They also create new compliance risks and bring added competitive pressures to the market. The overall prominence and impact FTAs have on global trade have drastically increased in the last 20 years. The utopia of a worldwide market with no barriers, no customs and no constraints, as dreamed by the World Trade Organization (WTO), is no more. The balance of power in geo-politics, and popular rejection of an uncontrolled mundialisation, have replaced that dream with an explosion in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements throughout the world (see Figure 1 for a glimpse of preferential agreements available for the EU). With this proliferation of agreements, how does a company set in motion the changes needed to leverage these FTAs; including the preparation, process changes, risk assessment and supplier/product qualifications? And they must do this while also having to cope with the ever-changing sourcing, manufacturing and selling strategies dictated by a truly global environment, with developed and emerging markets both crucial to business success. It is like jumping on a train while it is moving at 100 kmh. The response is obvious: with dedicated resources, processes and software automation, integrating preferential origin into the whole value chain, gaining strategic competitive advantage — and margin basis points — through every step of the way.</jats:p>"

The electrical energy was generated and transmitted through multiple substations to our customers, and the demand for electricity by the customers is dependent on the price of electricity. In the study, we considered the transmission and the distribution costs which depend on the capacities of power generation, transmission rates and distances between stations. We utilized the inventory theory to develop our model and proposed a procedure to derive an optimal solution for this problem.

Ensemble precipitation forecasts can take uncertainties under consideration, so they have been a research topic for improving reservoir operations. In this paper, a rainfall–runoff model, combined of a multiple linear regression model (for non-flood seasons) and the Xinanjiang model (for flood seasons), for inflow forecasts and a stochastic dynamic programming model for reservoir operations are developed in order to effectively use the ensemble precipitation forecast. To explore the best way for using the ensemble precipitation forecast, two post-processing techniques, i.e., ensemble forecast averaging (EFA) and interval value (IV), are tested. The ensemble precipitation forecast from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was chosen due to its high accuracy, and the Huanren reservoir, located in China, was used to test the newly developed models. The results show that, compared with the traditional rule curve, hydropower generation increases by 4.86% and 4.55%, respectively, when EFA and IV are used, which indicates that the use of ensemble forecasts facilitates considerable improvements in operating performance.</jats:p>",

However, purchasing fruit companies are suffering from the effects of fluctuations in production and demand, inefficiency in production and information trade, lack of understanding of the dynamics of supply and reduction in profitability for all members of the fruit production chain. The supply chain management has been touted as one of the ways to reduce this volatility and improve outcomes for all involved with the supply chain. However, results of recent researches do not relate it directly to the fruit industry. To solve this problem, the present research aimed to analyze the planning and management of the supply chain of a fruit purchasing company and identify contributions and improvements to the theories and methods related to supply chain management to propose a method for planning and management the supply chain of fruit purchasing companies. It was conducted a case study from a mango fruit purchasing company using interviews with industry experts to assess the applicability, functionality and usefulness from the managerial point of view of the proposed method. Data analysis was done through the cross analysis of the methods of the supply chain management and the description of the case. The results of the study allowed the development of a method for planning and management the supply chain of fruit purchasing company. With the proposition of this method is expected to contribute with a sequence of steps to assist in planning and management of supply chain managers and specialists from a fruit purchasing company.</jats:p>"

Initially, the load gets power supply from the reliable source (such as solar photovoltaic), if in case it is unavailable, then the proposed modules automatically switch over to the next reliable source (such as AC mains), and so on. If in case all proposed renewable energy sources (RESs) are unavailable than the proposed mod-ule automatically switch over to the local grid supply, if suppose the local grid supply is also unavailable then the proposed module au-tomatically switch over to the power storage bank. Therefore, the proposed intelligent/smart power module can improve the system per-formance and efficiency. The programming instruction of controller, the relay driver switches appropriate relay of sources to maintain uninterruptable power supply to the proposed utility of capacity 0.1kW. The proposed back-up system gets charged from the available reliable RESs with no pollution and noise, and it can also reduce the electricity bill.

Although, the high production capacity, half of the vegetables and fruits are lost during the supply chain processes from farmer to the end consumer because of the long and complex structure of the supply chain. At the same time the current supply chain structure leads to huge gaps between producer and consumer prices. The aim of this study is to determine the structure of the fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain in Turkey and develop alternative supply chain forms to prevent the “price differences” and “product losses” from farmer to the final consumer. The study included descriptive analyses with secondary data as well as literature review. In addition, this study emphasizes the asymmetric power relationship in the agricultural supply chain. The asymmetric power relationship is explained by the price differences between the farmer and the final consumer. The research findings suggest that the transition from the existing multi-intermediated supply chain to the non-intermediated model must be done in a gradual way and through strengthening of the farmers.</jats:p>"

Considering the complex relationship between online and offline retail channels, this paper proposes a competitive–cooperative strategy based on altruistic behavior for the dual-channel supply chain, by applying the theory of the co-competition game. First, we introduce the problem with respect to the relationship between online and offline retail channels, and establish the competitive–cooperative strategy model based on altruistic behavior. Then, we prove the equilibrium strategy for existence and stability of the proposed model through mathematical deduction. Next, a multi-object optimal model is excluded by applying the Pareto principle, and the NSGA-II-based algorithm is obtained to acquire the Nash equilibrium point. Finally, we present the case testing results, which indicate that the proposed model is robust and can improve the channel efficiency of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sufficient and uninterrupted electricity supply is one of the main factors to develop the country. Today, electricity can be generated using a variety of sources, whether from non-renewable sources as well as renewable resources. To generate electrical power, Malaysia can't rely entirely on non-renewable resources such as petroleum and coal as these are finite resources which are experiencing depletion around the world. Electricity generated from renewable sources such as water, particularly from micro hydropower systems is considered the cheapest and most environmentally friendly source of electrical energy. Based on the reconnaissance study conducted, the streams of flowing water in Gua Kelam have the potential to yield about 34.29 kW of electricity power, based on the head height of 27 m and flow rate 0.216 m3/s. In this paper, a model for an ordinary micro hydropower facility has been proposed. It links various electromechanical equipment consisting of a hydraulic turbine governor, and a synchronous generator. The modeling was executed to design a micro hydropower system as an alternative source of supply of electricity to Gua Kelam, Perlis. The proposed model was tested by placing a three-phase fault to earth for the purpose of testing the reliability of the system. With the selection of an appropriate control system, the proposed model is very suitable for the development of micro hydropower system at a potential site such as Gua Kelam.</jats:p>"

Given that most relevant literature still focus on the descriptive aspect of GSC, we adopt game theoretic approach rather than qualitative analysis method to address the following problems: (1) How can the integration of environmental and economic sustainability goals be achieved in GSC? (2) What is the impact of customer environmental awareness on the green level and profitability of the GSC? (3) How does the market demand changes in the presence of the online direct channel in addition to the traditional one? We establish four game models, which are decentralized scenario, centralized scenario, retailer-led revenue-sharing scenario and bargaining revenue-sharing scenario. In the decentralized scenario, participants in a GSC make individual decisions based on their specific interests. In the centralized scenario, the GSC is regarded as a whole and the participants make collective decisions to maximize the overall profit of the GSC. In addition, in the two revenue-sharing scenarios, revenue-sharing contracts as the important profit coordination systems are set up and the revenue-sharing ratio is determined either by the retailer or through bargaining. Moreover, the cost of green product research and development, customer environmental awareness and price sensitivity are also taken into account in the four scenarios. By comparing and analyzing the four game models, we recommend the two revenue-sharing scenarios as the optimum choice and improving green awareness as a feasible strategy to achieve the integration of economic and environmental goals of the GSC. Additionally, we find that online sales has become a major distribution channel of the GSC.</jats:p>"

The present study is focused on the effect of the grain size distribution of the particles of the aquifer material on its permeability. In order to investigate variation of permeability with respect to the grain size distribution, experimental investigations are conducted on natural borehole samples and those prepared by mixing borehole samples with known quantities of marble chips within a laminar flow regime. A power function model is developed for the estimation of permeability based on grain size distribution parameters σ (standard deviation) and D50 (median grain size). The results from the developed model show good agreement with experimental data as the values of R2, RMSE and MAE for the model are (0.99, 0.007, 0.005) for 5.08 cm dia., (0.99, 0.005, 0.004) for 10.16 cm dia. and (0.97, 0.004, 0.003) for 15.24 cm dia. permeameters respectively. The developed power function model provides an efficient tool to estimate the yield of wells, seepage below earthen structures and design of filters with reasonable accuracy.</jats:p>",

For decades we assumed that most human diets provide an adequate Ins supply, but newer evidence suggests that increasing Ins intake ameliorates several disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome, poor sperm development and retinopathy of prematurity. Proposed explanations often suggest functional enhancement of minor facets of Ins Biology such as insulin signalling through putative inositol-containing ‘mediators’, but offer no explanation for this selectivity. It is more likely that eating extra Ins corrects a deficiency of an abundant Ins-containing cell constituent, probably phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). Much of a cell’s PtdIns is in ER membranes, and an increase in ER membrane synthesis, enhancing the ER’s functional capacity, is often an important part of cell responses to ER stress. This review: (a) reinterprets historical information on Ins deficiency as describing a set of events involving a failure of cells adequately to adapt to ER stress; (b) proposes that in the conditions that respond to dietary Ins there is an overstretching of Ins reserves that limits the stressed ER’s ability to make the ‘extra’ PtdIns needed for ER membrane expansion; and (c) suggests that eating Ins supplements increases the Ins supply to Ins-deficient and ER-stressed cells, allowing them to make more PtdIns and to expand the ER membrane system and sustain ER functions.</jats:p>",

The potential for rapid adoption of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, specifically silicon carbide (SiC), highlights a need to understand the drivers of location-specific manufacturing cost, global supply chains, and plant location decisions. Further, ongoing research and investment, necessitates analytical analysis to help inform the roadmap of SiC technologies. In collaboration with PowerAmerica the project explores the bottoms-up cost analysis of wafers, devices, modules, and variable frequency motor drives at the anticipated manufacturing levels. Leveraging these models, it outlines how the cost reduction potential of proposed research advances can be quantified.</jats:p>",

From production inefficiencies to supply chain disruptions, management recognizes the need to rapidly evolve their family business to a professionally managed one. Their relationship-based supply chain worked for a family firm, but will this approach continue to work as they expand rapidly? A disruption in their egg supply exposed the firm to risks they never anticipated. Now, they are rethinking their entire supply chain, including their most important raw material: flour. How can they strategically manage their raw material needs while sustaining double-digit growth? How do they identify and mitigate risks in their chain? King’s Hawaiian knows its success is in its supply chain, including their unique delivery model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper develops a model to analyze inter-organizational technology adoption in a supply chain. While the basic model is general, this study is motivated by several cases of inter-organizational technology adoption in supply chains. The proposed model in this study considers firms on both levels of the supply chain, namely, supplier firms and buyer firms. These individual firms’ thresholds for adoption should be considered by other firms’ decisions within a network, together with their own organizational attributes. The heterogeneity across the population should be allowed. That is, individual firms make a decision for adopting the technology at different times due to their different network sizes, prior beliefs, and amounts of information observed. The main finding is that this uncertainty decreases as other suppliers adopt the technology, and information about their experiences becomes available. In addition, at any given time, an estimate of the benefit to a supplier depends on the number of supplier firms and on the number of buyer firms that have already adopted the technology. Thus, we seek to capture this dependence and analyze its effect on the adoption of a new inter-organizational technology. The next step is to embed the firm-level adoption model into a population model. The model includes various types of heterogeneity in the population model to capture the factors affecting the speed of diffusion. This allows us to derive an adoption curve that is specified by the accumulated fraction of firms that have adopted the technology in or before any given period. The population model allows us to consider the effect of several strategies observed in practice and numerical experiments yielding many managerial implications in this area.</jats:p>"

Sampling sites were selected from the lake, Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works and critical points in the distribution system. The spatial variations of trihalomethanes and selected water quality parameters were investigated for 15 sampling points in 5 sampling campaigns to assess suitability for drinking. All trihalomethane species were measured, namely chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform. Only chloroform and bromodichloromethane were detected. The study confirmed that there is trihalomethanes formation in the Harare water distribution system and that it is affected by the residence time and presence of organic matter in the system. However, the levels of trihalomethanes are generally within the levels suggested by the World Health Organization. Only bromodichloromethane presents a risk for long-term exposure as it had levels that exceeded the limit for long-term exposure suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Bromodichloromethane, turbidity and free residual chlorine levels were not suitable for drinking in some of the zones. Boosting of chlorine residuals is necessary especially in areas with free chlorine less than 0.2 mg/L. Injection of ammonia, periodic cleaning of storage reservoirs, and flushing of lines will reduce trihalomethanes formation.</jats:p>",

What constitutes these transactions has been narrowed down by the CJEU to the function of ‘having the effect of transferring funds and entail changes in the legal and financial character’. This has reduced the opportunity for intermediaries in the supply chain to benefit from the exemption. On 21 March 2018, the Advocate General (AG) handed down his Opinion in DPAS Limited (DPAS) (Case C-5/17), whose conclusions appear to potentially narrow down even further any scope for exemption as regards transactions concerning payments or transfers. According to the AG, the exemption should not apply to a provider that ‘only’ instructs banks to transfer sums of money insofar as it constitutes a ‘mere physical, technical or administrative service’ that is not covered by the exemption. In this article, the author analyses the AG Opinion and provides some alternate views in light of previous case law.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

They analyze the economic interests, motives and goals of the heads of commercial companies that transform non-cash into cash. The current taxes regime is used to compare the financial losses of the working capital of a commercial company whose head has the task of transforming non-cash money into cash. They study the criminal demand for the unaccounted cash and its supply and formulate the concept of «entrepreneurial insolvency». The authors also argue for the possibility of a total abandonment of cash in the shortest possible time. They present a critical evaluation of the criminal schemes where sham companies offer unaccounted cash and show the role of commercial banks and the Bank of Russia in counteracting such criminal business practices. The authors have also compiled an overview of research publications on this topic that include the works of Russian legal scholars and economists. At the same time, they examine the positions of authors from the USA, Kazakhstan, Italy, Ukraine, Belarus and Turkmenistan. They analyze the current Russian constitutional, civil, banking and tax legislation as well as the normative base of the social and pension insurance. It is argued that the transformation of non-cash money into cash is a real fictitious deal not named in the legislation; it is concluded between juridical persons as a cover-up for illegal actions. These actions are initiated by the head of a commercial company who is motivated by mercenary interests and carries out a criminal intent in an organized group with a prior agreement.</jats:p>",

As part of Techkem Water's corporate social responsibility initiatives, mobile ultrafiltration membrane water treatment systems were deployed to provide emergency drinking water supplies to flood victims. Four types of mobile system were evaluated in this case study. The operational parameters of the systems such as feed water turbidity, system capacity, filtrate quality, filtration flux, footprint required and specific energy requirement details are presented. Each system has distinctive features that help to accommodate different site conditions.</jats:p>",

There are numerous studies that approach both perspectives, but there are still many questions about their relationship, mostly in the agri-food industry. Hence, this paper aims to address the influence of collaboration initiatives on the sustainability indicators of the cashew supply chain (SC). To reach this objective, a case study was performed among farmers belonging to the Cooperative of Cashews in the Piauí state (COCAJUPI), a local cooperative in Northern Brazil. Attending to the results, it is possible to state that the collaboration initiatives that have higher levels of implementation among research companies are the “trust among supply chain members” and the “sharing of standards information”. Moreover, the size of companies in the cashew SC does not influence the level of implementation of collaboration initiatives. The findings of this study demonstrate that the farms’ area of the companies from the cashew SC does not have a significant influence on their sustainability indicators. Furthermore, a weak relationship exists between the collaboration initiatives and the indicators associated to the three dimensions of sustainability.</jats:p>"

The scope of the research was maximized on pharmaceutical warehouse operations and drug distribution to clinics. This research did not focus on cost, profit, lead time, and procurement costs. This system was built using PHP programming language and MySQL database. System development process used waterfall method. It consisted of requirement analysis, system analysis, design, development, and testing. The test system used the xampp 6.2 servers with a black box testing method that involved the pharmaceutical warehouse staff as the end user. The results demonstrate technologies that can be used by physicians to submit drug requests faster and report on real-time drug use (LPLPO). For pharmaceutical warehouses, this system is useful for drug availability, drug management, and response information. This technology can help the health department to perform its role as a supervisory or controlling function (internal controls) of the drugs. This research also gives a recommendation for the pharmaceutical warehouse management in providing benefits for the institutions/companies involved.

Based on analyses of the spatiotemporal characteristics of total water utilization, the factors that influenced changes in industrial water utilization in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2003 to 2016 were studied using a factor decomposition model. The results show that the scaling effect (SCE) increased water utilization by 31.78 billion m3 over those 13 years and was the only driving effect that caused industrial water utilization to increase. The structural effect (STE) and technological effect (TEE) reduced industrial water utilization by 14.93 and 20.44 billion m3, respectively. The TEE was the main reason for the decrease in industrial water utilization in Beijing, accounting for a reduction of 96.5% in total industrial water utilization. The STE was stronger than TEE in Tianjin, with associated decreases of 94.65% and 90.1% in total industrial water utilization, respectively. In Hebei, the STE and TEE reduced total industrial water utilization by 60.23% and 85.46%, respectively. Adjusting the industrial structure and promoting water-saving technology are efficient methods of alleviating the water shortage in the study area.</jats:p>",

However, the seasonal availability of the raw materials, high maintenance cost, and high logistical cost of the biomass energy supply chain are the main factors impeding the commercialization and large-scale-production of this energy source. Furthermore, research focusing on an environmental or green supply chain network design of cellulosic butanol has been insufficient. This study focused on designing a green supply chain network for cellulosic butanol. A life cycle analysis was integrated into a multi-objective linear programming model to optimize the cellulosic butanol supply chain network. With the objectives of maximizing the economic profits and minimizing the greenhouse gas emissions, the proposed model can optimize the location and size of a bio-butanol production plant. The mathematical model was applied to a case study in the state of Missouri, and solved the tradeoff between the feedstock and market availabilities of sorghum stem bio-butanol.</jats:p>"

The findings revealed that weak enforcement of the regulations governing compliance to standard weights and measures, weak extension services that failed to provide reliable market information to farmers, lack of negotiation skills among smallholder farmers against local brokers / traders coupled with inadequate market infrastructure with appropriate weights and measure facilities provide incentives for local brokers and traders to exploit smallholder farmers.

Integrating emerging IoT into the current ICT systems can be unique because of its intelligence, autonomous and pervasive applications. However, research on the IoT adoption in supply chain domain is scarce and acceptance of the IoT into the retail services in specific has been overly rhetoric. This study is drawn upon the organisational capability theory for developing an empirical model considering the effect of IoT capabilities on multiple dimensions of supply chain process integration, and in turn improves supply chain performance as well as organisational performance. Cross-sectional survey data from 227 Australian retail firms was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results indicate that IoT capability has a positive and significant effect on internal, customer-, and supplier-related process integration that in turn positively affects supply chain performance and organisational performance. Theoretically, the study contributes to a body of knowledge that integrates information systems research into supply chain integration by establishing an empirical evidence of how IoT-enabled process integration can enhance the performance at both supply chain and organisational level. Practically, the results inform the managers of the likely investment on IoT that can lead to chain’s performance outcome.</jats:p>"

Focusing on energy-producing technologies, such as pyrolysis or gasification, the present work assessed the amount of vegetal biomass that may be used as fuel, both in terms of actual availability and supply price, in the Province of Rieti (Italy). The aim is to draw up a supply plan that has an intrinsic relationship with the local area. The results confirmed a production of 24 MW of project thermal power and 4 MW of project electric power. The ensuing plant was then studied following current norms about renewable energy, environmental consistency, and atmospheric emissions. An economic analysis of the cost investment was also carried out, where the total return is approximately of 19%. The results exposed that plant costs are acceptable only if short-supply chain fuel is purchased. The costs of generating energy from agroforestry biomass are certainly higher; however, the plant represents a significant territorial opportunity, especially for the economic sectors of agriculture and forestry. The employment effect plays a central role in the concession process, which is relevant for the interaction among renewable energy production and agriculture. The environmental impact of a biomass plant from agroforestry residues can be measured exclusively on atmospheric emissions: the plant must be placed in industrial areas without any landscape or naturalistic value.</jats:p>"

This has included appointing someone with experience in the private house building industry, investigating the establishment of a local authority housing company and setting up a communications programme to spread positive messages about home building locally. Issues affecting the build out of new homes start early in the development process and there is rarely a single reason for delays.

This paper addresses the latter issue, which has traditionally proven intractable to analytical modeling. Apart from reviewing some research devoted to the subject of liquidation value modeling, predominantly from the Eastern European perspective, where this issue has, for years, commanded a particular economic interest, this paper synthesizes the best features of this research and builds on it to propose its own model, which lays equal emphasis on both the sellerside and demand-side perspectives. The first perspective accounts for the financial interests of a lender in forced sale disposals, while the latter perspective engages economic analysis on the side of market feasibility of identified efficient lender disposal strategies. By negotiating both perspectives, an optimal analytic solution to the issue of liquidation value discounts can be obtained. This is achieved by what we call a SI-MI framework which is developed throughout the paper.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We also adapt this framework specifically to the mortgage banking context where we use it to bring to light some rarely discussed linkages between the LTV policies of a bank and its mortgage liquidation strategies. This also allows us to propose a model and an LTV formula which can help organize thinking about optimal LTV policies in credit issuing processes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We hope that, with the re-appearance of liquidation value basis/premise of valuation as a recognized international basis of valuation in the new edition of the International Valuation Standards (IVS 2017), the findings of this paper will become topical.</jats:p>",

This paper studies the optimal emission abatement decision for firms in a supply chain, considering emission costs. Four Stackelberg models are established that differ in free emission allowance allocation schemes and emission abatement cost-sharing schemes. On comparing optimal solutions in the models, the results show that regardless of which free emission allowance allocation scheme or emission abatement cost-sharing scheme is adopted, upstream firms tend to set a higher emission reduction rate. If supply chain firms aim for a higher emission reduction rate, they should advocate that upstream and downstream firms establish emission abatement cost-sharing contracts. The upstream firms should undertake larger emission reduction costs, and use free emission allowance allocation schemes based on emission intensity; the optimal emission reduction rate is related to carbon price, and the relationship may not be monotonous, affected by the difficulty of reducing emissions.</jats:p>"

The level and contextual risk factors of household food insecurity and hunger were assessed in households (n=630) from three rural communities of Ethiopia (Halaba or Zeway) using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Household Hunger Scale. Multiple classification analysis was employed to explore the effects of key demand (e.g. household size, livestock) and supply (e.g. land size, frequency of production) factors and community (geographic location) as well as institutional (participation in food security programs) factors on food insecurity and hunger. Household food insecurity was unacceptably high in both districts (95% in Halaba &amp;amp; 67% in Zeway). Household hunger was 38% in Halaba and 18% in Zeway. Both food insecurity and hunger were significantly greater in Halaba (p&amp;lt;0.001), indicating an effect of geographic location. Both supply and demand factors were significant in determining household food insecurity and hunger (p&amp;lt;0.01); however, supply factors such as women’s access to land, land size and wealth had greater influence than the demand factors. Levels of food insecurity and hunger in both communities were very high and of serious concern. We recommend increasing the food supply, and its subsequent accessibility, for households through enhancing women’s access to land, improving income through savings and wealth accumulation, introducing more inclusive programs for women’s participation and reducing household work-burden by significantly enhancing productivity of cultivable land.</jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to investigate the importance of port integration in the supply chains overall and to analyse how North Adriatic Ports are integrated into the supply chains. The analysis is based on the sample of 939 firms aggregated by ports regions and classes level within Section H (Nace Rev.2). The assumption is that if the business cycle of all firms (classes) included in the port supply chain is correlated, it can indicate that the port is integrated in the supply chain. The results of our analysis are ambiguous, where the correlation is rather negative than positive.

A variety of toxic and non-toxic iodine species have been identified in environmental water and in the drinking water produced by public water treatment plants. Here, we examined the change of iodine species during the water treatment process at a public water treatment plant in Japan. Samples of raw water and of treated water immediately after each of eight treatment stages comprising the treatment process were collected, and a speciation analysis was conducted by means of ion chromatography– and size-exclusion chromatography–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In the raw water, iodine was found mainly as iodide or iodinated humic substances that were ultimately oxidized and transformed into iodate, a form non-toxic to humans, by two independent oxidation stages in the water treatment process – ozone treatment and chlorine treatment. No disinfection byproducts were detected at any stage of the treatment process. Fluorescence spectrometry with multivariate analysis revealed that humic substances were markedly decreased by ozone treatment, but not by chlorine treatment. The present results show that, at the plant-scale, ozone treatment is an effective means of removing toxic iodine species from raw water.</jats:p>",

The installation of micro hydro plants for energy recovery can be profitable in sites with excessive pressure, though requiring proper technical and economical evaluation. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the energy recovery potential in water supply systems under high seasonal demand variation. The methodology is based on the calculation of head and flow rate conditions that maximize energy production for a specific energy recovery technology, given available head and flow rate ranges. The methodology is applied to the inlet of a storage tank of a water transmission system using hourly collected data over one year. Results show that, in systems of high variability of flow rate, the installation of turbomachines in parallel is necessary for maximizing energy recovery and that the developed methodology returns lower, but more realistic, energy production estimates than other approaches based on average head and flow rate data.</jats:p>"

The proposed model locates the multi-modal facilities and biorefineries and determines the optimal production, storage, and routing plans in such a way that the overall system cost is minimized. We propose a hybrid Constraint generation-based Rolling horizon algorithm to solve this challenging NP-hard problem. The performance of this algorithm is tested in a example case study with numerical analysis showing that the hybrid algorithm can find near-optimal solutions to large-scale problem instances in a reasonable amount of time. Results indicate that the effect of congestion reduces the usage of multi-modal facilities in the biofuel supply chain network while bio-refineries and multi-modal facilities tend to move away from coastal areas when disruption probabilities are taken into consideration.</jats:p>"

A PRS probe consists of an anion or cation exchange resin membrane that is housed in a plastic support. We assessed nutrient adsorption by PRS probes over three incubation periods (2, 24, and 384 hr) in a boreal extreme‐rich fen, a system with moderately high pore water electrical conductivity and a peatland site type that has been targeted in oil sand wetland reclamation. Ion adsorption by PRS probes was similar at 24 and 384 hr for ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, calcium, and magnesium, indicating that a stable or dynamic equilibrium was reached. However, potassium declined from 24 to 384 hr, likely due to displacement by more strongly held cations, while iron and manganese increased, likely due to increasingly anaerobic conditions. The finding that most nutrients were close to equilibrium on PRS probes within 24 hr has important implications for implementation and interpretation of PRS probe data in wetlands with moderately high pore water electrical conductivity.</jats:p>",

Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive effect and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> has a negative effect on both growth and calcification. For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> impacts. Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope upon which CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> effects can act in food-replete situations. These interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry, coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification research.</jats:p><jats:p>Arising from: L.

While we find well-level production of natural gas is primarily determined by geological characteristics, producers respond to market signals through drilling rates and locations. Using a novel fixed effects approach based on petroleum-engineering characteristics, we confirm that production decline rates tend to be larger for wells with larger peak-production rates. We also find that the price elasticity of peak production is negative, plausibly because firms drill in less productive locations as prices increase. Finally, we show that drilling is price inelastic, although the price elasticity of drilling increased significantly when new technologies began to be adopted in Wyoming. Our results indicate that the popular view that shale wells have larger decline rates than conventional wells can be at least partially explained by the pattern of falling natural gas prices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sulphur is an essential element for plants. Decreasing sulphur deposition from the air, and the use of more concentrated phosphate fertilizers, which contain no sulphur, has led to reports of sulphur deficiencies for wheat. Sulphur deficiency significantly affects yield and also the quality of wheat. The pot experiment was set up on calcareous chernozem soil at Látókép, Hungary, test plant was spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L). Seven treatments were used where nitrogen and sulphur were supplied as soil fertilizers in increasing rates (NS1, NS2, NS3) and in foliar fertilizer as well (NS1+fol., NS2+fol., NS3+fol.). Plant aboveground biomass production was determined in samples taken in the stages of development BBCH 29-30, 51-59, 61-69, 89. The nitrogen and sulphur content of straw and grain were measured. N/S ratios of grain and straw were calculated. The weights of grain were ranging between 8.6–16.1 g/pot. NS2 and NS2+fol. treatments produced the highest values. Foliar fertilizer had no further effect on grain. Analysing the values of the straw, it was observed that tendencies were similar to values of grain. The NS2 treatment produced the highest weight of straw and the NS3 rate already decreased that amount. The obtained results show the unfavourable effect of excessively high rate applied in NS3 treatment. The supplementary foliar fertilizer had no significant influence on the weight of straw. Both N and S-uptake of plant was very intensive at the stem elongation stage, then the N and S-content of plant continuously decreased in time in all treatments. The N-content of grain ranged between 2.215–2.838%.&#x0D;\nThe N-content of grain slightly increased with increasing of nitrogen doses. In the higher doses (NS2, NS3) foliar fertilization slightly increased the nitrogen content of grain, although this effect was not statistically proved. The N-content of straw varied from 0.361 to 0.605%. The growing dose of soil fertilizer also considerably increased the nitrogen content of straw. Foliar fertilization further increased the nitrogen content of straw. The S-content of grain ranged between 0.174–0.266%. The lowest fertilizer dose (NS1) significantly increased the sulphur content of grain. The further increasing fertilizer doses (NS2, NS3) did not cause additional enhance in sulphur content of grain.&#x0D;\nThe foliar fertilizer also did not change the sulphur value of plant. The increasing amount of soil fertilizer and the supplementary foliar fertilizer had no effect on the sulphur content of straw. The treatments influenced the N/S ratios of grain and straw. On the basis of experimental results it can be concluded that the examined nitrogen and sulphur containing soil fertilizer had positive effect on the growth and yield of spring wheat grown on the calcareous chernozem soil. The soil fertilizer application enhanced the grain nitrogen and sulphur content. The highest rate of fertilizer (600 kg ha-1) proved to have decreasing effect on the yield. The sulphur and nitrogen containing foliar fertilizer did not have significant effect on the yield parameters but slightly increased the nitrogen content of plant.</jats:p>"

PV is introduced to reduce the energy cost and increase the reliability of power systems. A reversible converter can achieve multiple objectives including regenerative braking energy recovery, PV energy inverting, DC voltage regulation and power factor improvement. In this paper, the topology and operating modes of the HTPSS are first introduced. Three-level boost converter (TLBC) is employed in the PV system. A double closed-loop control scheme considering both maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and midpoint potential balancing (MPB) is recommended. The reversible converter adopts a multi-modular topology and the independent control for active power and reactive power has been achieved by a current decoupling control. According to the working characteristic of each device, a coordinated control strategy is designed, and four basic principles are given. A system simulation model containing a hybrid traction substation and a train was built, and comprehensive simulations under multi-scenario were carried out. The results show that the reversible converter can accomplish PV energy inversion, DC voltage regulation, regenerative braking energy recovery and power factor improvement, by which a high utilization rate and energy-saving effect can be obtained.</jats:p>"

This study aims to assess mismatches in the provision of urban ES. Specifically, it compares the amount of services that urban dwellers currently benefit from with the capacity of green spaces to provide service and the ES demand, in order to assess two mismatches: “unsustainable flow” and “unsatisfied demand”, respectively. We focus on two ES, recreation and food supply, and conduct an empirical study in two adjacent municipalities of the city of Havana, Cuba. The methodological approach includes: the identification of services providing and demanding areas; and the quantification of mismatches by carrying out a spatial comparison between critical capacity and flow, and demand and flow. Results show that urban green spaces may be potentially exposed to overcrowding. Concerning food supply, a mismatch between demand and flow emerged in both of the municipalities. The assessment can support planners in addressing the sustainable use of green spaces and the equitable distribution of ES benefits. However, its applicability requires a deep understanding of local specificities, including demand levels, accessibility to ES, and sustainability thresholds.</jats:p>"

Insider trading opportunities motivate insiders to reduce their supply of information by concealing firm performance, thereby increasing their information advantage over outsiders, resulting in higher insider trading profits. Using data from 40 countries over the 1988–2004 period, we find that reporting opacity, as captured by earnings smoothness, decreases significantly after the initial enforcement of insider trading laws in countries with strong legal institutions. The decrease in earnings smoothness is positively related to the strictness of insider trading laws. The decrease in earnings smoothness is also more pronounced for countries that have more persistent insider trading law enforcement and for countries that impose more severe penalties on insider trading cases. Further analyses show that the decrease in earnings smoothness following insider trading enforcement is concentrated among firms that are not closely held and among high‐growth firms. In addition to uncovering a channel through which insider trading restrictions affect the information environment, our evidence highlights the importance of country‐ and firm‐level governance structures in determining the consequences of insider trading restrictions.</jats:p>",

On the supply side, a cluster analysis identifies homogenous groups of agritourism firms. On the demand side, a factor analysis is run on a set of motivations and environmental externalities and a probabilistic model estimates the determinants that influence the likelihood to choose 1 type of firm over the other. The results show that traditional and genuine food, culture, and authenticity are elements that determine the choice of 1 firm over another. A further contribution of this paper is the identification of environmental externalities as determinants of the attractiveness of a firm. From a marketing perspective, linking demand to supply is essential to determine product development strategies capable of satisfying actual and potential customers. Several strategies are proposed to different types of agritourism firms to attract and retain customers.</jats:p>",

This is somewhat surprising given the recent policy focus on Guaranteed Basic Income programs. An annual lump-sum payment, the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) is available to almost all Alaska residents, is clearly exogenous with respect to work effort, and – while relatively predictable – varies over time and across households (since it increases linearly with family size). This paper estimates the nonlabor income elasticity of labor supply using exogenous variation from the Alaskan PFD and data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The analysis finds that men have elasticities between −0.15 and −0.10, depending on the specification.

Groundwater was one of the first sources since the prehistoric times to cover human needs. Initially, the exploitation of groundwater has been made by shallow wells and later by boreholes. A water well is constructed through excavation in the ground by digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater in aquifers. Groundwater wells were used in the Helladic world since Neolithic times. Ancient China developed a sophisticated tool for drilling water wells that is similar to modern machines. Qanat, a system of wells, originated in Iran (Persia), but was adopted by other countries. Moreover, the Indus valley civilization had well-constructed wells mainly for drinking purposes. The construction of wells varied according to local conditions, determined by geology, hydrogeology, and morphology, as well as by local tradition. Furthermore, a well was not just a water source but also became a cultural symbol throughout history, related to local religion and custom. The stepwells in India became not only sources of drinking water, but also holy places (sanctuaries) for bathing, meditation and prayer. In the present review, the evolution of wells through the centuries is examined. The study of water well technologies demonstrates their diachronic evolution and, furthermore, reveals that the ancient people had an outstanding engineering knowledge of water exploitation, which is interesting for water engineering and hydrogeologists, even nowadays.</jats:p>",

In decentralized supply chains, however, these mitigating actions may be the supplier's responsibility yet are often not contractible. We show that wholesale price contracts, despite their simplicity, can perform well in inducing reliable supply, and we identify when and why they perform well. This could explain the widespread use of wholesale price contracts in business settings with unreliable supply. In particular, we investigate how the performance of wholesale price contracts depends on the interplay between the nature of supply risk and the type of procurement process. Supply risk is classified as random capacity when events such as labor strike disrupt the firm's ability to produce, or as random yield when manufacturing defects result in yield losses. The procurement process is classified as control when the buyer determines the production quantity, or as delegation when instead the supplier does. Analyzing the four possible combinations, we find that for random capacity, irrespective of the procurement process type, contract performance monotonically increases with the supplier's bargaining power; thus, wholesale price contracts perform well when the supplier is powerful. However, this monotonic trend is reversed for random yield with control: in that case, wholesale price contracts perform well when instead the buyer is powerful. For random yield with delegation, wholesale price contracts perform well when either party is powerful. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, the presence of a powerful retailer in the dynamic collecting closed-loop supply chain is considered. The supply chain consists of a manufacturer and a retailer who is responsible for the used-product collection. Specifically, we have considered three settings, that is, no channel leader, the manufacturer as the leader and the retailer as the leader. The steady equilibrium and the optimal control strategies are derived in different channel power structures utilizing the open-loop control strategy method. By the comparison of three models, we found that the system with manufacturer leading results in the lowest return rate in the three models. If the transfer price of the used-product is low, the presence of a power retailer would result in a higher return rate, which is beneficial for decreasing the market price for the consumers. When the transfer price is quite high, the scenario with no channel leader in the supply chain would result in a higher return rate. However, the numerical comparison results of the profit rate of the supply chain members indicate that both manufacturer and retailer prefer themselves to be the channel leader rather than the other channel member as the leader. This means that although the presence of a power retailer is beneficial for the collecting efficiency, it is not enough to increase the profit of the supply chain members. The manufacturer should transfer all unit cost savings to the retailer in the scenario of manufacturer leading and no one leading.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in water quality of Tangxihe River, a eutrophic urban river receiving tail water from a nearby WWTP in Hefei City, using the single-factor index (SFI) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results of SFI indicated that the most important parameters responsible for low water quality were total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia (NH4+-N). PCA showed that tail water from the WWTP greatly reduced water quality, as demonstrated by the significantly increased SFIs and integrated principal component values (F values) of the sampling points around the drain outlet of the WWTP (T3, T4 and T5). The sampling points located at the upstream of the river (T1) and up the water-gate of Chaohu Lake (T6) had negative F values, indicating relatively higher water quality. In addition, the season had a significant effect on the water quality of the river. Moreover, we discuss measures to improve the water quality of urban rivers in order to maintain their ecological functions.</jats:p>",

This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program to optimize facility location and inventory management decisions jointly, and the logistics flows between the two markets are modeled dynamically. To solve this problem efficiently, a new heuristic approach is also developed by introducing an effective adaptive mechanism into differential evolution. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the solution approach and provide valuable managerial insight. This paper makes a meaningful contribution to the literature by incorporating the secondary market into the study of closed-loop supply chains, and practically, it is also greatly beneficial to improve the sustainability and efficiency of modern supply chains.</jats:p>"

Tal processo tem impacto no preço dos alimentos evidenciado pelo valor da cesta básica em Vitória, podendo afetar o nível de segurança alimentar dos domicílios capixabas. Por fim, considerando o PPA 2012-2015 vimos que todas essas questões não são objeto de preocupação, de estratégias ou programas de governo. AbstractThe present article tries to understand how the situation of food production and supply in Espírito Santo is dealt by the Pluriannual plan (PPA) 2012-2015. The level of the main food cultures production has fallen substantially as well as the specialized production of some exportable goods. It was noticed that this process has an impact on the prices of food evidenced by the food basket price in Vitória. This process can affect the level of food safety for the locals. Finally, considering the PPA 2012-2015, it was detected that these issues aren’t object of concern or strategies in governmental programs.Keywords: Agrarian Question; Food supplies; Food Security.</jats:p>"

To improve the performance of the decentralized system, we propose online channel price discount and offline channel price discount contracts to coordinate dual-channel supply chain and provide a transfer payment mechanism to make win-win of both sides.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration between WEAP and MODFLOW models coupled via LinkKitchen helps to create a dynamic link between surface water and groundwater supply sources of Addis Ababa city. Possible impacts of natural and anthropogenic stresses on surface water reservoirs volume and groundwater storage have been assessed through water supply scenario analysis. Besides, contrary to other surface water hydrological models, the unique nature of WEAP adds water demand assessment by simulating Addis Ababa city near future water demand coverage under three population projection scenarios. The water demand projections of Addis Ababa city indicates 100% water demand coverage will not be achieved for high (4.6%), medium (3.8%) and low (2.8%) population growth rate projections, even with all the emerging and planned water supply projects start production up until 2025. Supply scenario projections indicate, as surface water reservoirs are highly sensitive to climate change and variability, the city groundwater supply sources will be noticeably affected by the emerging and planned groundwater supply expansion schemes. If groundwater abstraction continues to reach to zero unmet demand, more than 30-meter groundwater level decline can be registered in 2025. To foresee the combined effect of both natural and anthropogenic stresses on Addis Ababa city water supply sources, best case (considering conditions which improve Addis Ababa city water supply) and worst case (considering conditions stressing Addis Ababa city water supply) scenarios were tested. The best case scenario results zero unmet water demand in Addis Ababa city in most wet months of future projection years up to 2025, with likely decline of about 6 meter on the groundwater level. The worst case scenario to the contrary shows, Addis Ababa city water demand coverage will potentially be reduced to a maximum of 35% in 2025, with seasonal and annual variability. The dynamic link between surface water reservoirs and groundwater supply sources helps to gain insight into the potential consequences of continuously changing natural and anthropogenic conditions on Addis Ababa city water supply sources. Consequently, the significant predicted near future pressure on Addis Ababa city surface water and groundwater supply clearly indicate planning and developing alternative water supply sources outside of the boundary (Upper Awash basin) where the city is located should be immediately started in order to endure the pressure from the ever increasing demand. Otherwise, not only Addis will continue suffering unmet water demand for the years to come, but also the water supply sources will be severely impacted. Nonetheless, wherever the water supply sources, minimizing water loss, recycling and improving water use efficiency should be given at most priority.</jats:p>"

To overcome the problem of their non-dispatchable and stochastic nature, several approaches have been proposed so far. This paper describes a novel mathematical model for scheduling the operation of a wind-powered pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) hybrid for 25 to 48 h ahead. The model is based on mathematical programming and wind speed forecasts for the next 1 to 24 h, along with predicted upper reservoir occupancy for the 24th hour ahead. The results indicate that by coupling a 2-MW conventional wind turbine with a PSH of energy storing capacity equal to 54 MWh it is possible to significantly reduce the intraday energy generation coefficient of variation from 31% for pure wind turbine to 1.15% for a wind-powered PSH The scheduling errors calculated based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are significantly smaller for such a coupling than those seen for wind generation forecasts, at 2.39% and 27%, respectively. This is even stronger emphasized by the fact that, those for wind generation were calculated for forecasts made for the next 1 to 24 h, while those for scheduled generation were calculated for forecasts made for the next 25 to 48 h. The results clearly show that the proposed scheduling approach ensures the high reliability of the WT–PSH energy source.</jats:p>"

The proposed APS circuit is targeting the application of MV SiC devices in modular multilevel converters (MMCs). It can harvest energy from a MV (≥ 7 kV) dc bus to provide an isolated low voltage output to gate drive circuits of MV SiC devices. Compared to existing APS solutions, it can achieve a high input voltage (≥ 7 kV) with simple circuit structure and control scheme.

The results presented are different from those from past investigations, because of the addition of a significant mainstream pressure gradient. Main stream flow is provided along a passage with a contraction ratio of 4, given by the ratio upstream flow area, to downstream flow area. With this arrangement, local blowing ratio decreases significantly with streamwise development along the test section, for every value of initial blowing ratio considered, where this initial value is determined at the most upstream row of effusion holes. Experimental data are given for a sparse effusion hole array. The experimental results are provided for mainstream Reynolds numbers of 128400 to 135300, and initial blowing ratios of 3.6, 4.4, 5.2, 6.1–6.3, and 7.3–7.4. Results illustrate the effects of blowing ratio for the hot-side and the cold-side of the effusion plate. Of particular interest are values of line-averaged film cooling effectiveness and line-averaged heat transfer coefficient, which are generally different for contraction ratio of 4, compared to a contraction ratio of 1, because of different amounts and concentrations of effusion coolant near the test surface. In regard to cold-side measurements on the crossflow side of the effusion plate, line-averaged Nusselt numbers for contraction ratio 4 are often less than values for contraction ratio 1, when compared at the same main flow Reynolds number, initial blowing ratio, and streamwise location.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work seeks to explore and demonstrate the use of Agent Based Simulations (ABS) in modelling and simulating supply chains. Such methodology was applied to develop a model to evaluate the impact of current tax policies in soy supply chain in Brazil. The model brought interesting insights on how the country’s current tax structure induces logistics and tributary trade-offs, therefore generating a suboptimal grain distribution. This is accomplished by going through the conception and implementation of an Agent Based Model. First there is the definition and delimitation of the main agents acting upon soy’s supply chain, such as producers, trader and consumers. Those agents then have their behaviors studied and translated into programable patterns. Finally, the model considers the environmental interactions with the mentioned players, including the effects of infrastructure capacities, transportation costs, storage costs and tax legislation. After quantitative and behavioral validation, the simulation is then able to mimic the actual allocation of corn, soy and soymeal productions in their respective supply chains. This would allow inferring how the system could work in different tax conditions, thus quantifying the tributary impact in terms of congestions, idle infrastructure and delays. The analysis of such results points out that a path dependant tax system may induce agents to opt for inefficient logistic solutions, if such alternatives are cheaper when taking taxes into account. From those simulations it is possible to conclude that there are opportunities for supply chain efficiency gains in the design of a new tax policy.</jats:p>"

The system also allows the manufacturers to choose good sub-suppliers more easily and incline them to achieve perfection at every stage of production. In the paper, the function constituting the main element of the system’s algorithm was tested and modified, and the other postulated functions were described.</jats:p>"

As a part of a wider global food chain, every link in this chain is deeply insecure and partly marked by secrecy and mystification. Contemporary representations of the Norrlandic landscape tend to obscure and hide economic conflicts and power relations connected to resource exploitation and corporate concentration, neglecting workers and local communities. This paper examines how globalization, neoliberal policies and the development of supply chain capitalism drive changes in labour markets and migration policies, which in turn shape/and are shaped by both material and immaterial aspects of the Norrlandic landscape. While many studies of global food chains have focused on abstract patterns of chain governance, business economics and logistics, we analyse the wild berry industry by centring on migrant workers and the production of a distinct spatiality through interconnectedness and historical conjuncture, with a starting point in a particular place in the interior of Norrland. We thereby contribute to a different narrative of the Norrlandic landscape, making visible power and labour relations.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the dynamic mechanical vibration caused by transporting on public roads was simulated in laboratory vibration tests then samples were subjected to microbiological examinations in compliance with legislations currently in force. Due to this vibration, the initial microbe count increased by two orders of magnitude, while after terminating the 4-hour mechanical action it decreased gradually.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of hydrology and climate is important for understanding the present and future impact of climate on streamflow, which may cause frequent flooding, droughts, and shortage of water supply. In view of this, we assessed the impact of climate change on daily streamflow duration curves as well as extreme peak and low flow values. The objectives were to assess how climate change impacts watershed-wide streamflow and its extreme values and to provide an overview of the impacts of different climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5) on streamflow and hydrological extremes when compared with the baseline values. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for daily streamflow and its extreme value modeling of two watersheds located on the Island of Oahu (Hawaii). Following successful calibration and validation of SWAT at three USGS flow gauging stations, we simulated the impact of climate change by the 2050s (2041–2070) and the 2080s (2071–2100). We used climate change perturbation factors and applied the factors to the historical time series data of 1980–2014. SWAT adequately reproduced observed daily streamflow with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of greater than 0.5 and bracketed &gt;80% of observed streamflow data at 95% model prediction uncertainty at all flow gauging stations, indicating the applicability of the model for future daily streamflow prediction. We found that while the considered climate change scenarios generally show considerable negative impacts on daily streamflow and its extreme values, the extreme peak flows are expected to increase by as much as 22% especially under the RCP 8.5 scenario. However, a consistent decrease in extreme low flows by as much as 60% compared to the baseline values is projected. Larger negative changes of low flows are expected in the upstream part of the watersheds where higher groundwater contributions are expected. Consequently, severe problems, such as frequent hydrological droughts (groundwater scarcity), reduction in agricultural crop productivity, and increase in drinking water demand, are significantly expected on Oahu. Furthermore, the extreme values are more sensitive to rainfall change in comparison to temperature and solar radiation changes. Overall, findings generally indicated that climate change impacts will be amplified by the end of this century and may cause earlier occurrence of hydrological droughts when compared to the current hydrological regime, suggesting water resources managers, ecosystem conservationists, and ecologists to implement mitigation measures to climate change in Hawaii and similar Islands.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The 2 × 25 kV power supply system is the most frequently used traction rail system to provide the huge power needed by high-speed trains. However, locating the ground fault in this power supply system is more complicated than in other configurations of electrical railway power supply due to the installation of autotransformers throughout the line section. In previous papers, the authors have described a ground fault location method with an insignificant installation cost. The method and, moreover, the location discriminate between whether the ground fault is located between a positive conductor and ground or a negative conductor and ground. The current of the high-speed train influences the accuracy of the location of the ground fault. An additional factor which influences the location method is the existence of an arc resistance between the positive or negative conductor and ground. In this paper, the influence of high-speed train currents and arc resistances are analysed to evaluate the error in the location method. The major conclusion of the paper is that the location method has an acceptable precision even taking into consideration the high-speed train current and arc resistance. The validation of the method has been performed by laboratory tests and computer simulations with satisfactory results.</jats:p>"

The performance is greatly influenced by the location, cross area, and the characteristics of the connector. In order to improve the property of the surge tank, the effect of the connector is numerically analyzed by the method of characteristics (MOC). A hysteretic effect can occur when the discharge capacity is limited. Therefore, the performance of the surge tank can be improved if the discharge capacity of the connector is appropriately controlled according to the different conditions. For the adjustability of the connector’s discharge capacity, a kind of intelligent self-controlled surge tank (IST) is proposed. In addition, through simulations and analysis, IST is proved to have advantages in pressure control and applicability compared to normal surge tanks.</jats:p>"

As an important source of TP, lake sediment contributes a lot to TP release. TP release across the sediment–water interface varies with the hydrodynamic conditions of the overlying water, and in this paper the release characteristics of TP under hydrodynamic disturbance has been investigated. The sediment samples from Xuanwu Lake are collected and their release characteristics of TP under varying shear velocity are simulated in laboratory apparatus. Results show that increasing shear velocity contributes to the release of TP from sediment and the combination of varying shear velocity in different stages has a significant influence on the distribution of TP concentration. Further, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to simulate the process of TP release from the sediment–water interface and the predicted values agree well with the measured data, which proves that the LBM can be used in simulating the process of TP release from sediment.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper was to investigate residents’ perception on willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water supply in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria using regression analysis. \r\nMethodology / approach. Data were collected from 512 households through multistage sampling from eleven political wards in Owo. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and stepwise regression. \r\nResults. Findings showed that 44.9 % of the residents obtained water from public utility while 21.5 % and 18.8 % obtained water from well and borehole respectively. Majority of the residents (72.6 %) were of the opinion that public water supply were irregular and unreliable but were willing to pay for improved water supply (74.6 %). Residents were willing to pay an average sum of N972 (US$2.7) per month for improved water supply services. \r\nOriginality / scientific novelty. The results of stepwise regression analysis revealed that age, income, access to water supply, education, quality of water, frequency of water supply and gender were the factors influencing residents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water supply services in the study area. There is need for government to create enabling policy for public-private partnership in the improvement of water supply in the study area.\r\nPractical value / implications. The implication of these findings is that government and public-private organisation should consider age, income, access to water supply, education, quality of water, frequency of water supply and gender when evaluating residents’ willingness to pay in the study area.</jats:p>"

In addition, this research discusses a wide range of consequences from choosing an effective supplier, including reducing production cost, improving product quality, delivering the product on time, and responding flexibly to customer requirements. Therefore, the activities noted above are able to increase an enterprise’s competitiveness. It can be seen that selecting a supplier is complex in that decision-makers must have an understanding of the qualitative and quantitative features for assessing the symmetrical impact of the criteria to reach the most accurate result. In this research, the multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach was proposed to solve supplier selection problems. The authors collected data from 25 potential suppliers, and the four main criteria within contain 15 sub-criteria to define the most effective supplier, which has viewed factors, including financial efficiency guarantee, quality of materials, ability to deliver on time, and the conditioned response to the environment to improve the efficiency of the industry supply chain. Initially, fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) is used to evaluate and rank these criteria, which are able to be utilized to clarify important criteria that directly affect the profitability of the business. Subsequently, data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, including the Charnes Cooper Rhodes model (CCR model), Banker Charnes Cooper model (BCC model), and slacks-based measure model (SBM model), were proposed to rank suppliers. The result of the model has proposed 7/25 suppliers, which have a condition response to the enterprises’ supply requirements.</jats:p>"

A key supporting technology is a highly stable pulsed power supply (PS), which enables stable XFEL operations by precisely switching the beam route. We developed a high-power pulsed PS to drive a kicker magnet installed in a SACLA’s beam switching system. SiC MOSFETs were adapted as switching elements to reduce the required size and to increase the electric power efficiency. The PS we developed provides two key capabilities: (i) a high current stability of 20 ppm (peak-to-peak) at a peak power of 0.24 MW and (ii) generation of controllable, bipolar, and trapezoidal current waveforms at 60 Hz. This paper describes the overall concept, the detailed design, the performance achieved, and the initial beam test results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water scarcity is an alarming issue in the developing world. Due to population explosion, the supply of water to households is becoming difficult. And as the quality of water supply infrastructure is deteriorating, clean water is getting mixed with sewage and becoming a cause of waterborne diseases. This study was carried out in the city of Lahore, Pakistan, to find out the willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water supply by using Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). This study explores the relationship of WTP with socio-economic factors, i.e. income, accommodation and employment. Moreover, questionnaires were administered to randomly selected 200 respondents. For statistical analysis stepwise linear regression, Pearson correlation and chi square were employed to find out the variables that determine WTP for improved water supply quality. Results showed that income was the variable that most significantly impacted the WTP for improved water supply. The WTP amount was found to be 0.70 USD. People were not generally satisfied with the water supply quality. Unavailability of water for 1–2[Formula: see text]h per day was commonly reported by the respondents. However, more studies should be conducted with a larger sample size to enhance our knowledge about water supply situation in Lahore. </jats:p>",

In addition, Beijing has experienced a prolonged period of consecutive droughts from 1999 to 2010. Water crisis has constrained the socio‐economic development of Beijing. Meanwhile, the national “South‐to‐North Water Transfer” (STNWT) project, which is expected to provide some relief to the water crisis in Beijing, is still under development. In order to ensure the security of water supply in Beijing before the completion of the STNWT project, several measures have been implemented to cope with droughts, including pumping groundwater from emergency well fields, water saving, recycling of water, rain and flood water harvesting, and the diversion of water from neighboring rivers and groundwater basins. Groundwater from four emergency well fields contributes the most to the public and domestic water supplies in Beijing, supplying a total volume of 1.8×10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The water crisis is supposed to be mitigated by the completion of the STNWT project. After the completion of this project, more sustainable management of water resources will be implemented, including the use of aquifers as groundwater reservoirs and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

In adult plants, it can vary in response to many factors, such as nutrient availability in the soil or reserves in the roots from the previous season. The question remains whether, at the interspecific level, reserves in seeds can affect seedlings' R:S ratio in a similar way. Proper allocation to resource‐acquiring organs is enormously important for seedlings and is likely to determine their survival and further success. Therefore, we investigated the effect of seed mass on seedling R:S biomass partitioning and its interaction with nutrient supply in the substrate. We measured seedling biomass partitioning under two different nutrient treatments after 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks for seventeen species differing in seed mass and covering. We used phylogenetically informed analysis to determine the independent influence of seed mass on seedling biomass partitioning. We found consistently lower R:S ratios in seedlings with higher seed mass. Expectedly, R:S was also lower with higher substrate nutrient supply, but substrate nutrient supply had a bigger effect on R:S ratio for species with higher seed mass. These findings point to the importance of seed reserves for the usage of soil resources. Generally, R:S ratio decreased over time and, similarly to the effect of substrate nutrients, R:S ratio decreased faster for large‐seeded species. We show that the seed mass determines the allocation patterns into new resource‐acquiring organs during seedling development. Large‐seeded species are more flexible in soil nutrient use. It is likely that faster development of shoots provides large‐seeded species with the key advantage in asymmetric above‐ground competition, and that this could constitute one of the selective factors for optimum seed mass.</jats:p>",

There has been a dearth of literature in this area, predominantly regarding assessing the impact of collaborative attributes on supply chain sustainability. An integrated supply chain model comprising trust, information sharing and uncertainty practices is proposed here to assess their impact on the sustainability of service supply chains in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study conducts a comprehensive literature review to develop constructs and their items. Social exchange theory is used to link these constructs/variables to sustainability. These variables are linked to sustainability through social exchange theory of behaviors. Structural equation modeling is used to test five hypotheses pertaining to the impact of those constructs on sustainability. The results of this study can help managers align and prioritize their investments while targeting sustainability in their partnerships with numerous stakeholders. Several implications and limitations of the study are also outlined at the end of the paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The landed cost for oil products in local markets is very often affected by the fluctuation of price related to the international purchasing from oil markets. As a result, oil products are primarily procured via term contracts i.e. derivatives as wholesalers are typically loath to rely heavily on spot supplies as these may be unreliable and exhibit high price volatility. In this study, we apply Grey Theory to evaluate the derivatives based strategies of the Tanzanian oil products imports for hedging the price risk in the local market. After comprehensive evaluation, we find that the applicability of oil derivatives by the Tanzanian importers is high. Thus, the government (i.e. Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry of Trade and Industry) and other stakeholders have the obligation to continue bringing awareness on the benefits of the derivative instruments in the purchasing of oil products, which ultimately upon application would bring a relief to all consumers of the oil products in the country. Moreover, as the grey theory can deal with vague and incomplete data, the proposed model can be applied as an evaluation tool for quantifying qualitative data in any industry.Â Â </jats:p>"

Consequently, merging eco-design tools with the joint DPSC can develop a better understanding of the product and its environmental interactions to achieve green product development. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, we present a literature review dealing with environmental principles’ integration into the SDPSC, then we investigate tools for green product design selection using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). We compare suitability of three selected MCDM methods, namely Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), and Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT). Two case studies were selected from literature, and a sensitivity analysis is applied for each selected method. Results suggest that although all methods are convenient and can be used in practice, TOPSIS method was more stable towards weighting changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the current economic environment of companies, with the focus on core business and the increasing use of outsourcing, a good relationship management with suppliers is very crucial to increase the performance of the companies. Since the rate of purchases in the value added of the product keeps increasing, suppliers who are considered as partners have a significant role to play. This situation poses the problem of managing the customer-supplier relationship because a greater part of the performance depends on suppliers and the service providers. Due to these observations, there is the need for companies to secure their supply chain, especially in terms of QCD (Quality, Cost and Delay). The control of these three elements is a solid asset that is used to remain competitive and to keep their strategic stake in the logistics chain. The SCM practices related to supplier management are defined as a set of activities within an organization to ensure an effective supply chain management. This paper focuses on exploring the best practices in term of supplier management used to ensure high performance in the automotive sector in Morocco. In other words, the objective of this research is to assess the actual state and the perspectives for applying a security approach and an appraisal of the suppliers’ performance, based on management practices and a combination of quality and logistics audits. This research contributes to the study of the link between the SCM practices and the performance based on a qualitative approach applied with a business case within the automobile manufacturer Renault Tanger in Morocco.</jats:p>"

This research tests the effects of a transportation carrier's economic, environmental, and social sustainability performance on a shipper's carrier selection decision. Underrepresented experimental methods are used to test an a priori hypothesis derived from behavioral decision theory logic. Results contradict commonly held win–win, trade‐off, and ecological perspectives of sustainable supply chain management by finding that the economic dimension of sustainability has the greatest effect on carrier selection. Our research highlights this managerial preference and offers a theoretically grounded explanation for selection behaviors. This is one of the first empirical studies to simultaneously consider all three dimensions of sustainability. It also moves beyond an internal focal firm focus to evaluate sustainability effects through the eyes of external supply chain members. Our unique approach and findings offer managerial opportunities for differentiation and resource allocation as well as policy implications for the broader transportation system.</jats:p>",

Application of the proposed approach also results in reduced uncertainty of the performance measurement process caused by qualitative criteria evaluation. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. First, the fuzzy decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method has been used to determine important criteria by avoiding low influences; and then a Mamdani fuzzy inference system model has been adopted and applied for performance evaluation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This model is employed in order to cope with the vagueness that exists in the SSCM performance investigation due to the vagueness intrinsic in the evaluation of criteria. In the proposed model, human reasoning has been modelled with fuzzy inference rules and has been set in the system, which is an advantage compared with those models in which fuzzy set theory and multicriteria decision‐making models are integrated. The proposed approach has been implemented in the pipe and fitting industry in order to highlight its application in real life. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the influence of service and manufacturing criteria on SSCM performance. The findings reveal that sustainable manufacturing criteria compared with sustainable service criteria have more effect on the performance of SSCM.</jats:p>",

It provides new insights on the negotiations and outcomes of labour clauses across different stages of the policy process, including implementation and monitoring. The analysis demonstrates the importance of pragmatic alliances of progressive local politicians, unions and employers in ensuring that socially responsible procurement moves beyond rhetoric, along with supportive national and sectoral employment regimes. Labour clauses can compensate for weak systems of labour market regulation by setting higher standards for outsourced workers, while they play a complementary role in more regulated labour markets by levelling up wages and working conditions to prevailing collectively agreed standards. </jats:p>",

The proposed methodology aims at identifying “management triggers” for possible mitigation measures. Emphasis is given on the use of standardized indices to promote information sharing. The implemented tool is structured into five modules: “hydrological” module; “scenarios” module; “reservoir” module; a module for the evaluation of “indices of shortage”; and a “support to early-warning” module. The whole procedure has been applied to three Italian reservoirs. For each water body, a case specific shortage early-warning system, based on standardized precipitation indices has been identified, allowing the implementation of efficient local mitigation measures.</jats:p>"

Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the effect of geometric parameters, including the blade radius, chord length, and pitch angle, on the performance of the turbine are conducted. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations are numerically solved with a sliding mesh method. Thirteen sets of tests in total are performed at different values of tip-speed ratios. The tests are divided into three groups to study the effect of the three parameters mentioned above, separately. The obtained power coefficients, coefficient of torque, and the dynamic torque on a blade are then compared in each group of tests. Pressure contours and velocity contours are given to explain the reason how the geometric parameters affect the rotor performance. </jats:p>",

One of the most important cyanobacteria is Microcystis aeruginosa which can synthesise various microcystins that may affect the health of humans and animals. Accurate and efficient detection of microcystins in water is thus important for public and veterinary health. Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), a commercially-available ELISA kit (Abraxis) and a newly-developed Norwegian ELISA (putatively cheaper and more robust) were used to detect microcystins in fresh water in South Africa. Water samples were collected monthly at two sites, the Hartbeespoort Dam and a crocodile breeding dam. Extremely high microcystin concentrations (exceeding 360 μg L−1) were detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam during January 2015, whereas the microcystin concentrations in the crocodile breeding dam peaked during March–April 2015. Both ELISAs were positively correlated when analysing water samples ‘as is’ and following resin adsorption and methanol extraction. However, following resin adsorption and methanol extraction of the water samples, the correlation between the two assays was much stronger. These results suggests that the two ELISAs provide comparable results. If the Norwegian-developed ELISA can be packaged and made available as a user-friendly kit, it could be used successfully in surveillance programmes to monitor microcystin concentrations in fresh water bodies in Africa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) hosts the Peruvian upwelling system, which represents one of the most productive areas in the world ocean. High primary production followed by rapid heterotrophic utilization of organic matter supports the formation of one of the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) in the world ocean where dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations reach well below 1 µmol kg−1. The high productivity leads to an accumulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface layers that may serve as a substrate for heterotrophic respiration. However, the importance of DOM utilization for O2 respiration within the Peruvian OMZ remains unclear so far. Here, we evaluate the diapycnal fluxes of O2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved hydrolysable amino acids (DHAA) and dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) and the composition of DOM in the ETSP off Peru to learn, whether labile DOM is reaching into the core of the OMZ and how important DOM utilization might be for O2 attenuation. The observed diapycnal 2 flux (50 mmol O2 m−2 day−1 at max) was limited to the upper 80 m of the water column, the flux attenuation of ~1 µmol L−1day−1, was comparable to previously published O2 consumption rates for the North and South Pacific OMZs. The diapycnal DOM flux (31 mmol C m−2 day−1 at max) was limited to ~30 m water depth, suggesting that the labile DOM is already utilized within the upper part of the shallow oxycline off Peru. The analyses of DCCHO and DHAA composition support this finding, suggesting that DOM undergoes comprehensive remineralization already within the upper part of the oxycline, as the DOM within the core of the OMZ was found to be largely altered. Estimated by a simple equation for carbon combustion, aerobic respiration of DCCHO and DHAA, supplied by diapycnal mixing (0.46 µmol L−1 day−1 at max), could account for up to 38 % of the diapycnal O2 supply in the upper oxycline, which suggests that DOM utilization may play a significant role for shape of the upper Peruvian oxycline.\n                        </jats:p>"

Combined GHG and food supply targets can be met using substantially less land and agricultural support. Dietary changes involve a 30% reduction in meat consumption and a 10% to 20% reduction in the consumption of dairy products, counterbalanced by increased consumption of vegetable products. Although the numerical results are specific to Norway, they are relevant for other rich countries. A consistent pattern in these countries is that ruminant animals impose a heavy toll in terms of both GHG emissions and land use relative to their contribution to food energy production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Driven by the policy imperatives of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving energy security, an increasing proportion of global energy demand is being met by nonfossil energy sources. The socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to supply wood‐based bioenergy, by addressing the following multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2) How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an integrated supply chain and cost‐effective mobilization of the biomass? (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could theoretically provide about 100 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains, because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is needed to develop a cost‐efficient bioenergy sector.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Bioenergy &gt; Climate and Environment</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

It argues that the convergence of state-centered climate politics and market-oriented climate governance, which has a multi-level feature, has shaped the “climate-focused” behavior of Chinese exporting companies. Specifically, nation-states, multinational enterprises, and non-governmental organizations have contributed in the following ways: (1) at the global level, nation-states co-established and interpreted international norms, which generally justify the stance of the Chinese government, have been an indirect source of influence; (2) at the national level, the Chinese government has been the most influential actor, which has put emphasis on energy-saving when interpreting and operationalizing international norms; (3) at the industrial level, multinational enterprises and international non-governmental organizations have been influential contributors by playing a proactive role in launching and running low-carbon initiatives; and (4) transnational public–private partnerships launched in China and some developed countries have offered limited momentum. </jats:p>",

This study thoroughly analyzes the anatomic variations of the brachioradial artery (radial artery of high origin) based on the variability of its origin, the presence and types of anastomosis with the brachial artery in the cubital fossa (“cubital crossover” or “cubital connection”), and the pattern of radial recurrent arteries, as well as the vascular territory within the hand.<jats:italic> Material and Methods</jats:italic>. One hundred and twenty randomly selected, isolated upper limbs fixed in 10% formalin solution were dissected.<jats:italic> Results</jats:italic>. The radial artery was found to have a high origin in 9.2% of total number of the limbs: two cases from the axillary artery; nine cases from the brachial artery. Anastomosis between the brachioradial and “normal” brachial arteries in the cubital fossa was also frequently observed (54.6%). The anastomosis (“cubital crossover”) was dominant in one case, balanced in three cases, minimal in two cases, and absent in five cases.<jats:italic> Conclusions</jats:italic>. The brachioradial artery may originate from the brachial and, less frequently, from the axillary artery. Anastomosis between the brachioradial and “normal” brachial arteries in the cubital fossa may be dominant, balanced, minimal, or absent. A complete radioulnar arch was found more often when the brachioradial artery was present as a variant.</jats:p>",

And\nsurface water is vulnerable to climate change. This paper aims to examine the\nstatus of the supply reliability of surface water irrigation, and discusses\nhow it is affected by climate change in rural China. The field data we used\nin this study was collected from a nine-province field survey during 2012 and\n2013. Climate data are offered by China's National Meteorological Information\nCenter which contains temperature and precipitation in the past 30 years. A\nTobit model (or censored regression model) was used to estimate the influence\nof climate change on supply reliability of surface water irrigation. Descriptive results showed that, surface water supply reliability was\n74 % in the past 3 years. Econometric results revealed that climate\nvariables significantly influenced the supply reliability of surface water\nirrigation. Specifically, temperature is negatively related with the supply\nreliability of surface water irrigation; but precipitation positively\ninfluences the supply reliability of surface water irrigation. Besides,\nclimate influence differs by seasons. In a word, this paper improves our\nunderstanding of the impact of climate change on agriculture irrigation and\nwater supply reliability in the micro scale, and provides a scientific basis\nfor relevant policy making.\n                    </jats:p>"

To this end, the effect of interferons (IFNs) on the MHC peptidomes of human breast cancer cells (MCF‐7) were evaluated. Although all four HLA allotypes of the MCF‐7 cells (HLA‐A*02:01, B*18, B*44, and C*5) present peptides of similar lengths and C‐termini, which should be processed similarly by the proteasome and by the APP chaperones, the IFNs induced differential modulation of the HLA‐A, B, and C peptidomes. In addition, overexpression of recombinant soluble HLA‐A*02:01, introduced to compete with the identical endogenous membrane‐bound HLA‐A*02:01 for peptides of the MCF‐7 cells, did not alter the expression level or the presented peptidome of the membrane‐bound HLA‐A*02:01. Taken together, these results indicate that a surplus supply of peptides is available inside the ER for loading onto the MHC‐I peptide‐receptive molecules, and that cell surface MHC‐I expression is likely limited by the availability of empty MHC molecules.</jats:p>",

In order to better control the air supply subsystem, an appropriate model needs to be established to describe the subsystem covering whole working conditions from PEMFC startup to shutdown. This paper propose a linearized parameter varying (LPV) model based on system identification. To describe the subsystem in different working conditions, the subsystem is identified near 7 equilibrium points. Identification results show that the subsystem can be described as several linear models near equilibrium points. Based on these linear models, a LPV model is proposed solving 2‐D interpolation problem. It is proved theoretically that LPV system has the same steady‐state character and linear model at equilibrium points with identification models. The simulation and experiments results also verify that the LPV model can cover the working conditions from PEMFC startup to shutdown with accuracy both in dynamic condition and steady state.</jats:p>",

This paper presents analysis of the first phase of scale model experiments and focuses on the influence that both the lateral and longitudinal separations between two vessels have on the interactions during RAS. The experiments are conducted in regular head seas on a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) and a Supply Vessel (SV) in intermediate water depth. The SV is shorter than the LHD by approximately 17%, but due to its larger block coefficient, it displaces almost 16% more than the LHD. Generally, the motions of the SV were larger than the LHD. It was found that hydrodynamic interactions can lead to large SV roll motions in head seas. Directions for future work are provided.</jats:p>",

Corona es una compañía familiar de capital privado que contribuye al desarrollo de Colombia desde su nacimiento en 1.881 y que, hoy por hoy, es uno de los conglomerados más grandes de Suramérica. El grupo Corona se ha especializado en la fabricación de productos en cerámica y porcelana para la industria de acabados en construcción y proyectos de reformas hogareñas, así como en otros sectores, como el de aislantes eléctricos, en cerámica. Corona administra además de 11 plantas de fabricación en los Estados Unidos y Suramérica, varios puntos de venta al detal en el país, así como en México y USA, con oficinas de exportación en China. La empresa hoy exporta a más de 32 países alrededor del mundo, generando más de 1.25 billones de dólares en ventas anuales. Más del 90% de los empleados de Corona trabajan en las plantas Colombianas. ¿Cuál es el secreto para que esta compañía permanezca como estructura organizacional en el tiempo, soportando los embates de las circunstancias sociales, del entorno interno y externo, así como de los efectos de la globalización?; ¿Cuáles han sido los hitos que han marcado la ruta de consolidación de este grupo, permitiéndoles no sólo la permanencia sino el crecimiento y la expansión tanto horizontal como vertical en las diferentes cadenas de valor? Estas son las preguntas de investigación sobre las cuales se desarrollará el trabajo. Apoyado en los aportes conceptuales de académicos e investigadores del tema como Maturana, Varela, Luhmann, y Bertoglio, así como en el pensamiento de Weber, este articulo intenta plantear, en forma comparativa, de qué manera la integración de los sistemas abiertos y cerrados en un momento dado, como criterio de decisión estratégico, a la luz de la revisión de la estructura organizacional del Grupo CORONA-COLCERAMICA, han sido parte fundamental de dicho éxito. El Supply Chain Orientation es definido como un concepto naciente: “La medida en que existe una predisposición entre los miembros de la red hacia la visualización de la cadena de suministro con una entidad integrada y en la satisfacción de necesidades de la red logística” (Hult, Tomas, Ketchen, David, &amp; J, 2008)(Tucker, 2011). El método de investigación realizado fue de carácter cualitativo donde se analizaron diferentes referentes tanto a nivel local como internacional en el ámbito de Supply Chain Orientation y de sistemas abiertos como adecuadas prácticas para la satisfacción de los grupos de interés del grupo.</jats:p>"

Using the principle-agent theory, we develop a CLSC model with dual collection channel without the government’s reward–penalty mechanism (RPM). An information screening contract is designed for the manufacturer to attain real information on collection effort levels; meanwhile, the optimal decision-making results of other decision variables are derived. Next, we take RPM into account to further examine the efficacy of the government’s guidance mechanism in improving collection rate and profits of CLSC members. Our results indicate that (i) the collection competition reduces the total collection quantity and the expected profits of all the CLSC members without RPM; (ii) all CLSC members’ expected profits are improved if both two collection agents select a high collection effort level without and with RPM; (iii) RPM increases buyback price, collection price, collection quantity, and franchise fee but decreases wholesale price and retail price; with the reward–penalty intensity increasing, the manufacturer’s expected profit first decreases and then increases, while the expected profits of H-type retailer and H-type third-party recycler continue to increase. We find that RPM may ultimately stimulate the collection agents to collect more WEEEs, while the intense collection competition reduces the profits of CLSC members.</jats:p>"

The heating control for molten steel consists of temperature increasing and constant temperature processes (alternatively called transient‐state and steady‐state operation). The main contribution of this study is to propose a direct power feedforward control based load current feedforward strategy for TIHPS. With this strategy, TIHPS can be controlled operating with full power to heat molten steel in transient state and guarantee the insulation effectiveness in steady state. Proper parameters of controllers are designed. Experimental results are conducted to validate the feasibility of MMC‐TIHPS and the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</jats:p>",

In this paper, an energy efficient two-stage supply pressure hydraulic system is proposed to solve the energy waste in the one-stage supply pressure system of the downhole traction robot. This novel two-stage hydraulic system can match different pressure requirements of actuator by changing the modes of supply pressure, which is helpful to reduce the energy loss and improve the efficiency for traction robot. Based on the robot working principle, the load characteristics in different actuators are obtained and the shortage in traditional hydraulic system is analyzed. The novel hydraulic system which consists of a high-pressure source and a low-pressure source is designed, including the system structure and energy supply method. According to the energy flow process, energy loss models of the system and components are established to analyze energy-saving principle of the novel hydraulic system. The feasibility and efficiency of two-stage supply pressure system are verified by simulating the operating process of telescopic mechanism. Finally, the simulation shows that control precision of the novel system can reach 3.5 mm and the efficiency is increased to 59.53%, which can provide theoretical reference for design of hydraulic drive system in traction robot and the efficiency improvement of multiactuator mobile robot.</jats:p>",

Here the magnitude, spatial structure, and seasonal evolution of the ocean forcing on the proglacial fjord off a rapidly retreating glacier (Jorge Montt, Patagonia) are characterized using data from multiple shipboard surveys from 2010 to 2016, a multiyear mooring array, and a weather station. The melting of the glacier is forced by relatively warm (8–11°C) waters entering the fjord over a shallow (45 m deep) sill ≈20 km from the terminus. This warm subsurface water is renewed every summer from the surface layer of Gulf of Penas., is transported along the 100‐km long Baker Channel, and reaches the proglacial fjord in the late austral summer to early fall, where it remains relatively warm until late austral spring. Analysis of the freshwater fractions in the fjord reveals that the total freshwater content has a strong seasonal signal with maximum fractional values in the summer, mostly explained by the seasonality of subglacial discharge from the glacier. The submarine melting fraction has no strong seasonal signal, but is a first‐order contributor to the freshwater content of the fjord in winter. This seasonal evolution is consistent with idealized theories of meltwater production, and suggests that the seasonal supply of heat is critical to sustain a high mean temperature for melting, but does not directly control the melting rate variability.</jats:p>",

A systematic approach for selecting hydropower sites within river networks may help to minimize the detrimental effects of small hydropower on biodiversity. In addition, a better understanding of reach‐ and basin‐scale impacts is key for designing planning tools. We synthesize the available information about (1) reach‐scale and (2) basin‐scale impacts of small hydropower plants on biodiversity and ecosystem function, and (3) interactions with other anthropogenic stressors. We then discuss state‐of‐the‐art, spatially explicit planning tools and suggest how improved knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary impacts of hydropower can be incorporated into project development. Such tools can be used to balance the benefits of hydropower production with the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Adequate planning tools that consider basin‐scale effects and interactions with other stressors, such as climate change, can maximize long‐term conservation.</jats:p>",

Defects in the process of nucleocytoplasmic transport or in its machinery have been frequently described in human diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, but only in a few cases of developmental disorders. Here we report biallelic mutations in the nucleoporin<jats:italic>NUP88</jats:italic>as a novel cause of lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) in two families. FADS comprises a spectrum of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders with congenital malformations related to impaired fetal movement. We show that genetic disruption of<jats:italic>nup88</jats:italic>in zebrafish results in pleiotropic developmental defects reminiscent of those seen in affected human fetuses, including locomotor defects as well as defects at neuromuscular junctions. Phenotypic alterations become visible at distinct developmental stages, both in affected human fetuses and in zebrafish, whereas early stages of development are apparently normal. The zebrafish phenotypes caused by nup88 deficiency are only rescued by expressing wild-type nup88 and not the disease-linked mutant forms of nup88. Furthermore, using human and mouse cell lines as well as immunohistochemistry on fetal muscle tissue, we demonstrate that NUP88 depletion affects rapsyn, a key regulator of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Together, our studies provide the first characterization of NUP88 in vertebrate development, expand our understanding of the molecular events causing FADS, and suggest that variants in<jats:italic>NUP88</jats:italic>should be investigated in cases of FADS.</jats:p>"

Its evaluation indicators are the current distributions and the integrated impedance of traction network. This paper proposes a spatial magnetic-field description method for the auto-transformer (AT) power supply system. Due to the limitations of previous approaches, all the real loop circuits of the AT system are considered for structuring a loop circuit matrix. At first, different description processes are divided, respectively, into those for the right side and the left side of the load. Then, considering that two types of return conductors exist in an AT system, a certain current ratio deduced in existing studies is introduced. As the introduced current ratio of the left side of the load is approximate, an iterative scheme is adopted. By constantly adjusting current ratio to satisfy a constraint condition of circuit voltages, accurate traction network impedance is obtained. Last, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed description method, two real-life experiments in a Chinese HSR line are performed, which indicate that the proposed method can not only directly reflect complete and accurate current distribution, but also deduce the exact traction network integrated impedance.</jats:p>"

This paper explores whether the use of a new HIV prevention product, with 100% efficacy but modeled after pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), could change the price and quantity of condomless commercial sex supplied. We collected stated preference data from 122 HIV‐negative female sex workers in urban South Africa, using a repeated choice experiment to simulate the impact of using PrEP on choices. Results suggest that the price premium for condomless sex would decrease by 73% with PrEP use and the quantity of condomless sex is predicted to increase by a factor of 2.27. Act price does not significantly affect choices without protection but strongly influences choices under full HIV protection. The utility offered by condoms reduces by around 15% under PrEP use. Because new HIV prevention products do not protect against other STIs or pregnancy, the unintended consequences of introducing HIV prevention products should be closely monitored, whereas users should not face stigma or blame for reacting rationally to exogenous changes to market conditions.</jats:p>",

In addition, great imbalanced development has been observed in different regions in China, as supported by the literature review. It is necessary to help companies in the supply chain to adjust their pricing strategies according to regional differences. This paper is aimed at answering the following two questions: (1) After introducing online channels, what strategies should the recycling center adopt to adjust online recycling prices and to readjust the transfer price of offline channels? (2) How do recycling centers and TPR in city A &amp; B modify their pricing strategies in accordance with logistics costs or consumers’ awareness of sustainability changes in city B? To solve the above questions, models were made to study the pricing strategies of recycling centers and the TPR based on the Stackelberg game in a dual-channel reverse supply chain in two cities. The results indicate that recycling centers will benefit from the increase in consumers’ awareness of sustainability and the reduction in logistics costs of the online channel in city B; this is in contrast to the TPR in this city. We also find that the revenue of the TPR in city A will be affected when the above two factors in city B change. Its increase or decrease depends on the selection of pricing strategy by the recycling center.</jats:p>"

The plant is configured around a 2-kWel Organic Rankine Cycle turbine and solar field, made of Fresnel mirrors. The solar field is used to heat thermal oil to the temperature of about 240 °C. This thermal energy is used to run the Organic Rankine Cycle turbine and the heat rejected in its condenser (about 18-kWth) is utilized for hot water production and living space heating.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The plant is equipped with a latent heat thermal storage to extend its operation by about 4 hours during the evening building occupancy period. The phase change material used is Solar salt with the melting/solidification point at about 220 °C. The total mass of the PCM is about 3,800 kg and the thermal storage capacity is about 100 kWh. The operation of the plant is monitored by a central controller unit. The main components of the plant are being manufactured and laboratory tested with the aim to assemble the plant at the demonstration site, located in Catalonia, Spain. At the first stage of investigations the ORC turbine will be directly integrated with the solar filed to evaluate their joint performance. During the second stage of tests, the Latent Heat Thermal Storage will be incorporated into the plant and its performance during the charging and discharging processes will be investigated. It is planned that the continuous filed tests of the whole plant will be performed during the 2018–2019 period.</jats:p>",

Lowland elite field hockey players resided at simulated altitude (≥14 h/day at 2,800–3,000 m) and performed regular training plus six repeated-sprint sessions in normobaric hypoxia (3,000 m; LHTLH; n = 6) or normoxia (0 m; LHTL; n = 6) or lived at sea level with regular training only (LLTL; n = 6). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the m. vastus lateralis before (pre), immediately after (post-1), and 3 wk after the intervention (post-2). Changes over time between groups were compared, including likelihood of the effect size (ES). Succinate dehydrogenase activity in LHTLH largely increased from pre to post-1 (~35%), likely more than LHTL and LLTL (ESs = large-very large), and remained elevated in LHTLH at post-2 (~12%) vs. LHTL (ESs = moderate-large). Fiber cross-sectional area remained fairly similar in LHTLH from pre to post-1 and post-2 but was increased at post-1 and post-2 in LHTL and LLTL (ES = moderate-large). A unique observation was that LHTLH and LHTL, but not LLTL, improved their combination of fiber size and oxidative capacity. Small-to-moderate differences in oxygen supply capacity (i.e., myoglobin and capillarization) were observed between groups. In conclusion, elite team-sport athletes substantially increased their skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, while maintaining fiber size, after only 14 days of chronic hypoxic residence combined with six repeated-sprint training sessions in hypoxia. </jats:p><jats:p> NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Our novel findings show that elite team-sport athletes were able to substantially increase the skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in type I and II fibers (+37 and +32%, respectively), while maintaining fiber size after only 14 days of chronic hypoxic residence combined with six repeated-sprint sessions in hypoxia. This increase in oxidative capacity was superior to groups performing chronic hypoxic residence with repeated sprints in normoxia and residence at sea level with regular training only. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of indoor positioning technology, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has become the preferred solution due to its advantages of non-line-of-sight, non-contact and rapid identification. However, the accuracy of existing RFID indoor positioning algorithms is easily affected by the tag density and algorithm efficiency, and their environmental robustness is not strong enough. In this paper, we have introduced an RFID positioning algorithm based on the Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) fused with semi-supervised online sequential extreme learning machine (SOS-ELM), which is called the GSOS-ELM algorithm. The GSOS-ELM algorithm automatically adjusts the regularization weights of the SOS-ELM algorithm through the GSO algorithm, so that it can quickly obtain the optimal regularization weights under different initial conditions; at the same time, the semi-supervised characteristics of the GSOS-ELM algorithm can significantly reduce the number of labeled reference tags and reduce the cost of positioning systems. In addition, the online learning phase of the GSOS-ELM algorithm can continuously update the system to perceive changes in the environment and resist the environmental interference. We have carried out experiments to study the influence factors and validate the performance, both the simulation and testbed experiment results show that compared with other algorithms, our proposed GSOS-ELM localization system can achieve more accurate positioning results and has certain adaptability to the changes of the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To ensure supply chain coordination and equitable profit allocation when there is bilateral asymmetric information, a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer with private manufacturing cost information and one retailer with private selling cost information is considered. A bilateral adverse selection model is established with a virtual altruistic principal as the coordination subject, for which the supply chain coordination conditions and an allocation rule for the supply chain surplus are then given. It was found that contract coordination depended on the costs and risk rates of both parties and market demand; that is, the lower the costs and the risk rate, the easier the supply chain coordination. Second, the trading volume distortion degree was positively correlated with production cost, sales cost, and price sensitivity and negatively correlated with the market environment parameter. Third, the allocation proportion for the supply chain surplus was determined. Finally, under a specific cost distribution assumption, a numerical example was given to simulate the contract execution and analyze the relationships between costs and profit.</jats:p>",
