Harvest priorities for each stand type were chosen by maximization of conifer output over alternative periods of time subject to volume, species, and inventory constraints. Results indicated that timber harvest from forest industry land would decline in the next several decades, but that this decline would be offset by increased output from nonindustrial holdings. A substantial buildup of hardwood inventories on small private ownerships is anticipated. West. J. Appl. For. 4(3):80-84, July 1989.</jats:p>",

The necessity for this arises when individual supplies exceed allowable levels of certain chemical or biological constituents. An explicit methodology to make these calculations for complex water distribution systems is presented. The methodology requires the solution of a set of linear equations of order equal to the number of junctions. The equation coefficients are based on the flow distribution for the system demands under consideration. Because the explicit solution procedure requires the simultaneous solution of large equation sets for large networks, an alternative solution technique was developed. This technique solved the equations in a simple, cyclic manner requiring little computer storage and proved to be an efficient scheme for carrying out the calculations.</jats:p>",

Waterfowl, amphibious and aquatic wildlife have all benefited from this change, especially important after so much wetland has been drained and ploughed to increase agricultural production. Modern reservoirs include landscape and conservation in their planning, construction and operation, often leading to their notification as Sites of Special Scientific Interest soon after their construction. Examples in the Anglian Water and Thames Water regions are discussed to demonstrate their value to wildlife as well as fulfilling their prime function for water supply. Pitsford Water (Northamptonshire), Rutland Water (Leicestershire), Staines Reservoirs (Surrey), and Walthamstow Reservoirs (Greater London) show varying levels of conservation planning. Protection from recreational activity is shown to be an essential part of management at these sites.</jats:p>",

Alperovits and U. Shamir (1977) and has received much attention in the last 10 years. It consists of two stages that are solved in alteration: (1) a LP problem is solved for a given feasible flow distribution and (2) a search is conducted in the space of flow variables, based on the gradient of the objective function (GOF). In this paper a matrix formulation is given for both stages using well‐known graph theory matrices. It is proven that the mathematical expression of the GOF is independent of the choice of the sets of loops and paths along which the head constraints are formulated. This is contrary to the claim made by I. C. Goulter et al. (1986). The original GOF expression is shown to have been an approximation of the steepest direction, but still gives good results. Finally, the search procedure is improved by using the projected gradient method.</jats:p>",

Poly-Si films with a strong 〈100〉 and 〈110〉 preferential orientation (P.O.) are obtained by changing the rf power for generating the plasma under the same preparation condition. The surface of the PECVD films with dominant 〈100〉 and 〈110〉 textures is very smooth in contrast with that of LPCVD films. These textures are maintained after thermal oxidation at 1000 °C, and the degree of P.O. and the grain size increase.</jats:p>",

The nature and extent of this scarcity are examined in detail. While water may not be scarce in the West, cheap water certainly is. The optimality of water marketing is also dependent upon various <jats:italic>ceteris paribus</jats:italic> assumptions. These assumptions are questioned due to certain <jats:italic>bydrologic</jats:italic> uncertainties and external <jats:italic>costs</jats:italic> associated with the use and <jats:italic>development</jats:italic> of western water. Considerable benefit, particularly in expanding <jats:italic>residential supply</jats:italic>, can be achieved from more market‐like incentives to <jats:italic>conserve</jats:italic> in use. But the resource's social value about rights argues for policies based on equitable sharing.</jats:p>",
