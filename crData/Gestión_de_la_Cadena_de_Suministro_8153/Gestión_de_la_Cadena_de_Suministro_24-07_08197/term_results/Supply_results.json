This examination focuses on identifying common styles of theorizing in supply chain management research, which are defined as specific modes of reasoning to make inferences about supply chain phenomena. Armed with this definition, the authors elaborate how research in the field has for the most part hinged on a propositional style as a common base for theorizing and theoretical contributions. The analysis that is provided emphasizes the limits of this style, particularly when it is considered as the preferred form for all theoretical contributions. The authors, in turn, make the case for a pluralistic system of knowledge production that supports the use of multiple theorizing styles that, when used alongside one another in a coordinated or co‐oriented manner, will lead to a better understanding of supply chain management phenomena.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern supply chains face escalating vulnerabilities, especially in the maritime industry. Traditional lean supply chain management lacks flexibility and risk mitigation measures, encouraging the proposal of agile-focused SCM. The success of companies is intricately tied to supplier performance, highlighting the pivotal role of procurement in risk mitigation through supplier relationship management (SRM) strategies. This emphasizes the role of procurement in risk mitigation since they manage suppliers using supplier relationship management (SRM) strategies. To properly apply SRM strategies, suppliers are segmented. The standard segmentation method is the Purchasing Portfolio Matrix (PPM). The downfall of this matrix is the focus on power relations, which misses a softer relationship side of SRM. The Supplier Potential Matrix (SPM) includes relationship dynamics but overlooks supply risk. A new matrix for segmentation is proposed, the Integrated Supplier Matrix (ISM), which combines and integrates the PPM and SPM. A case study in a maritime company assesses risks using the Best-Worst Method (BWM), revealing significant procurement risks such as product uniqueness, regulatory compliance, and external factors. The ISM then establishes relationships between supplier willingness, capabilities, risks, and profit impact. The findings emphasize the critical role of communication and trust in managing trade-offs within supplier relationship management (SRM).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The implementation of the reservation of the heat supply system to a populated area was analyzed. It is noted that increasing the reliability of heat supply to consumers is a fundamental task, especially given the current military situation in Ukraine. The solution to this difficulty is considered when reserving heat supply by constructing a backup source of thermal energy using alternative types of fuel. A combined thermal scheme for connecting a hot water heat generator using biofuel to the existing city heat supply system is proposed to increase its reliability and survivability, which ensures the efficiency and reliability of operation of the heat supply system during the heating and summer periods. It is shown the possibility of operating a solid fuel heat generator with its power significantly less than the total heat load of the city's heating supply in several operating modes: during the heating period - for heating the return coolant at the inlet to the existing gas boiler house; in the summer period - for the needs of hot water supply in full; in the event of an emergency shutdown of a gas boiler house in winter - to maintain the viability of the heat supply system. The results of a calculation analysis of the operation of a 5,0 MW biofuel heat generator under different operating modes are presented. Heating the return coolant by 4...5 °C in winter, in addition to saving natural gas, prevents low-temperature corrosion of existing gas boilers. In the event of an emergency lack of natural gas supply, the combustion of wood chips ensures the production of thermal energy at the level of thermal losses of the heating network while maintaining the coolant temperature at least 3 °C at the calculated external air temperature. Thanks to the accumulation of thermal energy at night in the summer period in the volume of heating network pipes as a buffer tank, compensation for peak hot water consumption is provided with the available power of the solid fuel boiler house equal to the average load of the hot water supply system. When implementing a project to back up the heat supply system in Lutsk using a combined thermal scheme for connecting a solid fuel boiler house, an increase in the reliability and viability of the system and natural gas savings of 40,5% during a year of operation were achieved</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the commitments made under the Paris Climate Agreement, the scientific community has initiated a strategic increase in the share of renewable energy sources while gradually reducing dependence on traditional carbon fuels. Priority is given to the acceleration of the development of the photovoltaic industry, which has shown a constant increase in capacity over the past decades. According to the energy and climate strategies of the European Union, a significant increase in the amount of energy generation due to solar sources is planned. Therefore, the article is devoted to the development of a solar heat supply system based on a hybrid thermal photovoltaic solar collector with an improved design and analysis of the main characteristics of its operation using computer modeling. The authors have developed a 3D computer model of the proposed hybrid system with a solar collector by using SolidWorks software. The change in the temperature of the heat carrier in the hybrid thermal photovoltaic solar collector under constant solar radiation was analyzed. The temperature change of the coolant in the thermal accumulator of the system was also investigated. The results of the simulation of thermal processes revealed the key regularities of the temperature increase during the computer experiment, both in the hybrid thermal photovoltaic solar collector and in the thermal accumulator. The change in the instantaneous specific heat capacity of the developed solar collector was analyzed, and its average efficiency was estimated. The trends of changes in the thermal efficiency of the developed heat supply system during the computer experiment were determined. The novelty of the study is that the design of the hybrid thermophotoelectric solar collector has been improved, its 3D computer model has been developed, and the main thermal characteristics of the developed heat supply system with constant solar radiation have been obtained, which will contribute to the development of calculation methods for such heat supply systems with hybrid solar collectors in the future.</jats:p>"

However, as many manufacturers must continue to rely on market governance, this research introduces a governance strategy, manufacturer–retailer bridge governance (MRBG), for these manufacturers. The research examines the governance effects of MRBG on distributor behavior and the contingent effects of manufacturer status and MRBG strategic orientation. Hypotheses are developed based on in‐depth interviews with sales and purchasing managers and tested in two experiments with sales managers. The results show that MRBG has a double‐edged effect on distributor behavior, and this effect is moderated by manufacturer status. Moreover, the alignment between manufacturer status (high versus low) and MRBG strategic orientation (collaboration versus arbitrage) influences the effectiveness of MRBG.</jats:p>",

Problems at PT XYZ include overstocked items and damaged or defective product packaging during production, storage, and distribution. To compete in the Indonesian lubricant business market, it is necessary to analyze the supply chain performance using the SCOR model approach. The goal is to design supply chain performance indicators and propose improvements for low-performing areas. There are 12 existing KPIs and 8 additional KPIs from literature studies that have been adapted to the company's needs. KPI properties are compiled, and data is processed to determine the weights for each performance level with the help of Expert Choice. Data processing is carried out by calculating secondary data obtained for each KPI, except for KPI-8, KPI-13, KPI-14, and KPI-19, which do not have data requirements. Normalization is carried out for each KPI, and the total supply chain performance measurement for PT XYZ is 56.78, with an additional contribution value of 13.3. It can be concluded that around 70% of the maximum performance has been achieved, which falls into the \"Good\" category.</jats:p>"

Digital SCF is established on the basis that financing companies need to provide global data to the financial service providers. However, some enterprises may be unwilling to share information for financing suppliers due to data security which affects the development of such new SCF pattern. In this paper, we propose a solution scheme based on data federation technology and evaluate the feasibility of data federation technology in SCF by dynamic evolutionary game analysis. A trustworthy financing service model is established based on data federation technology and the model highlights the characteristic of data availability but invisibility. Evolutionary simulation analysis was conducted on factors that affect data federation technology applied in SCF. The findings indicate that SMEs can get effective financial services if we use data federation technology to enhance the mutual data trust between the two parties.</p>",

This study's main goal was to assess the effect of supply chain flexibility and performance of food and beverages manufacturing firms in Kenya. The cross-sectional survey was used in the study. Senior procurement managers from 246 Kenyan companies that produce food and beverages were the target audience. Krejcie and Morgan (1970) were used to estimate a sample size of 150 respondents. Simple random sampling was used to choose the sample. Pilot research of 15 firms, representing 10% of the sample size, was carried out, and 13 questionnaires were returned. Semi-structured and self-administered questionnaires were employed by the researcher. 135 questionnaires were given to responders and 119 were returned. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, were used to analyze the data. Correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing were also used in inferential statistics. SPSS version 28 was used for processing the acquired data. Tables were used to display the data. According to the dependability results, every variable satisfies the requirement for a Cronbach's alpha value of greater than 0.7. Criteria, content, and construct validity were also examined. The findings showed a favorable, substantial linear significance between SCF and performance of food and beverages companies in Kenyan (β: 0.590, t: 7.910, p ≤ 0.00) In addition, the results indicated that when one unit in supply chain flexibility grows there is a rise in a unit of the performance.

This research employed cross-sectional descriptive research designs. A total of 217 food and beverage processing businesses in Nairobi City County, Kenya, was the target. Stratified random sampling was used to choose a representative sample of 108 companies. Using a drop and pick-later approach, a structured questionnaire was used to collect the primary data. 15 processing companies from nearby Kiambu County participated in a pilot study that the researcher used to evaluate the validity and dependability of the research tool. An internal consistency method with a coefficient of 0.7 or above was considered reliable using Cronbach's Alpha. A diagnostic examination was conducted. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the data analysis. The mean, percentage, and standard deviations of the data were displayed. To analyze the data, inferential statistics were employed. There is a strong and positive correlation between green procurement methods and supply chain performance. The results confirmed that the variable's P-value was 0.000, R2 = 0.446, β = 0.152, and t = 2.503. According to the study's findings, the majority of Nairobi City County's food and beverage processing companies have embraced green procurement strategies. The research indicates that the processing industry used green procurement extensively in a number of ways, including green specification, cost-cutting, eco-friendly products, environmental policy, green-designed products, environmental impacts, environmental awareness seminars, and the purchase of hard-to-dispose-of items. Therefore, the study concluded that processing firms must heavily invest in green procurement methods with regard to sustainable procurement practices to improve supply chain performance. Organizations should implement rules that prioritize the best green procurement practices. These include procuring products with green specifications and are eco-friendly, the firm to develop an environmental policy, the firm to reduce its environmental impacts in terms of energy conservation and conduct environmental awareness seminars.</jats:p>"

This study assesses the value of sharing delivery due date updates, which are then used to convert spent time into a fraction of the expected total time for order fulfillment (i.e., progress updates), to synchronize the delivery of components for an automotive manufacturer who, amid long and variable lead times for semiconductor chips, maintains a strategy of waiting for the delivery of all needed parts before commencing production. Having progress updates in a fractional form puts numerical bounds (i.e., 0% to 100%) on the shared information, and this facilitates closed-form analytical comparisons. We develop analytical models to show decreases in expected assembly-related costs based on the progress update information shared between two suppliers—one supplier has a shorter and more reliable order fulfillment lead time than the other. When there are more than two suppliers, we use a simulation model to estimate the expected value of sharing progress updates. Our results show that increasing the frequency of shared progress updates, and having more suppliers share progress updates, results in increased cost-savings percentages. However, the opposite occurs with increasing uncertainty in suppliers’ delivery lead times. The computational study provides support for the existence of a critical mass level of suppliers needed to achieve a given percentage cost saving. This study can help automakers to make informed decisions on encouraging information sharing among suppliers, by first creating a critical mass of suppliers to share progress updates. Our investigations also help show the conditions in which to best leverage such information sharing strategies while waiting for the delivery of all needed components prior to production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction supply chain confronts interruption risks that raise significant concerns regarding industry safety and stability. Consequently, exploring risk management strategies from both enterprise and supply chain network perspectives is crucial. This study employs complex network theory and the cascade failure model to propose a methodology tailored to the unique characteristics of the construction supply chain, facilitating the identification of key risk nodes and the conduct of invulnerability analyses. By evaluating the importance of construction enterprise nodes and their risk propagation ability during cascade failures, this method enables the comprehensive identification of key risk node enterprises within the construction supply chain network. Furthermore, this study examines and discusses strategies for enhancing network invulnerability by taking into account node capacity, load, and resilience. Empirical results indicate that the key nodes and risk nodes in the construction supply chain network are mainly located upstream and downstream, displaying specific distribution patterns. In addition to core enterprises, key risk nodes comprise some strong suppliers at the intermediary and lower tiers of the supply chain. Adjustments to node enterprise parameters like capacity, load, and resilience have diverse impacts on the invulnerability of the construction supply chain network. This study clarifies the distribution patterns of key risk nodes within the construction supply chain network and the variations in network invulnerability under particular conditions, providing valuable insights for risk management decision-making.</jats:p>"

As major banks reduced their branch networks in recent years, many firms have lost access to their local bank. We evaluate the impact of a large number of branch closures on firm operations, wages and employment, and economic output in Brazil from 2011 to 2021. We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy with staggered treatment timing, employing both two-way fixed effects and Callaway-Sant'Anna estimators. Our study finds that bank branch closures result in a reduction in establishments with active operations from 1.2% initially to 8.1% within 4-7 years, a 0.5 decline in weekly hours of formal employment, and a compression in the real wage distribution. Micro firms, trade and service firms, and agricultural firms are found to be the most vulnerable.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In current competitive market, efficient supply chain management is essential to achieving sustainable business success. This paper explores the integration of lean principles into supply chain operations and its impact on enhancing the value creation stream. Lean principles, originally developed in the manufacturing sector, focus on waste reduction, continuous improvement, and value maximization from the customer perspective. By applying these principles to supply chain management, organizations can streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency. The study investigates key lean methodologies, such as Just-In-Time inventory, Total Quality Management and the 5S system, and examines their application in various stages of the supply chain, including procurement, production, and distribution. Through a combination of case studies and empirical data, the research highlights how lean initiatives lead to significant improvements in supply chain performance metrics, such as lead time, inventory levels, and defect rates. Findings demonstrate that lean supply chain practices foster a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration among supply chain partners, ultimately enhancing the responsiveness and agility of the supply chain. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges and best practices for implementing lean principles in supply chain management, providing a roadmap for organizations seeking to optimize their supply chain value creation. The application of lean principles in supply chain management not only drives operational excellence but also contributes to greater customer satisfaction and competitive advantage. This paper underscores the strategic importance of lean thinking in creating a robust and value-driven supply chain.</jats:p>",

This value shows that supply chain management activities at PT. PG Candi Baru is running moderately and obtained 9 KPIs that have not reached the target. Waste is the cause of the 9 KPIs not achieving the target, namely waste defects, waiting, not utilizing employee knowledge, skills and abilities and extra processing. Recommendations for improvement given to the company to reduce the occurrence of waste are: For defects in sugar quality, the proposed improvement is to carry out milling in accordance with established standards and use raw materials that comply with specifications. When waiting for raw materials to be late, the proposed improvement is that the plant department must carry out earlier purchasing planning to avoid waste waiting and prioritize TS suppliers because they have a higher weight than other suppliers. The proposed improvement for the production department is training on how to forecast production scheduling. In extra processing, the proposed improvement is that the company can provide a quality control list when inspecting the finished product so that the inspection is more controlled.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the long-term effect of fertility on the elderly’s labor supply in China. By applying the instrumental variable methods on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset, I find that having more children decreases the elderly’s labor supply, especially for the disadvantaged elderly, including females, those living in rural regions and those with low levels of educational attainment. The negative effect is concentrated on the effect on the extensive margin of labor supply, rather than the intensive margin. I rule out co-residence with adult children and providing care to grandchildren as potential channels for the negative effect on the elderly’s labor supply. The increase in the net transfer from children as the number of children increases can be a viable explanation for the negative effect. The linkage between fertility and labor supply of the elderly has important policy implications.</p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The term “Long COVID” is commonly used to describe persisting symptoms after acute COVID‑19. Until now, proposed mechanisms for the explanation of Long COVID have not related quantitative measurements to basic laws. In this work, a common framework for the Long COVID pathophysiological mechanism is presented, based on the blood supply deprivation and the flow diffusion equation. Methods: Case-control studies with statistically significant differences between cases (post-COVID patients) and controls, from multiple tissues and geographical areas, were gathered and tabulated. Microvascular loss (ML) was quantified by vessel density reduction (VDR), foveal avascular zone enlargement (FAZE), capillary density reduction (CDR), and percentage of perfused vessels reduction (PPVR). Both ML and hemodynamic decrease (HD), were incorporated in the tissue blood supply reduction (SR) estimation. Results: ML data were found from 763 post-COVID patients with an average VDR, FAZE, CDR, and PPVR of 16%, 31%, 14%, and 21%, respectively. The average HD from 72 post-COVID patients was 37%. The estimated SR for multiple tissues with data from 634 post-COVID patients reached a sizeable 47%. This large SR creates conditions of lower mass diffusion rates, hypoxia, and undernutrition, which at a multi-tissue level, for a long time, can explain the wide variety of the Long COVID symptoms. Conclusions: Disruption of peripheral tissue blood supply by the contribution of both ML and HD is proposed here to be the principal cause of the mechanism leading to Long COVID symptoms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to play a huge role in the digital industry revolution, 4.0 and beyond. Added challenges presented by pandemic conditions has increased the need for effective use of digital and optimization techniques for a sustainable supply chain, both from suppliers’ and buyers’ perspectives. Buyers need to maintain a healthy pool of suppliers that can sustain added stresses and risks at times of crises, and suppliers need to improve their presence and visibility of their capabilities. Both these requirements are often addressed with more effective use of technology, particularly AI-based techniques, once the digital infrastructure with the right data set is established. For optimized supply chain management, choosing a supplier based solely on cost may prove insufficient. Buyers now must play a more proactive role towards establishing a healthy and functional arsenal of suppliers. This often requires the use of procurement decisions that go beyond short-term cost optimization but that targets long term risk optimization. Towards this goal, one of the most prevalent approaches used for planning, optimizing and forecasting the supply chains is AI-based methods. Decision support systems or relevant mechanisms need to employ practical AI techniques to handle these complex decision processes. Genetic Algorithms (GA), one of the widely used AI techniques, provides the optimal solution by analyzing multiple criteria at the same time to make an effective and efficient selection in supplier selection. Incorporating multiple criteria such as price, delivery time, customs and taxes, the supplier company's production type, warranty policy, quality assurance tests is very important in the competitive market environment. Among these, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) stands out for their ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, enabling more effective and efficient supplier selection by considering multiple criteria such as price, delivery time, customs, taxes, production types, warranty policies, and quality assurance tests. This capability is vital in the competitive market environment, where choosing a supplier involves not just cost considerations but also long-term risk optimization. Thus, LLMs integrate seamlessly into decision support systems, providing optimal solutions that enhance both planning and forecasting in supply chain management. In this study, an analysis was carried out through text generation with Distilgpt2, a large language model, as an effective way for supplier selection. Supplier selection was carried out using this artificial intelligence approach, which was carried out with an end-to-end approach, and the selection was made both in time and effectively.</p>"

Inter-supply chain management has transformed in responding to the need to pay attention to environmental impacts into environmental management in line with sustainable development goals (SDGs) called green supply chain management (Green SCM). Green SCM has been widely applied to large industries, but it is still a new thing for small and medium industries and lacks information about the concept and its application. This study explores the published Green SCM indexed in the Scopus database. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,776 Scopus-indexed documents from the first year of 1996 to determine the progress of GSCM research. Research trends and keywords that are still relevant and emerging have been explored and explained. Research gaps that require follow-up have been identified, and future research directions have also been discussed.</p>"

Due to these current circumstances, there is an imbalance between the limited supply of water and the rising demand for water. According to this perspective, accurate data on the spatial and temporal patterns of stockholder water demand can only be obtained through effective water planning and management. Geographic information system (GIS) mapping and smart metering are being used to implement intelligent water supply systems for dependable water supply management. In water supply systems, GIS models aid in data comprehension, analysis, and querying using advanced technologies that can significantly enhance work in the field of urban planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This qualitative study explores the pivotal role of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in enhancing resilience within e-commerce supply chains. In an era marked by rapid digital transformation and global interconnectedness, the resilience of supply chains has become a strategic imperative for organizations striving to maintain operational efficiency and meet customer expectations. Through semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, procurement officers, and strategic sourcing specialists across diverse industries, this research investigates the strategies, challenges, and outcomes associated with SRM practices. Findings reveal that effective communication and collaboration are fundamental to successful SRM, fostering trust, transparency, and responsiveness in supplier relationships. Strategic risk management through proactive identification and mitigation strategies enables organizations to navigate uncertainties such as economic fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. SRM implementation yields significant organizational benefits, including improved supply chain efficiencies, enhanced product quality, and increased customer satisfaction. However, challenges such as technological complexities, cultural differences among global suppliers, and regulatory compliance issues underscore the need for adaptive strategies and digital investments. The integration of digital technologies such as AI and blockchain enhances SRM effectiveness by enabling real-time data exchange, predictive insights, and decision-making capabilities. Ultimately, SRM emerges as a cornerstone of sustainable growth and competitive advantage in e-commerce, empowering organizations to optimize supply chain performance and resilience amidst dynamic market conditions.</jats:p>"

This study explores the impact of digital technologies on inventory management, focusing on the adoption of IoT sensors, RFID tags, AI-driven analytics, and cloud-based systems. Through a qualitative research approach encompassing interviews with industry professionals and secondary data analysis, the study examines key themes including enhanced inventory visibility, improved accuracy, advanced demand forecasting, and streamlined supply chain collaboration. Findings reveal that digital technologies significantly enhance inventory visibility by providing real-time tracking and data integration capabilities. This facilitates accurate inventory monitoring and decision-making, reducing errors and optimizing inventory levels to meet fluctuating demand effectively. AI-driven analytics and machine learning models emerge as pivotal tools for predictive demand forecasting, enabling businesses to anticipate market trends and adjust inventory strategies accordingly. Additionally, cloud-based systems and electronic data interchange (EDI) foster improved communication and coordination among supply chain partners, enhancing overall operational efficiency. Despite these benefits, challenges such as system integration complexities, high implementation costs, data quality management, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory compliance issues are prevalent. Successful adoption of digital inventory management solutions requires strategic planning, investment in technology infrastructure, and organizational readiness to navigate these challenges effectively. This study contributes to the understanding of how digital transformation reshapes inventory management practices, offering insights for researchers and practitioners alike to leverage digital technologies for enhanced supply chain performance and competitive advantage</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing supply disruptions that often occur in business, firms can increase redundancy through supplier diversification and manage demand-side problems through responsive pricing and demand information sharing. We consider a Stackelberg–Nash game consisting of two competing suppliers with heterogeneity in terms of reliability and production cost and a manufacturer, and study the manufacturer’s strategy choice problem. The manufacturer has two strategies, namely responsive pricing and information sharing. The interplay between responsive pricing and information sharing is analyzed by defining the value of responsive pricing. The results of the study show that responsive pricing always benefits the manufacturer. Responsive pricing increases the manufacturer’s incentive to use dual sourcing, whereas the manufacturer with committed pricing will only choose single sourcing. Under responsive pricing, the demand potential and the unreliable supplier’s disruption probability similarly affect the manufacturer’s sourcing decision. As the demand potential or the unreliable supplier’s disruption probability increases, the manufacturer will tend to prefer dual sourcing. When the reliable supplier’s production cost is moderate, the manufacturer with responsive pricing will choose to share demand information, while the opposite is true for the manufacturer with committed pricing. At this point, responsive pricing and information sharing will complement each other.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Radical-right behavior is increasing across Western democracies, often very fast. Previous research has shown, however, that political attitudes and preferences do not change this fast. This book argues that, to understand these patterns, one needs to appreciate the crucial role of social norms as drivers of political behavior. It builds on a norms-based theory of political supply and demand, arguing that growing radical-right behavior is driven by individuals who already held radical-right views, but who did not act on them because they thought that they were socially unacceptable. If these voters do not express their preferences, politicians can underestimate how much latent support there is for radical-right policy. This leaves the radical right with less skilled leaders, who are unable to mobilize even radical-right voters to support them. However, if politicians realize that there is more private support for radical-right policy than is typically observable, they have an incentive to run for election on a radical-right platform and mobilize silent radical-right views. Their electoral success, in turn, makes radical-right individuals become more comfortable showing their views, and impels more politicians to join the radical right. The argument of the book makes us rethink how political preferences translate into behavior, shows how social norms affect the interaction of political supply and demand, and highlights how a political culture that promotes inclusion can erode.</jats:p>",

However, many countries face the opposite issue and instead have a shortage of necessary, life-saving medical supplies. The duality of the issue is a harsh and widespread reality throughout the world. For example, the United States generates about 4.7 million pounds of medical waste yearly (Zygourakis et al., 2015; Thiel et al., 2020). In contrast, India, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic, faced a massive shortage of essential equipment like N-95 respirators, face shields, as well as ventilators. To reduce the worldwide inequities that arise due to the imbalance of medical supplies, Blueprints for Pangaea (B4P), a medical surplus recovery organization was founded. B4P, headquartered at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, redistributes unused medical supplies to places in need both locally and internationally, effectively reducing medical supply inequities one shipment at a time. This paper aims to explore the key components and global dynamics contributing to medical waste and to consider B4P as a potential model for addressing this problem.</jats:p>"

Off-Site Construction (OSC), through better control of the various parameters involved, can bring important advantages, such as the reduction of construction time, the improvement of product and process quality, etc. In the last years, the rapidly growing demand for thermal insulation systems, stimulated also by tax incentives, has generated a unique situation in Italy compared to the rest of Europe, also leading to a considerable fragmentation of the supply chain with several players involved (component and system manufacturers, distributors, and installers). The complexity of such context makes Italy an extremely challenging and insightful case study for a supply chain and sustainability study, also considering the fact that the energy efficiency of the Italian building stock represents a crucial challenge to achieve the country’s energy saving goals since 40% of final energy consumption derives from buildings and 75% of the building stock presents a low energy performance (energy labels E, F and G). This article presents both an analysis of the Italian market of manufacturers of building envelope thermal insulation solutions, highlighting the different players in the supply chain in terms of number, type, and marketed products and solutions, and a focus on sustainable and recycled materials. The study also aims to define a methodology to investigate the state of play and opportunities for industrialisation of this market and its bottlenecks. In the article, a questionnaire is proposed to collect information and opinions on the spread of OSC and the perception of companies and professionals regarding the advantages and disadvantages of industrializing the sector. A first validation of the survey is presented in the form of industrial focus groups.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rapid development of digital technologies, digital transformation is becoming a critical way for enterprises to improve their performance. However, the current literatures lack sufficient research on whether and how the usage of digital technology improve supply chain performance. Based-on resource-based view and information processing theory, this study examines the impact of digital transformation on supply chain performance, as well as the mediating role of supply chain integration. The proposed hypotheses are tested empirically using data collected from Chinese A-share listed manufacturing firms for the years 2015 to 2022. The results show that digital transformation has a significant impact on supply chain performance, in which supply chain integration plays a partial mediating role. After a series of endogeneity and robustness tests, the results remain valid. Further analysis also reveals that the impact of digital transformation on supply chain performance is more significant for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than for large enterprises. In addition, firm size has a significant heterogeneous effect on this relationship, which implies that digital transformation is better able to improve SMEs’ supply chain performance. The findings provide guidance for enhancing supply chain performance through digital transformation and supply chain integration. </jats:p>",

The study seeks to understand the current state of GSCP adoption across various industries, identify key drivers and barriers, assess the perceived benefits and challenges, and evaluate the overall impact on environmental sustainability, economic performance, and social well-being. The research employs a qualitative approach, utilizing interviews with key stakeholders, document analysis, and literature review to gather data and insights. Interviews were conducted with representatives from government agencies, businesses, civil society organizations, and academia to obtain diverse perspectives on GSCP adoption and its implications for sustainable development in Bangladesh. The findings reveal a mixed scenario of GSCP adoption across different industries in Bangladesh, with sectors such as textiles leading the way. Key drivers of GSCP adoption include regulatory pressures, market forces, corporate social responsibility initiatives, and financial incentives. However, organizations face significant barriers such as high upfront costs, lack of awareness and expertise, regulatory uncertainty, and supply chain complexity. Despite these challenges, GSCP offer various benefits, including environmental sustainability, economic performance, and social well-being. Successful initiatives demonstrate tangible impacts, highlighting the potential of GSCP to contribute to sustainable development. The research is limited by its qualitative nature and focus on selected industries and stakeholders. Future studies could employ quantitative methods and broader sampling to provide a more comprehensive understanding of GSCP adoption and its implications in Bangladesh. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to promote GSCP adoption and enhance sustainable development in Bangladesh. Strategies for overcoming barriers and maximizing benefits are outlined, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and capacity-building initiatives. GSCP adoption can have positive social implications by promoting ethical labor practices, improving working conditions, and fostering community engagement. By prioritizing sustainability, businesses can contribute to social well-being and inclusive growth.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Improving detectability (i.e., enforcers’ capacity to detect illegal fishing activities) is crucial for fisheries management, food security and livelihoods. Identifying factors associated with higher probabilities of illegal activities and their detection across supply chains are necessary for effective interventions. Here, we developed a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to assess the detectability of illegal fishing activities. We use a large fisheries enforcement dataset from Chile covering all supply chain actors (e.g., fishers, traders, restaurants). Our model allowed evaluation of determinants of detectability and probability of violation across supply chain actors, species, regulations and effort predictors. Our results show an overall detectability rate of illegal fishing activities at 7%, with this rate varying significantly across supply chain actors. Notably, those positioned higher in the supply chain, such as processors and restaurants, which are also those receiving less enforcement effort, exhibit markedly higher detection rates. This study provides relevant management insights to improve detectability of infringements of fisheries regulations in Chile and more broadly. Our approach complements recent technological advances (e.g., satellite monitoring), and can support improved targeting of enforcement across supply chains, particularly in situations where capacity exists, but budgets are constrained. Improving detectability of rules violations is a key component of reducing illegal fishing and promoting compliance.</p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Biological communities can be described using the individual size distribution (ISD), a remarkably consistent negative relationship between individual mass and abundance that can be described as a power law  (N ~ Mλ). The parameter λ denotes the rate of decline in relative abundance from small to large individuals. Despite well-known influences of temperature on λ, interactive effects of temperature and resource supply on λ remain poorly understood. Leveraging data from 2.4 million individual body sizes in freshwater stream food webs, we test the hypothesis that λ varies as a function of temperature and resource supply. Surprisingly, despite varied environmental conditions and complete species turnover, there was no discernible impact on λ from temperature or resource supply. Instead, λ was consistently ~ -1.2 (sd = 0.04), differing from predictions of metabolic scaling theory, which assumes a value close to -2. This implies substantial subsidy inputs to large predators along with metabolic scaling coefficients shallower than assumed by the ¾ power law. Using simulations and mesocosm experiments, we provide support for a metabolic scaling coefficient of approximately ~0.4 for freshwater streams, along with a consistent influence of subsidies. The findings underscore remarkable consistency of individual size distributions in freshwater streams, likely driven by shallow metabolic scaling and large subsidies to large consumers.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global competition has forced companies, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to improve their competitive advantage. Supply chain management practices are the ways to improve the competitive advantage, particularly in the global competition context. However, there is still doubt SMEs can compete globally, considering they face limited resources, skilled workforce, and business networks. Therefore, this study aims to examine the influence of supply chain management practices, covering cross-functional integration, partnership, responsiveness, and resilience. Moreover, this study has examined which practices dominate in improving competitive advantage. The quantitative study involved 445 SMEs located in East Java, Indonesia. The respondents are supervisors or higher levels and work in departments related to supply chain management, as they can provide the relevant information and possess complete knowledge of management practices. The data were collected via a questionnaire designed with a five-point Likert scale. The responses were analyzed using SmartPLS software 4.0. The results show that cross-function integration improves supply chain partnership, responsiveness, and resilience (β = 0.705, 0.382, 0.324; t-value = 25.177, 6.697, 5.783). Supply chain partnerships affect supply chain responsiveness, resilience, and competitive advantage (β = 0.327, 0.257, 0.249; t-value = 5.933, 4.536, 5.651). Moreover, supply chain responsiveness improves supply chain resilience and competitive advantage (β = 0.285, 0.106; t-value = 5.690, 2.099). Supply chain resilience improves competitive advantage (β = 0.435 and t-value = 8.987). SMEs can enhance their competitive advantage by integrating their internal cross-functional integration and adopting supply chain partnership, responsiveness, and resilience.\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank DIKTI 2023 and Research and Community Outreach Petra Christian University for providing the grant to fund this research.</jats:p>",

Additionally, it investigates the moderating role of supply chain complexity on the impact of digital technologies on supply chain resilience and robustness. Data were gathered from 292 supply chain managers at registered manufacturing companies in Egypt and analyzed using Smart-PLS 4 software. The findings reveal that supply chain resilience and robustness partially mediate the link between digital technologies and sustainable environmental performance. Moreover, supply chain complexity was found to positively moderate the effect of digital technologies on both resilience and robustness. The model explained 53.2% of the variance in supply chain robustness, 56.6% in supply chain resilience, and 72.3% in sustainable environmental performance. These results provide critical insights for corporate policymaking, helping to drive continuous improvements in supply chain management, environmental performance, and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electric tractors have many advantages, including high torque, excellent controllability, energy efficiency, simple structure, and electric interface for expansion. However, a significant limitation lies in their endurance. This study presents the design of an extended-range power supply system to ensure continuous endurance of electric tractor. The objective is to provide a continuous power source for our self-developed electric tractor while preserving the benefits of electric propulsion. Extended-range power systems utilize a primary mover, typically an oil-fueled internal combustion engine, to drive the generator for electricity generation, and the generated AC form electricity is subsequently converted into stable DC bus voltage by a power electronic converter. The hardware and control design of the extended-range power supply system have been finalized and validated through experimental trials. Results demonstrate the system&amp;rsquo;s capability to sustain a stable DC bus voltage amidst disruptions such as sudden load shifts and fluctuations in prime mover speed. Even with 50% sudden load change, the voltage drop is within 12% and could recover to &amp;plusmn;3% within 4 seconds. The range extender can be used alone without battery to power the electric tractor, or it can used in parallel with other extended-range extenders or battery thanks with the droop control ability for power sharing.</jats:p>"

Research in the field of resilience in supply chain risk management has recorded significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines. Therefore, there is a need to synthesize, categorize and explain existing and newly emerging research directions, which may represent relevant platforms for developing supply chain concepts in the future. This study addresses this need by providing a bibliometric review of published papers on resilience in supply chain risk management. By analyzing more than 2500 published papers through bibliometric and machine-learning-based methods, we identified ten topics related to risk and resilience of supply chains: Pandemic impacts of food supply chain; Practices for capability and performance; Supplier-related modeling and optimization; System security and critical infrastructure; Production changes; IT in manufacturing process; Sustainability in global economy; Management and business approach; Modeling and design of complex networks; Operational strategies for risk mitigation. By analyzing articles published since 2020, we also identified a change in the direction of research dedicated to supply chain risk and resilience; we identified three other topics that were not recognized as distinct topics prior to 2020—Operational management; strategy; Sustainable production. The results of this study help in understanding the change in the direction of research in the area of risk and resilience of supply chains and thus provide up-to-date information for further research in this dynamically developing area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study is to address performance of the dairy supply chain and emphasizes the significance of reliability of the chain as a fundamental and critical attribute for fulfilling the safety requirements. In order to evaluate the performance of the dairy supply chain, the present study utilizes the reliability attribute, which is an essential and informative system performance indicator. The study considers not only the inputs and outputs but also internal activities and relationships between customers, manufacturers, and suppliers. To minimize calculations and resolve uncertainties and vagueness that may be experienced in the performance evaluation process, this study proposes the use of the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) approach and evaluates the reliability at each level of the supply chain: supply, manufacturing, and distribution. Combining the reliability of different levels, the study finally calculates the reliability of the entire supply chain. The proposed methodology offers a practical approach for evaluating the reliability performance of a dairy supply chain and can be easily extended to other industries as well. To verify the proposed methodology, a real case in the Iranian dairy industry is chosen to be studied. Results indicate that the proposed methodology can effectively identify bottlenecks or weaknesses in the dairy supply chain and help develop effective strategies to address them. Analyzing factors influencing supply chain reliability can optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of dairy product quality delivered to consumers.</jats:p>"

Universities receive more attention for their huge water consumption. The campus water supply system of a university in Xi'an was selected as the study object. Through real-time monitoring of the water consumption of the water supply network system, flow trends and leakage characteristics were analysed in conjunction with changes in water consumption, and WB-Easy Calc (water balance analysis software) proposed by the International Water Association was used to calibrate and evaluate the system for leakage. The results show that: with each building as a separate metering zone, the minimum night-time flow rate of the university occurs between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m., and the WB-Easy Calc analysis can obtain more accurate apparent leakage; therefore, the combination of the water balance method and the minimum night-time flow rate method can effectively assess the water use and leakage of the university, which is a good inspiration for assessing the water-saving potential of the university and formulating the corresponding water-saving measures.</jats:p>",

To maximize system efficiency, the cathode air supply system must be designed to optimally fulfill the requirements of the PEM FC system while obeying the design constraints imposed by the electric compressor drive and the air bearing system. This article proposes a dedicated design process for PEM FC cathode air compressors. Using physically based component models, the impact of varying cathode stoichiometry and operating pressure on PEM FC system performance is assessed to derive the system efficiency optimal compressor operating strategy. The centrifugal compressor stage is subsequently designed to achieve optimum efficiency on this operating line using meanline performance models and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations. Novel test procedures and measurement equipment are employed to validate the compressor design. The design process is demonstrated using a PEM FC passenger car application as an example. It is shown that significant performance and efficiency gains are achievable when tailoring the cathode air supply system to the application at hand. In the given example, effective compressor efficiency is increased by Δηeff = 12%. Along with an optimized compressor operating strategy, an overall PEM FC system efficiency gain of Δηsys = 2.7% is achieved.</jats:p>"

Method: The primary method used in this research is descriptive and analytic. The research location was chosen purposively in Malang. The type of data used is secondary data in the form of time series for 39 months. The data analysis method used is multiple regression linear analysis with the partially adjusted Nerlove Model. Findings: The results showed the variable price of mushrooms, the area of the harvested mushroom, the price of chicken meat, the price of urea fertilizer, and interest rates individually affected the supply of mushrooms in Malang. The variable of mushroom production and the average rainfall had no significant effect. Variables that are elastic in the short term are the area of the harvested mushroom, and elastic in the long term are the area of the harvested mushroom and the price of chicken meat. Conclusion: The mushroom farmer needs production planning to anticipate increases in the price of substitution products. Mushroom farmers are advised to make storage for supply and expand the mushroom house with more substantial materials to increase supply.  Novelty/Originality of this study: This analysis provides an in-depth understanding of supply dynamics, identifying key factors that influence supply elasticity in the short and long term. This study offers practical recommendations for mushroom farmers to optimize their production in the face of market fluctuations.</jats:p>"

Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.\r\nFindings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to blockchain technology for secure and transparent supply chain management. Preliminary empirical review revealed that blockchain technology had the potential to transform supply chain management by enhancing security and transparency. It emphasized the benefits of decentralization, immutability, and real-time visibility, which could reduce fraud and improve traceability. However, the study also highlighted challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory hurdles, which needed to be addressed for widespread adoption. Ultimately, the study suggested that companies investing in blockchain could gain a competitive advantage through increased efficiency and consumer trust, positioning blockchain as a crucial future component in supply chain management.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Transaction Cost Theory, Social Exchange Theory and Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory may be used to anchor future studies on blockchain technology. The study made significant contributions to theory, practice, and policy. It integrated blockchain into existing supply chain theories, highlighting its role in reducing transaction costs and fostering trust. Practically, it recommended businesses invest in blockchain for enhanced transparency and efficiency, and leverage smart contracts to automate processes. It emphasized the need for supportive regulatory frameworks and addressed legal and ethical implications. The study advised a phased implementation approach and stakeholder collaboration, and suggested future research explore blockchain's long-term impacts and integration with IoT and AI. It underscored the broader implications for global trade and economic development.</jats:p>"

For the onboard assessment of the energy efficiency of the power supply system, the ratio of the current values of the power of electric power consumers to the power of the automotive engine in the process of movement was experimentally determined. A model of dependence of the energy efficiency of the vehicle power supply system on the power of electric power consumers was developed. The maximum value of the energy efficiency of the power supply system does not exceed 35% and is achieved at the rated power of the generator. Further research will make it possible to determine the impact of operating time and the occurrence of abnormal situations in the power supply system on the change in its energy efficiency.</jats:p>",

The research and study continue to analyze the volatility of Bitcoin price while adding possible variables that modify the models better. The purpose is to better learn the market mechanics of Bitcoin and forecast price changes and long-term holders’ behaviors. In this paper, two relationships are established: first, there’s a long-term negative correlation between an increase in price and the number of Bitcoins held by LTHs. Second, the volatility of price and the volatility of the number of Bitcoins held by LTHs are positively correlated. Compared to previous analyses of the volatility of Bitcoin price, this paper considered a possible influential factor, the supply of LTHs, during the research. Based on the findings, suggestions for future investigations are given to consider short-term holders’ relationship of the two variables mentioned in this paper. Financial institutions can better forecast the behaviors of other LTHs, whereas individual investors can have a better understanding of the market mechanism of Bitcoin while learning the behaviors of LTHs.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology emerges as a viable solution, offering tamper-resistant ledgers, secure transactions, and automation capabilities. While considerable research on developing blockchain-based solutions currently exist, there is a lack of studies that specifically focus on optimizing port document management to speed up supply chain operations. In this paper, a supply-blockchain functional prototype for optimizing port operations using Hyperledger Fabric is introduced. In terms of core functionality, the prototype allows initiation of smart contract corresponding to functions such as creating and editing port-related documents, minimizing manual interventions and enhancing efficiency to reduce port congestion. Furthermore, it provides live tracking of completed events and transactions, facilitating transparency and streamlined oversight. The permissioned nature of Hyperledger Fabric ensures security and robust access controls, aligning well with sensitive port operations. Hyperledger Firefly and its connector framework was used as the middleware to facilitate blockchain integration and various functions of the prototype, while chaincode developed using Go language was used to package and deploy smart contracts. The supply-blockchain framework was used as the theoretical framework for prototype development, and agile project management was adopted to ensure timely completion. The results based on functional and performance testing demonstrate the prototype’s potential in alleviating port documentation bottlenecks and quickly delivering benefits to key stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>In the context of low-carbon economy, financial constraints are prevalent among both upstream and downstream enterprises, aggravated by the tendency of online retailers extending into offline physical stores. The present work firstly proposes and evaluates three financing combination models: \"bank lending + advance payment,\" (in short, AF), \"bank lending + delayed payment,\" (in short, DF), and \"bilateral bank lending.\" (in short, TF). It then examines the retailer's dual-channel supply chain pricing and financing decision-making models under unified pricing strategy and independent self-pricing strategy respectively. The evaluation results indicate that among various financing models, the independent self-pricing strategy holds potential for enhancing the retailer's profitability, outperforming the unified pricing strategy. In addition, when channel preference is significant, the retailer should prioritize the independent self-pricing strategy. Comparison of the optimal decisions across the three financing combination models indicates that both the cost coefficient of carbon emission reduction and the loan interest rate exert a limiting influence on the decision-making and income of all supply chain parties. Furthermore, the DF model emerges as a financing equilibrium strategy within the supply chain. The shift to the AF model as a financing equilibrium strategy is considered only when the manufacturer's loan interest rate is relatively high.</p>"

The model of electricity power failure, measured in terms of population disrupted, was calibrated against nighttime lights satellite imagery of historic TC events. Use of spatially coherent TC simulations enabled the calculation of electricity supply losses at national, regional and global scales for a range of return periods.We estimate that between 65 and 80 million people lose electric power with a return period of 1 in 100 years, depending on the TC model. Most regions show a worsening of TC-induced outages under climate change (RCP8.5 2050), except for the North Indian Ocean, where there is disagreement between TC models. Climate model uncertainty (across four GCMs) influences the estimated global population at risk by a factor of 0.91-1.05 in 2050.</p>"

With the rapid development of high and new technology, the production efficiency of enterprise products is greatly improved, the product renewal cycle is greatly shortened, and the market competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Supply chain management is an important part of modern enterprise management. With the development of the economy, the demand for supply chain management in the new era is getting higher and higher. In the past, when enterprises implemented production arrangements, due to the lack of self-knowledge, they could not manage the supply chain more effectively and scientifically, resulting in confusion about supply chain management and a negative impact on the development of enterprises. Therefore, it requires enterprise managers to correct their management concepts, do a good job in enterprise supply chain management, and avoid the negative impact of management chaos on enterprise development. This paper analyzes the important role of enterprise supply chain management in the development of enterprises, summarizes the current situation of enterprise supply chain management, and puts forward the corresponding optimization measures to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of enterprises.</jats:p>"

Somalia has a largely agrarian economy, with agriculture accounting for more than 70% of the country's GDP and employing over 65% of the population. However, the sector faces significant challenges when it comes to agricultural supply chains, which can hinder its development and growth. This experiment was conducted in the Afgoye district of the lower Shabelle Region, Somalia in 2023. This study aims to explore the challenges and opportunities that agribusinesses face in Somalia's agricultural supply chains. It also discusses the importance of technology in improving supply chain efficiency and the role that government and other stakeholders can play in supporting agribusinesses. The paper also examines the potential impact of improved agricultural supply chains on the Somali economy and provides valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and development practitioners seeking to support and promote agribusiness. The methodology used in this study involved survey questions. The survey questions utilized for this study were distributed through key stakeholders in Somalia's agricultural supply chains, including farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and processors. 57.5% of the respondents in the research responded that investing in the agricultural sector is necessary and may improve the standard of life of the population. Ultimately, this paper highlights the importance of addressing the challenges facing agricultural supply chains in Somalia and unlocking the opportunities that exist for agribusinesses to contribute to the country's economic development.</jats:p>"

The development and utilization of biomass energy are crucial for mitigating greenhouse effects, reducing air pollution, and alleviating energy pressure. Multi-functional biomass energy monitoring equipment and integrated systems have received extensive attention and are flourishing. This integrated design demonstrates a higher degree of integration, overall unity, diversification, and intelligence, which helps overcome the current developmental challenges of single-functionality and system isolation. One of the most representative designs of these integrated devices is the multi-energy conversion and utilization system, which efficiently converts low-grade energy into high-grade energy and provides various conversion pathways within a single system. This supplies ample energy for daily life and enables its full application in sports. By integrating self-powered wearable technology, this paper explores the use of a wearable sensor composed of KAP composite polyacrylamide/polyacrylic acid hydrogel (PAAH), namely KAP PAAH. The strain-voltage response and real-time sensing provided by KAP PAAH facilitate an electrically driven, self-powered integrated wearable sensor for human joint health monitoring. Additionally, this approach maximizes the residual value of biomass waste, highlighting its potential and high economic value for future practical applications. Specifically, the optimized design ensures reliable and continuous health monitoring during various sports activities, thus aligning with the broader environmental benefits of biomass energy.</jats:p>"

This study was descriptive and employed the mixed method, utilizing a validated and reliability tested researcher-made survey questionnaire translated to local dialect and conducted to 321 farmer-beneficiaries. Data were supplemented by interviews with 6 implementers from NFA and Local Government Units in Roxas City. The results revealed that farmer-beneficiaries perceived the PALLGU program as implemented as a whole and in terms of inputs, outputs, and mechanisms employed and that the challenges encountered as a whole and in terms of their profile was moderately challenged. These challenges acted as predictor of the perceived level of implementation of the PALLGU program and insights were focused on procurement procedures and requirements, provision of drying equipment/facilities during rainy season, and moving the buying station nearest to the farmers’ farm area or providing transportation support.</jats:p>",

Sustainability challenges in supply chains are characterized as complex and multifaceted, involving economic, social, and environmental dimensions that often intersect and conflict. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a critical role in addressing these challenges, navigating diverse stakeholder expectations and contextual variations across global operations. The review synthesizes insights from previous studies to highlight the role of sensemaking processes at individual and organizational levels in shaping sustainability strategies within global supply chains. Sensemaking acts as a cognitive and social process through which stakeholders interpret and respond to sustainability issues, influencing organizational responses and strategy formulation. Despite its contributions, the review acknowledges limitations in generalizability and the need for empirical validation in diverse contexts. Future research could benefit from longitudinal studies to capture the evolving nature of stakeholder interactions and sensemaking dynamics in sustainability initiatives.</jats:p>"

This study assessed the operational status of MRWD in terms of water supply and quality, identified key factors that affect water supply and quality, and analyzed water supply trend using historical data of its water production from 2019 to 2023. The 396 respondents were selected out of 41,805 concessionaires to answer a researcher-made questionnaire about their perception on MRWD’s water supply, water quality, and level of impact of identified key factors that affect the supply and quality of water. Data gathered were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and regression. Findings showed that waste management and water leakages had significant impact on operational status of MRWD, while natural hazards, pollution, population growth, source of water, urbanization, and water temperature had considerable impact. Results also revealed that MRWD’s operational status was operational for both water quality and water supply. Natural hazards and waste management were key factors that act as significant predictors of MRWD’s operational status, while pollution, population growth, source of water, urbanization, water leakages, and water temperature did not act as significant predictors. The SWOT analysis and matrix was utilized to evaluate secondary data and correlate with quantitative data results. The insights in SWOT analysis and matrix served as awareness for MRWD about its internal factors that can take advantage to battle the challenges and grab opportunities for the sustainability of its operations in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The Gambia River is a tidal and tropical river that covers 12% of the area of The Gambia and is to date not harnessed for drinking water supply purposes. While the freshwater region of the river is mainly used for irrigation, groundwater wells are predominantly used for drinking water. Salinity intrusion and wastewater treatment requirements are challenging current practices. Previous investigation on water quality indicated that the upper regions, with permanent and pristine freshwater, would be well suited for drinking water supply after ultrafiltration (UF) treatment. At 120 km from the river mouth to the coast, where the water becomes saline, desalination is required. With sea level rise, this saline region is expanding further inland, requiring increasingly energy-intensive treatments such as nanofiltration/reverse osmosis (NF/RO), while also affecting groundwater quality. In the urban area near the river mouth, there is potential for water reuse to increase water availability, while addressing the increasing load of micropollutants from the discharged wastewater effluents.\nUF could decrease the turbidity to ≤0.5 NTU with partial removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). During UF operation at controlled flux, an increase in transmembrane pressure was observed,  attributed to fouling caused by the high turbidity (up to 140 NTU) of the water samples from the freshwater region. Dense NF/RO membranes removed salinity and achieved the WHO recommended guideline for drinking water (&lt; 1 g/L as TDS) in the tidal regions with salinities up to 4 g/L during the beginning of the dry season between Tendaba and Jasobo at 100-120 km from the river mouth. The more open NF membrane could treat salinities in the tidal regions below 2 g/L at 100-110 km from the river mouth. \nMicropollutants (MP), with a total concentration of up to 26.3 µg/L for pesticides, 38.4 µg/L for pharmaceuticals, and 2.1 µg/L for hormones, were found in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharged 500 m near the ocean. This led to water quality degradation of the nearby stream, connected to The Gambia River, in which most of the MP concentrations were surpassing surface water quality standards. NF/RO membranes were able to remove most of the MP to concentrations below the surface water guidelines. With an appropriate pretreatment to mitigate fouling, and thus reduce energy consumption and process overall cost, NF/RO technology is well suited for water supply from desalination of the tidal region of The Gambia River and municipal water reuse for non-potable purposes, such as irrigation. The quality requirements will depend on membrane selection and water salinity. The findings of this research on desalination and water reuse can be extended beyond the local context and can contribute to addressing similar challenges in other countries worldwide</p>"

This article introduces the method and principle of applying a microcontroller control system to a portable emergency DC power supply, and proposes a method for a portable emergency DC power supply with adjustable and stable output. The output voltage can be adjusted in steps of 0.1-15V. This adjustable portable emergency DC power supply not only has the advantages of small volume and low loss of switch mode power supply, but also has the advantages of small output voltage ripple and good output characteristics of linear power supply.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The exhaustibility of traditional fossil energy sources is leading to the increasing use of unconventional energy sources. One of the most promising areas of alternative energy is the use of low-potential ground energy to heat buildings and structures for various purposes using a heat pump. The subway generates a significant amount of heat, especially when trains are braking, stopping on platforms and picking up speed when they start moving from the station. Thus, to combat the rise in temperature in tunnels and stations, a complex ventilation system is designed, including shafts, fans, and under-platform exhaust. In modern Ukrainian subways, the ventilation system is designed to cope with the rising temperatures in tunnels and stations. This traditional approach results in high energy consumption for running fans and ignores the possibility of using the extracted heat above ground in buildings. Techniques such as lining underground railway tunnels with heat exchanger segments, installing a heat exchanger in a subway ventilation shaft, installing geothermal heat pumps next to a subway tunnel, installing energy piles, energy baffle walls, energy platforms, and introducing absorption pipes into tunnel segments can provide an alternative solution to cool tunnels and the surrounding ground, and transfer the resulting heat to neighbouring buildings for heating. This would also have the benefit of reducing energy consumption for tunnel ventilation. This article discusses the possibility of using waste heat from underground railway systems as a source of low-potential energy to provide heat to, for example, adjacent buildings. Various technologies for utilising waste heat from underground railway tunnels that have already been implemented or whose models are technically and economically feasible are presented.</jats:p>"

The choice of replacing coal is quite complicated and currently being solved by various non-design fuels experimental combustion on a specific power boiler. The aim of the work is to develop criteria assessing non-design coal burning possibility in a specific furnace before experimental combustion. The stated goal is achieved with the help of numerical combustion modeling regarding various coals at the pre-critical parameters boiler furnace with an average composition ranking by the lower calorific value. 2 burning ratios have been proposed based on foreign experience: the fuel ratio and the degree of fuel burnout. The first is the ratio of the fuel carbon to volatile substances contents, which in this work are taken as an analytical mass. The second is calculated with the proposed formula, which, instead of the combustible content in fly ash, use mechanical underburning widely included in the technical calculations. Combustion zones with the degree of the acceptable fuel burnout according to the standards and with its excess are distinguished. The limit of possible coal combustion according to the fuel coefficient is found as well. It is shown that this furnace is quite universal for burning a wide range of coals, although it was originally designed for burning brown coal. It is not recommended to burn only lean and low-caking bituminous coals, anthracites and brown coals with calorific value less than 11.5 MJ/kg or humidity more than 40%. The obtained results are significant for the preliminary assessment of non-design fuel combustion and narrowing the range of fuels under consideration. Other the boiler conversion consequences for non-design fuel should be taken into account for the final decision, and above all, the probability of the heating surfaces slagging.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using textual analysis techniques, including seeded word embedding and bag-of-words-based content analysis, I develop a firm-level measure of supply chain risk exposure from a novel source of unstructured data—the discussion between managers and equity analysts on supply chain-related topics during firms’ quarterly earnings conference calls. I validate the measure by showing that (1) the measure exhibits intuitive variations over time and across firms, successfully capturing both routine and systematic supply chain risk events; and (2) the measure is about risk exposure, as it significantly correlates with realized and options-implied stock return volatility, even after controlling for well-known aggregate risk measures. I then demonstrate that the measure is specifically indicative of the supply chain component of risk exposure. (3) Consistent with theoretical predictions, firms facing higher supply chain risks have higher inventory buffers, particularly in raw materials and intermediate inputs, increased cash holdings in lieu of investments, and significantly lower trade credit received from suppliers. Moreover, (4) during unexpected risk episodes, such as the Tohoku earthquake, firms with higher ex ante risk exposure have worse operating and financial performance. These results indicate that the text-based measure provides a credible quantification of firm-level exposure to supply chain risks and can thus be reliably utilized as outcome or explanatory variables in empirical supply chain research. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The data files and online appendix are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4927 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The innovation of blockchain technologies into supply chain management is incremental by nature, attending to waste aspects and issues that are very old within SCM. As such, this reflection seeks to highlight the multifaceted benefits of blockchain in enhancing simplicity, traceability, security, and efficiency within supply chains. Blockchain provides a decentralized, permanent system of record that allows trust and honesty between partners; all valuable information is recorded in an imperishable way. Moreover, intelligent contracts mechanize some forms involved in supply chains, such as the processing of payments and inventory management, which reduces to a large extent not only regulatory costs but also human error. The high level of security measures is ensured by blockchain’s ability to encrypt this data and thus ensure information availability in case of sophisticated cyber threats. Such improvement in security reduces extortion and tampering, providing a more secure supply chain. This innovation further simplifies the administrative compliance, providing an accessible, verifiable record of each exchange. Not only this, but it also offers a way to verify whether material sources and technical support standards meet prevailing standards, thereby promoting brand identity to customers for the brand marked on a product and enhancing customer trust in a brand.</jats:p>"

An extremely important tool to develop heat sources that allows us to assess changes in consumer heat loads and model algorithms for heat source operation, taking into account the variability of outdoor air temperature in the geographical conditions of the design objects, is a graph of the duration of heat loads during the heating period (Rossander’s graph). It is impossible to construct the Rossander’s graph without data on the duration of the outdoor temperature standing during the heating period. In this paper, the problem of the lack of temperature data necessary for the construction of the Rossander’s graph in the current regulatory documents is revealed. The analysis of previous studies that produced temperature data with the duration of temperature standing is carried out, and the need for their refinement is substantiated. The arrays of hourly outdoor air temperatures were processed according to two weather models, as well as the array of average daily temperatures obtained as a result of measurements from the weather station for the geographical location of the main building of KNUCA. As a result of the comparative analysis, a model closer to reality was identified and, on its basis, actual data on the duration of outdoor temperatures standing for the city of Kyiv with a temperature step of 1℃ were developed. The obtained temperature data were compared with those that were developed in previous studies, as well as with the temperature data that are contained in the cancelled standard. The curve of the long-term run of the moving average outdoor air temperatures for the winter periods of 1973-2023 and its polynomial trend are constructed and compared with the curve that characterizes the run of the moving average five-year temperatures for the winter periods of 1861-1970 and its polynomial trend.</jats:p>"

Vascular afferents to the radial nerve, superficial radial nerve (SRN) and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) were described and located. Their origin was identified and its distance to interepicondylar line was measured.\nResults\nThe radial nerve had an average of 3 vascular afferents (2-5), of septomuscular origin in 54% of cases. 46% came from adjacent arteries.\nThe PIN had an average of 8 vascular afferents (6-12), arising from septomuscular branches in 82% of cases. The PIN was vascularized in 100% of cases by a large arterial plexus originating from the supinator muscle between its two heads.\nThe SRN had an average of 4 vascular afferents (3-5). Before crossing the septum of the brachioradialis, vascularization was predominantly septomuscular; after crossing the septum, the nerve was exclusively vascularized by septocutaneous arteries.\nConclusion\nThis is the first study to describe the vascularization of the radial nerve and its terminal branches along their entire length. Our results are in line with the data available in the literature.\nAn arterial plexus between the two heads of the supinator was surrounding the PIN in all cases. This vascular plexus might be involved in dynamic compression of the posterior interosseous nerve.</p>"

Meanwhile, Japanese direct investments in China continued to be strong. The secret to how Japanese corporations managed to survive these crises lies in what is journalistically called “China plus one”: a diversification strategy to expand their supply chains to neighboring countries in Asia. However, the magnitude of the headwinds against Japanese and other multinationals in China began to qualitatively differ in 2017 during the Trump administration. A series of events led the U.S. during the subsequent Biden administration, as well as other advanced economies, to follow a policy of “de-risking”: a transformation of supply chains to minimize risks and increase economic security. The current trend pitting the U.S. and China against each other, if it persists, may gradually turn China-plus-one strategies into “de-Sinicization.” policy implications• China-plus-one strategies allowed Japanese firms in the 2000s and 2010s to maintain their investments and supply chains in China while also expanding into other markets. • The current economic landscape is more challenging than earlier years of the 21st century in terms of navigating geopolitical tensions and uncertainty, introducing new technologies, and managing China’s economic slowdown. An increasing number of firms will switch from China plus one to de-Sinicization: an outright reduction in their business presence in China. • Chinese corporations are beginning to massively invest in Southeast Asian countries. Hence, the U.S. and Japan must take utmost care to ensure that China will not dominate these Asian countries in the future.</jats:p>",

The study is underpinned by the principles of lean and agile strategies as two key concepts that can be applied to respond to different customer expectations. Methods: Based on the phenomenological interpretivist paradigm, an empirical multiple-case study was conducted in German distribution centres operated by six companies. The empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews, built on the triangulation of sources. Open, axial, and selective coding were employed to analyse data collected through eighteen in-depth interviews with managers from the distribution centres. Results: The findings indicated that the construct of customer demand forms different benefits that the logistics service providers can achieve through VAS. Simultaneously, various customer demands on VAS requires the distribution centres to focus on developing different operational capabilities to gain superior performance. Conclusions: Based on the research findings, a conceptual model was created. This model can support logistics service providers in improving company performance through effectively managing VAS in their distribution centres. The high dynamic VAS customer demand can bring more financial and non-financial benefits but needs higher flexibility in the warehouse operation system. Stable and predictable VAS, in turn, require a higher degree of standardisation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the role of digital technologies in driving digital transformation in enterprises. As the economy and society enter a new era characterized by digital as a central feature, more and more companies are embarking on digital transformation, and more and more processes in the supply chain are applying digital technologies. However, while literature on the economic consequences of digital transformation has begun to emerge, the existing literature has received less attention than research on the factors influencing firms’ digital transformation. The existing literature still needs to be improved and requires further in-depth research in past studies, especially in discussing supply chain relationships and firms’ digital transformation. This study suggests a theory of dynamic capabilities to improve the digital transformation of businesses by integrating and analyzing internal and external factors in the digital transformation of businesses, as well as a case study on the dual impact of supply chain digitization on the digital transformation of businesses. It talks about studies on digital transformation that focus on MSMEs as their target market and offers recommendations for further research on the improvement and management of external interactions. By examining how the supply chain affects the digital transformation of enterprises, this paper suggests new perspectives and research scopes for exploring how to improve the success rate of enterprise transformation and help to better contribute to the academic community.</jats:p>"

The regions of the European Union are approaching NZEB standards and passive house standards. The Ukrainian regulatory framework for airtightness does not meet European standards for energy-efficient buildings and will require updating, as there will be an increase in the wind permeability of the building, and the increase is possible to the normatively permissible value, increased air permeability and energy efficiency. The permeability is expressed by the value of the air flow in cubic meters per year per square meter of the area of the outer shell of the booth when there is a pressure difference in the internal air of 50 Pa. Ait permeability will need to be specified by parameter q50 [m3/(h·m2)] instead of n50 [h – 1]. All countries of the European Union may use the q50 [m3/(h·m2)] parameter in their standards. Exclusions are Lithuania and Ukraine, where the actual air permeability is determined by the parameter n50 [h – 1]. Based on the Ukrainian standard for air permeability, air permeability is calculated by n50 [h – 1]. For energy efficiency class C, values n50 &lt; 2.0 [h – 1] are allowed, which is approximately the same value as q50 &lt; 5.0 [m3/(h·m2)].

By examining current literature, the study highlights AI's potential to automate and revolutionize supply chain operations, enhancing speed, accuracy, and risk management capabilities while identifying significant challenges such as bias mitigation, algorithmic transparency, and data privacy. The methodology involves a comprehensive review of scholarly articles, reports, and academic publications, focusing on AI applications in predictive maintenance, risk mitigation, and decision-making processes. The analysis reveals significant improvements in operational efficiency and accuracy due to AI, alongside concerns about biases, transparency, and implementation issues. The findings confirm AI's transformative potential in supply chain management but emphasize the necessity for ongoing supervision, regular audits, and the development of AI models capable of detecting and rectifying operational anomalies. The study proposes creating roles such as AI Supply Chain Oversight Officer (AISCO), AI Supply Chain Compliance Officer (AISCCO), and AI Supply Chain Quality Assurance Officer (AISQAO) to ensure responsible AI utilization, maintaining the integrity and efficiency of supply chain operations while addressing implementation challenges. The review concludes that AI is promising for transforming supply chains; however, careful implementation is crucial to uphold operational integrity and resilience. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to evaluate AI's long-term impact, focus on addressing implementation concerns, and ensure fair and transparent integration of AI technologies. These findings have significant implications for practice and policy, underscoring the need for robust frameworks and regulatory measures to guide the effective use of AI in supply chains.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve sustainable development, enterprises need to continuously adjust and improve their business models and strategies, combining environmental protection with economic benefits to achieve a win-win situation. Nowadays, the awareness of environmental protection is gradually increasing, and enterprises are no longer limited to internal green management, but gradually shifting to green co-operation practices among supply chains. Faced with pressure from society, government, consumers, and enterprises in the same industry, and in order to actively respond to the national \"dual-carbon\" goal, i.e., to achieve carbon peak by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, manufacturing enterprises are also actively establishing green supply chains through a variety of green management tools to increase the sustainability of products or services, improve social benefits, and enhance the sustainability of products and services, as well as improve social benefits. services, improve social benefits, and help enterprises improve their corporate image. Therefore, starting from Lenovo Group's green supply chain management framework, this paper explores its three-tier supply chain consisting of fellow traders, upstream suppliers, and downstream retailers, which stimulates the enthusiasm of the main supply chain enterprises, and at the same time, can reduce the green governance costs for the main supply chain enterprises, and increase the motivation to implement green behaviors.</jats:p>"

Achieving a balance between energy, cost, and ecology is crucial, particularly in specific contexts. As one of the critical factors influencing global climate, carbon emissions have consistently been a green indicator of concern for countries worldwide. This paper addresses optimizing energy costs in the cold chain transportation of the fresh supply chain to obtain a model with low carbon emissions and transportation costs. Initially, the paper explores the equilibrium between energy and cost optimization using the theoretical framework of differential games in game theory. Building upon this, an intelligent energy system is proposed, and a basic model for constructing a smart grid is provided based on commonly used electric power. Using this as the foundational concept, a game model is constructed, considering the conflicting objectives of cost minimization, time efficiency, and energy conservation in addressing the primary issue of energy savings in the fresh supply chain, specifically the transportation path optimization problem. Compared to traditional models, the model presented in this paper reduces the scheduling of two refrigerated trucks. By optimizing this model, the transportation path's length is shortened by 5.50%, the carbon emission is decreased by 8.9%, and the model's overall cost is reduced by 4.94%. This study presents a game model that may efficiently optimize the fresh product transportation chain, reducing carbon emissions and expenses. The model has certain practical applications and serves as a guide.</jats:p>"

A structured literature review on the topic was conducted to define a structural schema to analyse the intra‐ and inter‐organisational green practices and technological systems adopted by LSPs. Then, a cross‐country analysis was conducted in a sample of about 1000 LSPs operating in Germany, Italy and UK to highlight their degree of diffusion, as well as the homogeneity and differences among LSPs belonging to different European countries. The process of diffusion of green initiatives follows an evolutionary process characterised by misalignment problems. Despite the results of the cross‐country analysis highlight homogeneities and differences between the three countries, LSPs operating in the three countries adopt inter‐organisational technological systems that could be exploited to increase inter‐organisational green practices and overcome misalignment problems coherently with the NRBV. This means that LSPs operating in the three countries have a supply chain‐oriented technology engine that could be better exploited to support supply chain green practices and overcome the misalignment.</jats:p>",

A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.\r\nFindings: The effectiveness of risk management strategies in mitigating supply chain disruptions in South Africa has proven to be critical in maintaining operational stability and ensuring business continuity. In an environment characterized by frequent economic, political, and environmental challenges, robust risk management strategies have become indispensable for South African businesses. These strategies, including risk assessment, diversification of suppliers, implementation of advanced technologies, and development of contingency plans, have significantly enhanced the resilience of supply chains. By systematically identifying and evaluating potential risks, businesses have been able to proactively address vulnerabilities and reduce the impact of disruptions. The use of advanced technologies, such as predictive analytics, real-time monitoring systems, and blockchain, has further strengthened risk management efforts. These technologies provide valuable insights into supply chain dynamics, enable early detection of potential disruptions, and facilitate rapid response measures. As a result, businesses can maintain smoother operations and minimize downtime during unforeseen events.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Resilience Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) &amp; Contingency Theory may be used to anchor future studies on effectiveness of risk management strategies in mitigating supply chain disruptions in South Africa. Encourage the adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain for real-time monitoring and supply chain visibility. Practical implementation of these technologies can enhance early detection of disruptions and facilitate rapid response strategies. Foster closer collaboration with suppliers to co-develop robust contingency plans and risk-sharing mechanisms. Practices such as dual sourcing, supplier diversification, and joint risk assessments can build resilience across the supply chain network. Advocate for policies that incentivize resilience-building practices within supply chains. This could include tax incentives for investments in resilient infrastructure, as well as mandatory reporting on supply chain risk management practices to enhance transparency and accountability.</jats:p>"

There is a notable desire to optimize supply chains simultaneously with respect to economic and environmental factors, and the development of a mathematical model integrating the life cycle assessment into source-sink matching is missing in the existing literature. The present work means to fill this gap by using a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem. The case study for this research focuses on a real-life scenario in Germany where carbon dioxide is captured from flue gas and transported to be stored or/and used. The total profit and life cycle GHG reduction are maximized. The results show that the profit per unit of sequestered CO2 decreases from 2014 to −€332 as the rate of life cycle GHG reduction increases from −873 to 52 MtCO2eq/year. The findings from the model can provide valuable knowledge that can be utilized in various countries at different levels, such as at regional, state, and national levels.

The formation, breakage, and regrowth processes of algal coagulation flocs formed by a series of monomeric Al-based coagulants (Al2(SO4)3, Al13, and Al30), Al13/Al30 composite coagulant and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/Al13 (PDADMAC/Al13) composite coagulant were studied. Results indicated that Al13 mainly employed a charge neutralization mechanism, which was conducive to the destabilization of algae and the regeneration of flocs, while Al30 mainly employed a sweep flocculation mechanism, which was conducive to the formation of algae and the strength of flocs. Meanwhile, the charge neutralization was the main mechanism during the algae coagulation process because it could effectively remove the soluble microbial products (SMP) component in the extracellular organic matter (EOM). Therefore, Al13 could achieve a higher coagulation performance than other monomeric Al-based coagulants. The Al13/Al30 composite coagulant could make up for the deficiency of the sweep flocculation mechanism in Al13 and charge neutralization mechanism in Al30, and achieve the best synergistic optimization performance at Al13:Al30-7:3. Additionally, PDADMAC, as a polymer, could further enhance the charge neutralization ability of Al13 at low dosages and the sweep flocculation ability of Al13 at high dosages, respectively. However, an excessive dosage would lead to charge reversal and thus reduce the coagulation effect. Therefore, controlling the dosage was key when using Al-composite coagulants. The findings of our research could offer a certain theoretical foundation for the development of inorganic polymer flocculants.</jats:p>"

The present study investigates control node selection frameworks and RTC system architecture for the field-oriented control of a rural WDN. The unique topology of the case-study area, the small size of the area, and high-pressure variety increased the considerations of the RTC system. A computer code was developed based on the method of characteristics for the hydraulic simulation of the network. The code could analyze unsteady flows through sloped pipes, implement pressure-based analysis, and regulate control valves based on the target node. Leakage reduction, pressure fluctuation reduction, and cavitation prevention were used as three criteria and constraints in the selection of control nodes. It was found that the optimal strategy would reduce the real water loss from 25 to 10%. Furthermore, key parameters in remote sensing were evaluated to minimize the number of sensors in order to further simplify the control algorithm and RTC system architecture through an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The control function with a convergence rate of 99% was introduced.</jats:p>",

The effect of vegetation on DAV and BSS was also deliberated. To examine the effect of vegetation, synthetic grass 8 cm in height was used as a flexible vegetation to depict the natural conditions of the rivers. The DAV was calculated using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and the measurement of BSS was done using the Preston tube technique. After analysing the data, it was revealed that as the convergence of floodplains increases, maximum DAV increases. The presence of vegetation reduces the velocity specifically at lower flow depths. BSS increases with the convergence as well as vegetation. This research provides valuable data and results which will be helpful in better flood management, river restoration, and designing effective hydraulic structures.</jats:p>",

Establishing a clean energy power supply system, using clean energy for power generation, and investing in real power supply are currently unresolved challenges. Based the current high cost of new energy power supply systems, this project proposes an optimization plan based on the wind power supply system, targeting the capacity of lithium battery energy storage equipment, and constructs an optimization model for wind power supply in electric vehicle systems. In addition, in order to use lithium-ion battery devices more efficiently and ensure the evaluation of the efficiency and battery life of lithium-ion battery energy storage devices, we predicted the cyclic aging phenomenon of lithium-ion battery energy storage devices through machine learning technology. This prediction can provide suggestions and references for the use of this lithium battery.</jats:p>"

Considering the large-scale, multi-objective, complex nonlinear, non-convex, non-differentiable, and mixed-integer characteristics, this study decomposes the space station cargo supply planning problem into a bi-level optimization problem involving cargo manifest and loading layout iterations. A new CILPSO algorithm is proposed to solve this by integrating particle coding, reliability priority, and random generation mechanisms of population initialization, global and local versions of particle updating, and a local search strategy. The experimental results show that the CILPSO algorithm outperforms other algorithms regarding search performance and convergence efficiency. The proposed approach can effectively reduce the cargo supply cost of the space station and improve the output of space science and application achievements. It provides a decision-making basis for the responsible department to develop cargo supply schemes, for the cargo supply systems to submit cargo demands, and for the cargo spaceship system to design loading schemes. This study advances the logistics sustainability of the space station.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim was to develop digital models of traction power supply systems with nonlinear stationary loads in order to determine asymmetric and non-sinusoidal modes. To this end, methods based on phase coordinates were implemented in the Fazonord software package (version 5.3.4.1–2024). The models included the following elements: 220 kV transmission lines, 40 MV·A transformers, 25 kV traction networks of double-track sections and a converter unit powering the industrial transport power supply system. The developed models identified asymmetrical and nonsinusoidal modes during the movement of a train on a specific section of the main railway. It was demonstrated that the nonlinear stationary load generated by a six-pulse converter results in an increase in harmonic coefficients at the 10 and 220 kV inputs of the traction substation feeding the rectifier, exceeding 25% on the 10 kV busbars. This phenomenon should be considered when selecting means to reduce harmonic distortion. These include passive filters, active conditioners and new-generation electric rolling stock with four-quadrant converters. The maximum asymmetry coefficients on the 10 kV busbars of traction substations ranged from 4.8...9%. These values can be reduced down to acceptable limits using phase-controlled reactive power sources or balancing transformers. The presented models allow all the parameters of the AC railway power supply system to be adequately determined under stationary loads with nonlinear voltage-current characteristics. The developed method is versatile and can be used for calculating modes of supply and traction networks of various structures and designs.</jats:p>"

These are two typical questions students, researchers and practitioners encounter when they study or practice management. Decision-makers in companies have to be able to account for power in their daily tasks because of the potential partners’ reactions to wrong decisions. Major papers studying power do agree that power and its direct consequence, i.e., decision imbalance, could have direct impacts on how soundly a supply chain operates. Even though power has been analyzed for a long time in various fields, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of scientific literature examining and modeling power imbalance and its consequences in supply chains. An important challenge regarding this issue is analyzing power in networks of partners. This chapter contributes to the development of a power analysis framework by presenting a set of concepts and properties to model and examine various aspects of power and the interactive process that leads to its use or does not. This framework will use data collected from a set of interviews conducted with main decision-makers to analyze a real case of four companies from the high-tech sector.

This study aims to systematically review the literature on the use of simulation tools in managing supply chain disruptions, focusing on the historical evolution, prevalent simulation methods, specific challenges addressed, and research gaps. A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA method. An initial pool of 236 articles was identified, from which 213 publications were rigorously reviewed. This study analyzed these articles to map the academic landscape, identify key clusters, and explore the integration of digital advancements in enhancing supply chain resilience. The review identified the chronological development of research in this field, highlighting significant contributions and influential authors. It was found that various simulation methods, including discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and system dynamics, are employed to address different aspects of supply chain disruptions. Two primary research frontiers emerged from the analysis: the strategic reconfiguration of supply chain networks to mitigate ripple effects and the swift implementation of countermeasures to contain disruptions. The findings suggest a need for future research focusing on dynamic analysis and control theory applications to understand and manage supply chain disruptions better. This study also notes the increasing interest and need to use digital technologies (digital twins, artificial intelligence, etc.) in future research. It underscores the necessity for continued research to develop resilient and sustainable supply chain infrastructures aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The identified research gaps offer a roadmap for future scholarly exploration and practical implementation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In global agricultural markets, farmers often face profit squeezes due to low bargaining power, which affects the sustainability of agriculture and the livelihoods of farmers. Cooperative intervention is seen as a key solution to improve bargaining power and optimize profit distribution in the agricultural supply chain. In this study, a two-stage dynamic game model is adopted to focus on bargaining power and compare the effects of linear pricing versus a double charging system under cooperative intervention. It is found that the cooperative is better when it has full bargaining power or when it faces downstream sellers with comparable bargaining power, and the dual-charging system is more favorable. When cooperatives bargain with sellers, the degree of differentiation of agricultural products affects the cooperatives’ profitability and cooperatives tend to maintain the two-part tariff when the bargaining power is less than a threshold condition containing the degree of differentiation of agricultural products; when discounts exceed the threshold, cooperatives shift to linear pricing to safeguard their profitability. Numerical analysis validates the theory and reveals the changing pattern of cooperative profits under market forces. This study not only provides theoretical support for the study of supply chain pricing strategies under the condition of considering the bargaining power of producers (farmers) but also provides management insights for the stability and sustainable development of agricultural supply chains. Its novel dynamic game framework is cross-culturally applicable to help farmers’ cooperatives cope with the challenge of profit distribution in a global context and emphasizes the importance of differentiation strategies to enhance bargaining power and promote fairness and efficiency in global agricultural supply chains.</jats:p>"

Starting from procurement of raw materials, production, distribution, and finally the goods reaching consumers will influence each other. The costs of goods and services will be somewhat impacted by these social habits. Producers and merchants must comprehend these social behaviors in order to properly establish prices and the distribution of goods. This includes determining the prices of goods and services. Offering manufacturers who participate in cooperative advertising schemes money for a percentage of the costs connected with local advertising encourages retailers to launch additional promotional activities. The aim of this research is to investigate how cooperative pricing and advertising can improve supply chain coordination using consumer demand functions. A model based on game theory that takes the dynamics of power in the supply. A series of numerical simulations is presented to illustrate the optimal solution of channel members based on scenarios that illustrate, understand and compare the fundamental results of the game models. The results of this research are that retail price decisions are influenced by the level of competition and product differentiation. The results show that retail margins depend on local ( ) and national ( ) advertising effectiveness values. In addition, retailers can gain greater profits by setting higher prices in conditions of low price elasticity but must consider consumer sensitivity to price to maximize profits.</jats:p>"

In the field of supply chain, such progress can only be guaranteed via the exploration of new horizons and innovative solutions in response to the constraints of the global market. Emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, offer promising avenues for enhancing supply chain processes, with sustainability ascending as a critical consideration. Despite the recent surfacing of AI-driven applications, scant attention has been devoted to exploring their full potential within supply chain operations, particularly in conjunction with SDGs. Recognizing the untapped opportunities presented by the implementation of AI for a sustainable supply chain this study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of 236 research papers sourced from the Web of science database. The analysis utilizes R language BiblioShiny to examine the extracted papers, and dissect patterns, trends, and relationships among key concepts and themes as well as prominent topics, impactful authors, and leading journals and countries in this domain. The findings reveal substantial growth in research related to SCM, AI, and sustainability as the UK leads this field of study with 132 articles followed by India, China and the USA. Eventually, the National University of Singapore came first in terms of paper affiliations, followed by De La Salle University, and London Metropolitan University. These results only prove that sustainability is becoming more critical in the equation of AI-driven supply chains especially with the current socio-political and economic circumstances, constituting a solid base for further academic research and more innovations in the managerial and business-related policies in this field.</jats:p>"

Hence, one of the objectives of this paper is to implement, in a designed setup, variously heated loads, such as constant current, voltage, resistance, and power modes. That said, the designed system has hardware and software aspects that integrate advanced microcontroller capabilities so that high accuracy is assured through a series of test procedures on the system. The hardware design of the project encompasses choosing various resistors and relays modules (ESP32), selection of the proper power supplies, and microcontrollers. A program is being developed in the Arduino IDE that will program the microcontroller to do dynamic load control.It all began with the circuit design and resistor value choice, taking into consideration their power rating about effective heat dissipation. Dynamic loading control by the ESP32 microcontroller allows variable changes which are automatic in nature. On top of this, relay modules were used for effective switching of load and its adjustments, hence making the system flexible and responsive. The firmware developed in Arduino IDE automates control processes, which enables the smooth running of operations. In this regard, our experiments output results that show the device—a programmable electronic load mimicking load situations and providing performance information. Notably, the automated control system coupled with adjustable load capabilities increased the testing process efficiency and accuracy to a great deal. The overall effect of the programmable electronic load device is that it makes testing more professional by way of automation and provision of precise management for the test settings of the load. Its versatility also provides simulation of a wide scope of scenarios accommodating test conditions. It is designed to cater to heat regulation and power dispersion for the reliability of performance whiles in operation</jats:p>"

Therefore, the determination of the regression dependence, which describes the dynamics of the increase in the number of biogas plants and can be used when forecasting the number of such plants, is an urgent scientific and technical task. The purpose of the research is to determine the regression dependence, which describes the dynamics of the increase in the number of biogas plants and can be used when forecasting the number of such plants, with the aim of increasing the prevalence of the use of renewable energy sources, saving fossil energy sources and simultaneously reducing the intensity of environmental pollution. During the research, the method of regression analysis of the results of one-factor experiments and other paired dependencies was used with the selection of a rational type of function from the sixteen most common options according to the criterion of the maximum value of the correlation coefficient. Regression was carried out on the basis of linearizing transformations, which allow reducing the non-linear dependence to a linear one. The coefficients of the regression equations were determined by the method of least squares using the developed computer program \"RegAnalyz\", which is protected by a certificate of copyright registration for the work. An adequate regression relationship was obtained, which describes the dynamics of the increase in the number of biogas plants and can be used when forecasting the number of such plants. A graphical dependence was built that describes the dynamics of the increase in the number of biogas plants and allows to visually illustrate this dynamic and show sufficient convergence of theoretical results with actual data. It was established that the increase in the number of biogas plants in Ukraine during 2012-2019 grew according to a hyperbolic dependence.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although information design has recently received significant attention as a tool for shaping consumers’ purchase behavior, little is known about its use and implications in two-sided marketplaces, where both supply and demand consist of self-interested strategic agents. In this paper, we develop a model of a two-sided platform that facilitates transactions between vertically differentiated suppliers and consumers who differ in their quality preferences. We focus on illustrating the potential benefits of optimal information provision in managing the supply side of the marketplace, including the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of potential suppliers. We show that the revenue-optimal information provision policy often involves delaying the disclosure of information regarding the quality of the available suppliers. When the outside options available to consumers are relatively unattractive, we find that information design can help the platform achieve a more revenue-efficient matching between supply and demand. On the other hand, when consumers have access to attractive outside options, we show that information design can accelerate the discovery of high-quality suppliers, leading to an increase in the platform’s total transaction volume. Moreover, in cases where the platform benefits from commission subsidies to incentivize the entry of new suppliers, information design can be used to achieve the same goal while allowing the platform to earn higher commission revenue. Overall, our numerical experiments suggest that the impact of information design on platform revenue, as well as on consumer surplus, can be substantial. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4894 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of the green economy and the dual-channel model has led to consumer preferences for a model that is both green and service-based. At the same time, customer service expectations have led to greater uncertainties in corporate decision-making. However, many research gaps remain in terms of how green and service-based models work together in a dual-channel supply chain to influence operational decisions and achieve efficiency improvements. Therefore, while considering customer expectations, this study adopts Stackelberg game theory to construct a dual-channel supply chain analysis that considers green and service inputs and analyzes the optimal decisions of manufacturers and retailers. The results show that when the costs of green inputs are low, this increases the greenness and prices of green products while also stimulating the retailer to improve service levels and common product prices. When the retailer’s service costs are low, this promotes higher service levels and product prices but inhibits product greenness and green product prices in the online channel. In addition, centralized decision-making is associated with higher product greenness, which is beneficial from an environmental perspective. Numerical analysis further reveals that profit-sharing contracts can be effective in achieving supply chain coordination. These findings have reference significance for the coexistence and interaction of green and service-based factors in dual-channel supply chains, as well as provide a reference value for the impact of customer service expectations on supply chain-related decision-making.</jats:p>"

With the help of the logistic model, this paper analyzes the path of the industrial supply chain logically, finds out the influencing factors that affect the logistics planning of the supply chain, and calculates it. Among them, the intervention factors in the path, such as traffic congestion, traffic light, and path angle, are analyzed and judged, redundant interference factors are eliminated, and the adjustment coefficient of logistics planning is increased to realize the effective planning of production logistics and expand the development of new energy industry, and the research results show that with the help of logical analysis method, the rational planning of production logistics can be shortened by about 20%, the transportation efficiency can be improved by about 15%, the traffic congestion avoidance rate can be reduced by 10%, and the transportation cost can be saved by about 104,200 yuan.

CODANIN-1 negatively regulates the function of ASF1. However, the molecular mechanism by which CODANIN-1 inhibits the ASF1-mediated histone supply remains elusive. Here, we present the electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human CODANIN-1_ASF1A complex at 3.75 Å resolution. The structure reveals that CODANIN-1 forms a dimer where each monomer holds two ASF1 molecules, utilizing two B-domains and two histone H3 mimic helices (HMHs). The interaction of CODANIN-1 with ASF1 via the HMH and B domains inhibits the formation of an ASF1/H3–H4 complex and sequesters ASF1 in the cytoplasm. Our study provides a structural and molecular basis for the function of CODANIN-1 as a unique negative regulator that highjacks ASF1 interaction sites with histones and downstream chaperones to inhibit nucleosome assembly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most important aspects of ensuring optimal conditions in museums is the air conditioning systems. Traditional ventilation and air conditioning systems with a constant air flow rate may not be effective. In the context of optimising the microclimate in museums, it is crucial to implement technological standards and requirements aimed at stabilising the temperature and humidity conditions. It is important to note that the conditions for the preservation of museum exhibits require that the temperature (16-24 °C, optimally 18-22 °C) and humidity (55% ± 5%) regimes remain constant. Multi-jet air distributors in variable flow systems are one of the modern approaches that can provide optimal parameters for museum premises. The paper considers theoretical studies of a multi-jet air distributor that can create axisymmetric and fan-like jets, as well as combine these jets together. The formula for the coefficient of non-isothermicity of the jets fed vertically against the influence of gravitational forces was refined in accordance with experimental data. Three schemes of air supply vertically downward were modelled: axisymmetric jet, fan-like jet, and both jets. For the exhibition hall, the distribution of temperature, air velocity and relative humidity at a height of 1.5 m (the place where the paintings are placed) was modelled. The results showed that the supply of a compact cool jet is effective only at an air flow rate of 25 %. The supply of a fan-shaped cooled jet ensures that the air parameters are within the standard range. The heated fan-like jet floats away and does not reach the working area. The heated axis-symmetric jet requires adjustment of the air outlet area. The results allow recommending air supply by cooled fan-shaped jets from 25 to 100 %. For lower flow rates, the axis-symmetrical jets are more appropriate. Heated jets should be axis-symmetrical with enough control of the initial area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Businesses and economic growth together depend on effective supply chain management. The threats posed by poor supply chain management are beyond the reach of the present methods of managing them. To study the improvement in supply chain efficiency management, we propose a learning and neural-network-based supply chain risk management model called the Integrated Tunicate Swarm Algorithm Adaptive Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Networks (ITSA-AMFNN) method for determining strategies to manage supply chains. The initial step of our methodology is to gather both historical and current supply chain data. Information on demand, stock, shipping and vendor efficiency is featured. To ensure stability and prevent abnormalities that might affect the accuracy of our model, we use min–max normalization on the raw data before feeding it into our classification method. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a feature extraction method is used to get information from supply chain data. By revealing overlooked latent elements in the data, NMF helps to enhance forecasting and decision-making. The core of our study is the development of a novel deep learning classification called ITSA-AMFNN. This structure fuses swarm optimization with the flexibility of multilayer feed-forward neural networks. To keep up with the ever-changing demands of the supply chain, ITSA-AMFNN excels in predicting demand, inventory optimization, anomaly detection, and route optimization and supplier performance assessment. Finally, the research assesses the risk indicator system in light of the actual state of supply chain management. We use stringent performance assessment criteria including accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity to determine how our innovative algorithm performs. The method has been shown to optimize supply chain processes and improve performance in real-world case studies across many sectors.</jats:p>"

The methodological approach used in this study was based on online searches using the database of Participatory Development Assistance Software (Pro-ADP). Overall, the study estimates that the number of handpumps used as the main source of drinking water supply in Cameroon is 20,572. Our findings suggest that about one in three handpumps in Cameroon is nonfunctional, which in 2022 was roughly equivalent to 6,724 inoperative water points. According to this estimate, it is about 44.8 billion CFA francs, or 66.8 million USD, was invested in the construction of water points that are immobilized and do not generate any benefit. The review has found that the community-based management of handpump water supply seems not to have given the expected results. Further, there are questions in relation to the quality of handpump material and the corrosion of handpumps which have not been sufficiently taken into account in the various research projects in Cameroon and Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the implementation of post-construction monitoring, physical audits, and handpump rehabilitation campaigns could shed light on these issues in order to improve the performance of handpumps.</jats:p>",

The complexity and periodicity of pressure variations in the water supply networks pose significant challenges to traditional prediction models. In this study, we introduce a novel short-term pressure prediction model, termed the 1DCNN-GRU-multi-head attention (CGMA) model, which incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism alongside an integrated network consisting of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). Initially, the model employs a 1DCNN network to extract features from the pressure data. Subsequently, the extracted features are input into the GRU neural network, leveraging its long-term dependency capabilities to improve prediction accuracy. Then, the attention mechanism is incorporated into the GRU component to highlight key information, enabling the model to focus on more important data features, thereby improving the prediction performance. We implemented this model in a real urban water distribution system equipped with five pressure sensors. The model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.00197 and a root mean square error of 0.00262. When compared with alternative approaches, our method demonstrated superior predictive performance for pressure data, thereby confirming its efficacy in practical applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This systematic review aims to enhance the current understanding of supply chain management (SCM) practices in Ghana by examining emerging trends in the literature. The analysis considered 43 peerreviewed articles published in the last 20 years to identify the features, SCM components, research types, methodologies, and contributions to SCM theory. The results indicate that previous research on SCM practices in Ghana has mainly focused on particular attributes, such as supply chain (SC) risk planning and management, communication and information sharing, quality, strategic supplier partnership, inventory, and logistics management. However, benchmarking, customer relationship, and demand forecast, were list examined. Additionally, research on SCM practices has been concentrated in industries, such as manufacturing, banking and finance, agriculture value chain, health and allied areas, and retail and SMEs. The study also reveals that while quantitative research methods have gained increasing interest, qualitative research methods are still prevalent in the field. The results further highlighted a variety of SCM theories, namely resource-based view, transaction cost theory, agency, SC operations reference (SCOR), network theory, diffusion of innovation theory, contingency theory, and service demand logic, are focal areas of understanding SCM practices, performance, and their critical success factors in Ghanaian industries. This study provides practical insights for industry practitioners to better understand SCM deployment, design, and implementation steps, as well as suggestions for future research directions for SCM theory and practice in Ghana. These include exploring other areas and industries to gain a more comprehensive understanding of SCM practices in the country. </jats:p>"

Over the period of 4 months, coordinates of all available taxis in Singapore, as well as rain value data from 66 weather stations located around the island, were collected every minute from public Application Programming Interfaces (API). Singapore was divided into a grid of 3km by 2km rectangles, with each region minutely assigned a taxi supply count and a rain value weighted based on distance to the weather station. To obtain groups where taxis behaved similarly, the data on weekends and weekdays were separated, then divided spatially and temporally. A non-linear correlation coefficient was calculated for each category. It was hypothesized that rainfall notably reduces taxi supply in most regions, an effect most pronounced in the evening rush hours (18:00 – 21:00) on all days of the week. The results do not fully validate this hypothesis, displaying that though taxi supply levels were generally decreased in situations with rainfall, they could likewise reach low levels in scenarios without.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous research on the growth-environment nexus has predominantly focused on demand-side indicators, disregarding the supply-side dynamic and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. This study examines the role of economic growth on environmental quality in Canada, considering various macroeconomic factors such as energy consumption, technology innovation, foreign direct investment, and institutional quality. Using time series data for the period 1990 to 2022, this study employs the dynamic autoregressive distributive lag (DARDL) co-integration model to assess the co-integrating relationship among variables and conduct counterfactual shock analysis. The results demonstrate that economic growth significantly affects demand-side dynamics, leading to increased carbon emissions and ecological footprint, while concurrently reducing the supply-side factor, namely the load capacity factor, in both the short and long run. Notably, these findings include the confirmation of the EKC hypothesis as it relates to environmental safety, measured through energy consumption within the Canadian context. In addition, counterfactual analysis of the DARDL approach examines the effects of (±) 1% and (±) 5% shocks from the independent to dependent variables. For robustness, the kernel regularized least squares machine learning algorithm validates the results obtained from the DARDL estimation technique. The study's findings suggest implementing stringent environmental policies to enhance supply-side environmental parameters while carefully balancing energy consumption to support growth. It is crucial to ensure that economic growth is not achieved at the expense of environmental degradation in Canada. </jats:p>"

In a rapidly changing, Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) business, it is essential to analyze the sales of the products and accordingly plan the supply. Due to low data volume and complexity, traditional forecasting methods struggle to capture intricate patterns. Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) offer a promising solution by integrating transfer learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy across diverse datasets. This study presents a new sales order prediction framework that combines DANN-based feature extraction and various machine learning models. The DANN method generalizes the data, maintaining the data behavior’s originality. The approach addresses challenges like limited data availability and high variability in sales behavior. Using the transfer learning approach, the DANN model is trained on the training data, and this pre-trained DANN model extracts relevant features from unknown products. In contrast, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to build predictive models based on it. The hyperparameter tuning of ensemble models such as Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) is also performed. Models like the DT and RF Regressor perform better than Linear Regression and Support Vector Regressor. Notably, even without hyperparameter tuning, the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) Regressor model outperforms all the other models. This comprehensive analysis highlights the comparative benefits of various models and establishes the superiority of XGBoost in predicting sales orders effectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To connect renewable energy sources (e.g. solar or wind) on the grid, an inverter or electronic converter is used. However, a traditional inverter has no inertia in the face of frequency changes. Unlike the inertia of the rotor of a synchronous generator. Frequency variations are a product of the imbalance between the energy generated and the grid loads. If the frequency is too far from its nominal value or if the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is high, it can affect the synchronism of the generators that feed the grid. Therefore, power cuts are made in sectors on the grid, thus preventing instability from spreading to other sectors on the grid, which translates into large economic losses. Solutions such as inverters with virtual inertia (or emulated inertia) are a good alternative due to their structural simplicity and low cost, compared to other solutions such as synchronous condensers, for example. For the virtual inertial control strategy, the grid frequency needs to be measured. This article compares the use of a phase-locked loop (PLL) or a frequency-locked loop (FLL) for frequency estimation and its effect on inertia emulation. The proposed control designs are validated through simulations.</jats:p>"

As a result, the electrical energy supplied by the grid is frequently interrupted. The productivity and quality of service delivered by these health centers to the people who live in these areas are severely affected by this issue. This issue can be resolved by incorporating battery storage systems along with renewable energy sources into the distribution system. The direct delivery of energy to customers is greatly aided by these renewable energy supplies. Partially, the grid supports such a system on a limited scale to guarantee the continuity of the energy supply. This study tried to resolve the problem due to these frequent power outages and its economic expenditures. To address the illustrated challenges, we tried to renovate the diesel generator with a solar and battery energy supply. The PVsyst software shows the average global solar radiation in the selected zone is. The annual energy demand for Gedeo health centers in 2023 is 3.32 MWH and the proposed PV‐battery hybrid system has a 10.95 MWH capacity. Moreover, when we utilize a diesel generator the Capital cost (CC), Net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and payback period are 12 452.25$, 13 369.12$, 0.1$, and 10.7 years respectively. The economic assessment result of the proposed system is 4083$, 4727$, 0.059$, and 3.8 years consecutively. In southern Ethiopia, the annual emission from diesel generators alone, excluding the emission from the vehicles is close to 692 tons. Consequently, from the empirical economic assessment the installed solar energy is 90% more beneficial than the existing system.</jats:p>",

The energy demand for India is soaring high as it is a fast-developing nation in terms of industrialization; however, the interest shown by India toward renewable energy is low, especially for OWTs. This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate the criteria needed to be considered in the installation of OWTs and selection of potential locations in India. Based on literature analysis and exploratory interviews with experts, six aspects, namely, climatic conditions, regional features, investments and benefits, environmental impact, economic impact, and social and technical impact, with a total of twenty-six criteria, were identified and evaluated. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) with grey analytical hierarchy process (GAHP) and grey Complex proportional assessment (GCOPRAS) is used to evaluate the criteria and also to identify the locations for OWTs. Soil condition, extreme wind speed, seismic movement, tidal flow, and closeness to the power transmission grid have been identified as the top five criteria to be considered in the installation of OWTs. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, the Lakshadweep Islands, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been identified as potential locations for installing OWTs in India. The outcomes of this study will deliver better insights for the practitioners about the criteria that need to be considered in OWTs. Further, this study sheds light on the importance of OWTs in an Indian context, which can possibly attract more investments.</jats:p>"

In addition, the operation process analysis covering power supply devices functioning within a given environment was conducted for selected representative electronic security systems operated in buildings. Analysis results enabled determining basic operation process indices for selected power supply systems, i.e., failure rate λ and recovery rate μ. Then, reliability models for devices powering electronic security systems were developed, and a computer simulation to work out reliability parameters was conducted for the determined operation process indices (λ, μ). Basic reliability indices for electronic security systems responsible for the life, health and property accumulated within the buildings and vast areas in question were determined for power supply models developed this way. Data for reliability computer simulations were developed on the basis of proprietary system tests.

Chlorination is widely used for disinfection in water distribution networks (WDNs). A higher dose of chlorine is required in an overhead service reservoir to maintain minimum residual chlorine at the farthest end in WDNs. However, delivering high dosages of chlorine from storage tanks can pose public health issues, especially for the residents living near overhead service reservoirs due to the formation of trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, and chlorophenols. In addition, a higher dosage will lead to increased chlorine consumption and will accelerate pipe corrosion. Booster chlorination (BC) stations with smaller dosages are a solution to this problem. However, identifying the optimal number, locations, and dosage of each BC station in a cost-effective manner is challenging. This study proposes a methodology for determining the optimal number, locations, and chlorine dosages of BC stations in WDNs using a mixed integer linear programming problem. The methodology is illustrated through a simplified WDN in Holeta town, Ethiopia. The results indicate that if one adds two BC stations beyond the three dosage stations at the source, it will lead to a 49% reduction in chlorine use and a 27% decrease in the life cycle cost.</jats:p>",

However, our results also show that the presence of a shared auditor in the supplier-customer pair could alleviate these adverse impacts by enhancing the quality of information in the supply chain.

The article examines this issue using the example of Vital Health Systems, a prominent hospital system with multiple facilities across a wide region. The qualitative data for the study was collected through interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders in Vital Health Systems, including supply chain managers, procurement specialists, frontline staff, etc. The quantitative data for the study were based on reports, internal documentation and archival documents, industry reports, market research, government databases. Analysis of the supply chain resilience of Vital Health Systems to natural disasters was carried out using the PESTLE framework, based on which a comprehensive risk reduction strategy was proposed. This strategy, while rooted in theory, is highly practical and feasible, with measures to optimise stocks, creation of alternative transport routes and logistics networks, and use of technological solutions. Organisational and managerial proposals for minimising supply chain disruptions for Vital Health Systems in the event of natural disasters are based on the theory of transformational leadership, Denison’s organisational culture, Levitt’s diamond model, and McKinsey’s theory of strategic horizons. The role of healthcare professionals, supply chain managers, procurement specialists, and researchers in healthcare management and disaster preparedness is crucial in implementing these strategies.</jats:p>",

Consequently, microplastic biofilms have attracted the attention of researchers. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs is one of the primary ways that bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance. Most studies focus on the effects of nanomaterials on suspended bacteria, but microplastic biofilms as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer also warrant significant investigation. This study primarily explored and compared the effects of nano-titanium dioxide on the conjugation transfer frequency of ARGs in suspended bacteria and microplastic biofilms. Nano-titanium dioxide could promote ARG conjugation in both suspended bacteria and microplastic biofilms, with a greater effect on the former. The mechanism involved nano-titanium dioxide promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in suspended and biofilm bacteria, increasing the synthesis of outer membrane proteins, enhancing the cell membrane permeability, and elevating the expression levels of conjugation-related genes, thereby facilitating the conjugation transfer of ARGs. Biofilm bacteria, being heavily encased and protected by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), exhibit greater resistance to external environmental pressure, resulting in the weaker impact of nano-titanium dioxide on biofilm bacteria compared to suspended bacteria. This study reveals the risk of ARG conjugation transfer within microplastic biofilms induced by nanomaterials, providing valuable insights into the risks of microplastic and antibiotic resistance dissemination in water environments.</jats:p>"

Utilizing the economic order quantity (EOQ) to minimize total costs is a key decision in inventory management, particularly in achieving a sustainable supply chain. The classical EOQ formula is rarely applicable in practice. For example, suppliers may enforce a minimum order quantity (MOQ) that is much larger than the EOQ. Some conditions such as imperfect quality and growing items represent variants of EOQ. Moreover, some requirements, such as the reduction of CO2 emissions, can alter the formula. Moreover, disruptions in the supply chain, such as COVID-19, can affect the formula. This study investigates which requirements must be considered during the calculation of the EOQ. Based on a literature review, 18 requirements that could alter the EOQ formula were identified. The level of coverage for these requirements has been tracked in the literature. Research gaps were presented to be investigated in future research. The analysis revealed that, despite their importance, at least 11 requirements have seldom been explored in the literature. Among these, topics such as EOQ in Industry 4.0, practical EOQ, and resilient EOQ have been identified as promising areas for future research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Brazilian Amazon forest degradation is driven by factors such as fire, mining, and notably, illegal logging. The Brazilian government has implemented control mechanisms to combat illegal timber extraction that have positively impacted deforestation rates. Under these regulations, any wood product, from raw logs to processed lumber, must be registered in control systems before transportation. This allows for analyzing the volume of wood products moving between each pair of timber companies within a specified timeframe. A challenge in this context is the existence of three different and only partially integrated control systems, making the comprehensive analysis of the entire timber market difficult. In this work, we integrate timber transportation data from the three different systems, enabling the creation of what we refer to as Timber Trade Networks (TTNs). From the TTNs, one can identify companies or groups of companies that operate contrary to expected standards, raising suspicions about their compliance with legal regulations. Furthermore, we propose a method to compute probable supply chains of timber companies, addressing a critical traceability challenge that has long concerned the Brazilian government. Among the results, we show that certain TTNs have components that operate without connections with licensed forests, suggesting that unregistered timber is input into those components, which is illegal. Additionally, we illustrate how supply chain analysis can significantly enhance customer confidence in the legality of purchased timber products.</p>"

SCO may enable entrepreneurs to make more accurate assessments and more efficient allocation of limited capital.

Traditional analytical methods often fall short in addressing these challenges, creating a need for more advanced approaches. Methods: This study leverages advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance logistics and inventory man-agement. Using historical data from a multinational retail corporation, including sales, inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, and operational costs, we applied a variety of ML algorithms, in-cluding regression, classification, clustering, and time series analysis. Results: The application of these ML models resulted in significant improvements across key operational areas. We achieved a 15% increase in demand forecasting accuracy, a 10% reduction in overstock and stockouts, and a 95% accuracy in predicting order fulfillment timelines. Additionally, the approach identified at-risk shipments and enabled customer segmentation based on delivery preferences, leading to more personalized service offerings. Conclusions: Our evaluation demonstrates the transforma-tive potential of ML in making supply chain operations more responsive and data-driven. The study underscores the importance of adopting advanced technologies to enhance deci-sion-making, evidenced by a 12% improvement in lead time efficiency, a silhouette coefficient of 0.75 for clustering, and an 8% reduction in replenishment errors.</jats:p>"

This study explores transitioning fleets from traditional diesel to fuel cell (FC) propulsion, identifying the most economically viable option through a comprehensive methodology, including a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. Despite FC technology advancements, challenges persist due to unfavorable hydrogen price and high capital expenditures, necessitating innovative alternatives. The main objective is to introduce and validate the design of a clean grid-independent hydrogen supply station, a transformative solution envisioning a fleet powered by H2 generated from a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL) based renewable microgrid, overcoming challenges posed by H2 pricing and aligning with NZE goals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The design process involves developing a tailored PEMEL-based microgrid for hydrogen production. Analyses include a simple payback (SPB) period evaluation and validation, comparing the proposed configuration with microgrid setups by other authors. Despite challenges, the grid concept associated with fleet renewal demonstrates real-world viability and economic benefits, providing a compelling case for adoption in urban bus fleet renewal. With a 40% reduction in TCO compared to FC bus renewal and a 10% reduction compared to diesel buses, it represents a sustainable and economically sound solution that significantly contributes to the global sustainability agenda.</jats:p>",

The risks and difficulties presented by the VUCA environment can harm an organisation's performance. The project stakeholders are highly encouraged to prioritise sustainability, adaptability, and resilience while considering the constantly changing, volatile, and uncertain climate. Thus, Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) is a strategic response to the challenges the VUCA environment poses. Contracting firms can expand their capacity to mitigate risks, negotiate volatility, and generate long-term value for all stakeholders by integrating sustainability concepts into supply chain operations. However, SSCM become problematic because of diverse global supply chain disruptions and sustainable demands. Understanding the trends in this topic is crucial to discovering the pattern of resilience strategies in sustainable supply chains. The current literature is reviewed in this study, focusing on studies conducted between 2006 and 2024. The Scopus database and the VOS viewer software were used to arrange a systematic literature review and provide an overview of this field. One hundred fifty-nine (159) publications on resilience, risk management and SSCM were identified and written by hundred and nine (109) authors from forty-four (44) countries. The top number of publications was from Iran, with thirty-eight (38), followed by the United States, with twenty-six (26). The most frequently used keywords are sustainability, supply chain management, supply chains, and sustainable development, reflecting the current significant research direction. Standard bibliometric indicators were utilised in this study, and data analysis was done using VOSviewer, Microsoft Excel, and Harzing's Publish and Perish software. The core input of this study is analysing available information to address resilience issues in mitigating risk in the sustainable supply chain. To build a more sustainable system, it offers suggestions for more research in these areas that scholars may pursue and that project stakeholders could implement in their organisations.</jats:p>"

Prioritizing and identifying the risk factors impacting the sustainability of the food supply chain is essential for managing uncertainty and averting unfavorable consequences. This study attempts to identify and rank the most significant risks affecting the sustainability of the food supply chain under an uncertain environment. We use the α-Discounting multi-criteria decision-making (α-D MCDM) method for the main three risk factors: the risks of supply, the risks of demand, and the risks of operations. The primary causes of the challenges in assessing the food supply chain's risk elements include inaccurate assessment data, DMs' subjective preferences, and DMs' differing opinions and thoughts about the criteria. Unfortunately, earlier research fell short of fully resolving these issues. A hybrid three-phase neutrosophic MCDM method is proposed by integrating triangular neutrosophic numbers (TNNs), TNN-AHP, and TNN-CoCoSo to close this gap. In this manner, it may efficiently handle ambiguity. The application of the suggested framework is then explored using the top six food and beverage businesses in the world: Nestle (A1), PepsiCo (A2), Coca-Cola (A3), Danon (A4), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA (A5), and Mondelez International (A6). The results show the sustainability rankings from best to worst, which were established on the groups of decision-makers assessments based on the importance of the risk factors that have to be handled. To gain additional insight into the rationale and resilience of this framework, sensitivity evaluation and comparative analysis have been employed in this study.</jats:p>"

An artificial neuronal network was used to adjust the brain blood oxygenation measurements to evaluate changes in these physiological parameters. Early detection of cerebral blood flow disorders related to cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer´s disease appears to be feasible. Acupuncture with Hegu (LI4) was applied to stimulate brain neuronal networks in 5 control patients (CPs) and 5 brain disorder patients (BDPs). The following conclusions were drawn: 1. fNIRS recordings of brain hemoglobin oxygenation indicate the efficacy of brain microcirculation and brain oxygen supply 2. Central brain acupuncture stimulation reveals deficits in the brain microcirculation and oxygen supply of BDPs 3. A 20-second period of acupuncture stimulation results in brain hypoxia in BDPs but not in CPs, primarily due to mismatching of arterial and venous microcirculation 4. fNIRS combined with subsequent ANN analysis of brain oxygen supply could be very effective and user friendly for recording early signs of brain microcirculation dysregulation and therapeutic progress.</p>"

The following problems exist in the power supply of the emergency equipment: the load equipment randomly cuts in the power supply network; load equipment requires fast dynamic performance of the power supply. This challenges the stability of the portable power supply with the Flyback converter as the core. In this paper, an optimal feedback control strategy based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory is proposed to improve the dynamic and steady-state performance of the Flyback converter. First, the state-averaged space model of the Flyback is derived and established. Second, an output voltage feedback integral controller is introduced to eliminate the steady-state error of the output voltage. Next, according to the LQR optimal control theory, the control model of the Flyback converter has been established, and the parameter design of the controller has been carried out by obtaining the optimal feedback gain matrix of the system. Finally, the simulation models are implemented with an output power of 120 W and a switching frequency of 50 kHz. The simulation results prove that the LQR controller provides superior performance than the traditional PI controller.</jats:p>",

This integration has recently attracted increased attention and emerged formally as circular SCM (CSCM). As with other business practices, economic feasibility is a major deciding factor with regard to CSCM adoption. Therefore, understanding whether, how and when firms can benefit from CSCM is of paramount importance for theory, practice and policy. However, the relationship between CSCM and firm performance and the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions that could explain this relationship have received limited empirical attention. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, this study examines the mediating role of employees' organisational identification in the relationship between CSCM and firm's operational performance and the moderating effect of employees' pro‐environmental attitude on this role. To achieve this, a multi‐respondent cross‐sectional research design was used in which data from managers and employees of 163 Jordan‐based manufacturing firms was obtained using two separately administrated surveys. The results reveal that CSCM has a positive impact on firm's operational performance. CSCM was also found to indirectly improve firm's operational performance through enhancing employees' organisational identification. Further, the results indicated that, unexpectedly, employees' pro‐environmental attitude does not amplify the positive relationship between CSCM and their organisational identification, or indeed the mediating effect of employees' organisational identification in the nexus between CSCM and firm's operational performance. These results have important implications for advancing the theory and practice of the CE.</jats:p>",

This cross-sectional study validates the existence of a housing mismatch in Malaysia from a view of housing demand and supply. This study employed 400 respondents on housing demand and 120 respondents from housing developers who represented housing suppliers. The Partial Least Square Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used to develop the model and validate the data. By performing the composite reliability and convergent validity through PLS-SEM, 25 attributes from housing demand and 22 attributes from housing supply were found significant for the development of the structural housing mismatch model. The final output was established by findings their coefficients determination, path coefficient, effect size and predictive relevance towards variables of housing mismatch. The result indicates five factors with nine attributes in housing demand and 11 attributes from housing supply contributed to the existence of a housing mismatch at 12%. Finally, by incorporating an analysis of the significant findings, it becomes clear that identifying the features of housing mismatch from both sides enables the government to have strategic interventions. This underlines the importance of recognising the key features in guiding authorities aimed at minimising housing disparities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to chronic total occlusion (CTO) is still a subject of debate. The primary goal of revascularization is to provide symptomatic relief and enhancing left ventricular (LV) functions. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is proven to be more sensitive than ejection fraction (EF), especially for subtle ischemic changes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the improvement in LV GLS after revascularization of symptomatic stable coronary patients with single-vessel CTO, categorized according to their collateral supply grades. 69 patients with successful CTO PCI were grouped according to their collateral supply grades, as well-developed (WD) and poor collateral groups and followed-up for 3 months. Basal characteristics were similar for both groups, except for lower EF (p=0.04) and impaired GLS (p&amp;lt;0.0001) in the poor collateral group. At the end of 3 months follow-up symptomatic relief was similar in both groups (p=0.101). GLS improvement reached statistical significance only for the poor collateral, not for the WD group (p&amp;lt;0.0001 and p=0.054, respectively). EF did not change significantly in both groups. Poorly collateralized CTO lesion may not only result in baseline LV dysfunction, but also appear to carry potential for recovery after revascularization. This may not be the case for WD collaterals.</jats:p>"

For the generation of young doctors in psychiatry training programs today, this means they face substantial and potentially overwhelming challenges in their clinical practice. This situation calls for creative solutions in psychiatry training to prepare them best for these challenges.\nMethods\n Perspectives of European trainers in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) were collected and analysed following an iterative procedure in three rounds using thematic analysis of focus groups.\nResults\n The three iterative rounds resulted in five proposed strategies for meeting the challenges of current and future demand in CAP specifically addressing implications for CAP training. Examples were provided illustrating how these strategies could be put into daily training practices. Four strategies aimed mainly at increasing capacity: efficiency (making best use of the existing CAP workforce); consultation (task-sharing); innovation (practicing differently); and wellbeing of the CAP workforce. An additional strategy focusing on prevention and early intervention was identified to decrease demand upstream.\nConclusion\n Rethinking CAP training practices through a European perspective on the balance between capacity and demand yielded strategies for aspects of training that are not yet universally applied. Implementation is partly dependent on the larger service provision system of care while training has leverage for future capacity and quality of care.</p>"

It highlights the significance of warehouses in efficiently and effectively meeting customer demands while minimizing costs. The study examines various types of warehouses and analyzes the activities involved in warehouse operations. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and benefits of warehouse operations in developed and developing countries. It emphasizes the need for efficient warehouse management to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and improve overall productivity. The integration of warehouses into the supply chain process is also emphasized, emphasizing their critical role in facilitating the flow of goods. This paper introduces the Warehouse Management System (WMS) concept as a technological solution for controlling the inflow and outflow of goods. It delves into WMS functions and highlights its importance in inventory control, order management, and system reliability. Additionally, this paper examines the differences between traditional manual warehousing and automated approaches, taking into account factors such as cost, efficiency, and suitability for different types of organizations. In conclusion, the study suggests that automated warehousing is more suitable for larger companies operating in countries with limited manual labor availability. On the other hand, traditional warehousing may be more applicable in developing countries with higher unemployment rates.</jats:p>"

First, determine the goal of dynamic scheduling in the logistics supply chain. Second, considering supplier satisfaction, transportation costs, and maximum delivery distance constraints, a dynamic scheduling model for logistics supply chain is constructed. Then by smoothing the pheromones and designing a transition function, adjusting factors are introduced to update the pheromone rules. Finally, based on the adaptive ant colony algorithm, the solution of the dynamic scheduling function of the logistics supply chain is solved to achieve the dynamic scheduling of the current logistics supply chain. The experimental results show that after 19 iterations, the method can search for the optimal route A1 group with a length of 33.85 km, with fewer iterations and shorter paths. The total cost is 114,290 yuan, and the degree of cargo loss is low, with a maximum of only 0.14%. The task completion time is short, customer satisfaction is above 0.85, and the scheduling accuracy is 99.9%. It can effectively control costs, improve customer satisfaction, and accurately arrange logistics supply chains.</jats:p>"

The review finds that AVs offer substantial improvements in supply chain efficiency through continuous operation and reduced human error, leading to decreased costs and improved delivery timelines. It details the potential for up to 30% enhancement in logistical operations with AV adoption. Critical barriers such as technological challenges, regulatory concerns, and cybersecurity risks are also discussed. Conclusively, the paper argues that while AVs present a promising avenue for revolutionizing supply chain management, their widespread adoption depends on overcoming existing barriers.

This paper establishes a one-dimensional mathematical model based on sections of the Yinjiangjihuai long-distance water diversion project in China. The water supply requirements of the pipelines are categorized into two replenishment modes as follows: gravity supply and pump-pressurized water supply. The opening and closing strategies of the water pipelines under different flow conditions are simulated and analyzed to explore the hydraulic transient processes under various water supply modes. The transient variations of key hydraulic parameters during valve closure are clarified. Simulation results indicate that the water pipeline design is reasonable, meeting the water supply demands at relatively low Manning values and that it has the capability for long-term supply. Due to the excessive head provided by the pumps, pump-pressurized water supply and gravity supply modes cannot operate simultaneously. Under gravity supply mode, the minimum pressure in the downstream pipeline is relatively higher overall, while the maximum pressure in the upstream pipeline is relatively lower overall. In the pump-pressurized water supply mode, the safety and stability of the water supply can be ensured by adjusting the closing time of individual pumps and the interval time between adjacent pumps. The research findings provide technical guidance and scientific basis for the construction of national water networks and water transfer projects.</jats:p>"

To control risk, on the one hand, we use a risk-averse objective, and on the other hand, we utilize a chance constraint to satisfy demand with a high probability. We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic program with a chance constraint and risk-averse objective, where long-term decisions on pre-positioning products are made in the first stage, while recourse decisions on reallocation and emergency procurement are made in the second stage. To allow for different risk preferences, we incorporate conditional value-at-risk into the objective function and study its combination with the expectation or worst-case of the second-stage costs. To solve the resulting models, we develop various variants of the L-shaped method, based on dual and primal decomposition, and by leveraging the connection between the optimization of coherent risk measures and distributionally robust optimization. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate the value of risk aversion and present a comparative computational study on the performance of different algorithms.</jats:p>",

But it also offers new opportunities, as we can track and study the system more efficiently. Several studies individually addressed different digital tracks, focusing on specific aspects like disinformation production or content-sharing dynamics. In this work, we propose to study the news ecosystem as an information market by analysing three main metrics: Supply, Demand, and Diffusion of information. Working on a dataset relative to Italy from December 2019 to August 2020, we validate the choice of the metrics, proving their static and dynamic relations, and their potential in describing the whole system. We demonstrate that these metrics have specific equilibrium relative levels. We reveal the strategic role of Demand in leading a non-trivial network of causal relations. We show how disinformation news Supply and Diffusion seem to cluster among different social media platforms. Disinformation also appears to be closer to information Demand than the general news Supply and Diffusion, implying a potential danger to the health of the public debate. Finally, we prove that the share of disinformation in the Supply and Diffusion of news has a significant linear relation with the gap between Demand and Supply/Diffusion of news from all sources. This finding allows for a real-time assessment of disinformation share in the system. It also gives a glimpse of the potential future developments in the modelisation of the news ecosystem as an information market studied through its main drivers.</jats:p>"

This study collected two hundred and five usable responses from top and senior managers of brewery companies and their key suppliers. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the hypothesized causal paths. The findings indicate that stakeholder support positively moderates the relationship between supply chain integration and organizational resources, as well as the relationship between organizational resources and organizational capabilities. The study has demonstrated that the effect of supply chain integration on organizational resources and capabilities is contingent on the direct and indirect support from both primary and secondary stakeholders in the supply chain. This study contributes to the literature on supply chain management by providing insights into the moderating role of stakeholder support in the relationship between supply chain integration and organizational resources and capabilities. The study highlights the importance of stakeholder support in building the necessary capabilities for a firm to provide competitive services to its customers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We study supply chain contract design under uncertainty. In this problem, the retailer has full information about the demand distribution, whereas the supplier only has partial information drawn from historical demand realizations and contract terms. The supplier wants to optimize the contract terms, but she only has limited data on the true demand distribution. Methodology/results: We show that the classical approach for contract design is fragile in the small data regime by identifying cases where it incurs a large loss. We then show how to combine the historical demand and retailer data to improve the supplier’s contract design. On top of this, we propose a robust contract design model where the uncertainty set requires little prior knowledge from the supplier. We show how to optimize the supplier’s worst-case profit based on this uncertainty set. In the single-product case, the worst-case profit can be found with bisection search. In the multiproduct case, the worst-case profit can be found with a cutting plane algorithm. Managerial implications: Our framework demonstrates the importance of combining the demand and retailer information into the supplier’s contract design problem. We also demonstrate the advantage of our robust model by comparing it against classical data-driven approaches. This comparison sheds light on the value of information from interactions between agents in a game-theoretic setting and suggests that such information should be utilized in data-driven decision making. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0325 . </jats:p>",

An exponential increase in hospital waste can cause very significant risks to both humans and the environment if it is not treated adequately. In this way, the efficient management of this waste can bring benefits and prevent an increase in the likelihood of disease occurring. With the growth of technology, there are various tools available to improve decision-making in the supply chain. Simulation, one of the pillars of Industry 4.0, is one of the tools being used. With the complexity of systems increasing, hybrid simulation provides more precise solutions to problems. The aim of this article is therefore to systematically research and analyze the literature on the use of simulation/hybrid simulation in supply chains in the health sector. In this way, 20 articles that approach simulation as a decision support tool in hospital waste supply chains were analyzed in the context of Industry 4.0. The results indicate that the years 2020 and 2023 had the highest number of publications (with five each) and that countries such as China and Indonesia had the highest number of documents on this topic (with five each). The topics in this research area with more related documents were environmental sciences, computer sciences and medicine. This research highlights the fundamental role of simulation approaches in improving the performance of supply chains in the healthcare sector, promoting resilience and improving healthcare outcomes for patients.</jats:p>"

The adoption of AI in supply chains offers significant opportunities to improve service delivery and operational capabilities, which are crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the rapidly evolving business landscape. The study underscores the importance of AI technologies in reshaping supply chain dynamics by providing a comprehensive analysis of both the benefits and challenges associated with its implementation. Key benefits highlighted include the optimization of inventory management, enhanced accuracy of demand forecasting, reduced operational costs, and improved customer service. These enhancements are pivotal in achieving a competitive edge and adapting to changing market demands.However, the integration of AI into supply chains is not devoid of challenges. The paper identifies critical obstacles such as the need for significant cultural shifts within organizations, data security concerns, and the complexities of navigating legal and regulatory frameworks. These challenges require strategic management to ensure successful AI adoption and to mitigate associated risks.The research includes case studies of Arab companies that have integrated AI into their supply chains, offering practical insights into the real-world application of these technologies. These examples demonstrate both the potential rewards and the difficulties encountered, providing a balanced perspective on the practicalities of AI deployment in supply chain settings.In conclusion, while AI presents substantial opportunities for advancing supply chain management, it also necessitates careful consideration of various implementation challenges. The paper provides strategic recommendations for Arab companies aiming to leverage AI technologies effectively. These guidelines emphasize the need for thorough planning, continuous risk assessment, and fostering an adaptive organizational culture. By addressing these key areas, companies can harness the full potential of AI to enhance their supply chain operations and achieve sustainable growth.</jats:p>"

In fact, this paper aims to determine KM impact on SCP facets (SCPF) through highlighting the relation between KM elements (KME) and SCPF. Proposed approach consists, first, to design a conceptual model identifying the relationship between KME and SCPF. Thereafter, to implement this model, quality function deployment (QFD) house of quality (HOQ) was used. Through the interrelationship matrix, the impact of each KME on whole SCPF can be measured and evaluated, similarly, the impact of whole KME on each SCPF. Finally, based on interviews treated with the managers of SIDILEC international company, a case study was implemented. The results demonstrate that knowledge application, sharing, and capitalization are the most impacting KME on all SCPF. Furthermore, reliability and sustainability are the most impacted SCPF by all KME.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seafood plays an important role in sustainably feeding the world and is one of the most traded food products globally. However sustainability improvements are often focused on its production (e.g., aquaculture, fishing) rather than trade. Here, we quantify the magnitude and extent of global ‘redundant two-way’ seafood trade–the exchange of the same quantity of the same taxonomic species between two countries–to examine its prevalence and potential implications across the seafood supply chain. We focused on wild-caught seafood trade and found that redundant two-way trade has increased by 43%, between 2000 and 2015, making up 3.2% (7.7 Mt) of global seafood trade during that period. Although most countries were involved in redundant two-way seafood trade (111 of 212 analyzed), the majority occurred between five trade partners: Canada and the United States (15%), Germany and the Netherlands (11.8%); Denmark and Sweden (10.6%); Germany and Denmark (7.1%); and France and Norway (7%). Nearly 50% of redundant trade is made up of just four species including Atlantic herring, Atlantic cod, Skipjack tuna and Atlantic mackerel. While deficiencies in global seafood trade data mask seasonal and product heterogeneity, redundant trade could have implications for meeting conservation and sustainable development goals. Future research should build upon these findings to explore specific environmental, economic, and social implications associated with redundant two-way trade to benefit producers and consumers within the seafood supply chain.</jats:p>"

But the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a devastating shock resulting in huge reverse migration in India as well as in its respective states. In this context the present study tries to investigate labour supply and employment opportunity in rural areas of Chhattisgarh due to COVID-19-led reverse migration and also examines the gender specific impacts of COVID-19 on reverse migrants in Chhattisgarh. The study also suggests the possible measures to rebuild the Chhattisgarh’s rural economy after COVID-19. Thus, the study inculcates both secondary and primary data. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis are computed to get the results. The study found that there is a sudden rise in labour supply in the rural economy of Chhattisgarh. Job loss is the biggest problem faced by migrants followed by loss in income. The study also found that there is no significant impact of reverse migration due to Covid-19 between both the gender in rural Chhattisgarh. Thus, on the basis of primary survey and focused group discussions the study concludes that the returned migrants would surely get back to their normal lives and would gradually afford the better standard of living to themselves as well as to their families. A comprehensive overview of the economic, health and gendered implications of the Covid-19 pandemic reveals the need for a more proactive and on-the-ground strategy to combat the post -crisis scenario in the rural economy of Chhattisgarh. Also, the Covid-19 pandemic have reinforced the need for and the importance of compiling data of migrants. Such a database helps in effective administration of various government interventions. However, there is also an urgent call for the proactive actions to be undertaken to retain these reverse migrants in their original source, so that they would contribute towards the development of their own state.\n          </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Papaya (Carica papaya Linn) is a tropical fruit with high economic and nutritional value. Indonesia was the fourth biggest papaya producer in the Asian continent from 2008 to 2018, and East Java was the primary contributor. Papaya has complex chemical components such as protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, minerals, and vitamins. However, its supply chain system faces challenges such as postharvest issues, processing and transportation, and low consumption. This study aimed to determine the papaya fruit supply chain system in    Surabaya City to reform the existing food and nutrition action plan, which has not yet been fully implemented. With a toolkit from FAO called RUFSAT (Rapid Urban Food System Assessment Tool), the food system was developed with a primary concern on papaya commodities. Results indicated that the papaya supply chain in Surabaya is comprised of three channels: farmer to collector, wholesaler/distributor, retailer, and consumer. Acquisition and distribution of papaya still suffered from losses, food safety, transportation handling, packaging issues, and quality assurance practices. In terms of consumption, most households ingested papaya within 1-3 times per week, which is considered inadequate. Effective collaboration among city government agencies is pivotal for addressing supply chain complexities. In addition, integrating papaya with other fruits into urban farming initiatives can help to improve the nutritional status of Surabaya citizens.</jats:p>"

Given that factor, this study formulates a model that integrates offline direct sales with online distribution led by remanufacturers, assuming that consumers perceive differences between channels. We develop a Stackelberg game model to represent cases of remanufactured channel promotion and generic promotion and analyze the optimization of pricing and the level of promotion effort decisions for remanufactured products. Furthermore, considering the market conditions, such as the difference coefficient of consumer channel perception and the spillover effect in generic promotion, we investigate the selection of the optimal promotion strategy for remanufacturers. The research findings reveal the following: (i) Under channel promotion, the level of promotion effort and the prices of online and offline products are positively correlated with the difference coefficient of consumer value perception. Conversely, under generic promotion, the level of promotion effort and the prices of online and offline products initially decrease and then increase with the difference coefficient of consumer value perception. (ii) Under the generic promotion, the differences in prices between online and offline products are significantly smaller compared to channel promotion. (iii) The remanufacturer’s profit from channel promotion is higher when the difference in consumer channel perception is either small or large. Conversely, when the difference in consumer channel perception is moderate, the optimal strategy for remanufacturers is generic promotion, thereby achieving a mutually beneficial outcome with retailers. This study provides a theoretical foundation for remanufacturers to formulate effective pricing and promotion strategies in dual-channel marketing, thereby enhancing the market recognition and sales of remanufactured products.</jats:p>"

At present, most of the data center heat system operation regulation depends on artificial experience, to meet the needs of the safe operation of the server is considered, not from the perspective of energy saving, heat system of indoor side heat environment control, and the cold source system side is not according to the end demand and the demand difference between the end of the water supply temperature control and water flow optimization distribution, not only makes the natural cold source is not effectively use, and reduce the active cold source. For the multi-terminal data center with the centralized water cooling source system with natural cooling source, this study analyzed the heat transfer and thermodynamic process of the system, established the corresponding numerical model, and optimized the operation strategy of the system of centralized water-cooled air conditioning system in the data center. In view of the energy consumption waste of air conditioning system caused by supply and demand mismatch and excessive cooling in most data center current operation, this study proposes an personalized optimization strategy for centralized water-cooled air-conditioning systems in multi-terminal data centers based on supply-demand matching. Using this optimization method, a typical case was simulated and optimized with the outdoor environment of Beijing. Compared with the non-optimized working condition, the annual average chilled water supply temperature was raised from 12°C to 14.27°C, and the upper operating temperature of the natural cooling source was raised from 10°C to 15.897°C. Moreover, the NCM operation hours of the data center cooling source system were extended by 32.57% and the energy consumption of the cooling source system reduced by 28.70%.</jats:p>",

At the same time, in the coming years the energy landscape will change into a system in which an increase in decentralized systems based on renewable energy sources will take over the leading function. This transformation process will further increase the complexity and overall pressure for change in energy systems over the next decade. In order to be able to ensure the energy supply and the reliable system operation of the grids in the future as well, communicative networking of generators, storage systems, electrical consumers and grid equipment is indispensable. This study aims to investigate the consequences of including electric vehicles in Istanbul’s power system using a unit commitment simulation model. The presented considerations analyze how uncertain and managed charging strategies affect the power system in terms of operating costs and renewable resources. The presented simulations indicate that, in economic terms, the use of a managed charging strategy saves 2.3%, reducing the total cost from USD 66.71 million to USD 65.18 million.

This has made the industry to witness a rapid transformation in recent times with the digitalization of vessels, and anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels are no exception. The digitalization of offshore operational vessels is expected to play an important role in the future and support the analysis of the automation and instrumentation market. The AHTS vessel is a specialized offshore support vessel used in the oil and gas industry, which serves multiple functions and roles that provide support for offshore drilling and production operations. The multi-functional purpose of AHTS vessels includes anchor handling, towing, supply and cargo transportation, oil spill clean-up response, and cable and pipe laying, among others. This requires the integration of multiple functional digitalized systems to optimize vessel operations, especially in harsh arctic environments. The current study reviews the importance and potential of AHTS vessels' digitalization and discusses its benefits, opportunities, and challenges. A systematic approach is adopted to explore the potential development and dynamics of digitalization in the maritime industry, focusing on AHTS vessels. This study finds that the extent of knowledge is evolving and requires an integrated approach to maritime digitalization to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and resilience in critical offshore operations.</jats:p>",

Food product certifications can aid consumers in making better-informed purchasing decisions. In this research, we examined the consumer's perceptions of the sustainability features of two institutional short chain certifications, which indicate the product's local and short supply chain origins. Data was obtained from a sample of 300 Catalan consumers, who were stratified by gender, age, and income level. Respondents were surveyed face-to-face in an experimental environment and asked to rate 20 sustainability indicators on a 7-point Likert scale based on FAO’s sustainability assessment for food and agriculture systems (SAFA), with fig jam as the case study. The study showed that consumers believe purchasing certified fig jam contributes to improving agri-food supply chain sustainability, particularly concerning the farmers’ economic and governance aspects. The heterogeneity analysis revealed a correlation between trust in the certification and purchase intention of certified fig jam and higher sustainability perceptions, particularly among the enthusiastic cluster of consumers. However, prior knowledge of the certification was not a significant factor. The results highlight the significance of implementing direct sales and short chain certifications through institutional bodies to encourage consumers to make sustainable purchasing choices. This represents a road map for producers, policymakers and marketers in the agri-food sector.</p>"

This paper investigates the beneficial effects of AI and IoT on\nsupply chain efficiency and makes the argument that corporate failings in cyber\nsecurity might have a detrimental effect on supply chain efficiency. This study\nemployed a quantitative study with 91 respondents from organizations that\nsubstantially rely on supply chain operations. To determine the arbitrary associations\nbetween the independent and dependent variables, data were analyzed using Smart\nPLS. The findings imply that while AI and IoT have a beneficial impact on supply\nchain management performance, cyber security breaches are seen to have a negative\nimpact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;</jats:p>",

This review examines crop simulation models and methods for improving irrigation management, with a focus on integrating weather forecast data. The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) developed models such as AquaCrop, WOFOST (WOrld FOod Studies), DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator), exploring the incorporation of forecasted ETo (reference evapotranspiration) calculated based on forecasted values of weather through the Penman-Monteith method and rainfall data into the models using modified rule-based approaches with various forecast horizons, which enhances irrigation planning. Optimization methods, including genetic algorithms coupled with crop models, are also assessed and have shown significant water savings and profit gains compared with traditional farming practices. Emerging real-time irrigation scheduling tools, including simulation-optimization, field data assimilation, and human–machine interactions, further improve productivity and water conservation. Studies have also shown that web-based decision support using satellite remote sensing and crop models can be used to effectively monitor crop water status and predict real-time irrigation needs. Ongoing innovations like coupling crop models with optimization techniques, weather forecasting, remote sensing, and recommendations based on field experiments have shown promise for transforming irrigation planning and management.</jats:p>",

Based on dynamic capability theory and ambidextrous innovation theory, this study adopts the Resource–Behavior–Performance framework to investigate how green supply chain integration (GSCI) and ambidextrous green innovation affect financial performance. The proposed hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling using data from 400 China’s pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises. The results indicate that the various dimensions of GSCI and ambidextrous green innovation yield distinct outcomes. Among the three dimensions of GSCI, only green supplier integration and green customer integration significantly impact financial performance directly, unlike green internal integration. Among the two dimensions of ambidextrous green innovation, only exploitative green innovation significantly influences financial performance, acting as a mediator between the GSCI dimensions and financial performance, while exploratory green innovation does not. The main advantages of this study include considering the connotation and value of GSCI from a green dynamic capability perspective, as well as the effects of exploratory and exploitative green innovation as intermediary behaviors while simultaneously considering the performance effects of GSCI and ambidextrous green innovation. This study offers novel academic insights and practical guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises to integrate GSCI and ambidextrous green innovation, with the aim of achieving better financial performance in their sustainable development efforts.</jats:p>"

The automation and computerization of supply chains, asset tracking, simulation, and the prediction of disruption through artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming a matter of course. In selected countries, this will be facilitated by sixth-generation mobile networks planned for full deployment in 2030. The 6G-based intelligent supply chain management within the Industry 4.0/5.0 paradigm will ensure not only greater fluidity of supply, but also faster response to changes in market availability or prices, allowing substitutes to be found and taken into account in the production process and its logistical provisioning. The article outlines key research and development trends in this area and identifies priority development directions, taking into account the advantages and opportunities offered by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and machine learning (ML). The emergence of 6G technology will transform the supply chain with unprecedented speed, connectivity, and efficiency. This technology will improve visibility, automation, and collaboration while supporting sustainable and safe operations. As a result, companies will be able to design, plan, and operate their supply chains with greater precision, flexibility, and responsiveness, ultimately leading to a more robust and agile supply chain ecosystem.</jats:p>"

The prototype implements stepwise predictive control, which checks the partial conditions of the process success at each step based on critical parameter models of both the engine and the supply network. The development is based on the use of the LabVIEW software suite, parametric identification methods, physical simulation, analog and digital signal filtering, auto-regulation theory, mathematical analysis, and statistics. The study experimentally proved the possibility and effectiveness of predictive start-up control for asynchronous motors of local power supply systems in terms of the magnitude, rate, and pattern of variations in the operating parameters of motor stator windings without a direct measurement of the shaft velocity. The error of the developed models for determining the critical mode parameters, affecting the success of starting the asynchronous motor, is demonstrated to be less or equal to 4%. The error in the predictive estimate of the start-up duration for an asynchronous motor did not exceed 14%. It is demonstrated that in 91% of experiments with the start-ups of an asynchronous motor using the physical model of a local power supply system under the variations of circuit-mode conditions, the automatic system prototype reliably identified the success/failure of the engine start at various stages of the process. If a failure was detected, the prototype ensured the interruption of start-ups in the early stages. The studies revealed no cases of non-issuance by the automatic system of a command to interrupt the start-up process under the conditions of its failure. Therefore, intelligent automatic systems for monitoring the success of starting asynchronous motors in local power supply systems will reduce the likelihood of damage to motors and equipment of power supply networks, preserve their serviceability, and improve the reliability of power supply to consumers.</jats:p>"

They have applied sustainability standards to manage environmental risks stemming from suppliers' farming operations. To examine the application of supply chain sustainability standards in soil protection, we conducted a study using global data on existing sustainability standards and their use in the food retail industry, a key sector in agrifood supply chains. Soil quality is a priority objective in retail sector sustainability efforts: 41 % of the investigated companies apply some soil-relevant standard. However, the standards lack specific and comprehensive criteria. Compliance typically requires that farmers are aware of soil damage risks and implement some mitigation measures; however, no measurable thresholds are usually assigned. This stands in contrast to some other provisions in a number of standards, such as deforestation criteria. There are two probable causes of this difference: companies and certification bodies have prioritised other environmental challenges (e.g. pesticide use, biodiversity loss in tropical biomes) over soil degradation. Also, there are practical constraints in the useful standardisation of soil sustainability. Effective soil sustainability provisions will require measurable, controllable, and scalable multidimensional interventions and compliance metrics. Often, these are not yet available. The development of necessary practical tools is a priority for future research.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, companies are increasingly focusing on their channel strategies to gain sustainable development. However, asymmetric demand information poses challenges to these decisions. This paper explores the interplay between a retailer’s information sharing strategy and a manufacturer’s channel strategy in a retailer-led green supply chain, where the manufacturer may establish an online channel to sell its green products directly. The dominant retailer has private demand information about the market and decides whether to share private information with the manufacturer. By establishing a game model, we analyze the impacts of information sharing and the manufacturer’s channel strategy on the payoffs for all the supply chain members, considering sustainability aspects such as the environmental benefits of green products and the efficiency of supply chain operations. The results show that information sharing benefits both the retailer and the manufacturer, irrespective of the establishment of an online channel. When the retailer shares demand information, opening an online channel benefits the manufacturer but benefits the retailer under certain conditions. Furthermore, through a numerical approach, we examine the strategic preferences of the firms and derive the equilibrium strategy. Interestingly, the manufacturer consistently prefers the scenario involving both an online channel and information sharing. The retailer’s preference, however, depends on the direct selling cost; it favors information sharing with or without an online channel based on this cost. Ultimately, our findings suggest that the equilibrium strategy can either be sharing information with an online channel or not sharing information without an online channel, which is contingent upon the direct selling cost and the forecast signal precision. These insights provide actionable strategies for enhancing the sustainability of supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

To take a typical example, Enterprise A is supplied essential parts on a regular basis to manufacture its products. To place the order requires global financial systems, integrated email systems, the internet, multiple telecommunications systems, and supply software provided by large companies. To deliver the parts may require air and maritime transportation systems, the rail network, interstate highway systems, road haulage companies, state and local transportation systems and so forth. When any of these complex systems fail, the impact can be global, and the results catastrophic. Recent examples include the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID pandemic, computer chip shortages delaying the assembly and sales of cars, and, most recently, the baby formula shortage. These were due to disruptions in the supply chain caused by an overreliance on single sourced suppliers who failed to deliver, transportation disruptions, outsourcing of critical parts, supplies, medicines to distant countries, and/or an overreliance on “Just In Time” for inventory management. This is the case of placing too many eggs in too few baskets, and often just one basket. Counterfeit or substandard parts and products can enter the supply chain via graft, breaks in chain of custody, or carelessness. This has included critical mechanical parts on aircraft, chips containing spyware, and substandard or out of date medicines substituted for the real thing resulting in serious illness and death. This complex SoS needs to be examined, studied, and understood in the same way as a mission critical system; threats, vulnerabilities, and risks need to be identified and mitigated and assurance cases defined to ensure a solid and reliable supply chain. This paper will look at the supply chain of an example factory system to determine how some of these problems can be predicted, prevented, mitigated, and solved using the UAF, RAAML and assurance case techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Nepal, solid waste management is one of the major environmental issues, especially in the urban areas. While solid waste management (SWM) has become a major concern for municipalities and the country as a whole, the status of SWM is not fully understood due to the lack of SWM baseline data, which are also essential for effective planning. Such a back drop, this research attempts to assess the plastic waste released, management and recycling in supply chain in Hetauda Sub-Metropolitan City. This study revealed that about 83.8% households segregate their waste. None of the surveyed households have had public waste collection bin nearby their home whereas all households have had knowledge on solid waste management. About 63% HHs heard of importance of plastic waste recycling and all express their readiness to segregate the plastic solid waste if recycling program is set up in municipal area. Per capita waste generation per day is 141 gm out of which about 15% is plastic waste. On an average daily waste released at household level are 0.8 kg/HH which is 28.1 kg per institution.  Total wastes release per day from Hetauda city is 27.4 MT and 10006.8 MT per year.  About 931 MT plastic per year are gone in dumping sites in the Hetauda Sub-Metropolitan City. This study suggests that municipal office needs to develop an appropriate policy and strategy framework together with technical guidelines on key issues such as organic composting, recycling and landfill operation from dumping sites.\r\nInt.

The paper considered a system for supplying processed cheese with rheological parameters at temperatures from 55 to 95 °C. As a result of hydraulic calculations using published data, it was found that 1) calculation of the effective dynamic viscosity μE using the Ostwald formula with the found parameter values yields results very close to the experimental data obtained from open sources; 2) the dependence of the expended power N on the pressure is linear, on the rotor speed n is parabolic, and on the dimensionless dynamic viscosity coefficient μ is power-law; 3) the dimensionless dynamic viscosity coefficient μ has different effects on the productivity Q and the power N: for large values of μ, the effect on Q decreases, while on N, on the contrary, it increases;4) with the growth of viscosity of the pumped liquid, the energy efficiency of the cam pump first improves (the hydraulic efficiency of the pump η increases, the specific energy consumption indicator E decreases), and then begins to deteriorate. The characteristic of the process pipeline (dependence of the required pressure on the flow rate of pumped processed cheese) with a given length L, local resistances, static pressure PC for three values of the internal diameter is constructed. A method is proposed that allows determining the operating parameters of the liquid food supply system at the operating point, taking into account the influence of its viscosity (using the example of pumping processed cheese).</jats:p>",

It focused on assessing e-procurement's impact on supply chain performance in Kenya's level six hospitals, specifically analyzing the effects of e-tendering, e-invoicing, and e-payment within these institutions. The theoretical framework was based on Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory, transaction cost economics theory, and dynamic capability theory. A descriptive research design was employed, targeting 143 employees from the finance and procurement departments of Kenyatta National Hospital. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed with SPSS version 26, employing both descriptive and inferential statistics to derive findings and conclusions regarding the study variables. The results indicated that e-tendering (β= 0.328; t= 4.739; p= 0.000), e-invoicing (β= 0.239; t= 2.005; p= 0.000), and e-payment (β= 0.416; t= 1.901; p= 0.02) had a statistically significant positive impact on supply chain performance. With an overall p-value of 0.000 and an adjusted coefficient of determination of 75.6%, the study confirmed that e-procurement significantly affects supply chain performance in level six hospitals. The findings conclude that e-procurement practices positively and significantly enhance the supply chain performance of level six hospitals in Kenya. The study recommends broadly adopting e-procurement practices, including e-tendering, supplier assessment, e-invoicing, and e-payments, to enhance supply chain performance in Kenya's level six hospitals. Further research is suggested on the impact of e-procurement on supply chain performance in other government institutions, such as public universities.\r\n </jats:p>"

However, the question of who will lead live-streaming e-commerce in the supply chain (SC-LSC) is a key issue, especially when there is equity cooperation between upstream and downstream enterprises. Three main SC-LSC models are examined: independent SC-LSC run by manufacturers, independent SC-LSC run by retailers, and cooperatively run SC-LSC. Then, a novel LSC demand function composed of online popularity, price discount and sales conversion rate is proposed. Furthermore, four scenarios have been comprehensively investigated considering whether there is an online-to-offline drainage effect and whether there is equity cooperation. Regardless of the scenario, having both parties reach an agreement on a given SC-LSC model is difficult, and even equity cooperation cannot promote SC-LSC cooperation. In most cases, manufacturers tend to offset the losses caused by the drainage effect by adopting high wholesale prices, which will in turn exacerbate retailers’ resistance to SC-LSC. These findings provide insight into how LSC is modeled and how LSC can be better implemented in various types of supply chains such as that of Gree Electric.</jats:p>"

There are already enough scientific materials on this matter, which prove that the actual efficiency of air purifiers in real conditions is much lower than the data given by the manufacturers. Therefore, there is a need to determine the optimal performance of the air purifier in real conditions in order to achieve the WHO recommended levels of safe indoor pollution with a maximum time interval of 1 hour, besides, taking into account that the air outside has a higher level of pollution with particles of PM 2.5. In this study, we strive to obtain a PM 2.5 value of 5 μg/m3 with a PM2.5 level in the air outside of 16.7 μg/m3. The calculated value of CADR for light pollution should be at least half of the power of the air purifier for the projected cleaning duration of no more than 1 hour. A smaller value of CADR leads to further accumulation of pollutants, which reduces the work of the cleaner. In this study, the value of CADR was at L=100 m3/hour the value of CADR= 59 m3/hour with the efficiency of filter inserts in 73% and natural sedimentation of particles in 25%, and at L=310 m3/hour the value of CADR= 59 m3/hour at efficiency of filter inserts in 94% and natural sedimentation of particles in 18%.

As the target function of the optimization process, it is proposed to take the total heat losses that occur along the entire length of the studied section of the heat pipe from the source of heat supply to each of the consumers. Based on this, the geometric parameters of heat networks are modeled using instrumental means of determining the most rational positions of their branching nodes in order to identify economically feasible directions for laying each of the fragments of the corresponding networks. In order for the proposed approach to the optimization of heat networks to be conveniently applied in practice, additional mathematical tools should be introduced that allow taking into account specific urban planning conditions and restrictions imposed on heat supply systems and must be taken into account in the design process. In order to illustrate the simplicity of the proposed approach, the sequence of actions that must be performed to optimize the geometric parameters of the heat network is given. The corresponding sequence of actions was considered when modeling the elementary heat supply network.\r\nThe application of the developed algorithm allows not only to reduce heat losses during transportation of the coolant from boiler rooms to consumers, but also, as a result, to increase the level of energy efficiency of the entire heat supply system, to achieve higher savings rates, and also to indirectly achieve tangible environmental and social effects due to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions ( which could be formed during the burning of fuel for the production of additional thermal energy) into the atmospheric air and a potential reduction of costs for the heating needs of buildings on the part of subscribers (consumers). Obviously, the use and further improvement of the proposed algorithm will contribute to the gradual achievement of the goals of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

An avenue consistently used is to invest in large-scale public infrastructure projects. In 2019, the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) was launched with the aim of providing potable drinking water to every rural household in India. Underscoring the large investments in infrastructure development, the mission holds significant potential to create employment. The evidence base of studies assessing the effect of rural development programs on employment was weak. Against this backdrop, we assessed the employment generation potential of JJM at various phases of its implementation. We utilized secondary and scheme-level primary data across states of India and used the input-output model and ratio method to assess employment prospects. Our results suggest that JJM has the potential to generate an average of 5.99 million person-year of direct and 22.25 million person-year of indirect employment during the construction phase, and 1.11 million person-year of additional direct employment annually during the maintenance phase. Our study highlights the spillover effects of public investments in the form of employment generation and indicates that the impact of JJM is likely to be substantial once the program is complete and operational.</jats:p>",

The existing appropriate pattern for economic performance increase as well as pollution emissions abatement is a basic issue in industry activities. In this paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is introduced for estimating the directional marginal profit maximization of supply chain divisions based on wasted energy and power losses. The purpose of this study is to estimate the directional marginal productivity in the supply chain, which enables us to find the optimal direction of efficient divisions on the frontier. This makes the allocation of resources create a marginal profit increase and the pollution emissions be abated simultaneously. Indeed, the proposed model considers the synergistic effects of each input on MP estimation in predetermined directions. The model is able to estimate the marginal profit maximization of desirable output and undesirable output decrease for each input simultaneously. The results suggested that the gas field division of one of the supply chains had fundamental capacities for energy production increments and flare gas decrements. Furthermore, the gas field division of this supply chain also had a considerable structure for the marginal profit maximization of outputs based on flare gas decreases. Additionally, the distribution lines of 0.80% supply chains provided wasted energy reduction by adding one extra unit to the line’s capacity in the determined direction. Especially, there were supply chains that had investment opportunities for an acceptable abatement of power losses. This not only enables divisions to respond to fluctuations in demand as they produce more energy in critical situations like climate change but also decreases harmful emissions as wasted energy in supply chain divisions.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper posits that Supply Chain Optimization using Artificial Intelligence (SCO-AI) systems can help with these concerns. SCO-AI employs real-time data analysis and advanced machine learning algorithms which results to reduced response time, enhanced logistics route optimization, improved demand planning as well as real-time inventory control. Thus, the idea herein suggested fits smoothly into existing supply chain frameworks for data-driven decisions that make companies remain agile in ever-changing market dynamics. SCO-AI implementation has seen significant improvements in inventory turnover rate, rates of on-time delivery as well as overall supply chain costs.

In Cambodia, a program utilizing the sustainable rice cluster (SRC) approach has been developed and put into action by the government in order to maintain the rise of rice production. Compared to traditional approaches, SRC has enhanced rice cultivation by about 40%. The key lessons Cambodia can learn are boosting domestic production, diversifying rice varieties, improving storage and distribution, practicing climate-smart practices, strengthening regional cooperation, improving market access, and farmer empowerment. By analyzing rice demand and supply dynamics in ASEAN and applying the lessons learned, Cambodia can strive to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production and reduce reliance on imports, increase the profitability and competitiveness of the rice sector, enhance food security for its population, and contribute to regional food security within ASEAN.</jats:p>"

Sodium selenite was introduced by pre-sowing seed treatment and leaf treatment of vegetative plants. The study simulated optimal water supply conditions and soil moisture deficiency during the critical period of plant growth. The role of selenium in the regulation of the production process and the formation of the amino acid composition of spring wheat grain was studied. It was found that the production process of wheat plants, both under optimal water supply and in drought conditions, depended on the method of application of selenium and the varietal characteristics of spring wheat. The results allowed us to assume that selenium activated the attenuating ability of the ear by enhancing its acceptor properties. Under these conditions, the grains were better provided with assimilates. this made it possible to form the maximum possible yield of wheat grain. In conditions of drought, during leaf treatment of plants with sodium selenite, favorable conditions were created for the formation of reproductive organs of wheat, which stimulated the restoration of the processes of assimilate outflow from the vegetative mass into the forming grains. This made it possible to influence production processes and reduce the depression of wheat crop formation. The use of selenium revealed an increase in the total content of key amino acids, which had a significant effect on the antioxidant status of plants and contributed to the realization of their adaptive potential. The positive effect of selenium on the content of a number of amino acids, including on the assimilation of methionine, was revealed, which was probably due to the synthesis of selenomethionine, since the ways of their formation are similar and it is not possible to separate them. The greatest effect of selenium was observed in the cultivation of wheat of the Zlata variety compared with wheat of the Ester variety, which was determined by varietal differences inherent genetically and the unequal protein content in the grain.</jats:p>"

Several methodological approaches are used, including historicalism, objectivity, and comparative-historical methods. An anthropological approach is also applied to study socio-cultural aspects of people's lives during this period. The article emphasizes the importance of developing a water supply and sewerage system for improving the living standard of the population and ensuring the functioning of industry. In the course of our research, we analyzed available sources on the history of the water supply and sewerage system in Krasnoyarsk during the specified period, as well as described key measures taken by local authorities within modernization activities to improve the water supply and sewerage system both during the Great Patriotic War and the postwar period (installation of water intake points and booths, opening of new trusts, implementation of water disinfection measures, hydraulic tests, ВЕСТНИК Сургутского государственного педагогического университета № 3 (90) 2024 г. 117 etc.). In the analysis of existing literature on the history of housing and communal services in the city, we identified key features of the Khrushchev era in the history of the formation of the water supply and sewerage systems in Krasnoyarsk, which significantly expands our understanding of everyday life of urban residents during that period.

The highest emergence rate, reaching 75%, was observed under 20% soil moisture conditions. By the eighth day of the experiment, the lengths of the plumules and radicles under the optimal emergence rate (full water, FW) were 21.82% and 10.87% longer, respectively, than those under closely matching the soil moisture content during the background survey (stress water, SW). The differential development of seedlings under varying moisture regimes is attributed to sugar metabolism within the seeds and the accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA). At FW conditions, enhanced sugar metabolism, which generates more energy for seedling development, is facilitated by higher activities of α-amylase, sucrose synthase, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase compared to SW conditions. This is reflected at the transcriptomic level with upregulated expression of the α-amylase (<jats:italic>AMY2</jats:italic>) gene and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (<jats:italic>TPS6</jats:italic>), while genes associated with ABA signaling and transduction are downregulated. Additionally, under FW conditions, the expression of genes related to the chloroplast thylakoid photosystems, such as photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), is upregulated, enhancing the seedlings’ light-capturing ability and photosynthetic efficiency, thereby improving their autotrophic capacity. Furthermore, FW treatment enhances the expression of the non-enzymatic antioxidant system, promoting metabolism within the seeds. In contrast, SW treatment increases the activity of the enzymatic antioxidant system, including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), to cope with water stress.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Our experiment systematically evaluated the impact of moisture conditions on the growth and development of <jats:italic>F. kryloviana</jats:italic> seedlings.

The approach tries to explore the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors on the capacity to respond to complex transition challenges. Our working hypothesis is that agri-food supply chains are embedded in the territory they belong to, economic performances and market competitiveness are strongly influenced by a combination of organisational capabilities and good governance solutions. These topics are developed by examining the innovative socioeconomic features of two of the largest world and European supply chains: the processing tomato supply chains of Northern Italy and Extremadura (Spain), both representing most of the processed tomato national production, governed by an overarching organisation gathering producers and processing firms on a parity basis, characterised by an innovative path developed to face the changing conditions of policies and markets. The paper shows how governance capabilities and their implications on the competitiveness and chain’s performance need to be explored by combining qualitative and quantitative analysis and indicators.</jats:p>"

Using supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) as replacements for cement in concrete provides an effective way to reduce GHG emissions. However, quantifying the construction performance of using SCM concrete is hard because of complex interactions between concrete’s mechanical properties and construction characteristics, like local energy supply, surrounding temperature and construction plans, which leads to only the fragmental performance of using SCM concrete being explored in previous studies. There still lacks an effective way to quantify the comprehensive performance and provide decision support for contractors about how to use SCM concrete. To deal with the gap, this research proposes a Collection–Simulation–Calculation–Decision (CSCD) method to analyze the complex interactions between concrete and construction, and to quantify the performance of the supply chain–construction when using SCM. A case study is also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is effective in quantifying the performance of using SCM concrete in construction and providing decision support for construction decision makers. A scenario analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in different project characteristics, including the global warming potential (GWP) factors for different construction sites, seasonal temperature changes and different construction plans. The proposed method is an effective tool to quantify the construction performance of using SCM concrete considering complex interactions between concrete mechanical properties and construction characteristics. The results of the research can assist construction decision makers to make decisions about using SCM concrete by comprehensively understanding the impacts shifting along the concrete supply chain and construction.</jats:p>"

This is done to bring as many tourists as possible to Simalungun Regency through culinary tourism. The locus of this research is 4 tourist destinations in Simalungun Regency, namely Haranggaol, BIS, Sibaganding, and Parapat. Regional planning is a process of knowing and analyzing current conditions, forecasting the development of various factors, estimating limiting factors, setting goals and objectives to be achieved, determining steps to achieve goals, and determining locations and various activities to be carried out. One of the approaches taken to carry out the regional planning process is SWOT and Supply and Demand Analysis. The research was conducted over several months involving informants to obtain valid information. Based on the results of interviews addressed directly to informants, currently the attractions offered to visiting tourists are natural attractions in the form of scenery. Therefore, the existence of photo spots is the most desirable because of their natural beauty so it is worth displaying on social media pages such as Instagram and Facebook. Good tourist attractions must be able to bring in many tourists and hold them for a long time, assuming that the greater the profit expected from their presence by providing satisfaction to tourists. Activities and objects that are attractions must be in good condition, both attractions in the form of activities such as dances, as well as attractions in the form of objects, such as temples, krises, and so on, the way of presentation must be appropriate because tourist attractions are presented in front of visitors to tourist objects which will be said to be successful if they cause impressions and satisfaction to tourists. Tourism objects must also be integrated with other tourism requirements such as services and transportation. The identification of tourist attractions and existing supporting facilities/infrastructure in DTW Haranggaol, Bukit Indah Simarjarunjung, Sibaganding, and Parapat, Simalungun Regency was carried out using data on existing tourist attractions in DTW Haranggaol, Bukit Indah Simarjarunjung, Sibaganding, and Parapat, Simalungun Regency obtained from field observations and the results of the Quantitative - Two Steps Questionnaire round I method. The condition data is not only obtained from the results of field observations but also from the average value of respondents' answers to the attraction conditions in round II.   The existence of amenities is one of the factors that support the activities of visitors to DTW Haranggaol, Bukit Indah Simarjarunjung.</jats:p>"

The research focuses on how blockchain can enhance international payment systems and stimulate international trade under economic sanctions.\r\nMethodology: The study employs a descriptive express analysis and a system of recursive equations to explore the dynamics between cross-border cash flows and GDP growth. Data from the World Bank and the Central Bank of Russia are used to model the impact of transnational cash flow variations on the GDP of the Russian Federation. The methodological framework includes constructing and solving a system of econometric equations to predict economic outcomes based on changes in cash flow dynamics.\r\nResults: The findings reveal that a 1% reduction in transnational cash flows could potentially decrease the GDP of the Russian Federation by 0.45%. The introduction of blockchain technologies in cross-border payment systems is shown to mitigate these risks by providing a secure and efficient alternative to traditional international payment methods. This integration not only enhances the resilience of supply chains but also supports sustainable economic development amid sanctions.\r\nConclusions: The study concludes that blockchain technology offers significant potential to sustain international supply chains and economic stability under sanctions. By ensuring secure and efficient cross-border transactions, blockchain can help localize risks associated with disruptions in international payment systems, thereby fostering sustainable economic growth. The research underscores the importance of adopting innovative technologies to navigate economic challenges and enhance the resilience of national economies.</jats:p>"

Одним из перспективных технических решений водоприемников является конструкция удлиненной вихревой камеры с соблюдением равномерного водоотбора вдоль рассредоточенного водоприемного фронта. Такие водоприемники со стандартными плоскими решетками на входе нашли широкое применение из-за малых скоростей на входе, позволяющих транзитному потоку в водоисточнике уносить различного рода загрязнения за зону питания водозабора. При установке выпуклых решеток цилиндрической или коноидальной формы увеличивается водоприемная площадь до 2 — 2,5 раза по сравнению с плоскими решетками, следовательно и расход забираемой воды. Автором статьи разработана методика гидравлического расчета технологических элементов вихревых камер с возможными типоразмерами цилиндрических и коноидальных решеток различной степени выпуклости, тем самым открывая перспективы применения последних, обладающих рядом преимуществ. Одним из значимых достоинств конструктивных решений вихревых камер с выпуклыми решетками является возможность регулирования забираемого из водоисточника расходом воды в зависимости от требуемого объема водопотребления. В отличие от известных методик размеры элементов вихревых камер на входе и выходе из нее предлагается вычислять во взаимосвязи с параметрами водоисточника. Разработанная методика гидравлического расчета может быть полезна для инженеров, занимающихся проектированием и эксплуатацией водозаборов из поверхностных источников. В частности при реконструкции существующих водоприемников, заменяя съемные плоские решетки на выпуклые в водоисточник, либо при строительстве новых водозаборов с целью обеспечения гарантированного увеличенного расхода воды и эффективности функционирования системы водоснабжения.</jats:p><jats:p>The article discusses the issues of increasing water withdrawal by flooded river-bed water intakes from surface sources for water supply purposes, including for fire-fighting needs. One of the promising technical solutions for water intakes is the design of an elongated vortex chamber ensuring uniform water intake along a dispersed water intake front. Such water intakes with standard flat gratings at the inlet are widely used due to the low inlet velocities, which allow the transit flow in the water source to carry various types of contaminants beyond the water intake feed zone. When installing convex gratings of cylindrical or conoidal shape, the water intake area increases up to 2 - 2.5 times compared to flat gratings, and hence the consumption of water taken. The author of the article has developed a method for hydraulic calculation of technological elements of vortex chambers with possible standard sizes of cylindrical and conoidal gratings of varying degrees of convexity, thereby opening up prospects for the use of the latter, which have a number of advantages. One of the significant advantages of design solutions for vortex chambers with convex gratings is the ability to regulate the water flow taken from a water source depending on the required volume of water consumption. In contrast to known methods, the dimensions of the elements of the vortex chambers at the inlet and outlet of it are proposed to be calculated in conjunction with the parameters of the water source. The developed hydraulic calculation methodology can be useful for engineers involved in the design and operation of water intakes from surface sources. In particular, when reconstructing existing water intakes, replacing removable flat grates with convex ones in the water source, or when constructing new water intakes in order to ensure guaranteed increased water flow and the efficiency of the water supply system.</jats:p>"

The literature is replete with assertions on the importance of sustainability; however, cross-functional research is sporadic. This paper theoretically links Green HRM (GHRM) practices, Green SCM (GSCM) practices, and Triple Bottom Line (TBL) performance within this context. In scaffolding through Resource Orchestration (ROT) and Dynamic Capabilities (DCT) theories, a conceptual framework is proposed. We posit that GSCM transforms GHRM practices into tangible, eco-friendly supply chain activities resulting in enhanced sustainable performance, thereby playing a mediating role. Additionally, a unique interplay of Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) as a moderator between GHRM and GSCM is introduced. Firms with higher levels of EO employ innovative approaches to implement GHRM practices into their supply chain strategies, leading to robust GSCM initiatives. The literature review indicates that research on the synergistic effects of GHRM and GSCM on TBL performance in developing nations is scarce. The study warrants carrying out empirical validation and provides a clear plan for future research.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The food supply chain management sector has undergone significant transformations in recent years, largely driven by technological innovations aimed at enhancing efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. This review delves into the burgeoning realm of technological advancements in accounting within the food supply chain management domain. Technological innovations such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics have revolutionized traditional accounting practices in the food supply chain. Blockchain technology, for instance, has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain by providing an immutable ledger of transactions. This ensures the authenticity of data related to food products, from origin to consumption, thus mitigating risks associated with fraud and food safety incidents. Moreover, the integration of IoT devices enables real-time monitoring of various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and location, thereby ensuring optimal conditions for food transportation and storage. This not only minimizes wastage but also enhances the overall quality and freshness of food products. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms play a pivotal role in optimizing inventory management and demand forecasting processes. By analyzing vast amounts of historical data and current market trends, these technologies facilitate accurate predictions of consumer demand, thereby reducing stockouts and overstocking scenarios. Furthermore, big data analytics enables stakeholders to derive valuable insights from large datasets generated across the supply chain. These insights aid in identifying inefficiencies, optimizing resource allocation, and making data-driven decisions to enhance profitability and sustainability. However, despite the numerous benefits offered by technological innovations in accounting for food supply chain management, challenges such as data security, interoperability, and the need for skilled personnel remain significant hurdles to widespread adoption. Addressing these challenges will be crucial in harnessing the full potential of technology to create a more resilient, transparent, and sustainable food supply chain ecosystem. In conclusion, technological innovations in accounting have emerged as key enablers in revolutionizing the food supply chain management landscape. By leveraging blockchain, IoT, AI, and big data analytics, stakeholders can unlock new opportunities for enhancing efficiency, transparency, and sustainability throughout the food supply chain.\r\nKeywords:  Accounting, Food, Supply Chain, Management, Technology, Innovation, Review.</jats:p>"

The multivariate pressure signals reconstructed from these models are analysed for leakage identification. The leak onset time is estimated using a fast approximation sliding window technique, which computes statistical discrepancies in prediction errors. The performance of all three variants is validated using the widely studied L-Town benchmark network. Furthermore, their feasibility for real-world application is studied by applying them to a real-world case study representing the data availability and network design often found in smaller- and medium-sized utilities in Norway. The results for the benchmark network showed that AE and LSTM-AE showed comparable detection performance for abrupt leaks with VAE performing the least. For incipient leaks, the LSTM-AE showed better detection performance with few false-positives. For the real-world dataset, the performance was significantly lower due to the quantity and quality of data available, and the contradiction of inherent requirements of data-driven models. In addition, the analysis revealed that the positioning of pressure sensors in the network is critical for the leak detection performance of these models.</jats:p>",

This aspect is due to various risks impacting agrifood supply chains. The occurrence of risks is due to hazards: technological failures, technical breakdowns, or adverse weather conditions. Hence, the operational time of the agricultural supply chain during the harvest period increases due to such risk factors. In essence, some hazards are fuzzy, and the nature of most threats is characterized by significant uncertainty. Classical risk assessment methods do not allow assessing simultaneously the impact of various risks, especially those expressed fuzzy (weather conditions). Therefore, the study objective is to design a fuzzy model assessing risk factors that impact the increase in the operating time of the agrifood supply chain during the harvest period. As initial parameters in the indistinct model, three groups of risk factors were accepted: weather conditions, technological failures and technical malfunctions. The MATLAB Fuzzy Toolbox is used to design the fuzzy model, and the model architecture is implemented in Simulink. The modelling results can be used to create the necessary reserves of the harvesting and transport complex to ensure timely harvesting and reduce the negative impact of hazards on the agricultural supply chain operating.</jats:p>",

Power disruptions, particularly affecting critical loads, can lead to substantial economic damages. Historically, conventional UPS systems utilized dual separate converters to function as a rectifier and an inverter, without incorporating any power factor correction (PFC) mechanisms. Such configurations suffered from diminished power density, compromised reliability, and spatial limitations. To address these issues, this research proposes an enhanced UPS design that incorporates APF features into the SPMC. The focus of this investigation is on the efficiency of alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) conversion and the reverse process utilizing this advanced UPS model. The SPMC is selected to supplant the rectifier and inverter units traditionally employed in UPS architectures. A novel integrated switching strategy is formulated to facilitate the operation of the UPS in either rectifier (charging) or inverter (discharging) modes, contingent upon the operational state. The performance and efficacy of the devised circuit design and switching technique are substantiated through simulations conducted in MATLAB/Simulink 2019 and empirical evaluations using a test rig. The findings demonstrate that the voltage generated is sinusoidal and synchronized with the supply current, thereby minimizing the total harmonic distortion (THD) and enhancing both the power factor and the transition efficiency of the UPS system between its charging and discharging states.</jats:p>"

While stationary energy storage has been widely adopted, there is growing interest in vehicle‐mounted mobile energy storage due to its mobility and flexibility. This article proposes an integrated approach that combines stationary and vehicle‐mounted mobile energy storage to optimize power system safety and stability under the conditions of limiting the total investment in both types of energy storages. The principal aim is to minimize the weighted energy not served index in the presence of fault conditions. By strategically allocating energy storage resources and dynamically dispatching stored energy, operators can ensure rapid response and effective power restoration, improving overall reliability in the face of extreme weather events.</jats:p>",

Glide Path is a transmitter that provides distance angle guidance signals or helps the aircraft to land exactly at the landing point. Battery Charging Power Supply is one of the modules in GP equipment which functions as a low voltage DC provider, namely at +5V, +12V, and -12V, and also as a 24 Volt backup battery charger module when receiving AC input. In this research, there were indications of problems with the BCPS Glide Path module. This research aims to analyze the factors that cause equipment problems and enable actions that can be taken to return the backup battery function to normal conditions. The research method applied is a qualitative approach. This method is used to identify factors that trigger problems with Glide Path equipment. The problem that occurred with the Battery Charging Power Supply 1 (one) module which could not work in On Battery mode (supplying a DC source from the backup battery to the equipment) was found to be damage to the IC 74HC02 (U13) and IC 74HC14 (U15) components. The decision taken as an effort to resolve the problem was to take systematic action to replace components on the BCPS that were damaged (short circuit), namely (U13 and U15) with new ones.</jats:p>"

The proposed slew-rate enhancement (SRE) structure introduces a parallel auxiliary current path directly to the gate of the class-AB output stage, significantly accelerating the charging and discharging processes of the Miller capacitor without modifying the operating point of the remaining LA. The current delivered via this supplementary path shows a rapid increase, with changes in input voltage, culminating in diminished quiescent current levels. The supply modulator is fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process. The measurement results show that HETSM is able to track a 100 MHz, 16QAM signal accurately, achieving the maximum efficiency of 87.4% at a 5.12 W output power, with a load that consists of a 5 Ω resistor and a paralleled 100 pF capacitor. The proposed LA realizes a slew rate of −1857/+1239 V/μs and a bandwidth of 226.6 MHz under a 24 mA quiescent current.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Access to reliable water supply is critical for sustainable development and public health, yet many peri-urban and rural communities in the developing world face challenges such as poor maintenance, faulty infrastructure, and inadequate governance of water services, hindering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In Emina-Boadi, a small town in Kumasi, Ghana, residents increasingly rely on boreholes due to substandard service from the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). This shift highlights concerns about water reliability, quality, and affordability, impacting public health and hindering progress toward SDG 6. This case study assesses water service levels using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as quantity, quality, affordability, accessibility, and reliability, focusing on sources like boreholes, hand pumps, piped water, hand-dug wells, rainwater, and surface waters. The study aims to delineate the roles of different water providers, understand community dynamics, and evaluate contributions to rural development and SDG 6 through stakeholder interviews and questionnaires. Leveraging the WASHCost framework, which aims to improve planning methods and provision of water and sanitation services by addressing the lack of cost information in rural and peri-urban areas, and the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) framework, which monitors progress toward global targets related to water, sanitation, and hygiene, the study categorizes indicators and draws connections among them. Findings reveal a significant preference for borehole services, with 87% usage and an 83% reliability rate compared to 13% for GWCL. Daily water consumption averages 60.75 liters per person, with on-premises access improving water collection efficiency to 7 minutes. Dissatisfaction with GWCL services highlights the need for improved delivery aligned with community needs and SDG targets. Adopting sustainable management practices, enhancing infrastructure, and improving governance are crucial for ensuring safe and affordable water access for all residents of Emina-Boadi and similar communities.</jats:p>"

However, the palm oil supply chain faces numerous challenges related to actors, traceability, transparency, and sustainability. To address these issues, a conceptual model for a blockchain-based palm oil supply chain in Indonesia is proposed. The model aims to leverage the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology. It incorporates components such as smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and data sharing mechanisms to enhance traceability, transparency, and sustainability in the palm oil supply chain. The research utilized the SSM (Soft System Methodology) and CATWOE (Customer, Actor, Transformation, Worldview, Owner, Environment) methodologies. The actors involved in the palm oil supply chain include smallholders, plantation companies, third-party suppliers, middlemen, traders, palm oil mills, refineries, distributors, retailers, and consumers. The blockchain conceptual model is structured based on a sustainable supply chain model that considers economic, social, and environmental aspects. Blockchain transactions regulate the process of supply chain actors, while stakeholders such as the government, financial institutions, palm oil research organizations, NGOs, and consumers are involved. The blockchain-based supply chain model is expected to address the key issues of the palm oil supply chain, aiming for a sustainable supply chain system. By implementing this model, it is anticipated that the palm oil industry can achieve greater accountability, transparency, and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>",

Accurately estimating the level of water resource utilization efficiency in experimental areas and impartially assessing the impact of the water rights trading market's operation on water resource utilization efficiency have policy implications for improving water resource governance tools and capabilities. Based on the panel data of 19 provinces (regions) in China from 2010 to 2019, this paper describes the development of a three-stage data envelopment analysis model to measure water use efficiency and the application of the difference-in-differences method based on propensity score matching (PSM-DID) to examine the effect of water rights trading policies on the model. The results indicate that (1) after the introduction of the water rights trading policy, the water use efficiency in the experimental areas improved substantially; (2) the PSM-DID method also confirms this finding, and water rights trading has a positive influence on water use efficiency. The research outcomes of this study can be used to objectively appraise the policy performance of the water rights trading policy and provide a theoretical foundation for its nationwide implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction industry faces numerous challenges in achieving efficient supply chains, particularly in material procurement and logistics. This paper explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing these challenges and enhancing project success. The discussion covers current issues in construction supply chains, the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing material procurement and logistics, and practical strategies for implementation. The paper delves into the fragmented communication, inefficient procurement processes, and limited logistics visibility that hinder construction supply chains. AI's application is examined in real-time data analytics, automation of procurement workflows, and the integration of intelligent logistics management systems. The implementation of AI in material procurement includes demand forecasting, automated vendor selection, and order tracking, while logistics streamlining encompasses real-time tracking, route optimization, and proactive delay management. Benefits of AI implementation are highlighted, including cost reduction through waste minimization and optimized logistics, increased efficiency in procurement processes, and improved project timelines. The paper incorporates case studies illustrating successful AI implementation in construction supply chains, showcasing tangible improvements in material procurement and logistics. Despite the evident benefits, the paper acknowledges challenges and considerations in AI adoption within the construction industry. Barriers to implementation are discussed, along with strategies to overcome resistance and ensure successful integration. By streamlining material procurement and logistics through AI, construction projects can achieve heightened efficiency, reduced costs, and improved collaboration among stakeholders, ultimately contributing to overall project success.</jats:p>"

This study selects Chinese A‐share listed companies from 2012 to 2021 as research samples and empirically tests the impact of supply chain digitalization on corporate environment (E), social responsibility (S), and corporate governance (G) (ESG) performance. We find that supply chain digitalization significantly promotes corporate ESG performance, which is achieved by reducing information asymmetry and easing financing constraints. The positive effect of supply chain digitalization on corporate ESG performance varies significantly among different enterprises, with more prominent effects in mature enterprises, those at both ends of the industrial chain, and those located in regions with lower degree of marketization. Further analysis reveals that supply chain digitalization brings about an innovation effect for enterprises. These findings enrich the research on supply chain digitalization and corporate ESG performance, providing valuable insights for promoting supply‐side structural reforms and corporate sustainable development.</jats:p>",

Principal Component Analysis and Random Effects Regression Analysis are employed to empirically test the impact of four Green Supply Chain Management practices which are: Internal Environmental Management, Green Purchasing, Eco Design, and Customer Cooperation on ROE. A sample of 50 firms in the US and 50 firms in China is employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between Eco Design and ROE in both countries. However, a significant negative relationship between Internal Environmental Management and ROE is concluded in China only. This research contributes to identifying out and classifying the reported practices of the Green Pillar in firms’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reports under their related Green Supply Chain Management practices to provide a theoretical framework and facilitate future research. This paper proposes that policy makers, managers, and practitioners should accept sustainability as a strategic priority prior to implementing Green Supply Chain Management and suggests that firms should be confident of the long-term profitability of implementing Green Supply Chain Management practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Recent global crises have caused unprecedented economic uncertainty and intensified retailers’ concerns over inventory risks. Mitigating inventory risks and incentivizing retailer orders is critical to managing retail supply chains and restoring their norms after severe impacts. We study the allocation of inventory risk using contracts in a retail supply chain with a risk-neutral manufacturer and a risk-averse retailer. We consider two factors that affect the effectiveness of contracting: (1) asymmetric risk aversion information—retailers’ attitudes are typically diverse and unknown to the manufacturer, and (2) uncertain outside opportunity—retailers typically face a volatile external business environment. Methodology/results: With a game-theoretic model that captures the interaction among risk aversion, information asymmetry, and outside opportunity, we derive the contracting equilibrium under two widely adopted risk allocation schemes—push (i.e., the retailer bears the inventory risk) and pull (i.e., the manufacturer bears the inventory risk) contracts. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that pull contracts are more effective in risk mitigation, we show that push contracts may induce larger expected order quantities and achieve the highest supply chain efficiency due to the interaction of asymmetric risk aversion information and risky outside opportunities. We also find that the manufacturer may obtain higher profits with push contracts when both the heterogeneity in the retailer’s risk attitude and the risk of the outside opportunity are sufficiently high. In addition, when the risk of the outside opportunity is in a medium range, the push contract allows the manufacturer to fully eliminate the information rent and achieve the supply chain’s first-best outcomes. We further evaluate the effects of product profitability and demand uncertainty and generalize the retailer’s risk measure to any coherent risk measure. Managerial implications: Our analysis highlights the importance of modeling asymmetric risk aversion information and risky outside opportunities in analyzing supply chain contracting. When considering these practical factors, allocating more inventory risks to a risk-averse retailer may be better than a risk-neutral manufacturer. Our results provide novel insights into the selection of proper contract types for managing inventory risks in retail supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0624 . </jats:p>",

To sidestep this shortcoming, this paper develops an entropy-based method to quantify the vulnerability of SCNs to capacity reduction. This is achieved by measuring the flexibility inherent within the layout of SCNs, both at local and global levels. By performing simulation and sensitivity analyses, this paper predicts the impact of capacity reductions on the performance of SCNs. The results of our study favor the fact that incorporating more backups and increasing the capacity of various entities in the network reduces vulnerability and enhances the robustness of SCNs. The findings of this research may assist operations and supply chain managers in identifying the sensitive areas of SCNs, in turn facilitating the development of an effective risk management strategy to respond to disruptive events.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The objective of this work is to fulfil a strategic requirement in Egypt’s agriculture industry by establishing a fresh produce supply chain network (SCN) that manages the collection, processing, packaging, and distribution of products.Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase approach is proposed. In the first, a network of food aggregation hubs is strategically located across the country for the collection, consolidation, and distribution of products. This is accomplished by modeling and solving a cost minimization dynamic facility location-allocation (FLA) problem using a hybrid binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm. The second phase of the approach is to complement the hub FLA decision with optimal fleet size, transportation schedules, and routing decisions. This is achieved by solving the split-delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP) using a hybrid ant-colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, considering positioning loading constraints, and shelf-lives of products.Findings: There is a strong correlation between the geographical locations and capacities of the established hubs, and the proximity of supply points and the populations in the demand areas. In addition, accounting for spoilage of products has a significant effect on network design, and collection and distribution decisions.Practical implications: Establishment of the intended SCN can reduce the proportion of wasted product during transit, and improve the quality of the delivered product.Social implications: Establishment of the SCN will increase the exposure of small farmers to wider markets, and hence their return and standard of living, and potentially reduce the prices for the final customer.Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to establish an efficient fresh produce supply chain network in Egypt. In addition, the proposed solution approach considered a multitude of problem characteristics, simultaneously for the first time. </jats:p>"

Specific market segments consume agricultural products and have a supply chain structure consisting of individuals based on trust between actors. Most companies in Indonesia have implemented supply chain management, but many have not maximized it, so it runs less effectively and efficiently. The problem in the FR tofu agroindustry is the incompatibility of the delivery schedule of soybean raw materials. This is due to climate change, poor weather conditions, and trade policies between countries that impact imported soybean production, which will hamper the production process in the FR tofu agroindustry. This study analyzes the supply chain flow of tofu products in the FR tofu agroindustry. The research was conducted at the FR tofu agroindustry in Sepande Village, Candi District, Sidoarjo Regency, from February to March 2024. The analytical method used in this research is descriptive qualitative analysis. This study's informants were six: 1 owner of FR tofu agroindustry, two people in tofu production, one soybean supplier, one cooperative employee, and one tofu retailer trader. The results showed that the supply chain flow of tofu products in the FR tofu agroindustry consisted of three flows, namely the flow of product (upstream to downstream), the flow of financial (downstream to upstream), and the flow of information (upstream to downstream and vice versa) The parties involved in the supply chain of tofu products are CV Rahardjo Indobeans, KOPTI \"Karya Mulya\" FR tofu agroindustry, and retail traders. This research suggests that the FR tofu agroindustry needs to build stronger relationships with local and imported soybean suppliers.</jats:p>"

After 11 years of development, the number and quality of cultural auditoriums have greatly improved. However, there are still issues with public participation, content, and the depth of cultural activities. To explore the matching of supply and demand, this study reviewed existing literature, service norms, and other related documents in the service industry. An evaluation system of cultural auditorium service elements was developed, and a matching model of supply and demand was constructed to calculate the degree of matching of supply and demand of cultural auditorium services. The degree of matching of cultural auditorium service supply and demand of villagers with different characteristics was analyzed in detail. This helps to collect and analyze the villagers' demand in a targeted manner and optimize the service content and quality of cultural auditoriums. Optimize the service content and service level of cultural auditoriums.</jats:p>"

It occurs when the flow erodes the sediments surrounding the bridge's piers. This experimental study aims to find an innovative approach for armoring the bed using nano clay to mitigate the erodibility of non-uniform sand beds. Additionally, the study investigates the nano clay-sand bed under various hydraulic conditions, with different pier diameters to determine the optimal nano clay ratio for minimizing local scour around a cylindrical bridge pier. This study indicates that the nano clay could be used effectively to reduce the local scour depth, with an optimum ratio of 0.25% when the flow shallowness is less than 1.4 and an optimum ratio of 0.5% for the flow shallowness between 1.4 and 2. Notably, a significant reduction of up to 68% in local scour depth is observed out of all experiments. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the influence of nano clay on other factors related to local scour depth. It presents a predictive equation that can be used to estimate the depth of local scour in a bed composed of nano clay and non-uniform sand. This equation is derived from the obtained data from this experimental investigation.</jats:p>",

This study used an approximation of the parabolic function of solar radiation change, statistical processing of data on the average annual water flow of small rivers, as well as calculation of the volume of manure produced and its processing into biogas and bio fertilisers to assess their potential in agriculture and environmental impact. Kyrgyzstan, located between 40 and 68° north latitude, has evenly distributed solar radiation, small rivers and biomass, which have significant renewable resources. The distribution of solar radiation on the territory corresponds to the normal law of the monthly average mathematical expectation of 175.79 kWh/(m²*month) and a standard deviation of 92.44 kWh/(m²*month). On average, each square metre of a solar power plant can produce 0.451 kWh of energy. The intervals of average water discharge between the small rivers of Kyrgyzstan follow a power law distribution with a mathematical expectation of 3.112 m³/s and a standard deviation of 2.46 m³/s. With a natural water flow rate of 0.652 m³/s, a low-pressure micro-hydroelectric power plant (with a water head of 1 to 2 m) can generate up to 8.95 kW of power. The total consumption of biogas by an average farm in Kyrgyzstan and its consumption for heating raw materials in a bioreactor during the cold season ranges from 16.34 to 18.93 kg/hour. This demand for biogas is met by producing domestic feedstock (animal manure) using compact biogas plants with reactors of up to 20 m³. These facts indicate that the use of the above-mentioned renewable energy sources in Kyrgyzstan can provide autonomous power supply to remote rural consumers and contribute to solving existing environmental problems, as well as energy-saving</jats:p>",

With data from EU member states for a period of ten years (2011-2020) the panel autoregressive distributed lag technique (ARDL) is used for the aim of this paper. Common determinants such as recycling and environmental taxes were found to be the major contributors to economic growth in the long run. Recycling is found to be a major contributor to environmental sustainability as well, however, environmental taxes are detected to have a negative impact on environmental sustainability in the long run, but none of these determinants have any impact in the short run.</jats:p>",

Using these datasets, we identify a typology of lower-cost and informal tenures and dwelling units, ranging from secondary dwellings and illegally subdivided apartments to shared accommodation and precarious rental agreements. Our study highlights a supplementary supply of rental housing, operating within the conventional private rental market, accessed and made visible via the platforms we examine. Applying a statistical regression approach, we examine relationships between concentrations of informal housing supply and socio-economic variables. The findings reveal intersections between digital platforms and evolving informal market practices and have implications for urban planning and housing policy. </jats:p>",

The potential of 3D food printing (3DFP) aligns with circular economy principles; thus, it can be used to promote the development of a circular economy and contribute to the SDGs. As such, its efficiency should be further investigated, specifically in circular insect supply chains (CISCs), to fill a gap in the current literature. We present a narrative review of the extant research to understand how 3DFP can promote the CISCs and help achieve the SDGs. The findings are clearly articulated based on themes of the SDGs: people, prosperity, planet and partnership. Our results confirm that 3DFP promotes the CISCs and can contribute to achieving the SDGs as follows: people by enhancing food security (SDG 1, 2 and 3), prosperity by promoting economic growth (SDG 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12), planet by reducing environmental impacts (SDG 13) and partnership by fostering interdisciplinary collaborations (SDG 17). These findings offer researchers valuable insights that can shape potential development pathways and future research directions.

Secondly, to examine the impact of consumer characteristics on supply chain agility (SCA). Thirdly, to analyze how electric vehicle characteristics influence supply chain agility. Lastly, to assess the influence of supply chain agility on consumers’ purchasing intentions. The study sampled individuals in Thailand holding personal driver’s licenses and intending to purchase electric cars, totaling 350 respondents selected randomly. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics including frequency, percentage, and mean values. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were ensured through factor loading and Cronbach’s Alpha tests. Our findings indicated that consumer characteristics, electric vehicle features, and supply chain agility significantly affect purchasing intentions. Consumer-specific factors like social influence, environmental concern, and perceptions of electric vehicles were found to impact purchase intentions. Electric vehicle characteristics such as battery longevity, perceived benefits, and value also influenced purchase intentions. Additionally, supply chain agility factors including flexibility, speed in innovation, and responsiveness to customer needs were identified as influential. The research underscores the importance for manufacturers to prioritize initiatives that enhance customer experience with electric vehicles, alleviating concerns and fostering confidence in their use, thereby encouraging adoption without apprehensions about potential issues.</jats:p>"

Based on a literature review, surface mining, comminution, their related sub-stages, and long-haul transportation have carefully been surveyed to elucidate the order of magnitude of the energy demand, the technical challenges posed by each operation, and the potential energy-savings achievable by applying opportune strategies. This work confirms the significant energy-saving opportunities in fine and ultrafine grinding (one of the most energy-consuming activities along the raw material supply chain) as underlined by previous studies, and, in addition, it focuses on limestone and olivine-rich rocks providing new outcomes, it analyses data from a climate change perspective and extends calculations and discussion to transportation. The results show that the implementation of energy-saving strategies (cutting-edge energy efficiency solutions and best practices) to comminute such materials for OL and EW purposes in the near-medium term (2025–2050) would reduce the average electricity demand by 33%–65% in case of low carbon removal target (up to 27 MtC yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and substantial energy efficiency improvement, and by 33%–36% in case of high carbon removal target (up to 69 MtC yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and poor energy efficiency improvement.</jats:p>",

Therefore, predicting future water demand is of great significance. For univariate time series data, the issue of outliers can be solved through data preprocessing. Then, the data input dimension is increased through feature engineering, and finally, the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model is used to predict future water demand. The results demonstrate that cubic polynomial interpolation outperforms the Prophet model and the linear method in the context of missing value interpolation tasks. In terms of predicting water demand, the LightGBM model demonstrates excellent forecasting performance and can effectively predict future water demand trends. The evaluation indicators MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) and NSE (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) on the test dataset are 4.28% and 0.94, respectively. These indicators can provide a scientific basis for short-term prediction of water supply enterprises.</jats:p>",

This model can combine different stages of power supply to conduct more reasonable statistics and analysis of efficiency in different regions. In addition, correlation coefficients were analyzed for the impact of efficiency factors on the phase ratio in the production and sales stages of the power supply system. The research results indicate that there is a positive correlation between the output value and power generation of electricity sales and the efficiency of the electricity sales stage, with correlation coefficients of 0.57 and 0.092, respectively; The length of newly added lines, capacity of new equipment, and line loss rate are all negatively correlated with their efficiency, with correlation coefficients of −0.42, −0.12, and −0.46, respectively.

In this study, twelve IPNS modules of Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) based fertilizers, recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), farmyard manure (FYM), poultry manure (PM), urban compost (UC), maize residue (MR) and Gliricidia loppings (GL) were investigated. Results indicated that plant height, dry biomass, yield parameters (cob length and girth, grains/cob and 1000-grains weight) and yields (grain and stover) of maize significantly (p=0.05) improved with IPNS module (75% NPK +5 t FYM) and increased 31.8 and 23.8% grain yield over the RDF and 100% NPK of STCR, respectively. In chickpea, the higher plant height, dry biomass, pods/ plant and yields (grain and straw) were obtained with the residual fertility of FYM @ 25 t/ha every year and followed by IPNS module (75%NPK +5 t FYM). However, residual fertility of PM and UC based IPNS modules also considerably improved the crop growth and yields of chickpea. Substantially higher system productivity was also noticed with 75% NPK +5 t FYM and followed 75% NPK +1 t PM based IPNS modules which was 1.86 and 0.99 t/ ha higher than RDF. A positive nutrient balance was recorded with addition of higher level FYM only (25 t/ha) Whereas, a negative nutrient balance was noticed for N and K in all plots excluding higher level of organic manures. However, there has been substantial build-up of N, P and K in plots receiving 25 t FYM every year. The additional supply of nutrients (organic + inorganic) is crucial for positive nutrients balance. Thus, STCR based fertilizers (75% NPK) along 25% nutrients through organic manures (FYM and PM) sustained the crop yield while the addition of FYM (25 t/ha) is essential for a positive balance of nutrients in the soil.</jats:p>"

Results reveal that optimized operations using the PSO algorithm consistently outperform conventional strategies by better-managing peak discharges and controlling downstream inundation. The study further differentiates between PSO-optimized plans: PSO1, which focuses on minimizing inundation areas, and PSO2, which prioritizes peak reduction at the flood control point. Interestingly, PSO2 proves superior for single-point peak reduction, typically the primary objective in current practices, whereas PSO1, despite lesser peak reduction, achieves a smaller inundation area, enhancing basin-scale flood resilience. This discrepancy reveals the need to consider downstream inundation risks as critical evaluation metrics in reservoir optimization, a factor often overlooked in existing studies. The research underscores the importance of updating operational frameworks to incorporate 2D inundation risks and adapt to increased flood risks under changing climate conditions. Despite optimization, future climate scenarios predict increased flood exposure, indicating that the current safety discharge rates and flow regulations at control points are outdated and require revision.</jats:p>",

From national‐level production bans and phase‐out policies to divestment campaigns and the creation of “climate clubs,” such as the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), an increasing number of such policies are being adopted by national and state governments, cities and financial actors around the world. This marked shift in climate governance reflects a growing recognition that the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement cannot be achieved without enhanced efforts to leave large swathes of remaining fossil fuel reserves in the ground and actively phase‐out existing fossil fuels infrastructures. Unsurprisingly, there has been increasing scholarly attention to different dimensions of supply‐side policy: from identifying the nature and scale of the “production gap” (between planned fossil fuel production and that which is compatible with climate goals), to initial attempts to map and explain the adoption of supply‐side policies across different regions and sectors, as well as forward‐looking analysis of possible pathways to multilateral supply‐side agreements.

The study reveals unique insights into the complex interplay between pricing tactics, advertising efforts, production dynamics, and the variability brought on by stochastic lead times through meticulous study and modelling. Finally, the total system profit is calculated and optimized with all the decision variables. A classical approach is performed to obtain the optimized solution of the joint profit function along with the decision variables. Two models are discussed in the study: (1) the model with normally distributed lead time demand and (2) the model with distribution-free lead time demand. The joint profit of the supply chain is found to be lesser by 1% for the normally distributed lead time demand than the distribution free pattern. The comparison of the shipment policies and the safety factors for the different distribution patterns of the lead time demand are shown. Though the huge increment in the safety factor for unknown leadtime demand distribution may help in reducing the uncertainity factor and disruptions in the supply chain, but also it may unnecessarily tie up more capital which can be invested in other sectors of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) in manufacturing, it has been found that supply chain operations are difficult to meet personalized customer needs with high precision and quality. Therefore, we adopted a dynamic library strategy, supply chain network optimization model, hybrid algorithm, and the improved BP neural network to solve the above problems. First, this paper designs a corresponding inventory strategy selection mechanism for the various ordering methods of retailers in the manufacturing IoT environment. Based on this, we have constructed a dual objective model for a sustainable supply chain network to minimize total cost and maximize customer satisfaction. Second, we have developed a hybrid improved Grey Wolf and Whale Algorithm (OLDGWOA) that can accurately solve the above model. The hybrid algorithm divides the population into two parts through opposition‐based learning, and then we use the improved grey wolf algorithm and whale algorithm to solve the two populations, and seek the optimal solution in the results, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. Finally, we constructed a supply chain performance evaluation model and feedback mechanism based on the improved BP neural network to adjust inventory strategies and network design at any time. We also validated the developed model and algorithm through numerical examples, and the results showed that: (1) the hybrid algorithm has certain advantages in search and solution speed, (2) the advantages of supply chain network design based on supply chain performance evaluation and feedback mechanisms, and (3) the trade‐off between ordering methods and inventory strategies, as well as the trade‐off between location and inventory strategies.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted in Brondong District, Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The methods used are the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which measure effectiveness and efficiency parameters. Data were collected through interviews and field observations with expert respondents representing fishermen, collectors, and the fish processing industry. The results showed that the supply chain performance of the fishermen, collectors, and fish processing industry was 67.52% (poor), 88.11% (average), and 95.09% (excellent). The low performance was mainly in the fish catch composition accuracy and raw material handling practices. Root cause analysis was conducted to identify the leading causes, such as poor raw material quality, high raw material costs, and low cash-to-cash cycle time. Recommendations for improvement include handling raw materials training, using better cooling technology, and accelerating debt payments. Implementing lean supply chain management with the 5S system will improve operational efficiency and final product quality. Support from all stakeholders and government is essential for successfully implementing this strategy. Further study on the impact of lean implementation on environmental and social sustainability and exploration of new technologies for efficient fish handling and processing is needed.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this paper is to amalgamate production engineering, statistical methods, mathematical modelling, supported with Machine Learning to develop a dynamic e-waste supply chain model. Method Used: This article presents a multidimensional, cost function-based analysis of the EWM framework structured on three modules including environmental, economic, and social uncertainties in material recovery from an e-waste (MREW) plant, including the production–delivery–utilization process. Each module is ranked using Machine Learning (ML) protocols—Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and combined AHP-Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Findings: This model identifies and probabilistically ranks two key sustainability contributors to the EWM supply chain: energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. Additionally, the precise time window of 400–600 days from the start of the operation is identified for policy resurrection. Novelty: Ours is a data-intensive model that is founded on sustainable product designing in line with SDG requirements. The combined AHP-PCA consistently outperformed traditional statistical tools, and is the second novelty. Model ratification using real e-waste plant data is the third novelty. Implications: The Machine Learning framework embeds a powerful probabilistic prediction algorithm based on data-based decision making in future e-waste sustained roadmaps.</jats:p>"

Despite advances in surgical techniques and neurovascular preservation, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence in patients post-radical prostatectomy remains varied. Consequently, it is essential to identify and understand the distribution and pathways of periprostatic neurovascular structures to limit complications following radical prostatectomy. This review provides an overview of the literature investigating the neurovascular supply of the prostate and corpora cavernosa, particularly in relation to erectile dysfunction and urine incontinence. We screened publications listed on the PubMed database, incorporating all articles published in English that investigated humans. A wide range of uncertainty and complexity was revealed concerning the blood supply and innervation of the prostate and corpora cavernosa, with regard to their origin, course, branches, and region of insertion. Given that the preservation of neurovascular structures is beneficial for improving outcomes following radical prostatectomy, the lack of a definitive consensus of their anatomy makes it difficult to propose a simple approach to improve surgical procedures. Our findings suggest that further work exploring this important aspect of clinically relevant human anatomy is required.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer–microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer's ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, that is, the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48‐day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera <jats:italic>Euplotes</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Coleps</jats:italic> under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus, species‐specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting, and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species' resource‐dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species‐specific responses to the different resource supply modes. Overall, our study demonstrates that genus‐ or species‐specific traits other than that related to nutritional mode may override the relevance of acquired phototrophy by heterotrophs in competitive interactions, and that the potential advantage of photosynthetic carbon fixation of symbiont‐bearing mixotrophs in competition with pure heterotrophs may differ greatly among different mixotrophs, playing out under different environmental conditions and depending on the specific requirements of the species. Complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.</jats:p>",

This integrated review explores how SCM and operational practices impact the development and sustainability of affordable housing, highlighting strategies that enhance project efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Supply chain management in affordable housing involves coordinating the flow of materials, information, and services from suppliers to construction sites. Efficient SCM ensures that resources are delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards, which is crucial for maintaining project schedules and controlling costs. Key components of SCM in this sector include procurement, logistics, inventory management, and supplier relationship management. Effective SCM practices help mitigate risks related to delays, cost overruns, and quality issues. Operational efficiency in affordable housing focuses on optimizing construction processes, minimizing waste, and enhancing productivity. This involves adopting best practices in construction management, such as lean construction techniques, modular and prefabricated building methods, and advanced project management tools. Operational efficiency also extends to the management of workforce resources, ensuring that labor is effectively utilized and that productivity is maximized. The review integrates insights from various case studies and industry reports to illustrate how SCM and operational efficiency practices can be applied in affordable housing projects. For instance, the adoption of just-in-time inventory systems and the use of technology for real-time tracking and coordination have proven effective in reducing costs and improving delivery times. Additionally, lean construction methods have demonstrated their potential in enhancing project efficiency and reducing waste. However, challenges remain, including supply chain disruptions, fluctuating material costs, and coordination issues among stakeholders. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach, involving stakeholders such as developers, contractors, suppliers, and policymakers. In conclusion, effective supply chain management and operational efficiency are essential for the successful development of affordable housing. By adopting best practices and leveraging technology, stakeholders can improve project outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the overall efficiency of affordable housing projects. This integrated review underscores the importance of SCM and operational practices in achieving sustainable and cost-effective housing solutions.</jats:p>"

Notably, when comparing the two models (manufacturer Stackelberg and retailer Stackelberg), double marginalization is more pronounced in the retailer Stackelberg setup than in the manufacturer Stackelberg setup. In a traditional supply chain with iso-elastic demand, the follower typically extracts higher profit compared to the leader; however, our results show that, under fairness conditions, the leader achieves higher profit than the follower. Additionally, our study suggests that supply chain coordination is unattainable in a fairness setup.

In particular, biogas has a pivotal role in the generation of electricity and can also be upgraded into biomethane, with a higher and more stable energy content. In this study, the sustainability of the supply chain of electricity from biogas in Italy has been thoroughly analyzed in the broader framework of the ARCADIA (Life Cycle Approach in Public Procurement and Italian LCA Database for Resource Efficiency) project. The environmental assessment, carried out by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), provides a two-fold perspective. Firstly, it allows us to identify the main hotspots of the investigated system, such as the cultivation of dedicated crops, and to provide useful insights for improving environmental performance. Furthermore, a focus on the modeling of the dataset related to the production of electricity from biogas within the Italian electricity mix represents a step ahead in the LCA research, filling the lack of site-specific databases for reliable LCA results.</jats:p>"

This study evaluates the supply chain risk assessment and management and then selects the best supplier in a gas company in Egypt. A comprehensive methodology can use the experts' opinions who use the linguistic variables in the spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs) to evaluate the criteria and suppliers in this study based on their views. Selecting the best supplier is a complex task due to various criteria related to supply chain risk assessment, such as supply risks, environmental risks, financial risks, regularity risks, political risk, ethical risks, and technology risks and their sub-criteria. This study suggested a new combined model with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) under a spherical fuzzy set (SFS) environment to overcome uncertainty and incomplete data in the assessment process. The MCDM methodology has two methods: the Entropy and COmbinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) methods. The SFS-Entropy is used to compute supply chain risk assessment and management criteria weights. The SFS-CODAS method is used to rank the supplier. The main results show that supply risks have the highest importance, followed by financial and environmental risks, and ethical risks have the lowest risk importance. The criteria weights were changed under sensitivity analysis to show the stability and validation of the results obtained from the suggested methodology. The comparative analysis is implemented with other MCDM methods named TOPSIS, VIKOR, MARCOS, COPRAS, WASPAS, and MULTIMOORA methods under the SFS environment. This study can help managers and organizations select the best supplier with the lowest sustainability risks.</jats:p>"

Leveraging a blockchain-based platform, smart contracts play a pivotal role in aligning business logic and tracking progress within supply chain activities. Employing two distinct ledgers, namely Hyperledger and Ethereum, introduces challenges in handling the escalating volume of data and addressing the technical expertise gap related to supply chain management (SCM) tools in blockchain technology. Within the domain of blockchain-based SCM, the growing volume of data activities introduces challenges in the efficient regulation of data flow and the assurance of privacy. To tackle these challenges, a straightforward approach is recommended to manage data growth and thwart unauthorized entries or spam attempts within blockchain ledgers. The proposed technique focuses on validating hashes to ensure blockchain integrity. Emphasizing the authentication of sensitive data on the blockchain to bolster SCM, this approach compels applications to shoulder increased accountability. The suggested technique involves converting all data into textual format, implementing code encryption, and establishing permission-based access control. This strategy aims to address inherent weaknesses in blockchain within SCM. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique in providing security and privacy for various types of data within SCM. Overall, the approach enhances the robustness of blockchain-based SCM, offering a comprehensive solution to navigate evolving challenges in data management and privacy assurance.</jats:p>"

The towers were mathematically modeled, and the influence of three main factors, tower spacing, frequency, and number of transmitting pylons, on the electromagnetism scattered is investigated. Each factor corresponds to three levels of study and nine sets of orthogonal tests were designed to greatly simplify the number of simulations. Three-factor analysis of variance was undertaken on test data and demonstrated that frequency was the main factor affecting electromagnetic scattering, with tower spacing being the next most influential and many towers the least influential. With the main and secondary effects in mind, the combination with the most significant effect of interaction effects on electromagnetic scattering was selected as the five towers with frequency 1400 kHz and tower spacing 200 m. The investigated outcomes lay the foundation and supply instructions for multi-factor analyses of electromagnetic scattering.</jats:p>",

From the individual station on a production line to the global supply chain, everything is connected, making regulation and control a complex task. Biological molecular processes, such as the metabolism of living organisms or the cell cycle, are also extremely complex processes that can be compared to industrial production processes, both of which involve a series of intermediate steps and products. Thanks to (self‐)regulatory mechanisms that have evolved over time, these biological mechanisms are very efficient and robust in the face of perturbations. This article proposes an explanatory representation of these complex processes, considering both biological and technical aspects. The aim is to facilitate biomimetic transfer of biological regulation mechanisms into the technical domain. It presents concepts for biomimetic regulation of production lines and sourcing strategies and introduces a workflow for generating digital twins. This workflow is inspired by the cell cycle checkpoints, which ensure that only perfect copies of DNA are passed on during cell replication. By leveraging this understanding, the production industry can potentially improve its own processes and efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preterm infants are susceptible to neonatal sepsis, a syndrome of pro-inflammatory activity, organ damage and altered metabolism following infection. Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options of reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance.Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.</jats:p>"

The research emphasizes the multifaceted impact of race and racial discrimination on businesses, from strategic adaptation and operational management to financial capital access, real estate, and customer engagement. It notes that these influences arise from both inter-group and intra-group tensions, while also acknowledging that racial solidarity can offer crucial support. Strategies such as concealing racial identity and leveraging customer referrals emerge as key responses to discrimination.

We apply the proposed approach to a case study on Minnesota's ammonia supply chain. We find that accounting for conventional price uncertainty leads to earlier incorporation of in-state renewable production sites in the supply chain network and a reduction in the quantity and cost of conventional ammonia imported over the supply chain transition horizon. These results show that local renewable ammonia production can act as a hedge against the volatility of the conventional ammonia market.</jats:p>"

With the construction of 800kV multi-terminal flexible DC project, the demand for DC circuit breaker with higher voltage level is put forward. The voltage level of valve base power supply transformer as the power supply component of the DC circuit breaker is increased to 800kV. Single-section pendulum structure, single-section 100kV and 50kV schemes used at 535kV cannot meet the demand. An 800kV valve base power supply transformer scheme of four 200kV gas-insulated transformers in series is proposed. Its insulation design is also carried out. Firstly, the topology of hybrid DC circuit breaker power supply system and the structure of power supply transformer were described. Secondly, the design of power supply transformer insulation was carried out. Finally, the power supply transformer insulation was tested and verified. The results show that: SF6 power supply transformer internal insulation withstand voltage needs to be multiplied by the multiplication factor. The electric field strength limit of SF6 obtained by experiments is more than 1.5 times of the empirical design value. The internal field strength design of the 200kV power supply transformer takes into account the operating and seismic conditions, and the maximum electric field strength is 15kV/mm and 16.2kV/mm respectively. The curvature radius of the top shielding ring needs to be larger than that of other layers, after optimization, the maximum field strength is 2.68kV /mm when the curvature radius is 300mm. The internal insulation design of 200kV power supply transformer according to lightning impulse. The simulated and measured values of non-uniform voltage coefficient of 800kV power supply transformer under lightning impulse are 1.048 and 1.0488 respectively, in which the voltage equalizing capacitance is 3000pF. The insulation tests of 200kV and 800kV power supply transformer were all passed, and it can be operated safely. Effectively support the development of UHV DC circuit breaker.</jats:p>",

However, transparent information flows and fickle market circumstances hinder enterprises from actively participating in collaborative innovation, making it challenging to establish effective incentive mechanisms. To achieve sustained and stable collaborative innovation, an evolutionary game model of collaborative innovation between core enterprises and member enterprises in the CSC under DC based on Prospect Theory is constructed. Five equilibrium scenarios and evolutionary stability strategies are analyzed, and the corresponding stability conditions are obtained. Finally, the impact of different parameters on strategy selection are analyzed by numerical simulation. The results indicate that the balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge leakage is the premise of the positive impact of DC technology on collaborative innovation. Moreover, the adjustment of gain sensitivity and loss sensitivity is the key to enhancing managerial enthusiasm for collaborative innovation. Furthermore, the design of income distribution and innovation incentives must adhere to the reciprocity principle, while subsidies from owners demonstrate a prominent positive impact on collaborative innovation. This paper systematically expounds the dynamic influence of DC technology application, knowledge spillover effects, and managerial cognitive structures while confirming the intrinsic effect of innovation incentive mechanisms. It provides substantial theoretical reference and management enlightenment for promoting the development of collaborative innovation in the CSC under DC.</jats:p>"

RPTs often lead to operational diversion due to power disparities between parent and its subsidiaries. In this study, we explore how operational diversion in RPTs within multinational firms is affected by the roles of foreign subsidiaries and corporate governance mechanisms. Methodology/results: Using a unique data set on RPTs of Korean multinational firms from 2006 to 2013, we compare the performance of multinational firms engaging in RPTs with two types of foreign subsidiaries: vertical and horizontal. We conduct our empirical analysis based on the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Korea in 2011, which acts as a policy shock affecting corporate governance and deterring operational diversion. Our results show that the improvement in operational performance of a multinational firm following the IFRS adoption is more significant when the parent firm engages in transactions with vertical subsidiaries compared with horizontal ones. We further show that strong corporate governance mechanisms, such as internal governance, institutional ownership, and large shareholders, play a crucial role in restraining operational diversion in RPTs involving vertical subsidiaries. Managerial implications: The implications of our study extend to shareholders and auditors, highlighting the importance of prioritizing monitoring efforts concerning a parent firm’s RPTs with vertical subsidiaries, especially when corporate governance mechanisms are weak. In contrast, RPTs with horizontal subsidiaries are relatively robust against operational diversion, making them a natural deterrent to such malpractices. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This work was supported by the Institute of Management Research at Seoul National University, the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund [2023], and the Research Fellowship Fund of the Sangnam Institute of Management, Yonsei University [2020-22-0007]. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0372 . </jats:p>",

Using data from the 2018–2019 living standard measurement survey for over 61,000 Nigerians and applying the instrumental variable probit and Tobit techniques, we find that remittances are associated with an occupational switch from agriculture to nonagricultural (paid jobs and nonfarm enterprises) works. Specifically, the results show that remittance recipients are more likely to exit or reduce the hours worked on the farm, regardless of educational attainment and household income status. On the other hand, remittances promote labor supply to paid jobs and nonfarm enterprises, especially among the less educated in Northern Nigeria. In terms of household income, the positive effect of remittances on nonfarm jobs only holds for individuals in the top income quartile, regardless of their region of residence.

However, electrification and power infrastructure can cause mutual challenges. We use nationwide power outage and electric vehicle adoption data in China to provide empirical evidence on how power infrastructure failures can deter electrification. We find that when the number of power outages per district increases by 1 in a given month, the number of new electric vehicles adopted per month decreases by 0.99%. A doubling of power outages in one year on average across the nation can create a depressed adoption rate for up to a decade, implying a decline of more than $ 31.3 million per year in carbon reduction benefits from electric vehicle adoptions. This paper adds to the policy discussion of the costs of increased power outages due to extreme weather and natural disasters, and the urgency for policy to address this issue to facilitate wide adoption of electrification.</jats:p>"

Every summer, a large phytoplankton bloom forms northwest of the Ross Sea, above the Antarctic Australian Ridge (AAR), due to a plume of iron‐rich waters. Here, we investigate the origin and trajectories of these iron‐rich waters by analyzing water mass observations and Lagrangian experiments. Output from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) and in situ measurements reveal that iron‐rich AAR bloom waters share properties with Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW), which forms on the Antarctic shelf‐slope. The Lagrangian experiments are conducted using SOSE velocities. Bloom waters tracked with virtual Lagrangian particles highlight an along isopycnal pathway of MCDW from Antarctica's shelf‐slope to the AAR bloom site, illustrating advection of these waters by the Balleny Gyre. These results are supported by temperature‐salinity analyses, which show a correlation between waters advected northwards; MCDW properties; and high iron concentrations.</jats:p>",

The history of their consumption makes them potential new food sources for incorporation into the wider food supply. The ability to tap the potential of undervalued and underutilized food sources will reduce the world's reliance on a limited number of food sources and improve food security and sustainability. The expansion of the food diversity of the food supply to include underutilized food resources will require overcoming challenges in the efficient and profitable production of the raw material, application of suitable postharvest handling procedures to maintain the quality of perishable produce, and the use of appropriate traditional and emerging food processing technologies for conversion of the raw material into safe, nutritious and consumer‐acceptable foods. Improvement of food processing technologies, particularly resource‐efficient resilient food processes, are required to ensure the safety, quality and functionality of the whole food or extracts, and to develop ingredient formulations containing new foods for manufacture of consumer food products. Factors that help facilitate the social acceptance of new underutilized foods include increasing consumer knowledge and understanding of the contribution of new underutilized food resources to diet diversity for good nutrition, confidence in the safety and value of new foods, and their low environmental impact and importance for future sustainable food. The introduction of new underutilized food resources will increasingly require collaboration along the whole food value chain, including support from government and industry. © 2024 The Author(s). <jats:italic>Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</jats:p>",

The prominent challenges faced by farmers include the pervasiveness of middlemen, insufficient storage infrastructure, substandard transportation between supply chain participants, and inadequate mechanization within the agricultural sector. This research primarily investigates the influence of Third-Party Logistics – including warehousing, distribution, and order fulfillment – on optimizing farmers' rewards, a process moderated by technology adaptation and mediated by supply chain robustness. The principal objective of this study is to explore and scrutinize the impact of logistics and its constituents on the optimization of compensations and additional benefits for farmers, which can be achieved by enhancing the supply chain through technological adaptation. To meet this objective, the researcher adopted a pragmatic philosophical position coupled with a deductive methodology. The research was conducted among farmers in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. A sample of 180 farming households was chosen through a stratified simple random sampling technique that encompassed all Districts within the Province. An explanatory mixed method was employed as the methodological preference for the study, supplemented by a cross-sectional approach under the time horizon. The study's findings revealed that Third-Party Logistics positively impact reward maximization, and further demonstrated the moderating and mediating effects of technology adaptation and supply chain resilience. In conclusion, the paper presents recommended strategies, which include advancements in logistical practices and the implementation of updated technological solutions within agriculture. These recommendations could be adopted by farmers to maximize the monetary and non-monetary benefits.\r\n </jats:p>"

The study combined a literature review and survey data to identify key resilience factors in PBSC. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to explore the relationships between these factors. System dynamics were applied to create a simulation model, assessing the resilience impact level and conducting sensitivity analysis. The results show that the transportation and procurement processes are the most significant factors influencing supply chain resilience. The external environmental factors wielded a more pronounced impact on the overall evaluation of supply chain resilience than the delivery and use processes, but delivery and use processes are more sensitive. The study uses the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model to suggest strategies for enhancing supply chain resilience. This study contributes to more sustainable and efficient construction practices by offering an innovative theoretical framework to analyze the factors influencing PBSC resilience and proposing enhancement strategies.</jats:p>"

The authors examine alternative approaches to reparations for those structural imbalances, from monetary transfers that are more likely to have demand‐side implications to capacity‐building approaches that are more likely to affect supply‐side conditions for the Global South. Targeted supply‐side strategies lean more towards rehabilitation rather than purely compensatory measures aimed at redress for historical injustices and exploitations faced by the Global South. Economic analysis underpins a discussion of these different reparations strategies. The authors argue that a dynamic approach to understanding the impact of reparations is essential. This calls for a broader strategy to be adopted, offering unconditional support in practical areas such as industrial policy, investment in manufacturing, capacity building in research and development, and initiatives for general infrastructure development. More importantly, these policies must be guided by the needs identified by the people of the nations in the Global South. Moreover, for any reparations endeavours to have enduring effects, they must be reinforced by the elimination of current external imbalances that exist within the frameworks of international economic relations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Misreporting is prevalent in supply chain characterized by asymmetric information, and its impact on the supply chain is substantial and cannot be overlooked. In order to explore the impact of fresh supplier’s misreporting decisions on fresh supply chain, this paper takes the fresh supply chain with a single fresh supplier and a single e-commerce enterprise as the research object, and constructs five Stackelberg game models based on the differences of supply chain information transparency and power structure. Particularly, the effect of fresh-keeping level on the after-sales rate and market demand of the product is incorporated into the model, and the following conclusions are drawn by solving and analyzing the decision results of the different models: (1) When the supplier has the decision advantage, it will not choose to misreport. But when it loses the decision advantage, it will produce the misreporting behavior. Supplier misreporting is detrimental to the retailer and the supply chain; specifically, it can lead to lower fresh-keeping level and higher after-sales rates. (2) In the decentralized decision-making model, it is more beneficial for the supply chain that the supplier has the leading right of decision-making. In the absence of misreporting, the leader’s profit is always higher than that of the follower. When there is misreporting, even if the retailer is the dominant player, its profit is still lower than the manufacturer’s. (3) Both supply chain profit and fresh-keeping level are positively correlated with the coefficient of consumer perception of freshness and the coefficient of sensitivity to fresh-keeping technology, and are more significant under the centralized decision-making model. Furthermore, in response to supplier misreporting behavior, this paper achieves coordination in the fresh supply chain by designing a joint contract and confirms the effectiveness of this contract through an arithmetic analysis.</jats:p>"

In particular, when conducting supply elasticity estimation, we use multi‐factor error structures to address cross‐sectional dependence issues, which is ignored by previous studies. We find that the supply elasticity estimates are statistically significant at the state level (0.36), in the regional coastal area (0.97) and in the regional inland area (0.41 but can be inconsistent and inefficient due to cross‐sectional dependence), while perfectly inelastic in the metropolitan area. Effects of supply elasticity on the market responses to bubbles are largely affected by market heterogeneity such as overall supply elasticity levels and demand degrees. The findings may compensate for the limitations of the theory in Glaeser et al. (2008, J Urban Econ, 64:198–217) and offer potential avenues for future development of the theory. Our results implies that bubbles promote development in elastic areas of the metropolitan market and inelastic areas of the regional coastal market, and that balancing urban and regional development is important for dealing with bubble‐related affordability issues.</jats:p>",

To overcome this challenge, this paper takes the application of PV-battery subsystems in a distribution grid supply scenario as an example and conducts an in-depth analysis of the transient stability of PV systems during fault conditions. In cases where system demands are not adequately met, this research proposes a solution based on shared energy storage to enhance system supportability while maintaining economic feasibility. By appropriately allocating and sharing energy storage capacity, the system can better respond to sudden load fluctuations and fault conditions, ensuring a stable power supply. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed shared energy storage solution significantly enhances the transient stability of PV systems during fault conditions, effectively mitigating the destabilizing effects of PV grid integration. Furthermore, from an economic perspective, this solution can reduce energy storage operation and maintenance costs, enhancing overall system sustainability. In conclusion, this study presents a feasible and effective support solution for the application of PV systems in distribution grids, providing valuable insights to advance the reliability and sustainability of clean energy sources.</jats:p>",

This comparative review explores the dynamics of urban farming and its impact on food supply in two diverse contexts: the United States (USA) and African cities. The study investigates the unique challenges and opportunities faced by urban farming initiatives in these regions, considering factors such as infrastructure, socio-economic conditions, and agricultural practices.  In the USA, urban farming has gained momentum as a sustainable solution to enhance local food production and reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance food transportation. The analysis delves into the policies, technological advancements, and community engagement strategies that have contributed to the success of urban farming in American cities. Additionally, the study examines the integration of rooftop gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture in the USA's urban landscape. Conversely, African cities grapple with distinct challenges in implementing and sustaining urban farming practices. The review explores the impact of rapid urbanization, limited resources, and diverse climatic conditions on the feasibility of urban agriculture in African contexts. Strategies such as community empowerment, micro-financing, and knowledge sharing are examined to understand their role in overcoming obstacles and fostering resilient urban farming systems.\r\nKeywords: Urban Farming, Food Supply, Sustainable Agriculture, USA, African Cities, Urbanization, Community Engagement, Agricultural Practices, Food Security, Comparative Analysis.</jats:p>"

On average, every year one third of the total amount of food produced is lost or wasted, which indicates an extremely high level of inefficiency in the food supply chain. One of the key characteristics of food loss and waste is a wide range of ecological, economic and social implications, which is why this problem has become the subject of many national and global agendas. Although there is still no unique definition of the term food loss and waste and unique data collection methodology, many authors have researched this topic so far. Therefore, this paper's aim was to research the existing literature on the phenomenon of food loss and waste, as well as to observe trends of the amount of food loss and waste in the world and the EU. The results indicated that the differences between developed and developing countries have changed, and the amount of food waste in both groups of countries at the household level is now quite uniform. At the level of the EU, the household sector is also the largest generator of food waste.  </jats:p>"

Results revealed a high sedimentation rate in the reservoir, which ranged from 0.14 to 0.37 gcm-2 yr-1, with a mean sedimentation rate of 0.31 cm yr-1. The presence of 137Cs was not observed in the core, while the activity of 241Am was detected in two isolated samples but was insufficient for use as a marker. The constant rate of 210Pb supply (CRS) model dated the oldest sediments (22.5-24.5 cm) to AD 1985 ± 34 years of human influences. Overall, the sedimentation rate in the reservoir experienced a rapid increase from the 1980s to the 2000s and fluctuated to the top of the core indicating continuous anthropogenic impacts on the reservoir. The study identified continuous increases in agricultural activities, expansion in the tourism industry, population growth, and changes in land use, as the main cause of heightened sedimentation and sediment particles delivery into the reservoir. Therefore, urgent measures are needed to address the current siltation state of the reservoir.</jats:p>",

Recent geopolitical disruptions have highlighted the need for strategic foresight and risk management to enhance resilience. This study aims to analyze the multifaceted impact of geopolitical events on the food supply chain and propose strategies for enhancing its resilience and sustainability. A qualitative literature review was conducted, synthesizing findings from 50 peer-reviewed articles. Key findings reveal that geopolitical events such as conflicts, trade disputes, and regulatory changes significantly disrupt food supply chains, leading to food shortages and price volatility. Technological innovations and strategic foresight are critical in mitigating these impacts. Effective risk management, technological advancements, and adaptive governance frameworks are essential for building resilient food supply chains. Policymakers and stakeholders must collaborate to develop robust strategies that ensure food security in an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape.

From the most general considerations, we can expect that such an object can be approximately described by a simpler model, replacing the sum of identical-looking models with different parameters with a single model of this type with averaged parameters, however, finding many parameters simply in the form of an average is, apparently, an unreasonable approach. It seems more reasonable to find the parameters by the approximating model by numerical optimization, in which the integral from the module or from the square of the deviation of the output signal of such a model from the output signal of the exact model is minimized when the test signal is applied.

Carbon emissions from the construction industry are significant, including those generated by facility management during the operation of buildings. This study analysed the lifecycle and supply chain of the materials required for the disinfection process in the CITIC Tower (Beijing) facility management, alcohol disinfectant, through qualitative and quantitative methods. The study also explored possible means of reducing carbon emissions in the production and supply of alcohol disinfectants. This paper will classify the selection criteria for facility managers to choose sustainable products in the context of carbon neutrality. The findings should that in the context of COVID-19, facility management has been extended to include daily disinfection to maintain the health of employees. For large office buildings, facility management requires a large number of materials on a daily basis, and there is scope for reducing carbon emissions through the supply and production of these materials. There is also the specific process of distillation, which requires heat, and the fact that the contribution to carbon emissions varies according to the type of heat used. The use of burnt maize straw would be the best option, which makes maximum use of every growing part of the maize. In summary, the proposed research model and findings of this study are applicable to the calculation of carbon emissions from the supply of facility management materials for all office buildings in China and provide a reference for the calculation of carbon emissions from the wider facility management material supplying process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia triggered a significant energy crisis in the EU27&amp;amp;UK, leading to profound changes in their natural gas supply, transmission, and consumption dynamics. To analyze those pattern shifts, we first update our natural gas supply dataset, EUGasSC, with daily country- and sector-specific supply sources. We then provide a newly constructed daily intra-EU natural gas transmission dataset, EUGasNet, with specified supply sources utilizing the ENTSOG (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas) and EUGasSC data. To further understand the economic and climatic impacts, we finally developed EUGasImpact, a daily dataset with sector-specific driving factors of consumption changes based on change attribution models using multiple open datasets. Those datasets are available on the Zenodo platform: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11175364 (Zhou et al., 2024). On the supply side, Russian gas supply to the EU27&amp;amp;UK was cut by 87.8 % (976.8 TWh per winter) during the post-invasion winters compared to the previous winters. LNG imports become the largest gas supply source, rising from 20.7 % to 37.5 % of the total gas supply. Our intra-EU gas transmission analysis showed the gas transmission network was adjusted to mitigate the large gas shortfalls in Germany and distribute LNG arrivals. Total gas consumption fell by 19.0 %, which was driven by 1) consumer behavioral changes in household heating (contributed to 28.5 % of the total reduction, the same for the following numbers), 2) drops in industrial production (24.5 %), 3) heating drops due to the warmer winter temperatures (10.6 %), 4) shifts towards renewable electricity including wind, solar, and hydro (10.2 %), 5) decline in gas-powered electricity generation (9.4 %), 6) adoptions of energy-efficient heat pumps for industrial gas heating (4.2 %), 7) shifts towards non-renewable electricity including coal, oil, and nuclear (0.8 %), and 8) other unmodeled factors (11.8 %). We evaluated the benefits and costs associated with these pattern changes and discussed whether these changes would potentially lead to long-term structural changes in the EU energy dynamics. Our datasets and these insights can provide valuable perspectives for understanding the consequences of this energy crisis and the challenges to future energy security in the EU.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Plants absorb nutrients and water through their roots and modulate soil biogeochemical cycles. The mechanisms of water and nutrient uptake by plants depend on climatic and edaphic conditions, as well as the plant root system. Soil solution is the medium in which abiotic and biotic processes exchange nutrients, and nutrient concentrations vary with the abundance of reactive minerals and fluid residence times. High-altitude ecosystems of the tropical Andes are interesting for the study of the association between vegetation, soil hydrology, and mineral nutrient availability at the landscape scale for different reasons. First of all, because of low rock-derived nutrient stocks in intensely weathered volcanic soils, biocycling of essential nutrients by plants is expected to be important for plant nutrient acquisition. Second, the ecosystem is characterized by strong spatial patterns in vegetation type and density at the landscape scale and hence is optimal to study soil-water–vegetation interactions. Third, the area is characterized by high carbon stocks but low rates of organic decomposition that might vary with soil hydrology, soil development, and geochemistry, all interconnected with vegetation. The páramo landscape forms a vegetation mosaic of bunch grasses, cushion-forming plants, and forests. In the nutrient-depleted nonallophanic Andosols, the plant rooting depth varies with drainage and soil moisture conditions. Rooting depths were shallower in seasonally waterlogged soils under cushion plants and deeper in well-drained soils under forest and tussock grasses (&gt;100 cm). Vegetation composition is a relevant indicator of rock-derived nutrient availability in soil solutions. The soil solute chemistry revealed patterns in plant-available nutrients that were not mimicking the distribution of total rock-derived nutrients nor the exchangeable nutrient pool but clearly resulted from strong biocycling of cations and removal of nutrients from the soil by plant uptake or deep leaching. Soils under cushion plants showed solute concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na of about 3 times higher than forest and tussock grasses. Differences were even stronger for dissolved Si with solute concentrations that were 16 times higher than forest and 6 times higher than tussock grasses. Amongst the macronutrients derived from lithogenic sources, P was a limiting nutrient with very low solute concentrations (&lt;1 µM) for all three vegetation types. In contrast K showed greater solute concentrations under forest soils with values that were 2 to 3 times higher than under cushion-forming plants or tussock grasses. Our findings have important implications for future management of Andean páramo ecosystems where vegetation type distributions are dynamically changing as a result of warming temperatures and land use change. Such alterations may lead not only to changes in soil hydrology and solute geochemistry but also to complex changes in weathering rates and solute export downstream with effects on nutrient concentrations in Andean rivers and high-mountain lakes.</jats:p>"

The study shows the following: (1) in green product innovation, the formation of the cost-sharing contract is less affected by the intensity of competition in the green market when the market preference for greenness is relatively low. Therefore, government subsidies become an important tool to effectively guide the market mechanism to achieve the desired goal. As market competition intensifies, manufacturers’ incentives to suppliers will shift from reducing costs to increasing demand. (2) In green process innovation, when the intensity of green competition is low and suppliers’ process innovation efficiency is high, manufacturers should bear more costs; when the market preference for greenness is low, the market competition is intense, and the suppliers’ process innovation efficiency is low, the suppliers should bear more costs to help the manufacturers gain more market shares. (3) When retailers’ preference for greenness is relatively low, the government subsidy becomes an important tool to effectively guide the market mechanism to achieve the desired goal. (4) When the retailer’s green promotion performance is higher than the manufacturer’s, the manufacturer should bear more green promotion costs; conversely, the retailer should bear more green promotion costs. (5) Over time, the marginal increase in price over the marginal increase in greenness helps stabilise price volatility, considering consumer preferences. Conversely, it helps to increase the average value of prices.</jats:p>"

This adapter can be used to connect AC or DC power supplies to AC or DC loads. There are adapters available for various household appliances, laptops, and other electronic devices. The need for a universal power supply adapter comes when the electrical power supply needs to be converted in order to meet input the requirements of the load.   This paper focuses on the design and simulation of a universal power supply adapter with the primary aim of powering DC and AC loads using a solar cell to charge a 24V battery as a primary source and the AC line voltage as a secondary source. In order to achieve the desired result, this design requires the universal power supply adapter to have three main design components: a switch-mode power supply, a switch-mode DC to DC regulator, and an inverter.  Photovoltaic panels are used as the primary DC power sources of the system with a battery for energy storage, and the DC to AC inverter to feed AC loads.  This paper focuses of the design, simulation, and analysis of these three components.</jats:p>"

This research aims to bridge this gap by investigating the key factors in supply chains that influence both climate change and modern slavery and how interactions among supply chain stakeholders impact the relationship between them. Utilising the PRISMA literature review method, we systematically reviewed 56 articles to identify the underlying mechanisms and stakeholders' interactions that influence the dynamics between climate change and modern slavery in supply chains. Our findings culminate in a conceptual model that delineates 11 factors bi‐directionally impacting both climate change and modern slavery. These factors include social (migration, violent conflict, and war as well as tradition and culture), environmental (deforestation, soil erosion, disruption of protected area, extreme weather, and resource) and economic (liabilities, employment, education, and pandemic). Furthermore, it highlights how stakeholder interactions at the government, NGO, supplier, focal firm, worker, and consumer levels impact this relationship. Finally, the model underscores the potential of technology adoption, sustainable development strategies, and stakeholder engagement and collaboration as levers to positively influence the relationship between climate change and modern slavery in supply chains.</jats:p>"

Utilizing mandated disclosures regarding major customers from 1978 to 2018, we construct supplier–customer dyads to examine this connection. Our results indicate a positive association between strategic alignment in supply chain partnerships and the stickiness of COGS and SG&amp;A costs for suppliers. This positive association is more pronounced for suppliers in the early stages of their relationships than those with long-term partnerships. Additionally, strategic alignment increases the stickiness of suppliers’ research and development (R&amp;D) costs. Furthermore, we observe that strategic alignment correlates with an extended duration of supplier–customer relationships and improved supplier performance. Our findings hold across alternative constructs of strategic alignment, various supplier strategy types, and when accounting for characteristics of the supply-chain relationship.</jats:p>",

Global supply chains (GSCs), which until this outbreak, had shown a certain level of responsiveness and reliability in responding to disruptions, were subject to a great test of their resilience. Adopting a qualitative research approach and carrying out in‐depth interviews with several different companies, it is shown that COVID‐19 has caused substantial harm to a variety of industries worldwide, compromising all nodes of their supply chain, from raw material assurance to the delivery of finished goods to consumers. Consequently, the disruption propagation was both from upstream and downstream of the value chain. The results also revealed some mitigation measures adopted and the intention to implement future ones to deal with consequences of potential future disruptions. Aiming to investigate if the pandemic crisis was intensifying deglobalization trends, the study also researched the relationship between supply chain disruptions and their impact on global trade. The analysis pointed to a deacceleration of international trade during the first months of the disease, mainly due to the closure of borders, but after this period, global dynamics started to be re‐established, suggesting that there is not an intensification of deglobalization trends. The study is considered relevant to the literature, as it brings more evidence and diversified viewpoints from various interviewees and industries in a recovering phase of COVID‐19 impacts, as well as to GSCs' decision‐makers since it brings about some managerial insights to better navigate through crises.</jats:p>",

The data used in this study includes information about the number of sterilization procedures, the time required for each procedure, and the number of sterilization personnel available. The analysis was carried out using the WISN formula to calculate the ratio of sterilization personnel requirements. The results of the research show that the WISN ratio for the need for sterilization personnel at CSSD PKU Muhammadiyah Gamping Hospital is 0.6, indicating that there is a shortage of sterilization personnel. This indicates that the number of sterilization personnel currently available needs to be increased to handle the existing workload. In order to achieve a state of balance between the number of personnel available and those required, research recommends the addition of 7 sterilization personnel. This addition is expected to increase the efficiency and quality of the sterilization process, as well as reduce the risk of delays and disruptions in health services.

Hydroponics, an innovative and eco-friendly technology, has gained prominence in addressing these challenges. This study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to comprehensively evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of utilizing reclaimed water in a hydroponic system. Results from midpoint, endpoint, and normalized analyses reveal key contributors to the hydroponic system's environmental burden, including water, substrates, fertilizers, and energy sources. Significant impacts have been observed in marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity, as well as photochemical ozone formation. Reclaimed water consistently demonstrates lower environmental impacts compared to conventional water across various indicators, such as climate change (131 kg CO2 eq.), fine particulate matter formation (0.108 kg PM2.5 eq.), and freshwater consumption (0.291 cubic meters). The study emphasizes the potential of hydroponics with reclaimed water to offer sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices. The detailed LCA results provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders, promoting the adoption of hydroponics to address food and water scarcity challenges. From the findings, reclaimed water in hydroponics lowers the environmental impacts as compared to conventional water and PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) along with electricity is the major contributor in environmental burden.</jats:p>",

This research paper explores the critical role of policy interventions in facilitating the diffusion of low‐carbon technologies through intricate supply networks. As countries endeavor to meet environmental goals and transition to a more sustainable economy, it becomes critical to understand how policies can effectively shape the diffusion of these technologies through the supply chain. This study employs game theory and evolutionary game theory to investigate the intricate interactions within supply networks, with a particular focus on the nuanced effects of policy on the diffusion of low‐carbon technology innovations. The findings suggest that dynamically adjusted policies have the potential to significantly increase the uptake of low‐carbon technologies. In particular, an effective subsidy scheme not only promotes the diffusion of innovations, but also demonstrates the ability of government subsidies to be distributed efficiently. In addition, the implementation of dynamic carbon trading schemes is considered to be an important mechanism for promoting firms' decarbonization and stabilizing strategic decision‐making processes within firms. This study highlights the significance of tailored dynamic policy frameworks in promoting the adoption of sustainable technologies in supply chains, thus making a significant contribution to the broader goal of achieving a sustainable future.</jats:p>",

The strategic selection of dry port locations not only enhances the effectiveness of connections between seaports and hinterlands but also supports the sustainable advancement of the logistics industry, given that dry port operations can integrate with more environmentally friendly transportation modes, particularly inland waterway transport. Extensive research has been conducted to identify optimal dry port locations within the framework of inland waterway container terminals. Nevertheless, these studies primarily focus on developed economies, leaving a notable research void in developing countries. This paper aims to propose a methodological framework for selecting the most suitable dry port location, with a particular emphasis on integration with inland waterway transport in developing nations. This study implements a combination of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité III (ELECTRE III) in this domain. An analytical case study of Northern Vietnam, considering five alternative dry ports, is conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Twenty-seven Vietnamese experts, categorized into three groups—policymakers and consultants, dry port investors and operators, and dry port users—participate in the decision-making process, contributing insights to this case study. An aggregated group decision-making approach is employed. Four principal criteria—economic, accessibility, location, and environmental—are utilized to assess and rank the five alternatives. The findings reveal that a reduction in transport cost is the most critical sub-criterion, while environmental considerations and railway accessibility receive the lowest priority.</jats:p>"

Although previous research investigated the selection of eco-friendly suppliers, little research has been conducted on the significance of the wide range of selection criteria used by industrial customers. The aim of this study was to address this gap and examine the difference in the perceived importance of the selection criteria versus the performance achieved using the selection criteria, in addition to the difference in the business performance and the total supply performance. By investigating the selection criteria of manufacturers in the market environment, this study aimed to demonstrate how their business performance was affected by the performance of suppliers in relation to such criteria. To accomplish this task, this study conducted an empirical analysis based on the questionnaire responses of 72 purchasing managers working in the electrical/electronic and heavy chemical industries. Based on previous research, the following six supplier selection factors were identified: eco-friendliness, quality, relationship, flexibility, delivery, and price/finance. By using statistical analyses, including sample t-tests and multiple regression analysis, this study identified a correlation between supplier and manufacturer performance. The findings show that some factors, such as eco-friendliness, flexibility, price, and delivery, were statistically relevant to the performance of manufacturers, which added value to the decision-making strategy employed in supplier selection.</jats:p>"

A descriptive analysis of the infrastructural characteristics, human resources, cost of training, enrollment, and output from the programs over 5 years (2015–2020) was conducted. The growth in the number of registered PAP and trends in workforce density were determined. The 2020 needs deficit was calculated based on the WFSA benchmark, and the projected workforce needs in 2030 were estimated based on the population growth trajectory.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>RESULTS:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>There were 7 accredited university-based anesthesia residency programs in 2020, with median (range) enrollment and graduation rates of 10.5 (2–18) and 5.5 (0–13) residents/country/year, respectively. Enrollment was unstable with some countries having years with no enrollment at all. Only 1 country had new programs planned. There was a median resident to supervisor ratio of 1.44 (0.89–7):1 and 50.3 (21.4–100)% of residency training supervisors had no academic faculty appointment. The median university tuition was $1677 (600–6165)/year. The number of PAP increased in all 4 countries median 5-year growth of 79.3 (22.7–150)%, with minimal impact on the low workforce density, median of 0.23 (0.04–0.35)/100,000 in 2020. The median deficit in PAP in 2020 was an estimated 1410 (589–2499) PAP, with a median need for 1763 (763–2911) new specialists per country by 2030.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The PAP workforce deficits significantly outstripped the annual output of all residency programs. Anesthesia societies need to raise awareness about this deficit and engage policymakers to increase investment in anesthesia training, including providing scholarships and employment of PAP in training institutions. Integrating nonuniversity-based residency programs may support an increased output. The attainability of the 2030 workforce goals will need review. National strategies are needed to increase the total anesthesia workforce, which includes nonphysician anesthesia providers (NPAPs) as part of the task-sharing framework.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Firms utilize working capital management (WCM) to optimize their operating cash to create firm value. This study focuses on how firms could deploy the WCM approach through receivables, inventories, and payables to maximize long-term and short-term firm performance. It is worth noting that the components in WCM serve different roles in firm performance where shareholders value shorter receivable periods to avoid customer default risk, but firms could benefit from long receivable periods for short-term operation performance. In addition, governments from various countries implemented different policies to reduce adverse economic impacts of the pandemic. The sample includes publicly listed manufacturing companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Australia where different levels of government response have been observed. By using Ordinal Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis and adopting government policy as moderator, the results show that the government actions during the pandemic serve as the mitigating effect in the manufacturing supply chain. The analyses also show that the government policies implemented have successfully supported supply chain resilience during pandemic, especially to loss-making firms from decreased firm value. </jats:p>",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 15 patients, ranging in age from 27 to 49 years, who had undergone this surgical technique between March 2018 and July 2022 due to injuries from car accidents or heavy object impacts. These patients experienced various types of soft tissue defects, including those with and without associated bone fractures. During the postoperative follow-up, which averaged 12 months, it was observed that two patients experienced initial complications such as flap swelling and skin discoloration, which were effectively managed with conservative treatments such as pedicle suture removal, manual massage, and limb elevation. By the end of the follow-up period, the majority of cases showed excellent results with good flap appearance and texture, no reported surgical pain, and high patient satisfaction. Furthermore, the functionality of the ankle was significantly improved, with restored range of motion in both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. The results suggest that the retrograde wide pedicle double-blood supply flap is highly effective for reconstructing soft tissue defects in the foot and ankle regions, providing a stable blood supply and good venous return without the necessity for vascular anastomosis. This makes it a valuable option for surgical reconstruction in complex cases where tissue viability and functional recovery are paramount.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the flourishing development of global economy, effective management of production supply chains is crucial for the competitiveness of enterprises. Optimizing supply chain networks can not only improve the efficiency of resource allocation but also enhance market responsiveness and systemic risk resistance. Traditional supply chain network optimization methods, focusing mostly on linear models and static analysis, fall short in addressing the growing complexity and dynamism. The emergence of Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in recent years has offered new opportunities to tackle non-linearity and structural dynamism in supply chain networks. However, existing research still faces methodological limitations in supply chain node relationship mining and benefit assessment. This study introduces an optimization and benefit assessment method for production supply chain networks based on GNNs. Firstly, by developing a node role type-aware graph neural network model, this paper achieves in-depth mining and optimization of node relationships within production supply chain networks. Secondly, a hierarchical factor analysis method is used to comprehensively assess the benefits of the production supply chain. This method can dynamically capture changes in node roles and relationships within the supply chain network, optimize the network structure, and provides a multidimensional, multilevel framework for benefit assessment. This study not only expands the application of GNN in the field of supply chain management but also provides a new analytical tool for the comprehensive assessment of supply chain benefits.</jats:p>"

Bananas and pineapples are two widely grown fruits in Cameroon for income, employment, and foreign earnings. Cameroon remains an important global player in the banana trade. To boost production, identifying important factors that drive the supply response of such crops is an important policy question. Here, we ask if non-price factors are important determinants of supply response of such horticultural crops, a question that has received very little attention. The objective of this study is thus to estimate the effect of non-price factors on the supply response of bananas and pineapples. To do this, a Nerlovian response function is directly estimated via an Error correction model using time series data, to capture long-run dynamics of production and supply. The results show that non-price factors such as rainfall, temperature, and land are the major drivers of the supply response of both crops. The effects of these factors, however, vary with the crops. We provide plausible explanations why non-price factors are salient. Our results suggest that improving the timely availability of weather and climate information, and input subsidies are possible areas for policy interventions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's global economy, managing supply chains sustainably is crucial for businesses wanting to reduce their environmental impact while still making a profit. This article reviews how big data analytics can help achieve these sustainability goals. By using big data, companies can improve their supply chain practices, reduce carbon emissions, and implement more sustainable business strategies. Big data provides detailed insights and better levels of control over various supply chain activities, making it a vital tool for driving sustainability. Big data isn't just about internal operations; it also uncovers supplier practices, letting businesses assess their supply chains' environmental impact. Predictive maintenance, driven by big data, plays a powerful role here. It keeps operations running smooth by monitoring equipment health and foreseeing issues before they cause downtime. This proactive approach not only ensures machinery runs efficiently but also lowers energy consumption and emissions associated with breakdowns. Big data also plays a crucial role in optimizing transportation, where it analyzes traffic flow, weather data, and fuel efficiency to design smarter delivery routes. This approach cuts down on fuel consumption and emissions, making logistics more eco-friendly. Energy efficiency is also a priority; big data tracks energy usage across facilities, uncovering areas where consumption can be reduced. This not only lowers energy bills but also decreases greenhouse gas emissions. Big data goes beyond just making things greener; it also helps businesses save money! Here's how: by using big data to predict exactly how much of a product people will buy, companies can avoid making more than they need. This means less waste and less sitting around in warehouses, which is good for the environment and good for the company's bottom line. In short, big data is a win-win for both the planet and your wallet. Case studies from top industry players like Walmart, Nestlé and Maersk illustrate how big data improves sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) with tangible benefits. Yet, integrating big data has its own challenge: ensuring data accuracy, addressing privacy issues, and recruiting skilled personnel are key hurdles. Looking ahead, trends in SSCM—such as AI, machine learning, blockchain, and IoT advancements—hold promise for enhanced insights and predictive capabilities, shaping the future of sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid economic growth and population development in Indonesia have significantly increased the demand for energy, presenting complex challenges in managing the primary energy supply due to geographical variability and dispersed natural resources. This study addresses these challenges by applying clustering techniques with a hyperparameter approach to explore and map Indonesia's primary energy supply. The research contributes to the field by offering an effective method for analyzing energy data patterns and optimizing energy management. Secondary data on energy production, consumption, and distribution from reliable sources such as the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources were collected and analyzed. Various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Fast K-Means, X-Means, and K-Medoids, were applied to identify energy supply patterns across different regions. The Davies-Bouldin Index was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering algorithms. The results indicate that distance measures such as Euclidean Distance and Chebychev Distance consistently show excellent clustering performance. The study found that the choice of distance measure significantly impacts the clustering quality. The insights gained from this analysis provide valuable information for stakeholders involved in energy planning and policy-making, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of energy management in Indonesia. This research establishes a foundation for further detailed and holistic energy data analysis, supporting better decision-making in energy planning and development.</jats:p>"

Second, measuring true progress is difficult, because counterfactuals are unobserved, and measures of effort vary under policy. Third, relevant policy and broader stakeholder audiences differ in the standards of measurement they recognize. Transparent and broadly accepted, or at least interoperable, standards for assessing effort would help corporations and nations strengthen confidence in corporate claims that RE procurement efforts support international climate goals.</jats:p>",

Additionally, it explores whether the alleviation of financing constraints plays an intermediary effect in this pathway. The findings reveal that: (1) The development of supply chain finance can enhance the innovation capability of SMEs, and its significance level is correlated with the nature of the enterprise's equity; (2) Most SMEs face financing difficulties, and implementing supply chain finance can effectively alleviate these financing constraints. Furthermore, compared to state-owned enterprises, this alleviation effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises; (3) There exists a significant intermediary effect of financing constraints, indicating that supply chain finance can ease financing constraints, thereby facilitating the improvement of enterprise innovation capabilities.

To help the MNF formulate a more resilient offshoring strategy and identify the most desirable offshoring destination, this article aims to identify dynamic risk factors that significantly hinder the efficiency of offshoring and then measure specific offshoring risks over time using two different versions of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models and Malmquist productivity index (MPI). After assessing the degree of risk resiliency of the offshoring host countries over extended periods and then conducting Tobit regression analysis to identify key factors that significantly influence offshoring risks, we found that the host country's logistics efficiency (i.e., logistics performance index [LPI]) and domestic market size were critical indicators of offshoring success in that country. Since low‐cost sourcing countries (LCCs) tend to have relatively low LPIs and smaller domestic market sizes, they are not attractive offshoring destinations. This finding defies conventional wisdom. This article is one of the first longitudinal studies to assess the comprehensive risk resilience of 87 different offshoring destinations (countries) during multiple periods (6‐year span).</jats:p>",

This paper adopts the perspective of international trade, utilizing the random frontier gravity model, and focuses on the top five mineral products and raw materials exported from China to India according to the 2019 export composition table of the Ministry of Commerce of the Peoples Republic of China. Based on export data of these minerals from China to India between 2008 and 2023, this paper analyzes the trends in mineral import and export, studies the correlation between bilateral trade between China and India and changes in Sino-Indian relations, and points out the potential impact of current Sino-Indian relations on Chinas upstream industrial chain. The study finds that for mineral fuels, mineral oils and their products, asphalt, zinc and its products, and steel products, Sino-Indian relations have a relatively minor impact on Chinas imports of such minerals and raw materials from India. However, for steel resources, Sino-Indian relations show a significant positive correlation with their import situation. Based on the current state of Sino-Indian relations, the study will propose relevant recommendations for the production and export of Indian steel and other mineral resources, combined with the needs of Chinas upstream industrial supply chain.

These considerations require the formulation of a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming model, further complicated by the necessity for a two-stage stochastic programming approach. We introduce a hierarchical optimization framework that utilizes a decomposition method to differentiate between one-time design decisions and subsequent operational choices. At the upper level, potential design solutions are identified through the Bayesian Optimization and Hyperband algorithm, which effectively navigates the non-linear challenges posed by economies of scale. The lower level then addresses a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem to independently assess the feasibility of each scenario. Our empirical analysis includes case studies of three potential international routes for transporting green ammonia to Korea. We contrasted our methodology with a hypothetical scenario that presupposes a constant supply of power and a stable demand for energy.

The purpose of this article is to substantiate the choice of a sorbent within the framework of the considered wa-ter treatment technology, as well as to determine the optimal effective dosage of its dosing.

The achievement of these results made it possible to determine the main technological features of the water purification method and determine the possibility of combining it with other purification technologies.

After reviewing the available literature on IoT implementation, 13 barriers were identified. The survey data were cross–validated for quality, and Cronbach’s alpha test was employed to ensure validity. This study applies the interpretative structural modeling technique in the first phase to identify the main barriers. Among these barriers, “regulatory compliance” and “cold chain networks” are the key drivers of IoT adoption strategies. MICMAC’s driving and dependence power element categorization helps evaluate barrier interactions. In the second phase of this study, a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory methodology was employed to identify causal relationships between barriers and evaluate them according to their relative importance. Each cause is a potential drive, and if its efficiency can be enhanced, the system benefits as a whole. The findings provide industry stakeholders, governments, and organizations with significant drivers of IoT adoption to overcome these barriers and optimize the utilization of IoT technology to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the cold supply chain.</jats:p>"

Water samples were taken from various sources of water supply: natural spring water, water from wells, from a well, from the city water supply and from drinking water dispensers. In the samples of artesian water of the \"Roganska\" trade mark (automatic water dispenser), no exceeding of the normative values ​​was determined for any indicator. Water samples from wells and centralized water supply have elevated levels of total hardness, chlorine, nitrate and iron content, which requires the restriction of their use as drinking water without additional treatment. Water samples from private wells have an increased level of general mineralization, salinity and electrical conductivity of water. Methods of purifying tap water from common salts at home were studied: water freezing, filtration, settling, boiling.\n\nConclusions. On the basis of organoleptic, physico-chemical and toxicological parameters of water quality, according to DSTU 4808, water from the machine of TM \"Roganska\" corresponds to the 1st quality class, spring water - 2nd class, water from wells - 3rd class, and water from a well and centralized water supply - 4th class.

LCSCM technologies face several challenges that limit their adoption. Eleven hurdles were selected from the literature and the recommendations of one business expert and one academic expert. These barriers are defined by several factors, including a lack of information, financial worries, environmental concerns, and governmental limits, among others. In addition, efforts are being made to quantify the most optimal relevant barriers using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques such as interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The MICMAC analysis estimates the sensitivity and priority of barriers based on dependency and driving power. One of these barriers is a needed factor; three are driving elements; four barriers are linked factors; and three are self-sufficient factors. The findings of this study can help academic specialists, industry representatives, and practitioners in their ongoing attempts to adopt “LCSCM techniques” in Indian manufacturing industries. The model is appropriately explained and applies the link between the barriers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In view of achieving the decarbonization target, green hydrogen is commonly regarded as the alternative capable of reducing the share of fossil fuels. Despite its wide application as a chemical on industrial scale, hydrogen utilization as an energy vector still suffers from unfavorable economics, mainly due to its high cost of production, storage and transportation. To overcome the last two of these issues, different hydrogen carriers have been proposed. Hydrogen storage and transportation through these carriers involve: 1. the carrier hydrogenation, exploiting green hydrogen produced at the loading terminal, where renewable sources are easily accessible, 2. the storage and transportation of the hydrogenated species and 3. its subsequent dehydrogenation at the unloading terminal, to favour H2 release. Although there is a number of studies in literature on the economic feasibility of hydrogen transport through different H2 vectors, very few of them delve into the technical evaluation of the hydrogen value chain. From the process design point of view, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation stages are of paramount importance, considering that they are the cost drivers of the whole system. This work aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic methodology to technically analyse different hydrogen vectors. For the sake of example, ammonia and dibenzyltoluene are considered. Weaknesses of the overall value chain are pointed out, to understand where to focus research efforts for future process intensification.</jats:p>"

In low-income countries, traceability represents a challenge due to the complicated structure of supply chains and the involvement of multiple stakeholders. This research developed a framework for a digital traceability system (TS), using the Ethiopian coffee supply chain as a case study. A literature review was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of state-of-the-art digital traceability technologies. A logistics audit was conducted to map the coffee supply chain in Ethiopia and evaluate the implementation level of traceability technologies. Although the implementation of traceability technologies in the Ethiopian coffee supply chain is low, the results revealed that the usage of traceability technologies improves downstream of the supply chain. The traceability framework developed in this study ranges from a paper-based TS to a fully digitalised TS. The implementation of a TS in the coffee supply chain of Ethiopia is met with several challenges such as affordability, limited awareness, resistance of certain stakeholders, infrastructure limitations, restricted accessibility of some technologies and insufficient policy frameworks. Stakeholders from low-income countries can use the framework developed in this study to adopt a TS for their supply chains in line with their needs and current digitalisation levels.</jats:p>"

Drawing on quantitative data from 231 supply chain professionals in various industries, the results highlight that subcomponents of SCRM—specifically strategy alignment and technology usage—significantly influence risk information sharing, analysis, and evaluation. Abstract Surprisingly, an SCRM-oriented culture does not significantly affect the exchange of risk information or the amount of risk partnership. At the same time, team support has insignificant effects on risk analysis and assessment. From these insights, it is evident that although having a culture of SCRM in place and some team involvement is beneficial, they could not, altogether, pave the way toward the organizational capability of evaluating and disseminating risk-related information. In its place, the emphasis on aligned SCRM strategy and technological advancement in the supply chain sector becomes a critical factor for risk mitigation. This suggests an absolute imperative for managers: to facilitate a technological-enabled SCRM approach that is collaborative, in line with the strategy, and allows integrated information processing. Fortifying these domains can help minimize weaknesses, increase response, and streamline the supply chain performance; continuous monitoring and improvement of information dissemination processes are essential, as they facilitate better risk management across the supply chain network.\r\n\r\n \r\n</jats:p>"

We adopted bibliometric and text analysis, targeting 170 articles published between 2004 and 2023 from the Scopus database following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. We confirm that AI-integrated technologies have demonstrated the capability to enable SSCM across various sectors. We generated ten future research topics using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method and proposed 20 propositions. The results show that AI-integrated technologies in supply chain processes primarily address sustainability, focusing on environmental and economic issues. However, there is still a technological gap in tackling social issues like working conditions and fair dealing. Thus, we proposed a dynamic framework of AI in SSCM to help researchers and practitioners synthesize AI-integrated technologies in SSCM and optimize their supply chain models in future directions.</jats:p>"

The results show that the tariff imposed by the foreign government leads to higher product prices and lower sales volumes, resulting in welfare losses for foreign consumers. When the domestic retailer makes strategic inputs, the prices of products in the foreign market decrease and the sales volumes increase, which increases the profits of the domestic retailer and manufacturer and improves the welfare of foreign consumers. The equilibrium solutions of the models also show that the manufacturer has an incentive to compensate the retailer for its strategic inputs; when the manufacturer compensates for the retailer’s strategic inputs, the profit of the retailer and the manufacturer will be improved again, and thus, the whole supply chain will achieve Pareto improvement.</jats:p>",

Various challenges are faced by the conventional grid systems in accommodating the charging needs of growing fleet of e-rickshaws; and this problem is faced by most of the states in India. Cases of power theft for charging e-rickshaws have become quite common. And thus, to overcome this problem, charging stations can be made separately for e-rickshaws by using renewable energy sources.

Understanding these interconnected variables is crucial for effective monetary policy formulation and macroeconomic stability. this study employs the Toda-Yamamoto approach to Granger causality testing and quarterly data spanning from 2004 to 2022 to capture the dynamics following the Iraq War and explore the post-conflict economic landscape. Granger causality tests are conducted to determine the direction of causality among the variables. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions provide insights into the magnitude and persistence of shocks, shedding light on the relative importance of each variable in influencing the others. The empirical findings reveal a bidirectional causal relationship between money supply and foreign reserves, indicating that changes in one variable significantly influence the other. Additionally, a unidirectional causality is observed, running from foreign reserves to bank credit, highlighting the significance of foreign exchange reserves in facilitating bank lending. However, no causal link is detected between money supply and bank credit, suggesting that monetary policy may have limited direct impact on credit expansion in Iraq’s banking sector. These results have important policy implications for the Central Bank of Iraq in managing monetary policy tools and navigating the challenges of an oil-dependent economy.

The design solution involves the integration of a steam microturbine behind an evaporator radiator. The microturbine is a tangential supply device and a radially centripetal impeller of low speed nst40. In this area, there is no reliable data on the design and energy of both the supply device and the impeller. The energy (loss of enthalpy) of the supply device mainly determines the transport of the swirling flow to the impeller and, as a result, the circumferential operation on the turbine. A prototype of a radial microturbine has been developed and presented in order to evaluate the design of the flow part of both the supply device and the impeller. As a result of the analysis, the main determining hydrodynamic areas necessary for hydrodynamic analysis and mathematical elaboration of the flow calculation algorithm with an assessment of energy losses are identified: the flow of a swirling flow of a radial-annular slit; axial-annular slit and tangential supply device. The first two algorithms assume computational modeling, the model of energy losses in a tangential supply device is not amenable to analytical modeling because it includes a sequence (or compatibility) of flows under boundary conditions defined as “local resistances”: the sudden expansion, reversal of the flow, together with a section of radially circumferential flow, the mutual influence of these boundary conditions assumes only an expe rimental assessment of energy losses in a tangential supply device through the loss coefficient of local resistance in the range of changes in geometric and operating parameters.\r\nAs a result of experimental studies, a database has been proposed on the loss coefficient of tangential microturbine supply devices in the field of the practical range of the existence of operating and design parameters.</jats:p>"

The present investigation was focused on quality analysis, treatment, and economic feasibility of the River Neora, a raw water source in the fringe area of the Neora-Valley National Park, India. Pearson's correlations showed a positive correlation (0.629) between temperature and total solids (TS), whereas a negative correlation (−0.23) for dissolved oxygen with other parameters. In ANOVA, F-value (&amp;gt;1) was obtained for all parameters except BOD5. The water quality index (WQI) was determined to find out whether the river water meets the drinking water requirements for local inhabitants in the lower fringe. A high coliform count (approximately 4.5/100 mL) downstream further warranted the design of an advanced treatment, the electrochemical oxidation batch reactor. To maintain the water quality grade, the estimation of water benefits was mandatory. The water consumption for domestic and non-domestic purposes was calculated at 5,314,400 and 1,470,000,000 L/yr, respectively. Obtainability and no tax coverage might have led to the overexploitation of water, which paved the way for monetary evaluation (US$695.29). This study provided an overview of the potential of River Neora, which can be restored in the long run by adopting the water development policies by the government.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Revolutionizing procurement processes in LNG operations is essential for ensuring efficient and cost-effective supply chain management. This paper presents a synthesis of agile supply chain management (SCM) principles using credit card facilities to streamline procurement processes in LNG operations. The integration of credit card facilities offers a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional procurement methods, enabling LNG companies to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer demands. The paper begins by discussing the challenges faced by LNG operations in traditional procurement processes, including lengthy approval processes, limited supplier options, and lack of transparency. It then introduces the concept of agile SCM and its principles, highlighting its potential to address these challenges and improve procurement efficiency. The synthesis of agile SCM principles with credit card facilities is explored in detail, focusing on how this approach can transform procurement processes in LNG operations. By utilizing credit card facilities, LNG companies can simplify the procurement process, reduce paperwork, and improve transaction speed. This approach also offers greater flexibility in supplier selection, allowing companies to quickly onboard new suppliers and respond to market changes. The paper also discusses the benefits of this approach, including cost savings, improved supplier relationships, and enhanced operational efficiency. Case studies and examples are provided to illustrate the application of agile SCM using credit card facilities in LNG operations. In conclusion, the synthesis of agile SCM principles with credit card facilities offers a transformative approach to procurement in LNG operations. By adopting this approach, LNG companies can enhance their competitive advantage, improve procurement efficiency, and drive overall operational excellence in the LNG industry.\r\nKeywords:  Revolutionizing, Procurement Processes, LNG Operations, Credit Cards Facilities, Agile Supply Chain Management.</jats:p>"

A hybrid approach utilizing structural equations modelling with partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) technique was employed for data analysis. The findings demonstrated a significantly positive effect of blockchain-driven supply chain analytics on SCI, the LARGS supply chain, and SSCP. Additionally, SCI exhibited a significantly positive impact on the LARGS supply chain and SSCP. Moreover, the LARGS supply chain was shown to have a significantly positive influence on SSCP. Both SCI and the LARGS supply chain played positive and significant mediating roles in the impact of blockchain-driven supply chain analytics on SSCP. Furthermore, the LARGS supply chain also acted as a significant mediator in the effect of SCI on SSCP. Lastly, SCI had a positive and significant mediating role in the impact of blockchain-driven supply chain analytics on the LARGS supply chain. In conclusion, it can be inferred that blockchain-driven supply chain analytics contributes to the enhancement of SSCP through the facilitation of SCI and the promotion of LARGS supply chain principles.</jats:p>"

This makes it difficult to make clear recommendations for the choice of an energy supply concept that takes all stakeholder interests into account. We first identify the relevant stakeholders and define their objectives. In order to relate these with one another, we present a methodology based on energy system simulation and TOPSIS to make energy concepts objectively evaluable. A generic multi-family house with 40 residential units is examined, combining different energy technologies and insulation standards. There is no energy concept that satisfies all stakeholders equally and it is difficult to build coalitions between them.

Then, an improved dual‐population differential evolution algorithm is designed, and the layout of charging stations and the configuration of SC are co‐optimized in the first stage, and then the layout of charging stations is optimized again in the second stage. The simulation results show that co‐optimization can obtain a lower cost of PSS, and furthermore, the layout of charging stations can be optimized again to effectively improve the margin of SC, thereby improving the matching degree between the layout of charging stations and the connection scheme of SC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rural fires have been a constant concern, with most being associated with land abandonment. However, some fires occur due to negligent attitudes towards fire, which is often used to remove agroforestry leftovers. In addition to the fire risk, this burning also represents a waste of the energy present in this residual biomass. Both rural fires and energy waste affect the three dimensions of sustainability. The ideal solution seems to be to use this biomass, avoiding the need for burning and recovering the energy potential. However, this process is strongly affected by logistical costs, making this recovery unfeasible. In this context, this study aims to propose an optimization model for this chain, focusing on the three dimensions of sustainability. The results of the present study comprise a summary of the current state of the art in supply-chain optimization, as well as a disruptive mathematical model to optimize the residual biomass supply chain. To achieve this objective, a literature review was carried out in the first phase, incorporating the specificities of the context under study to arrive at the final model. To conclude, this study provides a review covering several metaheuristics, including ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing, which can be used in this context, adding another valuable input to the final discussion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, reverse logistics has become crucial in supply chain management, driven by sustainability, regulatory compliance, and economic efficiency. This review explores reverse logistics practices, which involve moving goods from their destinations back up the supply chain for value recapture or proper disposal through activities like returns management, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. Effective reverse logistics can yield significant cost savings by reclaiming value from returned products, reducing waste, and optimizing resource use, thereby enhancing operational efficiency, and mitigating environmental impact. Emphasizing environmental benefits, the review illustrates how these practices help companies reduce carbon footprints, lower raw material demand, and divert waste from landfills. Real-world examples highlight successful implementations and positive environmental outcomes. Economically, reverse logistics allows companies to extract substantial value from returned products, cutting production costs and meeting consumer demand for sustainable products. Socially, reverse logistics fosters job creation in recycling, refurbishing, and remanufacturing, promoting economic growth and community development. Despite challenges like logistical complexities and setup costs, the review provides insights into overcoming these hurdles through strategic planning, technological integration, and collaboration with third-party logistics providers. The role of technology, including IoT devices, big data analytics, and blockchain, is emphasized for their potential to streamline operations, improve tracking and transparency, and enhance decision-making. By adopting a comprehensive approach, businesses can achieve significant environmental, economic, and social benefits, contributing to broader sustainability goals and building resilient, future-ready supply chains.</jats:p>"

We propose a decision-making framework that integrates the CCUS supply chain's optimization model, emphasizing carbon tax policies, with a blockchain network. Smart contracts play a pivotal role in automating the exchange and utilization of carbon emissions, enhancing the digitalization of the CCUS supply chain from source to sink. This automation facilitates seamless matching of carbon sources with sinks, efficient transfer of emissions and funds besides record-keeping of transactions. Consequently, it improves the monitoring, reporting, and verification processes within the CCUS framework, thereby simplifying compliance with regulatory mandates for net emission reductions and carbon taxation policies. By eliminating reliance on third-party verifiers, our blockchain-based CCUS system reduces verification costs and ensures reliable tracking of emissions, mitigating the risk of carbon leakage.  Policymakers and stakeholders gain valuable insights to optimize the CCUS network design, specifically considering the impact of carbon tax.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The booming development of e-commerce has promoted the diversified development of logistics distribution services (LDS). For LDS, e-commerce retailers (e-retailers) often choose either the outsourced logistics distribution services strategy (OLDSS) or the self-built logistics distribution services strategy (SBLDSS). Although there are problems such as products getting lost and damaged during the logistics distribution process, the high transparency and traceability characteristics of blockchain technology (BT) can help solve the problem of products being lost and damaged in the logistics distribution process. However, due to the high cost of BT, e-retailers may encounter reduced sales, which causes the supply chain corporate profits to decrease. To encourage the BT investment enthusiasm of the e-retailers and regulate corporate profits, the government implements subsidies for e-retailers’ BT, namely, the government blockchain subsidy (GBS). In addition, in recent years, environmental degradation has become increasingly severe, causing negative impacts on people’s lives. To promote sustainable development, we use variational inequality to establish an e-commerce closed-loop supply chain (E-CLSC) network equilibrium model in which the network equilibrium decisions of e-retailers choosing the OLDSS and those choosing the SBLDSS are obtained. Then, we analyze the impact of the BT input cost and the GBS quota on equilibrium decisions by studying their properties and verifying the theoretical results by performing numerical examples. Finally, we analyze the profits of the e-retailers to obtain the impact of the BT input cost and the GBS quota on e-retailers’ choice of the optimal LDS strategy; in this way, we provide a scientific basis for e-retailers to choose the optimal LDS strategy. The results show that increasing the BT input costs reduces e-retailers’ product sales under the two LDS strategies, which decreases the production rate and the recovery rate of the products. When the BT input cost is low, SBLDSS is the best choice for e-retailers. When the BT input cost is high, OLDSS is the best choice for e-retailers. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between GBS and e-retailers’ product sales; thus, GBS is conducive to expanding market demand, regulating the profits of manufacturers, increasing the e-retailers’ profits, improving the enthusiasm of the e-retailers for BT investment, and promoting the overall development of supply chain enterprises. For e-retailers, choosing the OLDSS can lead to a better development of the E-CLSC.</jats:p>"

A two‐factor experiment of N (0, 50 and 100 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and P (0, 18 and 36 kg P ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) supply was conducted on the Loess Plateau in 2018–2021. Our results indicated that the promoting effect of combination of N and P supply on soil respiration and its components was greater than that of N/P supply alone. N and/or P supply increased the cumulative soil CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efflux in both non‐growing and growing seasons, and the non‐growing season CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efflux accounted for ∼25% of the growing season CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efflux. The increase of cumulative CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> efflux from Ra in response to N and/or P supply was significantly greater than that of Rh in 2018 and 2019, while it shifted to the opposite, that is, a greater increase in Rh than in Ra in 2020 and 2021.

With the impact of global climate change and other environmental factors, concerns about sustainable agriculture and access to sufficient and reliable food are increasing. Reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other international organizations also confirm this. For this reason, awareness has been created all over the world regarding the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).With the increasing awareness of environmental protection worldwide, green supply chain management (GSCM) has become an important issue for businesses to achieve environmental sustainability. Nowadays, many managers and business owners pay special attention to green supplier selection to gain competitive advantage. Therefore, green supplier selection remains a critical decision for businesses. Businesses need to consider many economic and environmental criteria in the decision process to select the most suitable supplier. The aim of this study is to choose the most suitable green supplier for the supply of agricultural pesticides. Decision makers in selecting the most suitable green supplier for agricultural pesticide supply are business managers and academicians who are experts in the relevant field. In this study, an effective solution based on the combination of IMF SWARA (Improved Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and fuzzy WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) methods is proposed to help agricultural enterprises that need to choose the best pesticide supplier. According to the research results, the criteria were determined as cost, quality and green product in order of importance, starting from the most important. In the ranking of the alternatives, alternative 1 ranked first with the highest value. This research proposes a framework to determine the most suitable alternative for green supplier selection through a combined approach of fuzzy multi-criteria decision making involving relevant stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The vulnerability stems from changing weather patterns, leading to extreme weather events that can cause damage to equipment, infrastructure, and mining facilities and disrupt operations. The new demand from governments and international agreements has placed additional pressure on mining industries to update their policies in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to CC. This includes implementing carbon pricing systems, utilizing renewable energy, and focusing on sustainable development. Most mining and exploration industries prioritize reducing mining’s impact on climate change rather than adapting to extreme weather events. Therefore, it is important to study and investigate the impacts of climate change on the mining sector. This paper aims to investigate the challenges and strategies for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change on mining through a systematic literature review. The results indicate that the majority of proposed models and strategies in the mining field are still in the conceptual phase, with fewer practical implementations. It has been identified that there is a requirement for long-term planning, improved risk management plans, and increased awareness and education within the industry. Practical strategies such as integrating renewable energy, enhancing operational safety, and improving water and tailings management have been recognized as crucial for effective climate change adaptation and mitigation.</jats:p>"

In comparison to conventional, Ultra dynamic scaled supply write (UDSS), Negative charge-boosted bit line (NCBBL), and Reconfigurable negative bit line collapsed supply (RNBLCS) write driver circuits, Proposed collapsed supply and boosted bit-line swing (CSBBS) for 9T SRAM cell has optimized write access delays of 0.74X, 0.41X, 0.32X and 0.21X, improvement in write margin (WM) of 1.51X, 1.34X, 1.22X and 1.12X respectively. The CSBBS Write driver circuit is implemented using custom compiler (Synopsys) through a 28 nm BSIM4 model card for bulk CMOS. MC simulation results are monitored on Cosmoscope wave viewer (Synopsys).</jats:p>",

Under this context, three initiatives can be identified: 1) establishing a National Center for Intelligence in Logistics to improve data-driven governance; 2) appointing the “Integrated Transportation Corridor Management Manager” (ITCMM) function to coordinate multiple authorities with different acting in critical freight transport corridors, and 3) creation of a digital tool based on millions of GPS data to monitor freight flows, allowing for collective intelligence among logistics actors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research's limitations are related to using non-standardized databases to gather information on four transportation modes. However, this limitation is also an interesting discovery. Mexico is becoming a strategic logistics hub between North America and Latin America, especially under the “Nearshoring” trend. Unfortunately, the lack of an integrated public policy in logistics and transportation reduces Mexico's capacity to deal with disruptions and its economic competitiveness.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research has identified practices that could be crucial in improving public policies to optimize shipping routes and reduce wait times while minimizing disruptions caused by unforeseen events. A concrete example is the digital platform called “eraclitux,” a computer tool similar to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system companies use. This tool can enable a “Control Tower” that monitors freight flow in transportation corridors under the supervision of “Integrated Transportation Corridor Management Managers.” The tool can make reactive and predictive decisions that help to enhance the logistics value provided by transportation infrastructure.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>The importance of a well-coordinated and integrated public policy for freight transportation was identified to ensure better performance during disruptions.

Our objective seeks to find out the optimum quantity and optimal cost required by the supplier and customer to maximize the supply chain profit. We applied a quantity-based mathematical model with renewal theory and shipment consolidation to obtain the profit function in the supply chain system. Then, we presented a solution to the model to determine the optimal solution in the supply chain. Our results show that the demand rate and the supply chain’s profit are higher, especially for the more retailers demand.

This publication seeks to analyze and discuss the vital role of supply chain risk management in addressing disruptions, becoming resilient and ensuring that healthcare services function effectively. The pandemic (COVID-19) brought to fore just how critical it is to have a robust and agile system for supply chain risk management in healthcare, the sudden and unprecedented surge in demand for essential medical equipment like personal protective equipment (PPE) left millions of people at risk thereby jeopardizing their safety and health. This crisis echoed the urgent need for efficient and effective supply chain risk management strategies to mitigate such risks and ensure the availability of vital medical supplies. This review paper will be sharing different strategies and actionable tips to develop contingency plans, identify, reduce potential disruptions and recommended practices for risk management in the healthcare supply chain. This will highlight key areas such as inventory management and stockpiling, which focuses on maintaining safety stock levels to buffer against sudden disruptions, using advanced analytics to forecast demand and manage inventory levels. It will also examine risk assessment and identification by pinpointing potential attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities within the healthcare supply chain through thorough risk assessments. Additionally, it will cover supplier base diversification, emphasizing the importance of engaging multiple suppliers to reduce dependency on a single source and enhance supply chain resilience by balancing global and local suppliers to mitigate geographic disruption risks. Furthermore, it will explore the integration of technology, leveraging innovative solutions like blockchain for enhanced transparency, security, and traceability of supply chain transactions.</jats:p>"

DC circuit breakers need to support and isolate from high voltage to ground through valve-based equipment and use valve-based power supply transformer to continuously supply energy to high potential components, the electrical performance of these two equipment determines whether DC circuit breakers and DC networks can be operated safely and reliably. For this reason, this paper carries out the research on the insulation capability of the valve base and the performance of the power supply transformer, such as the design and simulation of electric and thermal fields, as well as the test program. Firstly, the insulation design and simulation study of the valve base as a whole is carried out, and the design optimization of the equipotential scheme of the top homogeneous tubular bus, diagonal pull insulator and hydroelectric pole is completed. Secondly, the design and simulation verification of the thermal field distribution of the energy-supply transformer, the overvoltage between the ends of the output windings and the optimization scheme, and the short-circuit impedance were carried out. Finally, the insulation performance of the valve base, the temperature rise of the energy supply transformer, the overvoltage simulation of the output winding and the short-circuit characteristics were tested. The results show that: after optimization, the maximum field strength of the homogenizer is 2.3kV/mm, and the overall maximum field strength of the valve base is 2.61 kV/mm on the diagonal insulator, and there is no pressure difference between the water circuit and the fittings using the three-pin vertically distributed hydropower electrode scheme; the temperature rise of the supply transformer in the simulation and the actual measurement is 27K and less than 30K; by means of the parallel connection of the MOV, the overvoltage of the output winding of the power supply transformer under voltage impulse is effectively reduced to -1.8kV; the measured short-circuit impedance of the power supply transformer is 69.5%. The optimized design of DC circuit breaker valve base and power supply transformer can operate safely, and effectively support the construction of DC circuit breaker and DC power network.</jats:p>",

The security enhancement method referred to in this study is a home security system protection system by anticipating earthquakes. The advantage of this tool is that it applies a notification security system method with a sensitivity sensor which is automatically sent via email and sonor buzzer which also acts as sound vibrations due to an earthquake. The test results show that when a vibration occurs, the system will send a short email message to the user's smartphone so that the user will receive an email in the form of a warning message that the state of the house has an earthquake and the light-emitting diode (LED) interrupts and the buzzer is also on so that the alarm sounds which has been integrated into IoT.

The analysis highlights significant benefits of blockchain adoption, including enhanced trust, transparency, automation, traceability, and data security, supported by findings from various studies. However, implementation challenges such as system design complexity, resistance to change, and inadequate IT staff pose obstacles to adoption. Furthermore, barriers to widespread adoption, such as the absence of a proper legal framework and the capital-intensive nature of blockchain adoption, were identified. These barriers underscore the need for collaborative efforts to address regulatory uncertainties and financial constraints. It was suggested that further studies could explore the long-term impacts of blockchain technology on supply chain resilience and sustainability, as well as investigate strategies to overcome implementation challenges and maximize the technology's potential across diverse industries and regions.</jats:p>"

The extracellular heat shock protein-90alpha (eHsp90α) has been reported as an exosome cargo and a potential driver of wound healing. However, neither the mechanism of secretion nor the genetic evidence for eHsp90α in wound healing has been substantiated. Herein, we show that tissue injury causes massive deposition of eHsp90α in tissues and secretion of eHsp90α by cells. Sequential centrifugations of conditioned medium from relevant cell lines revealed the relative distributions of eHsp90α in microvesicle, exosome and trypsin-sensitive supernatant fractions to be approximately &lt;2%, &lt;4% and &gt;95%, respectively. Establishing the cell-number-to-interstitial-fluid-volume (CIF) ratio for the microenvironment of human tissues as 1 × 109 cells: 1 mL interstitial fluid enabled us to predict the corresponding tissue concentrations of eHsp90α in these fractions as 3.74 μg/mL, 5.61 μg/mL and 178 μg/mL. Remarkably, the 178 μg/mL eHsp90α matches the previously reported 100–300 μg/mL of recombinant eHsp90α whose topical application promotes maximum wound healing in animal models. More importantly, we demonstrate that two parallel secretory autophagy-regulating gene families, the autophagy-regulating (AR) genes and the Golgi reassembly-stacking protein (GRASP) genes work together to mediate the secretion of the physiological concentration of eHsp90α to promote wound healing. Thus, utilization of the CIF ratio-based extrapolation method may enable investigators to rapidly predict biomarker targets from cell-conditioned-medium data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Securing the financial supply chains of the United States against sophisticated cyber threats is crucial in the digital age. This research integrates Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance cybersecurity in financial supply chains. QRNGs leverage quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers, essential for creating secure cryptographic keys, addressing the vulnerabilities of traditional deterministic RNGs. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the QRNG-based system compared to classical RNG systems. The QRNG showed high entropy and unpredictability, passing NIST SP800-22 and Diehard tests with significantly higher rates. The AI component achieved high precision and recall in detecting cyber threats, enhancing the system's real-time security capabilities. The combined QRNG and AI system exhibited faster encryption and decryption speeds, lower latency, and higher resistance to predictive, quantum, and brute-force attacks. This research underscores the critical importance of adopting QRNGs and AI to secure financial supply chains. The integrated system offers robust cryptographic protection and real-time threat detection, providing a comprehensive solution to mitigate cyber threats. These findings highlight the potential of QRNG and AI technologies to revolutionize cybersecurity in the financial sector, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of financial transactions and protecting critical financial infrastructure.</jats:p>"

In the present study, laser light scattering density (LSD) analysis was applied to study the effect of cell size distribution percentages on fruit mechanics, considering three growth stages and added variance by foliar spray application of Ca, N, and Ca-N. The growth rate k considering cell size range 300–450 µm was enhanced in N compared to Ca treatment with 0.8 and 0.5, respectively. Comparison of cell sizes and mechanical fruit tissue properties reveals a strong effect of cell size on fruit mechanics. Based on cell size data, the particles in discrete element models (DEM) were established, applying a simple contact model of Hertz-Mindlin to test the effect of LSD data input, when simulating the compression peak force of strawberry tissue. Comparing measured compression data and DEM simulation, the mean square error was reduced, e.g., for Ca group of over-ripe fruit, from 9.6 to 6.5% when LSD percentages of cell size distribution were considered. Concluding, the newly available cell size distribution data provide valuable information on fruit growth and enable the simulation of fruit tissue compression under varying environmental growth conditions. The enhanced simulation accuracy of LSD-DEM approach makes the approach relevant for plant nutrition, developing robot harvesters, sorting devices, and shelf life assessment of fresh fruit.</jats:p>",

CDF1 mice, implanted in the right rear foot with a 200 mm3 murine C3H mammary carcinoma, were injected with various doses of the most potent VDA drug, combretastatin A-1 phosphate (CA1P), under different schedules. Tumors were also locally irradiated with single-dose, or stereotactic (3 × 5–20 Gy) or conventional (30 × 2 Gy) fractionation schedules. Tumor growth and control were the endpoints used. Untreated tumors had a tumor growth time (TGT5; time to grow to 5 times the original treatment volume) of around 6 days. This increased with increasing drug doses (5–100 mg/kg). However, with single-drug treatments, the maximum TGT5 was only 10 days, yet this increased to 19 days when injecting the drug on a weekly basis or as three treatments in one week. CA1P enhanced radiation response regardless of the schedule or interval between the VDA and radiation. There was a dose-dependent increase in radiation response when the combined with a single, stereotactic, or conventional fractionated irradiation, but these enhancements plateaued at around a drug dose of 25 mg/kg. This pre-clinical study demonstrated how VDAs should be combined with clinically applicable fractionated radiation schedules for the optimal anti-tumor effect, thus suggesting the necessary pre-clinical testing required to ultimately establish VDAs in clinical practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tourism is a worldwide industry that is associated with global risks. Tourists from various countries are susceptible to diseases that are transmitted as a result of ecological, genetic, and human-related causes. Presently, the escalating spread of viruses, epidemics, and pandemics exemplify the adverse repercussions of globalisation, resulting in fatalities and substantial economic downturns due to their detrimental effects on the tourism sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, unique and long-lasting risks made many tourism-related companies very difficult to run; they even risked survival. Because of this, we need a better understanding of the factors that affect or improve supply chain resilience. Addressing the public health sector of tourists is a pressing concern in such a scenario. This study seeks to examine the management of tourism, specifically focusing on the role of top management support, communication, and organisational culture in supply chain resilience. A particular focus is made on the impact of top management support, communication, and organisational culture on supply chain resilience, as well as the impact of supply chain resilience on supply chain performance. A total of 128 pieces of information were collected from various tourism sector organisations to analyse the potential relationship between the variables. Among respondents, there were 35 females and 93 males. SPSS 23 and SmartPLS, both based on structural equation modelling, are used to perform tests on the obtained data. The investigation findings indicate that the support of top management, communication, and organisational culture substantially improves supply chain resilience in the tourism sector. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that a higher level of supply chain resilience positively impacts the overall performance of firms engaged in providing tourism services. Enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain can decrease the health hazards faced by tourists, leading to an overall improvement in public health within the tourism and leisure business.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The synthesis of energy systems necessitates simultaneous optimization of both design and operation across all components within the energy system. In real-world applications, this synthesis poses a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, considering nonlinear behaviours such as investment cost curves and part-load performance. The complexity increases further when seasonal energy storage is involved, as it requires temporal coupling of the full time series. Although numerous solution approaches exist to solve the synthesis problems simplified by linearization, methods for solving a full-scale problem are currently missing. In this work, we introduce a rigorous method, RiNSES4, to manage the nonlinear aspects of energy system synthesis, particularly focusing on long-term time-coupling constraints. RiNSES4 calculates the upper and lower bounds of the initial synthesis problem in two separate branches. The proposed method yields feasible solutions through upper bounds, while evaluating the solution quality via lower bounds. The solution quality is iteratively enhanced by increasing the resolution for calculating upper bounds and tightening the relaxations for computing lower bounds. Both branches work simultaneously and independently, with their outcomes compared after each iteration within each branch. The iterations continue until a predefined optimality gap is reached. We apply RiNSES4 to design a photovoltaic and battery energy system, considering the seasonality of both energy supply and demand sides. In comparison with a state-of-the-art commercial solver, RiNSES4 enables to solve the MINLP synthesis problem with great temporal detail and shows high potential.</jats:p>"

The AcoD process was therefore designed for 20 L batch digesters, under mesophilic conditions, with less than 5% total solids for 66 days. The results showed that EUMs were highly resistant to degradation, while FPs were the most easily degradable. Kinetic analysis indicated specific organic matter reduction rates of 0.28% per day for EUM and 0.76% per day for FP. EUM alone produced 45.47 mL/g MOV, while the 50 :50 substrate produced 1184.60 mL/g MOV. The main factors contributing to EUM inefficiency were the inability to tame acidic conditions, and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. AcoD produced 23 to 50 times more methane than EUM alone, 2 to 5 times more than FP alone and 2 to 4 times more than ino-culum. Consequently, AcoD of both types of waste had a positive effect on gas formation in terms of quantity and quality, with CH4 content increasing from around 2 to 75% as a function of organic nitrogen input</jats:p>"

Empirical data analysis reveals that exceeding a critical price threshold on the platform not only augments the government’s optimal reserve levels but also substantially decreases operational costs. In scenarios where the supply chain is well coordinated, optimal reserve quantities are affected by variables such as the likelihood of disaster events, the success rate of sales, and a supply traceability index.

This study presents a multilayer N flow network model where each network layer represents a stage in the production step from raw agricultural commodities such as corn to final products such as packaged meat. We use this model to assess the impacts of alternative future agricultural production and land use changes on multiple pathways of N pollution within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW). We analyzed N loss via all pathways under multiple future scenarios, considering crop-specific projections based on empirical data and US Department of Agriculture projections. We found two model parameters, fertilizer nitrogen application rate (FNAR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), to be particularly important for seeing measurable N loss reductions in the Bay. Our results indicate a large increase in N loss under the business-as-usual trajectory in geographic locations with intensive agricultural production. We found that numerous management scenarios including improvements in FNAR and FCR, N losses fall short of the 25% total maximum daily load targets. Our work suggests that achieving the CBW N loss reduction goals will necessitate large deviations from business as usual. Our model also highlights substantial regional variations in nitrogen loss across the U.S., with central regions like the Corn Belt and Central Valley of California experiencing the highest losses from crop-related stages, while eastern areas such as the Chesapeake Bay exhibit major losses from live animal production, underscoring the need for region-specific management strategies. Thus, implementation of effective N management strategies, combined with improved crop residue management, remains pivotal in mitigating N pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.</jats:p>",

The efficacy of plasma stripping is influenced by the design of the components of the process chamber, which is critical for advancing semiconductor manufacturing technologies. In this study, we elucidated the influence of the design of a process chamber, particularly the showerhead nozzle angles, on the plasma chemical reactions of radicals emanating from conventional PR equipment using computational fluid dynamics simulations. We assessed the impact of the showerhead design, which incorporated divergent or angled gas supply nozzles, on the distribution of the supply gas across the wafer within the process chamber. Five distinct angles of showerhead nozzles were investigated, and the uniformity of the oxygen mass fractions was optimized for nozzle angles of 45° and 60°. Additionally, the factors contributing to the low uniformity in a showerhead design were identified and design components were modified, resulting in a 16% improvement in uniformity. This study delineated the relationship between the nozzle position, mass fraction, and flow streamlines, thereby establishing the critical role of equipment design for enhancing the plasma stripping process. Furthermore, this principle transcends the realm of stripping equipment design; it is anticipated that incorporating flow dynamics simulations for designing process components will enhance the overall process performance.</jats:p>",

In addition, the mathematical components of these factors were analyzed in order to determine the ways of their neutralization and weakening of the negative impact. It was determined that measures such as the creation of false objects have a significant impact on neutralizing the above factors and increasing the survivability of logistics objects. Reasonable subjective indicators that must be changed to increase survivability.\r\nIn the materials of the article, it is proposed to increase survivability due to the dispersion and mutual distance of logistical support objects, which excludes the possibility of defeating more than one object or its element with one munition, and the necessary mathematical equations are given.\r\nIn addition, the article identifies a discrepancy between the level of development of modern weapons and the level of survivability of logistical facilities. At the same time, in practice, there is a tendency to increase the role of the importance of logistics facilities in ensuring the overall dynamics of the functioning of the troops (forces), which are the primary targets for fire damage by missiles and artillery of the enemy and its subversive reconnaissance groups.\r\nThese shortcomings indicate that in previously performed studies, the influence of the survivability of logistics objects on the effectiveness of logistics support was not sufficiently considered in theory. Therefore, in further research, it is necessary to analyze the existing scientific approaches to assessing the survivability of the logistics support system in the conditions of conducting hostilities in order to determine the ways of their improvement.</jats:p>"

The flyback switching power supply's signal characteristics and fault separability are analyzed. Time domain features and frequency band wavelet packet dispersion entropy features are constructed to form multidimensional feature vectors that fuse time and frequency information, which enhances fault separability. Then, the MIV algorithm is used to screen the features to reduce the redundant information. Additionally, the diagnostic method of the NGO‐SVM model is proposed to optimize the multiclass SVM model by using NGO to improve the diagnosis model generalization performance. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has good diagnostic effect for both single and multiple faults, and the diagnostic accuracy is up to 98.3% under ideal conditions, and up to 96.8% in the presence of noise interference.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The logistics industry is experiencing transformational change driven by the rise of \"smart\" supply chains enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. This study examines the transformational impact of this technology, exploring how it increases productivity, reduces costs, and empowers better decision-making and inventory management throughout the supply chain. Focusing on transportation, warehousing, and demand forecasting, the paper provides a comprehensive view of the benefits and challenges associated with implementing AI and automation in logistics. Real-world examples and case studies illustrate the practical applications of these technologies and their potential to reshape the future of supply chain management. AI algorithms are reshaping inventory management by leveraging big data for precise future predictions, helping companies streamline operations through automated replenishment and reduced stock levels. In transportation, AI optimizes routes considering traffic, weather, and delivery times, leading to fuel savings, faster deliveries, and lower costs. Warehousing benefits from AI with enhanced scheduling, automated processing, and robotic conveyors improving efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, AI-driven demand forecasting integrates sales data, consumer trends, and social media insights to forecast demand accurately, enhancing production planning and customer service. The adoption of \"smart\" supply chains faces several hurdles. Concerns over data privacy due to reliance on big data necessitate stringent data management practices and compliance with privacy laws. Technical barriers and high initial costs for AI implementation are particularly daunting for smaller businesses. Potential solutions, like partnering with AI providers or focusing on long-term benefits, offer strategies to overcome these challenges. Despite these obstacles, AI and automation hold immense potential to revolutionize logistics, offering companies competitive advantages, cost optimization, and superior customer service. As these technologies advance, the future of efficient and agile delivery looks promising.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the supply chain management of electronic products, asymmetric cost information is a prevalent issue that can lead manufacturer to misreport costs, thereby exacerbating supply chain imbalances. This study focuses on the electronic product supply chain with an extended warranty service, where the manufacturer bears the after-sales responsibility during the extended warranty period. It explores the decision-making (DM) issues within the supply chain under different information environments and power structures. The Stackelberg game theory is employed to solve and analyze these models, and the main findings are as follows: (1) When supply chain information is symmetrical, centralized DM is the best choice. However, in cases where the supply chain adopts decentralized DM, it is more beneficial for the retailer and the supply chain if the retailer assumes the role of DM leader. Additionally, when the retail price sensitivity coefficient is low, the manufacturer will compete with the retailer for DM priority. Conversely, when the retail price sensitivity coefficient is higher, the manufacturer is better off as a follower in DM; (2) When the supply chain information is asymmetric, the manufacturer may engage in misreporting, which benefits the manufacturer but is detrimental to both the supply chain and the retailer. Moreover, if the price sensitivity coefficient is low, the manufacturer should lead the supply chain DM. Otherwise, the retailer should take the lead in supply chain DM. Adopting such a flexible strategy will prove advantageous for all parties involved in the supply chain. (3) The strategy of “reducing the retail price and increasing the extended warranty price” is a favorable strategy for the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Panic buying during crises, like the initial hoarding of toilet paper amid COVID-19 restrictions, is mainly driven by social and emotional factors influenced by risk perception and social media content. Similarly, unreasonable drinking water hoarding, i.e., simultaneous withdrawal of water by a large number of customers, can influence the performance of water supply systems (WSS). Decreasing performance (e.g., more friction losses and therefore a smaller outflow rate at faucets) can cause a negative feedback loop that might trigger further water hoarding behaviours. This research explores the socio-technical implications of water hoarding in crisis situations within a WSS. An analysis of an Alpine WSS in Austria reveals that up to 40% of households, with a filling rate of 0.1 L/s (bathtub filling), can hoard without performance drop and negative feedback. Beyond this threshold, impacts become noticeable, leading to inadequate water supply for some households, causing disruptions and negative feedback loops. This emphasizes the need for information campaigns to counter false information, preventing emotional triggers. In conclusion, the research highlights the interplay between technical and social factors in crisis water demand management, stressing the importance of informed interventions to mitigate hoarding behaviour and maintain efficient WSS operation.</jats:p>",

At the heart of these transitions are local food producers operating within shorter food supply chains, their experiences, and their knowledge of ecologically sustainable food production, biodiversity and climate, and their communities. Despite their important contributions to the resilience of food systems, society and ecology, local food producers' experiences and knowledges are often undervalued, ignored, or inaccurately reflected. This systematic literature review identifies the values, motivations, and concerns as key elements of the experiences of local food producers within short food supply chains across literature globally, their contributions to social-ecological resilience, and discusses how these experiences and contributions can influence transitions to sustainable food systems. Eighty-five research articles were distilled from 5 databases and thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) concerns for exploitative operating contexts and hidden labor expectations within short food supple chains, (2) local food producers’ value and need for social networks, (3) their environmental values, connections, and concerns, and (4) how they can value and be motivated by alternative models but are concerned by their economic viability. This review also observed an important paradox within local food producers’ experiences showing that whilst farming is a demanding profession and lifestyle, they can feel a deep fulfilment when they live and work in harmony with their values and motivations. This systematic review is significant for how it values and synthesizes the experiences of local food producers and the diverse personal, social, ecological, and economic contributions that local food production has for social-ecological resilience of communities. By better communicating these experiences and contributions to decision-makers, policy makers and planners, this research can have major implications for enabling societal transitions that are fairer and more just in ways that empower, protect, and privilege local food producers’ voices.</jats:p>",

This research aims to provide solutions using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method to determine the optimal order quantity, Reorder Point (ROP) calculations to determine the reorder time, and Safety Stock (SS) calculations to maintain the availability of chemical supplies. The research method used is a quantitative method with a descriptive approach. Data is processed using POM for Windows (POM QM) software to calculate EOQ, ROP, and SS. The research results show that using the EOQ method, PT. Fajar Surya Wisesa Tbk can determine the optimal order quantity for each type of chemical. For example, the optimal order quantity for Ammonia Nitrogen is 3 boxes with a total annual cost of Rp 150,525,100. The ROP calculation for Sulfate is 2 boxes, while the SS for Water Hardness is determined to be 1 box. The conclusion of this research is that by applying the EOQ, ROP, and SS methods, PT. Fajar Surya Wisesa Tbk can optimize the chemical inventory management in the WWTP laboratory. This method helps minimize total inventory costs and ensures the availability of chemical supplies for smooth operations. The research recommends the company adopt a more integrated inventory management system and utilize information technology for real-time inventory monitoring, thereby increasing operational efficiency and minimizing the risk of operational disruptions due to inventory shortages.</jats:p>"

The modeling is based on three objectives: minimizing the costs of the entire blood supply chain network, minimizing the pandemic virus transmission by donors in each of the blood donation centers, and maximizing the attractiveness of the blood donation centers in order to optimize the blood supply chain conditions and meet the needs of patients in the best possible way. Besides, since uncertainty is an integral part of supply chains, an efficient combination of scenarios, intervals and fuzzy robust optimization approaches is applied. As the results show, using robust approaches to deal with uncertain parameters can provide excellent conditions for efficient responses to those who demand blood products as well as pandemic patients who need the plasma of survivors.</jats:p>"

This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic timescale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN’s disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic timescale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.</jats:p>",

Autonomous energy supply of such objects of the forestry complex can be organized using wood fuel. The aim of the study is to increase the efficiency of autonomous energy supply of timber complex objects by developing and optimizing wood-fired mini-power plants. The method is to numerical modeling. For this, a simulation model of a mini-power plant was developed using the SimInTech dynamic simulation program. We have made the numerical experiments using this mathematical model. The article presents a technological scheme of a mini-power plant based on an open cycle gas turbine, a Rankine organic cycle turbine and wood fuel gasification. The results of numerical simulation of the operation of a mini-power plant with an electric power of 3,8 MW in the SimInTech program using the tools of the Thermal Hydraulics module are presented. The main technological parameters of the power plant in the nominal operation conditions are calculated: pressures, temperatures and mass flow rates of working fluid flows of power plant cycles and heat carriers. We have also calculated the rated mechanical powers of the units: the compressor of the gas turbine plant and the gas turbine, the fan of the organic working fluid condensation system, the Rankine cycle turbine running on R113 freon, and the pump for supplying freon to the evaporator. The proposed model allows you to explore the operating modes of the power plant, with variable environmental parameters, to select the optimal design and operating parameters of the components of the mini-power plant. In particular, the dependence of the net efficiency of the power plant on the consumption of cooling air for the condenser of the organic working fluid was studied. As a result, the optimal values of the cooling air consumption were determined according to the condition of maximizing the net efficiency of the power plant. The obtained results contribute to further technological and constructive improvement of power plants. The results of the study can be used to substantiate the effectiveness and feasibility of projects for autonomous power supply of industrial facilities.</jats:p>",

The results show that the variant structure has better streamlines distribution with double vortex flows in both the inner and outer chambers. Compared to the original configuration, the heat transfer intensity in the outer chamber is improved, and the globally averaged Nusselt number is 17.1% larger. The case with uniformly distributed nozzles has the best flow and heat transfer performance. As the nozzle number increases, the total pressure loss and friction coefficient decrease, but the heat transfer increases first and then decreases. The case of three nozzles has the best comprehensive cooling behavior. The aspect ratio has important influences on the double-vortex cooling configuration. Cases with small aspect ratios have higher local heat transfer intensity, but the flow loss is larger. The case with aspect ratio 4 has the best cooling performance.</jats:p>"

The primary control purpose of EAST FCPS is to quickly output current to track reference current. Change of load inductance parameters due to plasma motion poses higher robustness requirements for fast tracking control of output current. Therefore, an improved gray prediction parameter identification sliding mode control method is proposed to achieve fast tracking and robust control of output current under changes in load inductance parameters. Parameter identification sliding mode control method applied to identify load inductance parameters in real‐time, accurate EAST FCPS output current tracking sliding mode control model is established. High‐order terms are added to discrete exponential convergence reaching law, and a new smooth saturation function is designed to replace traditional sign function to achieve chattering suppression and accelerate system convergence speed. Gray prediction used in current sampling to achieve output current trajectory advanced prediction to further accelerate output current response speed. Four times equal interval time sampling within a fixed switching period and new information priority period by period prediction is proposed to improving gray prediction, achieving digital control delay compensation, and improving prediction accuracy of output current trajectory at abrupt edge. Simulation and experimental verification show that the proposed improved gray prediction parameter identification sliding mode control method has good output current tracking control performance under changes in load parameters. Compared with PI control method currently used in engineering, the proposed control method performs better in output current fast response and overshoot suppression.</jats:p>",

In the supply chain risk management domain, the timely identification of risk events is vital to ensure the success of supply chain operations. One of the important sources of real-time information from across the world is news sources. However, the analysis of large amounts of daily news cannot be done manually by humans. On the other hand, extracting related news depends on the query or the keyword used in the search engine and the news content. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have opened up opportunities to leverage intelligent techniques to automate this analysis. This paper introduces the LUEI framework, a lightweight framework that, with only the event’s name as input, can autonomously learn all the related phrases associated with that event. It then employs these phrases to search for relevant news and presents the search engine results with a label indicating their relevance. Hence, by conducting this analysis, the LUEI framework is able to identify the occurrence of the event in the real world. The framework’s novel contribution lies in its ability to identify those events (termed as the Contributing Events (CEs)) that contribute to the occurrence of a risk event, offering a proactive approach to risk management in supply chains. Pinpointing CEs from vast news data gives supply chain managers actionable insights to mitigate risks before they escalate.</jats:p>",

A field experiment was conducted during 2020-21 at Dharwad, by adopting the Inductive Cum Targeted Yield Model to develop soil test-based fertilizer prescriptions under STCR and STCR-IPNS approach to achieve desired target yields of maize in vertisols of Northern Karnataka, India. Methods: In the experiment’s first phase, an exhaust crop fodder maize was grown in three different fertility strips. After the harvest of fodder maize, the soil fertility levels varied significantly among the strips, indicating the creation of fertility gradients. In the second phase of the experiment, a test crop (hybrid maize) was grown and the response of maize to four levels of N, P and K and three levels of FYM under different fertility gradients was studied. The basic parameters viz, nutrient requirement (NR), contribution of nutrients from soil (Cs), fertilizers (Cf) and FYM (Cfym) were computed using the data from test crop experiment. The basic parameters viz, nutrient requirement (NR), contribution of nutrients from soil (Cs), fertilizers (Cf) and FYM (Cfym) were computed using the data from test crop experiment. Result: Using the basic parameters, fertilizer prescription equations for desired yield targets of maize under NPK fertilizers alone and under STCR-IPNS (with FYM) were derived based on initial soil test values. Results of the validation experiment in kharif 2021 revealed that the grain yield was significantly higher under STCR-IPNS equation with a target yield of 100 q ha-1 as compared to other treatments. STCR-IPNS equation with the application of FYM to achieve 100 q ha-1 target yield resulted in savings of 11, 10 and 15 percent of N, P2O5 and K2O as compared to STCR-NPK alone equation.\n</jats:p>"

The main advantage of this method is that the root mean square current is calculated only once for a series of calculations. This approach significantly reduces the time required for calculations and improves their accuracy, as it eliminates the need for multiple determinations of the root mean square current for each individual calculation. The proposed approach contributes to a better understanding of the influence of various factors on load losses, which allows for more effective planning and management of distribution networks. This is particularly important in the context of increasing loads on electrical networks and higher demands for their reliability and efficiency. In the calculation of electrical energy losses in distribution networks from 6 to 10 kV, methods that use generalized coefficients of electrical circuits and operating modes in the form of regression equations are widely applied. The most significant and independent factors, such as the input of active energy, total line length, number of line sections, total number of transformers, and their total installed capacity, must be taken into account and are included in the calculation equation. Additionally, the components used and their regular maintenance play an important role in electrical energy losses in electrical networks. The main direction of research is the optimization of distribution network parameters, taking into account the latest technologies and materials, as well as the implementation of automated monitoring and control systems that will allow timely detection and elimination of problems associated with electrical energy losses. The proposed method for estimating load losses in distribution networks is a promising direction for the development of the energy sector, which will contribute to improving the efficiency and reliability of electrical networks, as well as reducing the costs of their operation and maintenance.</jats:p>"

Measurements were taken along four (4) traverses at two intervals – firstly when the water supply valve from the overhead storage tank was closed and secondly when it was opened. The Total Field array was adopted for SP measurements with constant station separation of 0.5 m. ER measurements were taken via the Wenner array with electrode spacing (a) varied with an interval of 0.5 m from 0.5 m to 1.5 m. SP data were presented as profiles and maps while ER data were presented as 3-D resistivity depth stacks. SP values varied from -100 mV to 350 mV during the two measurement periods. ER values also varied from 100 ohm.m to 1200 ohm.m during the closed valve period and 100 ohm.m to 900 ohm.m during the opened valve period. During the closed valve period, pipeline routes were interpreted as manifesting oval-shaped high potential anomalies with central linear trend on the SP map; and as linearly-trending high resistivity intrusion within low resistivities on resistivity maps. The disparities between the results of closed valve and opened valve measurements were pointers to leakage-induced inhomogeneity in the subsurface. The diminished high potential SP anomaly and the anomalously low resistivity specks within linearly-trending high resistivity values were regarded as the source of leakage.</jats:p>"

Enterprises need to choose a digital supply chain partner (DSCP) during the process of digital transformation in uncertain and sustainable environments. Thus, the research constructs an innovative decision methodology for selecting the optimal DSCP to achieve digital transformation. The proposed methodology is propounded based upon the entropy measure, generalized Dombi operators, integrated weight-determination model, and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method under spherical fuzzy circumstances. Specifically, a novel entropy measure is proposed for measuring the fuzziness of spherical fuzzy (SF) sets, while generalized Dombi operators are presented for fusing SF information. The related worthwhile properties of these operators are discussed. Further, an integrated criteria weight-determination model is presented by incorporating objective weights obtained from the SF entropy-based method and subjective weights from the SF best worst method. Afterward, an improvement of the COPRAS method is proposed based on the presented generalized Dombi operators with SF information. Lastly, the practicability and validity of the proposed methodology are verified by an empirical study that selects an appropriate DSCP for a new energy vehicle enterprise to finish the goal of digital transformation. The sensitivity and comparative analysis are carried out to illustrate the stability, reliability, and superiority of the propounded methodology from multiple perspectives. The results and conclusions indicate that the propounded method affords a synthetic and systematic uncertain decision-making framework for identifying the optimal DSCP with incomplete weight information.</jats:p>",

The competition between enterprises in today’s changing marketplace has significantly heightened. Therefore, identifying the factors that contribute to an enterprises’ competitiveness has become more essential than it was previously. Methods: We adopted a pre-tested scale drawn from previous related studies and we were able to collect 430 forms from managers and department heads in Saudi Arabian hotels. Results: The study findings of the structural model by PLS-SEM revealed that environmental and economic GSCM had a considerable beneficial influence on hotel competitiveness. However, the social aspect of GSCM failed to have an extensive effect on hotel competitiveness. All three dimensions of GSCM have a substantial indirect influence on hotel competitiveness via EP. Conclusion: The study developed a complete model that integrates the elements of GSCM with EP and hotel competitiveness. The study presents numerous implications for hoteliers and academics.</jats:p>"

To manage the growth of battery-based electric vehicles (BEVs) in Indonesia and mitigate their impact on the power grid’s supply–demand equilibrium, regulatory adjustments and subsidies can be implemented by the government. The Jawa-Madura-Bali (Jamali) electrical system, as the largest in Indonesia, is challenged with accommodating the rising number of vehicles. Following an analysis of Jamali’s electricity supply using data from the National Electricity Company (RUPTL), simulations are constructed to model the grid’s demand side. Input variables such as Jamali’s population, the numbers of internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles, initial charging times (ICT), slow and fast charging ratios, and BEV charge load curves are simulated. Scenario variables, including supply capacity growth rate, vehicle population growth rate, subsidy impact on EV attractiveness, ICT, and fast charging ratio, are subsequently simulated for the 2024–2029 period. Four key simulation outcomes are identified. The best-case scenario (scenario 1776) achieves the highest EV growth with minimal grid disruption, resulting in a 45.38% EV percentage in 2029 and requiring an annual allocation of 492 billion rupiah to match supply with demand. The worst-case scenario leads to a 23.12% EV percentage, necessitating 47,566 billion rupiah for EV subsidies in 2029. Additionally, the most and least probable scenarios based on the literature research are evaluated. This novel simulation and its results provide insights into EV growth’s impact on the grid’s balance in one presidential term from 2024 to 2029, aiding the government in planning regulations and subsidies effectively.</jats:p>"

Analyzing 9 years of personnel records from a multiunit European bank, we find that the gender promotion gap is influenced by both supply‐side and demand‐side factors. Specifically, women are less likely than men to express a motivation to change to a new job or move to a different unit within the bank. Those who do express such motivation are as likely as men to be reassigned to new roles, but their moves are less likely to constitute promotions than are men's moves. Furthermore, gender promotion gaps vary significantly within the organization itself. Business units with the most significant gaps are in regions that have fewer available organizational positions to move into, diminishing women's motivation to seek such moves, and have jobs with numerous incumbents, decreasing women's chances to get a new job or secure a promotion upon doing so. This study extends gender role theory by creating a unified theoretical model that incorporates both employee and employer gender role perceptions as drivers of promotions. It contributes to gender queuing theory by demonstrating the theory's relevance to promotion outcomes.</jats:p>",

However, there are default risks if the retailer can not repay the loans. Using conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to describe risk aversion of the retailer, optimal order quantities of the retailer and optimal wholesale prices of the manufacturer are obtained by solving a Stackelberg game model, where the manufacturer is a leader and the retailer is a follower, respectively. Our numerical results show that the default probability of the retailer are proportional to optimal wholesale prices of the manufacturer. It implies that when the default probability of the retailer is high, the manufacturer should reduce the default risk by setting higher wholesale prices to avoid a burden of a substantial guarantee. Thus, our results can serve as insights for decision-makers of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Establishing and calibrating the hydraulic model is time-consuming and requires many engineering parameters, which are usually uncertain. This paper proposes a metamodel based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace the computationally costly hydraulic model. The metamodel is designed to bypass the modeling and calibration processes of the hydraulic model and directly estimate the target state of valves and pumps to realize real-time water distribution. The proposed approach uses the water levels of reservoirs and the flow demands of water plants as input data to the ANN. The metamodel's output prescribes the opening of regulating valves and the speed of pumps. A realistic case study is presented to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach. The results show that ANN is feasible as a state predictor to realize real-time water distribution in practical water supply projects.</jats:p>",

On the basis of Stackelberg game model, a mathematical model for coordinating the supply side of tourism in ethnic areas is designed, and the optimal benefit curve of tourism supply side reform is obtained from the benefits of tourism places, travel agencies, and the overall benefits of the supply side in ethnic areas respectively. Aiming at the development level of tourism on the role of common wealth, the research framework is constructed from the perspective of development, commonality, sharing and sustainability. Relevant variables are selected to evaluate the development level of tourism, in terms of absolute income and relative income. The entropy method was used to measure the level of tourism development and shared prosperity. Associated bivariate spatial autocorrelation as well as spatial panel Durbin model were used to analyze the spatial econometrics of the ethnic areas in the subject provinces. The results show that tourism talent resources have an impact on the earnings of all parties on the supply side of tourism, with the greatest impact on the earnings of the supply side as a whole, which rapidly increases from 20,000 yuan to a value of 65,000 yuan in the range of 0.2 to 0.9. In the global spatial autocorrelation analysis, the Moran coefficients of the five explanatory variables of common wealth are distributed between 0.1256 and 0.9456, and the Z value is greater than 1.58, and the P value is less than or equal to 0.05, which is significant.</jats:p>",

To determine the safe pumping rate, 39 borehole data points were gathered and adjusted for 4, 8, and 12 h of pumping scenarios for 50 years in a steady-state pumping condition. The recharge rates in the study area were calculated using four empirical approaches in addition to the water balance method. Of the four empirical methods, the water balance technique provided the most accurate estimates of groundwater recharge, with an estimated average recharge rate of 176.75 mm per year. The ModelMuse model water balance report demonstrated that there was positive storage for all boreholes to be pumped simultaneously under 4- and 8-h pumping rate scenarios, but that there would be a significant drawdown under 12-h pumping from the stress period of 2039–2065, and the summation of inflow and outflow would become negative, indicating that the withdrawal rate is greater than the recharge rate. Thus, the safe pumping rate for Borkena groundwater was calculated to be 975 L/s in 8-h pumping rate scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The low‐carbon energy transition requires significant increases in production for many mineral commodities. Understanding demand, technological requirements, and prices associated with this production increase requires understanding the supply chain dynamics of many minerals simultaneously, and via a consistent framework. A generalized economics‐informed material flow method, global materials modeling using Bayesian optimization, captures the market dynamics of key mineral commodities. The method relies only on a limited set of widely available historical data as input, enabling quantification of economic relationships (elasticities) for supply chain components where data are sparse, and relationships cannot be obtained via traditional statistical approaches. Building upon established material flow analysis (MFA) and economic modeling techniques, Bayesian optimization was applied to fit an economics‐informed MFA model to global historical demand, supply, and price for aluminum, copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, iron, tin, and zinc. This approach enables estimates for the evolution of ore grades, mine costs, refining charges, sector‐specific demand, and scrap collection for each commodity. Economic relationships were quantified and compared with a database compiled from the literature, including 1333 values from 213 analyses across 65 publications. Discrepancies in methods and limited coverage make use of these parameters in modeling efforts difficult. This work provides a single, homogeneous, probabilistic approach to identifying economic relationships across mineral supply chains, with uncertainty quantification, a literature database for comparison, and a modeling framework in which to use them.

This paper constructs an efficient power supply mode based on closed‐loop dynamic power supply system (CLDPSs). The CLDPSs can generate a pair of bipolar dynamic power supplies based on a predetermined signal to provide power to LPA, which can maintain a small voltage drop between the power supply and the output of LPA, thereby improving the power supply utilization of LPA. In addition, the study also focuses on the conflicting relationship between the output ripple and the dynamic performance of the CLDPSs, for which a new parametric design of the LC filter circuit is proposed, aiming to achieve a balance between these two aspects. Finally, a voice coil motor driving platform is constructed for experimental testing. The results demonstrate that the output ripple and dynamic performance of the CLDPSs can be balanced. In comparison to the DC power supply mode, the CLDPSs power supply mode can enhance the efficiency of LPA by 2 times while the driving accuracy of voice coil motor is basically unchanged.</jats:p>",

During austral winter and spring 2019, two cruises were conducted in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, to determine the distribution and surface water supply mechanisms of dissolved manganese in the upper water column. The supply mechanisms were used to calculate the total flux of dissolved manganese to productive surface waters and were compared to biological consumption estimates. Mean dissolved manganese concentrations in the upper water column (&lt; 500 m) during winter and spring were comparably low (≤ 0.34 nmol kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05), with seasonal mixed layer reservoir sizes averaging 65.21 ± 12.93 and 21.64 ± 19.32 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, respectively. Winter entrainment contributed 89.33–99.99% (average 97.26% ± 5.28%) of the total dissolved manganese flux, while diapycnal diffusion contributed 0.52–10.58% (average 4.92% ± 5.14%), was identified as the dominant mechanisms for transporting dissolved manganese into the mixed layer in the subantarctic zone, polar frontal zone, and antarctic zone. Here, the winter physical supply rates were higher than the estimated consumption rates during spring, meeting phytoplankton biological demands. Whereas in the subtropical zone, the supply rates were lower than the consumption rates, indicating the presence of additional supply mechanisms such as coastal upwelling, which may help to meet the biological demands in this region.</jats:p>",

Among the five cultivars, 325Jimai showed a better photosynthetic performance under <jats:italic>e</jats:italic>[CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] over the three generations, while 02‐1Shiluan appeared to be more inhibited by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> elevation in the long term conditions.

This led to a water emergency situation in Paraná, which was decreed by the state government in 2020 and 2021. The Curitiba region depends on the Curitiba and Metropolitan Region Integrated Supply System (SAIC). Due to the intense drought in 2020 and 2021, SAIC's reservoirs suffered a significant reduction in stored water levels and volumes, reaching 28% of their total capacity in August 2020. This was the biggest water crisis in the last 90 years in the history of the state of Paraná, with several reservoirs reaching levels close to historic lows, but maintaining constant discharges in order to maintain power generation or public supply. In these cases, with the reservoirs at lower levels and with a smaller volume, the variation in the water level on the upstream slope of the earth dam varies differently from the levels when the dam and reservoir are in normal operation or outside of a water crisis. In view of the atypical behavior of reservoir levels, and based on good dam engineering practice, when the operating regime changes or the reservoir water level drops, the safety aspects of these structures should be reassessed through geotechnical analyses for conditions of rapid lowering, in order to learn how these structures behave under these conditions. This article sheds light on the important stages of this thorough technical investigation of the extensive documentation of a project like this, data on instrumentation and performance, how they were built and behaved during the construction and filling of the reservoir, knowledge of geotechnical parameters of the materials of the dam massif and foundation, recorded field observations made at the time of preliminary investigation during the design, project and construction phase; obtaining hydro-meteorological data from the region, in order to obtain the \"as-built\" geometry of the structure, with the aim of modeling the typical section reliably to the structure in the field in order to infer this numerical model and vice versa, and obtain results on its performance during this atypical period.</jats:p>"

To ensure this maximum freshness, it is necessary to consider it when planning planting, harvesting, packing, holding, and transporting of horticultural products. These tactical decisions are constrained by the configuration of the supply chain, which makes it relevant to ascertain if maximising the freshness at sale for horticultural products during chain design influences its configuration. Given the gap in the literature in this area, this paper proposes a mathematical programming model with multiple objectives that supports the design of agri-food supply chains by simultaneously maximising their economic benefits and the average freshness at sale for horticultural products. To this end, the model incorporates strategic decisions concerning supply chain design and tactical decisions concerning the production and transport planning of horticultural products to ensure their freshness. The model’s validity is confirmed through its application to a realistic case study of Argentina, considering scenarios with different weight distribution among the optimized objectives. The results reveal that the distribution of weights among the objectives significantly determines the design of the supply chain and its subsequent management, showing the relevance of considering the freshness of the horticultural products in this process. In addition, the impact this has on the supply chain economic benefits, the average freshness at sale for horticultural products, the wastage of products and the unsatisfied demand are analysed, finding interesting trade-offs among these factors.</jats:p>"

However, for some CRM, the primary drivers of these supply chain disruptions are likely to be issues related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rather than geological scarcity. Herein we combine public geospatial data as mappable proxies for key ESG indicators (e.g., conservation, biodiversity, freshwater, energy, waste, land use, human development, health and safety, and governance) and a global dataset of news events to train and validate three models for predicting “conflict” events (e.g., disputes, protests, violence) that can negatively impact CRM supply chains: (1) a knowledge-driven fuzzy logic model that yields an area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristics plot of 0.72 for the entire model; (2) a naïve Bayes model that yields an AUC of 0.81 for the test set; and (3) a deep learning model comprising stacked autoencoders and a feed-forward artificial neural network that yields an AUC of 0.91 for the test set. The high AUC of the deep learning model demonstrates that public geospatial data can accurately predict natural resources conflicts, but we show that machine learning results are biased by proxies for population density and likely underestimate the potential for conflict in remote areas. Knowledge-driven methods are the least impacted by population bias and are used to calculate an ESG rating that is then applied to a global dataset of lithium occurrences as a case study. We demonstrate that giant lithium brine deposits (i.e., &gt;10 Mt Li\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            O) are restricted to regions with higher spatially situated risks relative to a subset of smaller pegmatite-hosted deposits that yield higher ESG ratings (i.e., lower risk). Our results reveal trade-offs between the sources of lithium, resource size, and spatially situated risks. We suggest that this type of geospatial ESG rating is broadly applicable to other CRM and that mapping spatially situated risks prior to mineral exploration has the potential to improve ESG outcomes and government policies that strengthen supply chains.\n          </jats:p>",

Using data on overdose deaths from the National Vital Statistics System, we fit Bayesian spatiotemporal models to estimate risk differences and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) in county-level opioid overdose deaths associated with enactment of these state policies. Must-query PDMPs were independently associated with on average 0.8 (95% CrI, 0.5-1.0) additional opioid-involved overdose deaths per 100 000 person-years.

Future SPI trends show increasing drought severity from 1986 to 2020. GRACE-DSI analysis (2002–2020) indicates a potential rise in drought conditions. VCI computations reveal vegetation health dynamics. Findings suggest an impending severe drought in the Ganga Basin, necessitating urgent water resource management. Drought causes are linked to precipitation changes and resource over-exploitation in changing climate conditions. The study emphasizes implementing measures like water conservation, sustainable land use, and groundwater recharge strategies to mitigate drought impacts.</jats:p>",

By integrating the use of SOFC and PVT, we can further minimize reliance on fossil fuels, while employing the coupling of PVT and heat pump effectively mitigates the inherent challenges of solar energy's variability and intermittency, all while enhancing overall system efficiency. On this basis, we apply the heat current method to construct a cross‐scale heat current model of the components and the system by considering the energy transfer, conversion, and storage characteristics of the system. By employing this model, we simulate the system's operation throughout an entire typical day, assess the COP enhancement of the PVT‐coupled heat pump system, analyze the influence of diverse operating conditions on daily system performance, and evaluate the economy of the energy storage devices in the system.</jats:p>",

It is a valuable indicator for understanding the significance of water resources in specific geographic regions. This paper focuses on the valuation of water supply as an ecosystem service in the subwatersheds of the Upper Pampanga River Basin (UPRB) by applying the InVEST model in both scenarios of business-as-usual (BAU) and development. The model incorporates economic valuation techniques, i.e. net present value (NPV), thereby enabling the assessment of the monetary value associated with water supply. The results of this study show that there is a slightly decreasing trend in the annual water yield values in both scenarios. In terms of land area, the largest area under the projected BAU and development scenario (2020–2027) is grassland and forest, respectively. The results provided insights into how land use changes and climate variability affect water yield, with the BAU scenario yielding a total annual water volume of 2.3 billion m3 compared to 2.1 billion m3 in the development scenario. Furthermore, the NPV is estimated at PHP 24.6 billion for the BAU scenario and PHP 22.4 billion for the development scenario. These findings are pivotal for decision-making frameworks, hence underscoring the imperative of sustainable land use practices and water resource management in the UPRB. The study underscores the necessity of conducting a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services to facilitate a balanced trade-off analysis, particularly at the subwatershed or watershed levels. This approach ensures that all factors influencing water yield and ecosystem health are considered, hence providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and effective resource management in the region.</jats:p>"

Community theory developed for free‐living organisms suggests that coinfecting pathogens can persist if they satisfy the mutual invasion criterion of coexistence, establishing infections in hosts that are already infected. Furthermore, the likelihood of coexistence may depend on host nutrition which can affect shared resources and host immunity. Here, we apply the novel approach of combining a dynamical model and experimental mutual invasibility trials to explore the effects of host nutrient supply on the coexistence of two viral plant pathogens. We focus on among‐pathogen interactions mediated by shared resources. First, we used a model to generate hypotheses about how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply rates affect the ability of two plant viruses to invade established infections of the other virus. Then, we experimentally manipulated the N and P supplied to oats (<jats:italic>Avena sativa</jats:italic>) in a growth chamber experiment and tested mutual invasion of two RNA viral pathogens, BYDV‐PAV and CYDV‐RPV. Nutrient supplies ranged from rates that barely kept hosts alive up to high, but sub‐toxic, rates. Model simulations suggested that the viruses were more likely to invade established infections either when they could replicate at lower N and P concentrations or when plant N and P concentrations increased due to a combination of nutrient supply rates and resident virus nutrient use. In the experiment, each virus successfully invaded hosts infected by the other and had consistent growth rates across N and P supply rates. Our results suggest that BYDV‐PAV and CYDV‐RPV can coexist across a wide range environmental nutrient supply, which is consistent with the high levels of co‐occurrence of these two viruses in field populations.</jats:p>",

The mentioned renewable sources are used to supply electrical energy. The bio‐waste unit (BEU) is equipped with combined electrical and thermal technology. It is used along with heat pumps to supply thermal energy. Electrical and thermal storage are employed to make the renewable power output as close as possible to the demand level. Electric storage can be either stationary (e.g., battery) or mobile (e.g., electric vehicles), but thermal storage is as stationary type of storage. In the following, the proposed scheme minimizes construction and maintenance costs imposed by power sources, storage devices, and power electronic converters, and expected storage degradation cost. This plan is bound to the model of operation of sources, storage devices, and power electronic converters. In this model, renewables are the main source of power to supply consumers, where storage is adopted to increase the generation level to make it as close as possible to the demand curve. The uncertain parameters are imposed by the load, renewable phenomena, and mobile storage parameters. To model these uncertainties, stochastic optimization based on unscented transformation is used. Finally, the findings of the paper demonstrate that the suggested scheme succeeds in the economic planning of the system with a simultaneous supply of electrical and thermal energy. The BEU equipped with a combined electricity and heat system along with thermal storage and a heat pump to supply thermal load besides providing electric energy can reduce the planning cost by 2.9% compared with the case with only electrical energy. Also, the mobile storage presence in the hybrid system can reduce the number of stationary storage devices, which alone results in a 7.7% decrease in the planning cost of the hybrid system.</jats:p>",

We use a discrete scenario set to model the uncertain blood supply and demand, and the unforeseeable disruptions in permanent blood collection facilities, blood banks, and road links arising from a disaster, where instead of complete failure, disrupted permanent blood collection facilities and blood blanks may only lose part of their capacities. To design a reliable blood supply network to mitigate the possible disruptions, we present a two‐stage adaptive robust model that integrates the location, inventory, and allocation decisions incorporating a blood sharing strategy, where blood can be delivered from a disrupted/non‐disrupted blood bank to disrupted blood banks to enhance the flexibility of the relief network. For this novel problem, we devise an exact algorithm that integrates column‐and‐constraint generation and Benders decomposition and introduce several non‐trivial acceleration techniques to speed up the solution generation process. We conduct extensive numerical studies on random data sets to evaluate the algorithmic performance. We also conduct a case study in Tehran to demonstrate its real‐life applicability and examine the impacts of key model parameters on the solutions. The numerical results verify the benefits of our model over typical benchmarks, that is, deterministic and stochastic models, and the superiority of our solution algorithm over the CPLEX solver and two well‐known solution approaches, that is, column‐and‐constraint generation and Benders decomposition. Finally, based on the numerical results, we derive managerial insights from the analytical findings.</jats:p>",

To enhance energy utilization, this study proposed an analysis method that renewable energy source shares among different buildings was investigated based on the supply relationship between energy from the ETSS side and BL demand side.

The proposed analysis method was used to develop the potential of available renewable energy through energy sharing from the perspective of the energy consumption differences of the three buildings. The results presented that the potential of renewable energy utilization was further developed by reasonably operating the use and storage of energy sources from ETSS based on the optimization between energy sources from EGS and building loads. Energy source shares among different buildings with different energy consumption characteristics enhanced energy efficiency according to reasonably change the useable time of energy sources from tanks. When a building required a large number of energy sources, the buildings with low energy consumption directly shared renewable energy without considering the use of energy storage.

We probe into two pivotal aspects: how industry dynamism and climate risk affect the mental health and well-being of owners of small and micro-sized suppliers and how, in turn, dictate involvement and, consequently, supply chain sustainability performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For the last four decades, policymakers have attempted to control the United States's high health care costs by reducing patients’ demand for care (e.g., by imposing managed-care restrictions or high costs on patients at the time of use). Yet studies based mostly on data from the public Medicare program, which covers mostly elderly Americans, suggest that supply (e.g., number of physicians or hospital beds) rather than demand drives aggregate service use and, hence, costs. Using variation between U.S. states in per enrollee Medicare spending versus per capita spending of all other (non-Medicare) individuals, we find that greater supply boosts costs for the entire population. Furthermore, we find that factors that suppress demand in the non-Medicare population do reduce non-Medicare health care spending, but simultaneously increase Medicare spending. This suggests that for a given supply of medical resources, suppressing demand for one group of patients may produce a compensatory increase in provision of care to those whose demand has not been suppressed. Health planning to assure adequate medical resources where they are needed while preventing excess supply where it is duplicative and wasteful is likely a more effective cost control strategy than the imposition of managed-care restrictions or imposing higher costs onto patients seeking care. </jats:p>",

Fourteen percent of the total water withdrawal in the United States is used for public supply, typically including deliveries to domestic, commercial, and occasionally including industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric water withdrawal. Stewards of water resources in the USA require estimates of water withdrawals to manage and plan for future demands and sustainable water supplies. This study compiled the most comprehensive conterminous United States water withdrawal data set to date and developed a machine learning framework for estimating public supply withdrawals and associated uncertainty for the period 2000–2020. The modeling approach provides service area resolution estimates to allow for annual and monthly water withdrawal estimation while incorporating a complex array of driving factors that include hydroclimatic, demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and land use factors. Model results reveal highly variable and lognormally distributed per‐capita water withdrawal, spanning from 30 to 650 gallons per capita per day (GPCD), across community, regional, and national scales, with pronounced seasonal variations. Analysis of estimated withdrawal trends indicates that the national annual average withdrawal experienced a decline at a rate of 0.58 GPCD/year during the period from 2000 to 2020. Model interpretation reveals a complex interplay between public supply withdrawal and key predictors, including population size, warm‐season precipitation, counts of large buildings and houses, and areas of urban and commercial land use. The developed models can forecast future public supply driven by various climate, demographic, and socioeconomic scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past, hydrogen was mostly produced from fossil fuels, causing a certain degree of energy and environmental problems. With the development of low-carbon energy systems, renewable energy hydrogen production technology has developed rapidly and become one of the focuses of research in recent years. However, the existing work is still limited by small-scale hydrogen production systems, and there is a lack of comprehensive research on the whole production-storage-transportation-utilization hydrogen system (PSTUH2S), especially on the modeling of different hydrogen transportation modes and various hydrogen loads in different fields. To make up for these deficiencies, the specific physical and mathematical models of the PSTUH2S are firstly described in this paper, with a full account of large-scale water-electrolytic hydrogen production from renewable power curtailment and grid power, various hydrogen storage and transportation modes, and multi-field hydrogen consumption paths. Furthermore, to achieve the maximum economic, energy, and environmental benefits from the PSTUH2S, a multi-objective nonlinear optimization model is also presented herein and then solved by the hybrid method combining the nonlinear processing method, the CPLEX solver and the piecewise time series production simulation method. Lastly, case studies are conducted against the background of a region in northwest China, where hydrogen consumption capacity in various years is accurately assessed and the potential advantages of the PSTUH2S are demonstrated. As the simulation results show, the power curtailment of renewable energy generation can be reduced by 3.61/11.87/14.72 billion kW·h in 2025/2030/2035, respectively, thus contributing to a 4.98%~10.09% increase in the renewable energy consumption rate and millions of tons of carbon emission reduction in these years. In terms of the total equivalent economic benefits, the proposed method is able to bring about a cost saving of USD 190.44 million, USD 634.66 million, and USD 865.87 million for 2025, 2030, and 2035, respectively.</jats:p>"

In this review, we discuss the potential of microalgae as a nutritional supplement in IACEs from four perspectives. The first section provides a theoretical foundation by reviewing the environmental adaptability and previous studies in IACEs. Subsequently, the typical nutritional components of microalgae and their bioavailability are comprehensively elucidated. And then focus on the impact of these ingredients on health enhancement and elucidate its mechanisms in IACEs. Combining the outstanding stress resistance, rich active ingredients, the potential to alleviate osteoporosis, regulate metabolism, and promote mental well‐being, microalgae demonstrate significant value for food applications. Furthermore, the development of novel microalgae biomatrices enhances health safeguards. Nevertheless, the widespread application of microalgae in IACEs still requires extensive studies and more fundamental data, necessitating further exploration into improving bioavailability, high biomass cultivation methods, and enhancing palatability.</jats:p>",

The question of how to motivate CLSC participants to implement product recycling effectively has come into focus. We study the optimal strategy of a two-echelon CLSC under different incentive mechanisms, characterize the return rate in the form of a state equation for its dynamic behavior and construct a closed-loop supply chain dynamic model. Subsequently, we discuss two incentives—the cooperative promotion incentive and wholesale price discount incentive—based on the no-incentive game and investigate the optimal strategy, steady-state return rate, and revenue of each CLSC player in the three scenarios. Then, the choice of incentives by manufacturers and retailers under different scenarios is determined by comparative analysis. The results indicate that retailers always favor the cooperative promotion incentive. For manufacturers, the wholesale price discount incentive is more advantageous only when the recycling efforts outperform retailers’ promotion efforts in unit cost. In most other cases, the cooperative promotional incentive is more popular since it will generate more revenue for each participant and the entire supply chain. Moreover, there is a Profit-Pareto-improvement region when the CLSC implements the cooperative promotion incentive. </jats:p>",

Unlike giant intermediaries, these suppliers have smaller scales and are more risk‐averse. Motivated by practical examples, this paper studies these intermediaries' incentives for vertical demand information sharing with their suppliers. We develop a game‐theoretic model to consider a hybrid e‐commerce supply chain with a risk‐neutral intermediary and two risk‐averse suppliers, where one supplier (agency supplier) adopts agency selling while the other supplier (reselling supplier) employs reselling. As a benchmark, we show that it is beneficial for the intermediary to share <jats:italic>all</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>no</jats:italic>) information with both risk‐neutral suppliers if the proportional fee is relatively high (low). However, we find that suppliers' risk aversion is a key factor leading to supply chain members' pricing decisions being influenced by the precision of the demand information. This influence impacts the double marginalization effect and further changes the intermediary's information‐sharing decisions. Specifically, the intermediary should disclose <jats:italic>part</jats:italic> rather than <jats:italic>all</jats:italic> of its information to both risk‐averse suppliers if the proportional fee is high (intermediate) in a weakly (highly) competitive market environment. Finally, when the reselling supplier's sensitivity to risk is sufficiently high (low) relative to the agency supplier's sensitivity to risk, we observe that the intermediary is less (more) willing to share information.</jats:p>",

This work presents a numerical investigation on the influence of diffuser vane height on flow variation and hydraulic loss in the volute for a water supply centrifugal pump. Experiments and numerical simulations were conducted with four different vane height ratios. The numerical results were validated against experimental data. The hydraulic losses of different flow components were numerically evaluated at varying guide vane blade heights. The changes in flow patterns within the volute and the resulting discrepancies in hydraulic losses due to variations in the inlet flow conditions at different blade heights were studied. The findings indicate that the total pressure drop within the volute is affected significantly. Compared to traditional guide vanes, the reduced height vanes can reduce the hydraulic loss in the volute by nearly 75%. Once the vane height is reduced, the high-pressure gradient is improved, and the small-scale vortex vanishes. The influence area of the large-scale vortex in the volute outlet pipe decreases, leading to a weakening of the deflection of the main flow and ultimately resulting in reduced hydraulic loss.</jats:p>"

However, it is not feasible to collect sufficient fault samples in a hydropower station. The scarcity of labeled samples poses a challenge in developing powerful diagnostic models with high classification accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-channel data fusion strategy based on a transformer for feature enhancement. Initially, the original signals are transferred into non-overlapping single-channel data patches to preserve correlation features across different channels. Next, temporal and spatial attention modules are applied to process the data patches, which can learn and fuse temporal and spatial information, respectively. Subsequently, the data patches are embedded to retain position information and represent fault-related features through class embedding, which are further processed by a transformer encoder with self-attention mechanisms. Finally, the classification task is achieved by using a multilayer perceptron layer connected to the class embedding. While dealing with limited training samples, the proposed method can learn robust features that are beneficial to improve the fault diagnosis ability of induction motors. The comparison of the proposed method with three basic models and two improved methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in accuracy and feature clustering performance under limited sample conditions. In addition, ablation experiments demonstrate the necessity of each module in the proposed method.</jats:p>",

Drawing from complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory, we develop and test a model of how a prospective and challenging financing scheme navigates complex social and repayment systems to achieve sustainable SCF. The results of the study show that a challenging financing scheme must navigate complex social and repayment systems to achieve sustainable SCF, while a prospective financing scheme even though it shows a positive influence on sustainable SCF, its effect is higher when it is able to navigate these. The study hence concludes that for agricultural SCF schemes to lead to sustainable food security, they must be accessible and appropriate to the needs of the community, overcome default risk and cumbersome financial arrangements and be able to navigate the complex social and repayment systems. The study recommends that financing schemes should establish proximity to farming communities and engage farmers to determine appropriate funds for different stages among others.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Critical raw materials (CRMs) supply is a challenge that EU countries have to face, with many thinking about domestic procurement from natural ore deposits and anthropogenic deposits (landfills and extractive waste facilities). The present research focuses on the possibilities linked to the supply of CRMs and the potential for exploiting rare earth elements (REEs), investigating a large variety of extractive waste and siliceous rocks in the Piedmont region (Northern Italy). Indeed, the recovery of REEs from the extractive waste (EW) of siliceous quarries and other siliceous ore deposits can be a valuable way to reduce supply chain risks. Starting with a review of the literature on mining activities in Piedmont and continuing with the sampling and geochemical, mineralogical, petrographic, and environmental characterization of EW facilities connected to siliceous dimension stones, of kaolinitic gneiss ore deposits, and of soils present near the investigated areas, this study shows that the degree of REEs enrichment differs depending on the sampling area (soil or EW) and lithology. The concentration of REEs in the EW at some sampling sites fulfils the indicators of industrial-grade and industrial recovery; the high cumulative production and potential market values of EW and the positive recovery effects through proven methodologies indicate a viable prospect of REE recovery from EW. However, REE recovery industrialization faces challenges such as the difficulty in achieving efficient large-scale recovery due to large regional differences in REE abundance, the mismatch between potential market value and waste annual production, etc. Nonetheless, in the future, EW from dimension stone quarries could be differentially studied and reused based on the enrichment and distribution characteristics of trace elements. The present paper shows investigation procedures undertaken to determine both CRMs potentialities and environmental issues (on the basis of literature data employed to select the more-promising areas and on sampling and characterization activities in the selected areas), together with procedures to determine the waste quantities and tentative economic values of REEs present in the investigated areas. This approach, tested on a large area (Piedmont region), is replicable and applicable to other similar case studies (at EU and non-EU levels) and offers decision makers the possibility to acquire a general overview of the potential available resources in order to decide whether and where to concentrate efforts (including economic ones) in a more detailed study to evaluate the exploitable anthropogenic deposits.</jats:p>"

The increase in operating costs caused by advertising places greater pressure on small retail businesses that are prone to capital shortages, leading them to seek financing from upstream firms. However, in the financing process, upstream and downstream firms may not be able to acquire all of one another’s real information, which inevitably has a significant impact on their operating strategies. By constructing a Stackelberg game, this paper studies the effects of information asymmetry on the retailer’s initial capital and the manufacturer’s financing rate on their advertising strategies. We find that in the symmetric information scenario, when the advertising cost coefficient is low, manufacturer advertising is the superior strategy and increases the retailer’s and manufacturer’s profits and social welfare; when it is moderate, retailer advertising is the superior policy; but when it is high, retailer advertising is more beneficial for the manufacturer’s profit and social welfare but is more unfavorable for the retailer’s profit. In addition, information asymmetry on the manufacturer’s financing rate affects the advertising strategies of the manufacturer and the retailer, but information asymmetry on the retailer’s initial capital fails. Additionally, we further extend the model to the Nash game scenario and cooperative advertising scenario and draw some different conclusions. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the advertising strategies of the retailer and the manufacturer with asymmetric financing information, and guides the design of advertising strategies for companies in practice.</jats:p>",

Hydrological dynamics of karstic sites in Mediterranean semiarid regions are difficult to be modelled mathematically owing to the existence of short wet episodes and long dry periods. In this paper, the suitability of an open-source SWAT method was checked to estimate the comportment of a karstic catchment in a Mediterranean semiarid domain (southeast of Spain), which wet and dry periods were evaluated using box-whisker plots and self-developed wavelet test. A novel expression of the Nash–Sutcliffe index for arid areas (ANSE) was considered through the calibration and validation of SWAT. Both steps were completed with 20- and 10-year discharge records of stream (1996–2015 to calibrate the model as this period depicts minimum gaps and 1985–1995 to validate it). Further, SWAT assessments were made with records of groundwater discharge and relating SWAT outputs with the SIMPA method, the Spain’s national hydrological tool. These methods, along with recurrent neural network algorithms, were utilised to examine current and predicted water resources available to supply urban demands considering also groundwater abstractions from aquifers and the related exploitation index. According to the results, SWAT achieved a “very good” statistical performance (with ANSE of 0.96 and 0.78 in calibration and validation). Spatial distributions of the main hydrological processes, as surface runoff, evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge, were studied with SWAT and SIMPA obtaining similar results over the period with registers (1980–2016). During this period, the decreasing trend of rainfalls, characterised by short wet periods and long dry periods, has generated a progressive reduction of groundwater recharge. According to algorithms prediction (until 2050), this declining trend will continue reducing groundwater available to meet urban demands and increasing the exploitation index of aquifers. These results offer valuable information to authorities for assessing water accessibility and to provide water demands in karstic areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organic waste, primarily originating from agricultural sources, remains underutilized in Indonesia, despite its substantial potential as an organic fertilizer. Consequently, it is imperative to comprehend the technology capable of efficiently decomposing organic matter and yielding high-quality compost. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a microbial consortium compris-ing Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Trichoderma sp., and Aspergillus sp. on the decomposition of organic waste derived from rice, sugarcane, corn and as well as to examine its application to sweet-corn (Zea mays var. saccharata). The study used a factorial randomized block design, featuring two primary factors, compost types and their respective doses. This design in total of nine treatments, each replicated three times, thus resulting in a sum of 27 experimental units. The treatments were RSC: Rice straw compost; SLC: Sugarcane leaves compost; CHC: Corn husk compost; D7.5: Compost dose of 7.5 t ha-1; D15: Compost dose of 15 t ha-1; D22.5: Compost dose of 22.5 t ha-1.  Moreover, an essential fertilizer, NPK, was applied at a rate of 200 kg/ha. The find-ings demonstrated a substantial impact of both compost types and doses on maize growth parameters, which encompassed plant height, leaf area, chlo-rophyll contentand dry weight. These effects were observed individually, without any interactions between the two factors. Furthermore, these treat-ments exhibited a discernible influence on corn yield. The highest to lowest yields were recorded as follows: CHC (9.29 t ha-1), RSC (8.72 t ha-1), and SLC (8.00 t ha-1). Combining organic compost with chemical fertilizer effectively prevented nutrient loss through denitrification and evaporation, facilitating nutrient retention and controlled release over time.</jats:p>",

But the carbon emission distribution, potential for carbon reduction, and pathways in the main links of the beef cattle industry chain are not yet clear. Balancing efficiency and fairness while taking tailored emission reduction paths according to local conditions is crucial in helping to achieve the low-carbon animal husbandry and “dual carbon” goals. This research adopts an industry chain perspective to assess four leading beef production regions’ carbon emissions, potential, and pathways in China from 2007 to 2021. We use life cycle assessment, the potential index which considers efficiency and fairness; the results are as follows: (1) The potential for carbon emission reduction in China’s beef industry showed an inverted U-shaped change trend from 2007 to 2021, and the average potential for carbon emission reduction in most provinces fluctuated around 0.500. (2) The main producing areas of China’s beef industry were divided into four areas of high efficiency and low fairness (Area A); high efficiency and high fairness (Area B); low efficiency and low fairness (Area C); and low efficiency and high fairness (Area D). (3) Differentiated emission reduction pathways were designed to reduce emissions, highlighting the need to implement region-specific carbon reduction policies.</jats:p>"

Investigating the power structure’s impact on decisions related to acquisition prices and inventory management can provide insights into the integration of sustainable practices. This study analyzes a reverse supply chain with a supplier and a remanufacturer, in which the supplier provides the remanufacturer with sorted used cores. We investigate the acquisition pricing and inventory decisions under different power structures (supplierled Stackelberg model, remanufacturer-led Stackelberg model) through game theory analysis. We first establish the centralized model to explore optimal acquisition decisions and profit of the total system. Then we evaluate the acquisition quantity, wholesale prices, the profit of supplier and remanufacturer in the supplier-led model and in the remanufacturer-led model. Finally, the impact of power structure on the performance of supplier and remanufacturer are explored by numerical analysis, as well as the supply chain system. Our significant findings show that (i) the total profit of the supplier-led and remanufacturer-led reverse supply chain are less than the centralized model due to the double marginalization; (ii) the remanufacturer-led reverse supply chain is superior to the supplier-led model reverse supply chain; (iii) the selected grades in the supplier-led model is proved the same as that in the remanufacturer-led model, which could not been affected by the wholesale price; (iv) the greater the inventory risk (the uncertainty in demand), the greater the profit share for the remanufacturer (supplier) in the supplier-led (remanufacturer-led) model.</jats:p>",

In order to supplement this area of knowledge of ESs, we selected 30 small watersheds in high-, medium- and low-precipitation areas as study units. A biophysical model and socio-economic data were used to calculate supply and demand for carbon sequestration, soil conservation and water yield. Redundancy analysis and regression analysis were used to study the ESs trade-offs, the supply–demand dynamics, and the characteristics of their correlation. The results were as follows. (1) The supply and balance between supply and demand of the three ESs, the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water yield and the trade-off between soil conservation and water yield trended downwards from the high-precipitation area to the medium-precipitation area to the low-precipitation area. (2) The primary factors influencing balance between supply and demand with regard to carbon sequestration in high-, medium- and low-precipitation areas were population density and soil organic-matter content, and the size of the conditional effects were greater than 53%. The dominant factor affecting the balance between supply and demand with regard to soil conservation in the three precipitation areas was slope gradient, and the conditional effect was greater than 40%. The most significant determinants of balance between supply and demand with regard to water yield in the three precipitation areas were grassland area, forest area and precipitation, and the conditional effects were greater than 22%. (3) The most significant determinants of the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water yield in high-, medium- and low-precipitation areas were forest, soil organic-matter content and population density, and the conditional effects were all greater than 45%; the primary factors affecting the trade-off between soil conservation and water yield in high-, medium- and low-precipitation areas were grassland and slope gradient, and the conditional effects were all greater than 24%. (4) The relationship between the balance between supply and demand and trade-off size often followed a quadratic function; the next-most-common relationship was a monotonous nonlinear response, and a linear response relationship was relatively rare. This study revealed the factors influencing balance between supply and demand and trade-offs with regard to ESs and the characteristics of their correlations in areas with different degrees of precipitation, which provided a new idea for the synchronous regulation of ESs in the context of conflicts and supply–demand imbalance.</jats:p>"

At the micro and macro levels, agricultural seed enterprises face challenges and pressures in earning excess profits, enhancing their competitive edge, and resisting the incursion of multinational seed enterprises. This article selects panel data from 49 listed seed enterprises in China from 2015 to 2022 and uses methods such as global principal component analysis (GPCA) and Q-type cluster analysis to measure and evaluate the competitiveness of Chinese seed enterprises. Research has found that: (1) From 2015 to 2022, the overall competitiveness of listed Chinese agricultural seed enterprises has shown an upward trend. The competitiveness of agricultural seed enterprises can be further decomposed into operational capabilities, growth capabilities, production efficiency, technological innovation capabilities, etc. (2) The top ten agricultural seed enterprises in China have obvious advantages in operational and technological innovation capabilities, but their growth capabilities and production efficiency are insufficient. (3) Regarding the vertical comparison of the seed industry, the ranking of the competitiveness of Chinese listed agricultural seed enterprises from strong to weak is wheat seed enterprises &gt; other seed enterprises &gt; melon and vegetable seed enterprises &gt; corn seed enterprises &gt; rice seed enterprises. (4) Compared with international seed industry giants, there are various reasons why China’s top agricultural seed enterprises have weaker competitiveness, specifically reflected in research and development investment, scale and market share, industrial layout, and other aspects. The findings of this research offer empirical evidence to bolster the competitiveness of seed enterprises and advance the seed industry, while also aiding in fortifying the nation’s strategic oversight of the seed sector, bearing profound implications for safeguarding food security.</jats:p>"

To understand the distribution and conjuncture of this sector, this study analyzes the pattern of location, concentration and clustering of the bioelectricity supply from sugarcane bagasse in Brazil, for 2017 and 2022. The data were obtained from the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency, and the methodology was based on concentration indices and scan statistics. The results showed that the Southeast region presented the most thermoelectric power plants and installed capacity. The Southeast and Midwest regions were highly concentrated in terms of quantity and sugarcane bioelectricity installed capacity. Five clusters were identified for the number of power plants in 2017; for 2022, there were eight clusters. Regarding installed potential, there were 14 clusters in 2017 and 23 clusters in 2022, all statistically significant. The existence of clusters provides information on the competitive advantages in the national market, which can drive new investments in more densified areas or in the neighborhood. Identification of the location and concentration pattern showed that facilities in the state of São Paulo and the Northeast coast were responsible for the most important share of supply. These results indicate to investors the impact of electricity generation on the sector and the most relevant location for installing new thermoelectric plants.</jats:p>"

This study assesses the water security of the sub‐Saharan region, focusing on Iwo, Nigeria. Surveys on household water sources, availability, and use were conducted across 12 months among 937 households. Climatic data spanning 31 years (1992–2022) from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency were analyzed for water supply evaluation. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were applied to the datasets. Results revealed a predominant 95% involvement of female heads and individuals above 18 years old. Notably, 92.7% spent less than 10 min obtaining water, with 90.5% not paying water tariffs, indicating a predominantly domestic water use pattern, reflecting the agrarian nature of the study area. Analysis of climatic data highlighted water loss during dry season months and previously rainy months (March, April, and August), confirming climate change manifestations. Household water use consistently exceeded supply, ranging from 348.9 to 444.6 L/month, with a per capita value of 148.6 L (4.95 L/day) falling below the WHO recommendation of 10 to 20 L/day.

In order to explore the mutual influence of the participants in the supply chain, this paper constructs two static tripartite game models for traditional and digital supply chain finance, including a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), a core enterprise (CE), and a financial institution (FI). The conditions for SME, CE, and FI to participate in digital supply chain finance, and the equilibrium strategy (repayment, repayment, loan) after participating in digital supply chain finance, are figured out. It is found that compared with the traditional supply chain, the digital supply chain expands the probability range of repayment for SME and CE by the change of pledge rate and default loss and broadens the probability range of repayment for CE by the change of default loss. Further, compared with the traditional supply chain finance, the greater the pledge rate of digital supply chain finance and the smaller the default loss, the stronger the willingness of the SME and CE to participate in the digital supply chain and the lower the willingness of the FI. After the three parties participate in the digital supply chain, however, the conclusion is the opposite. The smaller the pledge rate and the greater the default loss, the stronger the repayment willingness for the SME and CE and the stronger the loan willingness of the FI. Therefore, it is suggested to find the critical values of pledge rate and default loss and raise these two variables to an appropriate range to encourage all parties to voluntarily and consistently participate in digital supply chain financing.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the study of the relationship between water resources use and economic growth is of particular importance. Lanzhou City was selected as the study area, an evaluation index system was established to comprehensively evaluate the status of water resources utilisation, meanwhile, the water footprint method and Tapio decoupling model were adopted to measure the decoupling status between water utilisation and economic development from 2002 to 2021. The result showed that the total water footprint and per capita water footprint followed an increasing and then decreasing trend. The water footprint varied significantly by industrial sector, with agriculture accounting for 72.87% of total water use. The self-sufficiency rate of water resources was above 96.5%. The economic value increased substantially from 22.25 CNY/m3 in 2002 to 183.99 CNY/m3 in 2021. The water scarcity index and the pressure index were high, with annual mean values of 0.96 and 1, respectively. Water consumption and economic growth are generally decoupled weakly and strongly, with the number of strong decoupling occurrences increasing significantly from 2011 to 2021.</jats:p>",

We develop a framework to quantify fractional forecast uncertainty and partition it between (1) snowpack quantification methods, (2) variability in post‐forecast precipitation, and (3) runoff model errors. We demonstrate the uncertainty framework with statistical runoff models in the upper Tuolumne and Merced River basins (California, USA) using snow observations at two endmember spatial resolutions: a simple snow pillow index and full‐catchment snow water equivalent (SWE) maps at 50 m resolution from the Airborne Snow Observatories. Bayesian forecast simulations demonstrate a nonlinear decrease in the skill of statistical water supply forecasts during warm snow droughts, when a low fraction of winter precipitation remains as SWE. Forecast skill similarly decreases during dry snow droughts, when winter precipitation is low. During a shift away from snow‐dominance, the uncertainty of forecasts using snow pillow data increases about 1.9 times faster than analogous forecasts using full‐catchment SWE maps in the study area. Replacing the snow pillow index with full‐catchment SWE data reduces statistical forecast uncertainty by 39% on average across all tested climate conditions. Attributing water supply forecast uncertainty to reducible error sources reveals opportunities to improve forecast reliability in a warmer future climate.</jats:p>",

Prefabricated building supply chains often experience disruptions due to supply instability, transportation delay and force majeure, resulting in project delays and cost escalations and posing challenges to the sustainable development objectives of enterprises. Therefore, it is important and essential to study the strategy of enhancing the resiliency of prefabricated building supply chains, which has not been comprehensively explored in previous papers. This paper constructs decision-making models for supply chain cost resilience strategies under varying scenarios of supply disruptions, incorporating both redundant inventory and back-up supplier strategy. It considers the total cost and resilience of the supply chain as dual objective functions. Parameter-tuned non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Π (NSGA-Π) algorithms were used innovatively to solve the project case, and the impacts of the redundant inventory coefficient and back-up supplier supply price coefficient on the model result were analyzed. The results indicate that the supply chain with resilience construction has a superior capability to cope with disruption. The results show that when there is a mild supply disruption, the general contractor uses the capacity within the supply chain and chooses a redundant inventory strategy to restore resilience. In the event of moderate disruption, both the easy inventory strategy and back-up supplier strategy are selected to maintain supply chain stability. In the event of a severe disruption, only the back-up supplier strategy is selected to cover the losses and maintain the project schedule. In addition, the choice of resilience strategy is impacted by the inventory levels and component prices of back-up suppliers. It further verifies the effectiveness of the model and the impacts of uncertain parameters in the model on the results. This study contributes to enhancing the resilience management of the prefabricated building supply chain by the general contractor, thereby elevating the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the supply chain and furthering the sustainable development of prefabricated buildings.</jats:p>"

This paper utilizes 2021 Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite remote sensing images as its primary data source and uses deep learning algorithms for the precise extraction of the green space coverage within Beijing’s fifth ring road. It also incorporates the park points of interest (POI) information, road data, and other auxiliary data to extract green park space details. The analysis focuses on examining the relationship between supply and demand in the spatial allocation of green park spaces from an accessibility perspective. The main findings are as follows: (1) The application of deep learning algorithms improves the accuracy of green space extraction by 10.68% compared to conventional machine methods. (2) The distribution of parks and green spaces within the fifth ring road of Beijing is uneven, showing a clear pattern of “more in the north and less in the south”. The accessibility within a five-minute service radius achieves a coverage rate of 46.65%, with a discernible blind zone in the southeast. (3) There is an imbalance in the per capita green space location entropy within the fifth ring road of Beijing, there is a big difference in per capita green space location entropy (44.19), and social fairness needs to be improved. The study’s outcomes unveil the intricate relationship between service capacity and spatial allocation, shedding light on the supply and demand dynamics of parks and green spaces within Beijing’s fifth ring road. This insight will contribute to the construction of ecologically sustainable and aesthetically pleasing living spaces in modern megacities.</jats:p>"

However, due to the inherent nonlinear characteristics of the fuel cell gas supply subsystem, the traditional control strategy is mainly based on proportional integral (PI) control, which has the disadvantages of large limitation, large error, limited immunity, and inconsistent control performance, which seriously affects its effectiveness. In order to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an optimal control method for air supply subsystems based on nonlinear active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). Firstly, a seven-order fuel cell system model is established, and then, the nonlinear ADRC and traditional PI control strategies are compared and analyzed. Finally, the two strategies are simulated and compared. The validation results indicate that the integral absolute error (IAE) measure of PI control is 0.502, the integral square error (ISE) measure is 0.1382, and the total variation (TV) measure is 399.1248. Compared with the PI control, the IAE and ISE indexes of ADRC were reduced by 61.31% and 58.03%, respectively. ADRC is superior to PI control strategy in all aspects and realizes the efficient adjustment of the system under different working conditions. ADRC is more suitable for the nonlinear characteristics of the gas supply system and is more suitable for the oxygen excess ratio (OER).</jats:p>"

However, the problem is that the design and delivery of supply chain management MOOCs can be inappropriately presented and, thus, ineffective, especially for educational teams with fewer teaching experiences of MOOCs. This eventually makes it hard for the students’ learning outcomes to meet the industrial requirements of supply chain experts. Motivated by such a problem, this paper aims to improve the design and delivery of supply chain management MOOCs to enhance student learning outcomes. To achieve this goal, the research method adopted in this paper is to analyse online reviews in a widely-used Chinese MOOC platform with a novel TOPSIS-CoCoSo approach, aiming to identify the barriers to supply chain management MOOCs and their potential solutions. The results of this study show that 16 barriers to MOOCs are identified from the online reviews and then ranked based on their severity of reducing learning outcomes. The perceptions of the severity of the barriers to students and lecturers are compared, and the solutions to the barriers are then discussed. In addition, our comparison indicates that although students and lecturers have similar perceptions of severity for the majority of the barriers, they have significant disagreements on certain barriers. The significance of this study is that it can inform lecturers in supply chain management or relevant disciplines to better design and deliver their MOOC content, as well as contribute to the existing literature by providing new methodological tools for educational analysis.

Optimization ideas and technologies are important foundations and core frameworks in product family design. Previous research on product family design has mainly been limited to optimization problems within the product domain. As an important influencing factor in the product family design process, the supply chain not only affects the cost level of the product family in the back-end of the design process, but also affects the modular structure layout of the product family in the front-end of the design process. Therefore, the optimization of the correlation between supply chain and product family design process is a crucial issue that determines the success or failure of product families. However, when researching the personalized needs of users in product family design and configuring product modules, there is very little consideration given to the optimization of supply chain correlation. To address the aforementioned issues, this article develops supply chain oriented product design optimization decision-making method based on improved CUR matrix decomposition. Firstly, based on the customer’s functional requirements C matrix and module relationship R matrix, perform customer clustering and corresponding product configuration. Then, utilizing the numerical stability of orthogonal trigonometric decomposition (QR), U matrix is constructed, which represents the inherent relationship between functional requirements and module relationships. Secondly, based on quality/character requirements, functional module levels division and initial supplier configuration are carried out. Finally, determine the supplier configuration for each module with the goal of maximizing total profit. Analyze the customer selection, classification, and product configuration process of a contractor as a case study. The research results indicate that the optimization decision method based on improved CUR matrix decomposition can effectively obtain the optimal solution of the decision problem.</jats:p>",

Technical challenges, such as system interoperability and data privacy concerns, emerged as major barriers, necessitating the development of standardized protocols and robust security measures. Organizational resistance to change and the need for extensive training and capacity-building were also identified as significant obstacles. Socio-cultural challenges, including variability in technological literacy and trust in digital systems, further complicate the integration process. Despite these challenges, the study highlights substantial benefits of BIS integration, including improved data management and analytics, enhanced program efficiency, and better resource allocation. These advantages facilitate more informed decision-making, timely interventions, and optimized resource use, ultimately improving the effectiveness of public health nutrition programs.

Disentangling the cyanobacteria–bacteria interactions in relation to nutrient supply is essential to understanding their roles in geochemical cycles under global change. We hypothesize that enhanced nutrient supply in oligotrophic oceans can promote interactions among cyanobacteria and bacteria. Therefore, we investigated the planktonic bacteria and their interactions with cyanobacteria in relation to elevated nutrients caused by enhanced upwelling around a shallow and a deep seamount in the tropical western Pacific Ocean. We found obviously higher complexity of network occurred with significantly more cyanobacteria in the deep chlorophyll maximum layer of the shallow seamount when compared with that of the deep seamount. Cyanobacteria can shape bacterial interaction and community evenness in response to relatively high nutrient concentrations. The effects of the nutrients on cyanobacteria-related networks were further estimated based on the\n            <jats:italic>Tara</jats:italic>\n            Oceans data.

Although there are many studies on corporate social responsibility in the supply chain, there is still a lack of research on the impact of corporate social responsibility on various decision-makers in the competitive green supply chain dominated by upstream enterprises. Therefore, taking into account the greenness and corporate social responsibility, the paper proposes three Stackelberg game models with the two-echelon supply chain consisting of two competing manufacturers and one socially responsible retailer. We develop a series of propositions and corollaries to determine the optimal solutions and offer some managerial insights. The main novelties and contributions of the paper can be demonstrated in two aspects. First, the paper simultaneously considers the impact of competition intensity and CSR level on wholesale prices, retail prices and greenness level. Second, the paper discusses the impact of two manufacturers with different market positions investing in green products on the profits and utility of supply chain members. Numerical illustrations prove that the level of corporate social responsibility is negatively correlated with retailer profitability and the retailer achieve the highest profits when sub-dominant manufacturer produces green products.</jats:p>",

However, the potential molecular mechanism(s) are not well understood. Here we show that asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 (GPER1) are critical sensors of nutrient depletion and linked to poorer outcomes for females with CRC. Using a 3D spheroid model of isogenic SW48 <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> wild‐type (WT) and G12A mutant (MT) cells grown under a restricted nutrient supply, we found that glutamine depletion inhibited cell growth in both cell lines, whereas <jats:italic>ASNS</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>GPER1</jats:italic> expression were upregulated in <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> MT versus WT. Estradiol decreased growth in <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> WT but had no effect on MT cells. Selective GPER1 and ASNS inhibitors suppressed cell proliferation with increased caspase‐3 activity of MT cells under glutamine depletion condition particularly in the presence of estradiol. In a clinical colon cancer cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas, both high <jats:italic>GPER1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ASNS</jats:italic> expression were associated with poorer overall survival for females only in advanced stage tumors. These results suggest <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> MT cells have mechanisms in place that respond to decreased nutrient supply, typically observed in advanced tumors, by increasing the expression of <jats:italic>ASNS</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>GPER1</jats:italic> to drive cell growth. Furthermore, <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> MT cells are resistant to the protective effects of estradiol under nutrient deplete conditions. The findings indicate that <jats:italic>GPER1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ASNS</jats:italic> expression, along with the interaction between nutrient supply and <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> mutations shed additional light on the mechanisms underlying sex differences in metabolism and growth in CRC, and have clinical implications in the precision management of <jats:italic>KRAS</jats:italic> mutant CRC.</jats:p>",

Prior works have identified the effects of digital technology adoption on companies’ supply chain positions; however, there has been limited research on the impact of digital technology innovation heterogeneity on companies’ supply chain position and the pathways through which this effect plays out. Hence, based on the global supply chain panel data from Chinese new energy vehicle companies, this study used a two-way fixed-effects model and causal stepwise regression analysis to study the impact of digital technological innovation on companies’ supply chain position and the dynamic mechanisms between them. The empirical results show that all three types of digital technology innovations, in the design and development process, the production and manufacturing process, and the sales and after-sales process, significantly enhance the company’s supply chain position. Further mechanism analysis shows that digital technology innovations enhance the company’s managerial efficiency and profitability mainly by reducing costs and increasing revenues, which ultimately improves the company’s supply chain position. This paper can provide a reference for policy makers to promote the application and development of a company’s digital technology and enhancing the supply chain position.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, several distant communities far from the national grid do not have access to reliable power supply, owing to economic, environmental, and technical challenges. Furthermore, unreliable, unavailable, and uneconomical power supply to these communities contributes significantly to the delivery of substandard or absence of qualitative healthcare services, resulting in higher mortality rates and associated difficulty in attracting qualified healthcare workers to the affected communities. Given these circumstances, this paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the status of renewable energy available to rural healthcare clinics around the globe, emphasizing its potential, analysis, procedures, modeling techniques, and case studies. In this light, several renewable energy modeling techniques were reviewed to examine the optimum power supply to the referenced healthcare centers in remote communities. To this end, analytical techniques and standard indices for reliable power supply to the isolated healthcare centers are suggested. Specifically, different battery storage systems that are suitable for rural healthcare systems are examined, and the most economical and realistic procedure for the maintenance of microgrid power systems for sustainable healthcare delivery is defined. Finally, this paper will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and experts in rural power supply to remote healthcare centers globally.</jats:p>"

In situ information is usually derived from field data and computed using appropriate equations. Nonetheless, fieldwork is time-consuming and costly. Thus, new technologies like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as an alternative method for forest assessment. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of geostatistical methods in predicting the Site Index (SI) using LiDAR metrics as auxiliary variables. Since primary variables, which were obtained from forestry inventory data, were used to calculate the SI, secondary variables obtained from LiDAR surveying were considered and multivariate kriging techniques were tested. The ordinary cokriging (CK) method outperformed the simple cokriging (SK) and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) methods, which was interpolated using only the primary variable. Aside from having fewer SI sample points, CK was proven to be a trustworthy interpolation method, minimizing interpolation errors due to the highly correlated auxiliary variables, highlighting the significance of the data’s spatial structure and autocorrelation in predicting forest stand attributes, such as the SI. CK increased the SI prediction accuracy by 36.6% for eucalyptus, 62% for maritime pine, 72% for pedunculate oak, and 43% for cork oak compared to IDW, outperforming this interpolation approach. Although cokriging modeling is challenging, it is an appealing alternative to non-spatial statistics for improving forest management sustainability since the results are unbiased and trustworthy, making the effort worthwhile when dense secondary variables are available.</jats:p>"

Herein, a method for the simultaneous and rapid detection of two T and O compounds (methyl sulfide and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol) based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is firstly developed. The SERS substrate was prepared by coating Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), layered double hydroxide (LDH), and graphene oxide (GO) on the surface of an Ag-coated Au nanoparticle (Au@Ag NP) substrate. Under optimal conditions, this SERS substrate possessed low detection limits of 1.53 ppm for methyl sulfide and 0.39 ppm for 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. In addition, it took only 20 min to complete the detection using this method, without complex sample pretreatment. Furthermore, it was successfully applied to simultaneously detect methyl sulfide and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol in actual water samples and had good application prospects for the rapid detection of T and O compounds in water.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Constructing accurate spatiotemporal correlations is a challenging task in joint prediction of multiple photovoltaic sites. Some advanced algorithms for incorporating other surrounding site information have been proposed, such as graph neural network-based methods, which are usually based on static or dynamic graphs to build spatial dependencies between sites. However, the possibility of the simultaneous existence of multiple spatial dependencies is not considered. This paper establishes a spatiotemporal prediction model based on hybrid spatiotemporal graph neural network. In this model, we apply adaptive hybrid graph learning to learn composite spatial correlations among multiple sites. A temporal convolution module with multi-subsequence temporal data input is used to extract local semantic information to better predict future nonlinear temporal dependencies. A spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module is added to address the issue of integrating diverse spatiotemporal trends among multiple sites. To assess the model's predictive performance, nine solar radiation observation stations were selected in two different climatic environments. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of the constructed model was 38.51 and 49.90 W/m2, with average mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.72 and 23.06 W/m2, respectively. Single-site and multi-site prediction models were selected as baseline models. Compared with the baseline models, the RMSE and MAE reduce by 3.1%–20.8% and 8.9%–32.8%, respectively, across all sites. The proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of improving accuracy in forecasting solar irradiance through multi-site predictions.</jats:p>",

The proposed model incorporates correlation analysis to identify dimensionality-reducing factors of multitarget components, determining the proportion of each target component relative to the total components. Fuzzy sets are applied to irrigation water resource allocation quantity, segmented into six levels of fuzzy membership to analyze the stochasticity of water supply. Results demonstrate the model's efficacy, revealing that variations in risk probabilities impact water supply, necessitating positive water management strategies to enhance agricultural efficiency and negative strategies to mitigate the risk of inadequate water supply. Key findings emphasize the significance of agricultural water availability and the structure of irrigation water use in optimal resource allocation. Importantly, the study showcases the enhanced precision achieved through the proposed multi-objective chance-constrained fuzzy interval linear programming with PCA, thereby refining the optimization outcomes for water management under multifaceted objectives.</jats:p>",

This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of MBF research, encompassing their diverse sources (bacteria, fungi, and algae), major categories (polysaccharides, proteins, and glycoproteins), production processes, and flocculation performance and mechanisms. The wide-ranging applications of MBFs in removing suspended solids, heavy metals, dyes, and other pollutants from industrial and municipal wastewater are critically examined, highlighting their superior efficiency, selectivity, and environmental compatibility compared to traditional flocculants. Nonetheless, bioflocculants face significant challenges including high substrate costs, low production yields, and intricate purification methodologies, factors that impede their industrial scalability. Moreover, the risk of microbial contamination and the attendant health implications associated with the use of microbial flocculants (MBFs) necessitate thorough evaluation. To address the challenges of high production costs and variable product quality, strategies such as waste valorization, strain improvement, process optimization, and biosafety evaluation are discussed. Moreover, the development of multifunctional MBF-based flocculants and their synergistic use with other treatment technologies are identified as emerging trends for enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for in-depth mechanistic studies, advanced characterization techniques, pilot-scale demonstrations to accelerate the industrial adoption of MBF, and moreover, integration with novel wastewater treatment processes, such as partial nitrification and the anammox process. This review is intended to inspire and guide further research and development efforts aimed at unlocking the full potential of MBFs as sustainable, high-performance, and cost-effective bioflocculants for addressing the escalating challenges in wastewater management and environmental conservation.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper starts from the negative emotion induced by AI and builds an influencing factor model of unmanned smart hotels (USH) resistance guided by feelings-as-information theory (FIT) and innovation resistance theory (IRT). Based on 355 questionnaires, the data are empirically tested. The results show that surveillance anxiety and delegation anxiety induced by AI positively impact functional barriers evaluation of USH, and functional barriers evaluation of USH has a positive impact on USH resistance. This paper enriches the research results in AI and USH by exploring the factors affecting USH resistance and providing suggestions for USH’s future development. </jats:p>",

Water quality index calculation methods, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis were applied. The results showed that the Groundwater Quality Index fluctuated at “Excellent”, accounting for 18.61 %; “Good” accounts for 38.05 %; “Poor” accounts for 20.55 %; the remaining “Very Poor” and “Inappropriate” account for 22.79 %. The most “inappropriateˮ part is in Ham Thuan, Phan Thiet. Some well sites are not suitable for water supply. In the coastal area of Phan Thiet, the average chloride content during the year is higher than the allowed standard. During 3 years of monitoring, in the dry season, the highest chloride content was 478 mg.L–1 at sites GWBT16, GWBT20, and 521 mg.L–1 at GWBT24. The results of the principal component correlation analysis of water quality in the X15 m aquifer show a tendency to be more severely affected by high tides during the rainy season.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The \"Make or Buy” decision and the supplier selection are critical steps for the efficient operation of companies' supply chains. Safety and security are paramount considerations, especially in industries like logistics, where supply chains are vulnerable to external threats and disruptions. In this scientific article, we present a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted supplier selection method that significantly enhances the safety and security of suppliers. During our research project, we have created an expert system and a corresponding knowledge base with the relevant rules to support supply chain decision-makers in selecting logistics service providers for warehousing services. The foundation of the AI-assisted supplier selection method is advanced data analytics and the application of expert systems, enabling companies to evaluate potential suppliers in detail from a safety and security perspective. The applied expert systems can identify potential risks and make predictions about supplier performance in the future. In the turbulent environment of the global supply chain, selecting long-term partners like warehousing services providers is critical for the success of the organization. A wrong supplier selection can hardly be reversed in warehousing services, as the cost of change is usually high. The article demonstrates the practical application of the expert system-assisted supplier selection method in a real-world supply chain environment and thoroughly analyzes the achieved results and advantages. The results show that the expert system-assisted method not only increases supplier safety and security but also contributes to improving the efficiency and sustainability of the supply chain. This article provides valuable guidance and solutions for companies looking to enhance their supplier selection using expert system technologies, thereby increasing the safety and security of their supply chains.</jats:p>",

Existing techniques still face challenges in both accuracy and efficiency when detecting malware in SSC. To meet this challenge, this paper introduces two novel models, named the Bayesian Optimization-based Support Vector Machine (BO-SVM) and the Long Short-Term Memory–BO-SVM (LSTM-BO-SVM). The BO-SVM model is constructed on an SVM foundation, with its hyperparameters optimized by Bayesian Optimization. To further enhance its accuracy and efficiency, the LSTM-BO-SVM model is proposed, building upon BO-SVM and employing LSTM networks for pre-classification. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets: the balanced ClaMP dataset and the unbalanced CICMalDroid-2020 dataset. The experimental results indicate that the BO-SVM model is superior to other models in terms of accuracy; the accuracy of the LSTM-BO-SVM model on the two datasets is 98.2% and 98.6%, respectively, which is 2.9% and 2.2% higher than that of the BO-SVM on these two datasets.</jats:p>"

El objetivo de este trabajo fue caracterizar la tipología de las UR en términos de la fuente de abastecimiento de agua y su tamaño. A diferencia de los distrito de riego (DR), las UR son autogestivas y abastecidas principalmente de aguas subterráneas, y han estado marginadas de la intervención del Estado, por lo que la información sobre el inventario de las UR es limitada. Existe una gran diferenciación de las UR según su fuente de abastecimiento, tamaño y localización. Las UR se encuentran muy dispersas y predominan las UR monousuario abastecidas por aguas subterráneas operadas por usuarios independientes con limitada solidaridad hídrica, lo cual dificulta su estudio, seguimiento y apoyo.</jats:p>"

This newly developed CPED technique can break down the barriers of the existing CPED technique with higher current density. In this report, ceramic coatings were successfully prepared on aluminum alloy via the BP-CPED technique in an aqueous carbamide-based electrolyte. Data recording results in the reacting process show that there is the current density of the cathode below 0.15 A/cm2 and that of the anode below 0.035 A/cm2, which approximately reaches the level of conventional MAO technique. Interestingly, the addition of PEG into the electrolyte can further reduce the current density and effectively improve the coating quality. The kinetic of the BP-CPED process was discussed based on the evolution of current density/voltage-time curves and spark discharge phenomena. SEM observations illustrate that BP-CPED coatings possess a typical porous-surface feature. XRD analysis indicates that the coating was mainly composed of Al2O3 and Al4C3. Al2O3/Al4C3/ZrO2 composite coatings fabricated after Zr-doping reflected the successful Zr-incorporation into the coating, which demonstrated that the BP-CPED technique can be used to design the coating composition by the doping modification. The direct pull-off and thermal shock tests confirmed that new BP-CPED coatings obtained under the cathodic plasma discharge have excellent bonding strength. It is possible that this novel BP-CPED technique can provide a promising choice in developing the large-area CPED surface treatment for the industrial application.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to solve the current pricing and coordination problems in the fresh produce supply chain by proposing a dynamic pricing and coordination differential game model based on traceability goodwill to optimize the operational efficiency and profitability of the supply chain. Freshness and traceability are critical consumer trust and brand value factors incorporated into the dynamic pricing and coordination model in the agricultural supply chain. The research methodology of this paper integrates critical factors such as supply chain cost and market demand to construct a comprehensive differential game model. It also highlights the motivation of dynamic pricing strategy and coordination mechanism based on traceability goodwill. Through traceability goodwill, operating companies can better assess and manage product quality and improve consumer trust in agricultural products, thus enhancing brand value. The dynamic pricing strategy based on traceability goodwill can flexibly adjust prices according to changes in the quality characteristics of agricultural products and market demand, realizing a dynamic balance between supply and demand. On the other hand, the mutual cost-sharing and coordination mechanism promotes the synergy between the various links of the supply chain. It improves overall efficiency through cooperation coo, coordination, and other means. The validity and reliability of the model are verified through numerical simulation experiments. The numerical simulation results show that the dynamic pricing and coordination model based on traceability will significantly improve supply chain efficiency and profitability compared with the traditional model. Specifically, the interests of supply chain participants are balanced, and the overall supply chain operational efficiency is improved. The main contribution of this study is to propose a dynamic pricing and coordination model based on traceability goodwill and verify its superiority through numerical simulation experiments. This study provides a valuable reference for fresh agricultural products supply chain management and offers new ideas for improving supply chain efficiency and profitability.</jats:p>",

        "A vital component of India&amp;#039;s rural economy, the livestock industry employs millions of marginal, small and landless farmers and substantially contributes to the country&amp;#039;s food supply. The cattle industry has shown resilience throughout time, continuously registering positive growth rates despite hardships like droughts. Small and marginal farmers mostly depend on cattle as a source of income, devoting a sizeable amount of their budget to animal husbandry. The economic surveys conducted in 2016–17 and 2017–18 emphasize how livestock contributes more to agricultural revenue overall, underscoring the sector&amp;#039;s expanding importance. Women are vital to the cattle industry and many of them are involved in dairy groups. A comprehensive strategy for enhancing the livelihoods of small and marginalized farmers, Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) encourages resource efficiency, food security and recycling of nutrients. IFS provide options for employment, revenue generation and sustainable production by combining field crops with farm animals. IFS improves environmental sustainability, profitability and productivity by managing resources well. Different models have been created to improve farm revenue and productivity in the context of dairy-based IFS. These models provide small farmers with a holistic solution by combining crop growing, hydroponics, vermicomposting and other related practices with dairy farming. to bolster the dairy-focused industry, steps need to be taken, including making loans to small farmers hassle-free, encouraging the use of sex-sorted semen technology, creating online marketplaces for bovine germplasm, applying genomic technology to breed improvement, and incorporating livestock into agricultural systems. The livestock industry is greatly aided by research and development, which focuses on topics including breed improvement, thermostable vaccinations, ethno-veterinary treatment and animal feeding plans unique to a certain location. India can increase agricultural production, guarantee food security and improve farmers&amp;#039; livelihoods in a sustainable way by focusing on dairy-based IFS development and provide the required assistance."
