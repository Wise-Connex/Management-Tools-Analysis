Throughout the history of urban centers, a sufficient water supply has been the backbone of each city. All sources of water, rivers, lakes, springs, underground sources, and rainwater collection, were exploited for urban supply starting from the earliest civilizations. The specific choice was dependent upon the civilization, the geomorphology, the topography, and the local climatic and hydrological conditions. No large-scale lifting techniques were available; thus, water was transferred from the source by aqueducts from a higher altitude. Cisterns used for collection of rain water and wells for drawing groundwater were very well developed since the Bronze Age. During historical times, Greeks and later Romans reached a high level of water supply technologies that greatly influenced modern achievements in water engineering and management.</jats:p>",

Some parts of these systems are still in use at present and prove the practical efficiency of Roman hydraulics in the principles acquired from the populations living in the different regions of the Empire. In Pompeii the urban water supply system stands as a clear example of the Roman planning of urban complex networks by using small water towers to serve a limited numbers of users. This allowed to control the derivations and their maintenance and operated a disconnection from the high pressure mains and the low pressure pipes, maintaining a fixed maximum height of water over the final points of discharge. Considering the techniques for pressure reduction as a method to control leakages, this paper examines the ancient Roman water supply system to deduce some applications to modern urban networks built in new housing establishments.</jats:p>",

A qualitative, case study approach is used utilizing multiple sources of evidence.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>It was found that in order to make online (communication) efforts more effective throughout the value chain, an inside‐out communication strategy is needed by the organization. Each level seems to have primary versus secondary stakeholders in terms of the access to and interaction with the web site level in which they are interacting. Overall, it was found that the deeper one went into the I‐E‐I framework, the more value that was created and that such value was both provided to and received from both the organization and the stakeholder.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The I‐E‐I framework developed in this study introduces a framework that can be tested empirically, discussed and debated in other settings and provide a springboard for more in‐depth studies on value creation in B2B web sites for both scholars and practitioners.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Some of them are dated even in the Minoan era. Many references about them have been recorded in numerous ancient Greek scripts. Despite that many related archaeological finds are dated in a wide chronological range, the typical mature ancient Greek lavatory was probably formed in the Hellenistic period, which was a period of a great evolution of the ancient Greek water technology. Lavatories are found not only in private houses but also in many public buildings and sanctuaries. The features of the typical ancient lavatory are the bench type seats with the keyhole shaped defecation openings and the ditch underneath them, which is associated with both water supply or flushing conduit and sewer. The lavatory was usually situated in the area of the building most convenient for water supply and sewerage. Later, the mature lavatory's layout was spread out all around the Roman Empire, acquiring more or less monumental appearance.</jats:p>",

These Mycenaean systems are compared with the remarkable underground water supply system at Troy uncovered by the recent excavations led by Manfred Korfmann, a structure which may date to the beginning of the 3rd millennium and which appears to be invoked among the deities of Wilusa (Troy) in the early-13th century treaty between Muwattalli II of Hatti and Alaksandu of Wilusa (and which may be a precursor of the famous Persian qanats).</jats:p>",

During the Middle Bronze Age a “cultural explosion”, unparalleled in the history of other ancient civilizations, occurred on the island of Crete. One of the salient characteristics of that cultural development was the architectural and hydraulic function of aqueducts used for water supply in “palaces” and cities. Usually aqueducts were collecting water from springs located apart from the settlements. The Minoan hydrologists and engineers were aware of some of the basic principles of what we call today principles and practices of water sciences with emphasis on the construction and operation of aqueducts. The description of selected Minoan aqueducts could justify that Minoans could be considered as pioneers in those technologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One might think that locations of settlements through history depended on the existence of a nearby permanent water source. Wåhlin thinks that anthropologists and geographers seem to have missed that people in settlements in many parts of the Middle East were able to create for themselves a near-permanent water supply in places where nature was not kind enough to place a river or a spring. Several sites in Jordan provide examples of these creations. Despite an arid to semi-arid climate, several civilizations have started and flourished in these conditions. This paper summarizes the types of systems that people have used through history to develop reliable water supplies in this part of the world. Jawa was a settlement in northern Jordan during the Bronze Age that built an extensive hydraulic system. At Um El Jimal, a city in northern Jordan during the Byzantine era, deflection dams, canals and reservoirs provided a local water supply. Neabateans excelled in water management using cut-stone reservoirs in their capital, Petra, and their empire flourished more than 2500 years ago in what is now southern and central Jordan. Underground cisterns found in Umayyad desert castles in different parts of the country reveal similar activities during the Islamic era. Examining how water resources were managed long ago can provide relevant information in facing the water-resources challenges of today in arid lands.</jats:p>",

A second aqueduct was constructed in 1,499–1,500 by the ruler Ahuizotl when the first aqueduct became inadequate. Although the Aztecs had no citywide drainage system, and much of the wastewater ended up in the lake surrounding the city, they had a system to handle human waste by means of privies in all public places and many private dwellings from which excrement was collected in canoes. The excrement was applied as fertilizer to chinampas (floating parcels of land) or sold in the market to be used for tanning animal hides. Urine was collected in pottery vessels to be used later as a mordant for dyeing cloth. The Tenochtitlán environment was obviously healthy for its time, especially in comparison to European cities. Public and personal hygiene contributed to minimize the incidence and severity of illnesses.</jats:p>",

To most of us, however, the society that stands out for its particular preoccupation and special widespread achievements in this field is the Roman Empire which actively demonstrated great interest for its cities and the providing for their everyday basic livelihood needs. The creation of most urban centres was combined with the construction of aqueducts, water supply and wastewater systems. During the Roman occupation period (200 BC–300 AD) of the Hellenic world, many cities within the region expanded and new urban centres were created. Substantial steps were taken to upgrade the urban landscape and to improve their living conditions. This was connected with water supply and wastewater systems, comprising aqueducts, water towers and underground pipe systems. The investigation of the criteria that determined engineers' design choices for aqueducts, methods and processes of construction, techniques and materials used - as these are revealed through the archaeological excavations and relics - testify to the environmental approach and the maintenance perception of the Roman period.</jats:p>",

As reflected in the literature, environmental awareness led to early water treatments and these are briefly described in this paper. Thus the period prior to 500 BC to 1000 AD saw the use of naturally occurring materials for water purification, the building of aqueducts, and the introduction of the distillation process. This was followed by a dormant period of five centuries in which hardly any progress was made in water purification methodology. From the 17th to the 19th century, progress was made on filtration processes and the introduction of the microscope. In addition chemical methods for water disinfection by the use of chlorine and ozone were reported. These methods and their combination progressed significantly through the 20th century. However the problems associated with chemical contamination of ground water, from which, drinking water is mainly generated remained practically ignored for about five decades. It was in the late seventies that this was brought to light. Since then technologies for groundwater purification started to emerge but a lot remains to be done in this area of research. The crucial role of suitable analytical tools for any technological development which aim to remove toxic pollutants from water is acknowledged. Thus the need of re-visiting old methodology making use of the advantages resulting from the availability of advanced analytical techniques and the possibility of enriching naturally occurring materials by the introduction of supramolecular receptors for water decontamination purposes are emphasized.</jats:p>",

Historically, it was not recognized that many of these “plagues” were waterborne. Advancements in medicine and microbiological sciences which identified and isolated the pathogens were needed before “safer” water could be achieved through advances in engineering. Disinfection of drinking water, introduced at the end of 19th century, considerably reduced the spread of cholera and typhoid fever. However, despite these innovations, waterborne disease epidemics continue even in the 20th century. We contend that this is partly because little attention has been paid to sewage practices and these are directly related to our health as the source of contamination, while much attention has been focused on drinking water. We propose that to achieve “safe water” and an improvement in global health worldwide in the 21st century, we must address wastewater problems learning from the past and we must use new advances such as molecular microbiology for pathogen discovery, and characterization and control of emerging and re-emerging waterborne diseases.</jats:p>",

The first equation to quantify the flow of water is attributed to Darcy. The next major development for unsaturated media was made by Buckingham in 1907. Buckingham quantified the energy state of soil water based on the thermodynamic potential energy. Buckingham then introduced the concept of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, a function of water content. The water flux as the product of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the total potential gradient has become the accepted Buckingham-Darcy law. Two decades later, Richards applied the continuity equation to Buckingham's equation and obtained a general partial differential equation describing water flow in unsaturated soils. For combined water and solute transport, it had been recognized since the latter half of the 19th century that salts and water do not move uniformly. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that scientists began to understand the complex processes of diffusion, dispersion, and convection and to develop mathematical formulations for solute transport. Knowledge on water flow and solute transport processes has expanded greatly since the early part of the 20th century to the present.</jats:p>",

Though modern irrigation practices in the Indus basin do not have to worry about the river shifting its course, a priority concern should be the basin's salt profile. Despite attempts to deal with the problem since the 1960 s, the net result is still an increasing salt balance which threatens the system's sustainability. This paper explores what it means to manage risk, and then applies these insights to a narrative history of the Indus basin. Particular focus is placed on the basin's current management since it will shape how irrigation is managed in the future. A key lesson to derive is that given the short-term nature of decision-making in the basin, any significant change has to address the political reality whereby politicians exert influence over water allocations in order to safeguard their political lives.</jats:p>",

An impressive infrastructure of desert routes and cisterns was developed to support those engaged in the protection of routes and their supply. Requisitioned animals from the Nile Valley provided the necessary labour. Finally, the transport of military supply is considered, both requisition of supplies and their transport.</jats:p>",

The unique phenomenon in the ancient Greek civilization is that technological needs triggered physical explanations of natural phenomena, thus enabling the foundation of philosophy and science.

This study begins with the Ionian philosophers in the seventh century BC, continues in classical Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, and advances and expands through the entire Greek world up to the end of Hellenistic period. Many of the theories developed by ancient Greeks are erroneous according to modern views. However, many elements in Greek exegeses of hydrometeorological processes, such as evaporation and condensation of vapour, creation of clouds, hail, snow and rainfall, and evolution of hydrological cycle, are impressive even today.</jats:p>",

A considerable feat of engineering and social management, they remain a most unusual attribute of a Minoan settlement, all the more so since the Myrtos river is/was available to supply water at the foot of the hill of Pyrgos. This paper presents these cisterns, briefly, in terms of geology and technology, the history of their use and re-use, and their relevance to understanding the culture and society (at local and regional levels) of Crete in the time of the Old Palaces, as well as their possible contribution to the political and military history of the period. I then review possible precursors of, and architectural parallels to, the Pyrgos cisterns at Knossos, Malia and Phaistos (none of which has been proved to be a cistern), and the later history of cisterns in Bronze Age Crete. Since only three others are known (at Archanes, Zakro and Tylissos, of Late Bronze Age date), the two cisterns of Myrtos-Pyrgos are an important addition to our still rudimentary knowledge of how the Bronze Age Cretans managed their water supplies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we consider a buyer who designs a product and owns the brand, yet outsources the production to a supplier. Both the buyer and the supplier incur quality-related costs, e.g., costs of customer goodwill and future market share loss by the buyer and warranty-related costs shared by both the buyer and the supplier whenever a nonconforming item is sold to a customer. Therefore, both parties have an incentive to invest in quality-improvement efforts. This paper explores the roles of different parties in a supply chain in quality improvement. We show that the buyer’s involvement can have a significant impact on the profits of both parties and of the supply chain as a whole, and he cannot cede the responsibility of quality improvement to the supplier in many cases. We also investigate how quality-improvement decisions interact with operational decisions such as the buyer’s order quantity and the supplier’s production lot size. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Teacher shortage in rural localities is a long-standing issue in New Zealand. This paper reports on an attempt to reduce the impact of shortages by redesigning the way preservice teacher education was delivered. Called the Mixed Media Programme (MMP), this is a primary (elementary) teacher education programme that was established in 1997 in New Zealand by the University of Waikato. It was initially introduced to rural areas of the North Island of New Zealand. It continues now as a viable and accessible flexible option for teacher education and is a significant means of ensuring better teacher supply in numerous rural areas. The programme uses a combination of face-to-face teaching; school based learning activities and electronic  communication. There is an annual intake of about 60 student teachers, most of who study at home in their local area. Now in its tenth year, the programme has produced more than 400 graduates, many of whom are still teaching in schools throughout New Zealand. This paper reports on a small-scale study, which sought to examine the way that student teachers, teachers and school principals from two communities perceive the programme and its effects on these communities. School principals, teachers, graduates and current student teachers were asked about the way that the programme has enabled people from local  ommunities to firstly study to become teachers in these communities and then to teach in them. Their views show that student teachers have found this approach to teacher education very beneficial to local communities for a number of reasons, including stable staffing for schools, commitment to teacher education programmes, confidence about the quality of the  raduates they employed. The student teachers reported that they were able to become teachers without having to leave their local communities, were exposed to university education as mature student teachers and that their study has had a range of effects on them and their families. It can be concluded from the evidence that the Mixed Media Programme has had important positive effects upon the two small communities of the study, at individual, school and wider community level. </jats:p>"

In this sense, the current paper is an anomaly in that the “artefact” motivating this historical review of the hydrological cycle was observed first in the classroom. More specifically, many years of teaching hydrology has highlighted the difficulty students often have in achieving a broad and deep understanding of hydrological processes. Several reasons could be proposed for the observed pedagogical difficulties, but what is of interest here is that a student's struggles are reminiscent of the historical ones relating to first deducing the hydrological cycle. Thus, a novel hypothesis is tentatively advanced: concepts that were tortuous or taxing to deduce historically often, and for quite similar reasons, are challenging to teach, and vice versa. While a comprehensive psychological exploration of this observation is beyond the scope of this article, a few broader connections are briefly explored.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A review of the current regulation and performance indicates wide variation with respect to reliability of supplies in the electricity systems in Europe. Can the variation in reliability of supply be explained by differences in regulatory frameworks and is it possible to draw any best practice lessons for the future? This paper provides a cross country analysis of reliability of supply performance and regulation in the Nordic electricity market. A correlation between service reliability regulation and reliability performance is observed in the Nordic region however the current evidence is not sufficient to identify best practice. The paper also provides evidence about the resource intensive nature of detailed regulation on the basis of data concerning costs of regulation in the Nordic market. An important limitation of the currently available cross country data related to reliability performance is variation in measurement practices. In the appendix we also provide a brief overview of the reliability metrics issues; information which in our opinion is not readily available in economic publications. </jats:p>",

The Serino aqueduct is not well known because there are no remains of spectacular bridges, but it was a masterpiece of engineering and one of the largest aqueduct systems in the whole Roman Empire. The Serino aqueduct was constructed during the Augustus period of the Roman Empire, probably between 33 and 12 BC when Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was curator aquarum in Rome, principally in order to refurnish the Roman fleet of Misenum and secondarily to supply water for the increasing demand of the important commercial harbour of Puteoli as well as drinking water for big cities such as Cumae and Neapolis. The main channel of the Serino aqueduct was approximately 96 km long, and had 7 main branches to towns along its trace such as Nola, Pompeii, Acerra, Herculaneum, Atella, Pausillipon, Nisida, Puteoli, Cumae and Baiae. Since the total length of all the branches was approximately 49 km, the Serino aqueduct complex had a length of around 145 km and therefore it should be considered the largest aqueduct system in the Roman world.</jats:p>",

There a network of underground channels and tanks, fictile water pipes and pools, at times connected to one another, was found. Many of them are still used today, given the low population growth and the lack of modern industrial development of this area and to its isolation, in spite of its proximity to Rome. Moreover the study area holds a votive stone dedicated to the Sabine-Roman goddess of water Vacuna, a multiform Sabine and Central-Italic goddess with many characteristics and functions, known also as Minerva-Bellona-Victoria, Feronia, Caerere, or as Angerona-Angitia.

Using dyadic data collected from a logistics services provider and 91 clients, findings show that the level of customization and real time information access has a direct positive impact on performance outcomes realized by both. Additionally, results demonstrate that provider's level of trust in the client positively influences their information exchange behavior, and in turn, information exchange behavior positively impacts client customizations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective – To examine the human resources environment in Canadian libraries in order to assess readiness to accommodate change and to identify opportunities for human resources planning. The “8Rs” of the study were defined as recruitment, retirement, retention, remuneration, repatriation, rejuvenation, re-accreditation, and restructuring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDesign – This study was undertaken in three phases over nearly three years through the use a variety of methods including literature review, analyses of existing data (Statistics Canada and library school graduate data), telephone interviews (with senior library administrators), focus groups (with representatives from Canadian Association of Research Libraries, Canadian Urban Libraries Council and Alberta Association of Library Technicians), print surveys (library institutions) and web-based surveys (of professional librarians and paraprofessional library staff).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSetting – Canadian libraries that are not component branches of a system, and that employ professional librarians.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubjects – Stage I:  17 senior library administrators participated in telephone interviews and three focus groups were conducted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStage II:  Surveyed library administrators representing institutions. A multi-stage stratified random sampling technique was used to ensure geographical representation from each of Canada’s provinces and territories. Full census participation was conducted for members of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries and the Canadian Urban Libraries Council. The print survey instrument was distributed to 1,357 subjects; 461 completed surveys were returned (response rate of 34% with results for the total sample accurate within plus or minus 3.8 per centage points, 95 times out of 100).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStage III:  Surveyed professional librarians and paraprofessional staff. Multi-stage random sampling was used to ensure representation of library staff from all library sectors and sufficient sub-sample sizes. Of the 12,472 individuals in the sampling frame, 8,626 were notified of their selection to participate in the web-based survey. Corrections were made to e-mail addresses and 7,569 e-mail invitations with the survey URL were sent successfully. Of the 8,626 potential respondents, 3,148 librarians and paraprofessionals participated (for a response rate of 37%). A non-random Canada-wide call for participation was distributed to library staff who had not been represented in the sampling frame via the listservs of 56 library associations. This provided an additional 1,545 respondents and the total sample size increased to 4,693 for a confidence interval of plus or minus 1.2%, 95 times out of 100. The non-random data from the Canada-wide call was kept in a separate dataset file.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMethods – Stage I began with a literature review and analysis of existing Statistics Canada and library school graduate data. Three focus group sessions with representatives from Canadian Association of Research Libraries, Canadian Urban Libraries Council and Alberta Association of Library Technicians were held and in-depth telephone interviews were conducted in May 2003 with 17 senior library administrators. Transcripts were thematically coded and summarised. The interview guide is available as Appendix E of the report. The results of Stage I were used to inform the design of the two survey instruments (Stages II and III). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStage II was a 17-page print survey informed by insights gathered in Stage I and was sent to library directors in the summer of 2003. The print mail-out of the institutional survey was sent to libraries that employed at least one librarian and were not a component branch of another system. A copy of the institutional survey is available as Appendix C of the report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStage III was a web-based survey of librarians and paraprofessional library staff undertaken in the summer of 2004 using random and non-random sampling methods. This survey was developed from insights gathered in Stages I and II. A copy of the individual survey is available as Appendix D of the report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain results – The analytical focus of the 275-page report is on the broad Canadian library sector. Data and analysis are provided by type of library, type of staff, and by geographical regions where sufficient response rates have allowed reporting. Although the role of the paraprofessional is examined in many sections of the report, the principal focus is on the professional librarian.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNine sections of the report present results, analysis and strategic human resource planning implications. Highlights for the broad Canadian library environment are briefly described below. Each section of the report provides further breakdown by library sector, type of position, career stage and other variables that provide significant insight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWorkplace Demographic Characteristics (Section C)&#x0D;\nThis section provides demographic information about those in supervisory or management roles (62% of librarians), union density (67% of librarians and 79% of paraprofessional staff), longevity in career, part-time employment, and gender, along with other characteristics. Results conclude that visible minorities and Aboriginal staff are under-represented across all types of libraries and that few libraries recognise the credentials of immigrant librarians.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecruitment to the Profession and to the Organization (Section D)&#x0D;\nPositive exposure to libraries and librarians is the best predictor of librarianship as a career choice and there were no significant differences in the original motivations for choosing the professional librarian career between new professionals and senior librarians. In response to the open-ended question about motivation for choosing librarianship, none of the librarian respondents (n=1,823) indicated leadership, managing libraries or supervising others as their reason (p. 52). Many respondents indicated reasons for choosing the profession that are in alignment with the values of librarianship, but few indicated reasons that reflect the real nature of the librarians’ role. The average age of new librarian recruits is 37 (with little variation between sectors).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThirty per cent of paraprofessionals are interested in pursuing an MLIS degree; 29 per cent are not interested because they are satisfied with their current role. The major barriers for paraprofessionals wishing to pursue the MLIS degree are inadequate or unrecognised credentials (21% - although 45% of paraprofessionals have an undergraduate degree), geographic distance (33%), lack of money (48%), and lack of time (49%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEighty per cent of libraries report that the major barrier to recruiting is budget constraints; other barriers include small size of library (60%), organizational hiring freeze (54%), inadequate librarian pay (54%), geographic location (52%), inadequate pool of qualified candidates (51%), and inadequate pool of interested candidates (50%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ten most important and difficult-to-fill competencies when recruiting varied significantly for each sector: leadership potential, ability to respond flexibly to change, and ability to handle high-volume workload were the three highest-ranked competencies across all libraries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRetirement (Section E)&#x0D;\nCanadian libraries experienced librarian retirements (11% of total current workforce) and paraprofessional retirements (7% of total current workforce) between 1997 and 2002. During this period, 79 per cent of librarians retired before age 65. Forty per cent of librarians over age 50 estimate that they will retire between 55 and 60. Only 9 per cent of libraries have a succession plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStaff Retention:  Inter- and Intra-organizational Mobility (Section F)&#x0D;\nLibrarians are satisfied with their work and stay in their organization because they like the job (85%), co-workers (84%), and workplace (79%). Seventy-seven per cent of senior librarians and 87% of senior paraprofessionals have been at their current library for more than 10 years. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSixty-nine per cent of librarians believe they are qualified to move to higher level positions, but 69% of institutions state that limited librarian turnover contributes to a lack of promotional opportunities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEducation (Section G)&#x0D;\nSeventy-five per cent library administrators agree that MLIS programs equip graduates with needed competencies, but 58% recommended that the programs provide more management, business and leadership training.  Seventy-six per cent of administrators believe that they have little or no input into curriculum content of MLIS programs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOverall evaluation of MLIS education by recent librarian entrants is not positive. Only forty-four per cent indicated that the program provided a realistic depiction of the job, while only 36% said the program provided a realistic expectation of work in their library sector. Recent librarian entrants (67%) were satisfied with the overall quality of their MLIS program, but few indicated that their program provided them with the necessary management skills (25%), leadership skills (20%), or business skills (12%) for their position. Recent library technician entrants were more satisfied (81%) with their programs’ success in providing general skills (87%), and providing a realistic depiction of the job (72%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuing Education (Section H)&#x0D;\nNew librarians (72%) need a significant amount of ongoing training, but only 56% believe that their institution provides sufficient training opportunities. Only 30% of libraries have a routine method for determining training needs of librarians and fewer (13 %) have an evaluation method for training outcomes. In most cases, about half of those who received training reported that it improved their job performance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuality of Work and Job Satisfaction (Section I)&#x0D;\nLibrarians and paraprofessionals are satisfied with their jobs (79% for each) and librarians (72%) and paraprofessionals (61%) agree that their salary is fair. Most libraries offer a wide range of benefits to their employees, including life insurance (95%), pension plan (92%), and medical benefits (88%). Librarians (80%) and paraprofessionals (70%) are satisfied with their benefits.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough a low percentage of librarians agreed that they have little job stress (24%) and only 39% found their workload to be manageable, 62% of librarians agree that their work allows work, family and personal life balance. The statistics are slightly more positive for paraprofessionals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere is a gap between the desire to be treated with respect (98% for all workers) and the perception that respect is conveyed (77% of librarians and 75% of paraprofessionals). A similar gap exists between desire to be involved in decision-making and actual involvement. The two most important factors for job satisfaction for all library workers are respectful treatment and a job that allows them to learn new skills and grow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerical Librarian Demand-Supply Match (Section J)&#x0D;\nLibraries hired more librarians than they lost in 2002, for a net three per cent increase. Many library administrators believe that there will be a five-year increased demand for librarians (77%) and paraprofessionals (81%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe short-term supply (next 5 years) of new librarians to replace departures due to retirements is predicted to have the capacity to fill 98 per cent of the current librarian positions; the capacity to replace library technicians is 99 per cent. The long-term supply (next 10 years) of new librarians to replace departures due to retirements is predicted to have the capacity to fill 89 per cent of the current librarian positions; the capacity to fill technician positions is identical. These predictions are based on no growth in the number of positions in the future.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMatch Between Organizational Job Function Demand and Individual Staff Supply of Skills, Abilities, Talents, Interests (Section K)&#x0D;\nLibraries report that increased use of information technologies (87%) and re-engineering (61%) have contributed the greatest change in the roles of librarians. Libraries report that more librarians have been required to perform a wider variety of tasks in the past five years (93%) and that this trend will continue over the coming five years (94%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA high percentage of libraries (86%) reported that over the past five years librarians have been expected to perform more management functions and 56% of mid-career and senior librarians believed this had occurred. Libraries (88%) believe that this trend will continue; only 44% of librarians indicate interest in performing management functions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMid-career and senior librarians report that job stress has increased over five years ago. Requirements to work harder (55%), perform more difficult tasks (56%), perform a wider variety of tasks (69%), and perform more managerial functions (56%) are the contributing factors. The performance of a wider variety of tasks and more difficult tasks was significantly related to the assessment by librarians that their jobs were more enjoyable, interesting, rewarding and challenging.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInstitutions (78%) reported the increased need for paraprofessionals to perform librarian tasks over the past five years and believe that this will continue (77%). Only 28% of paraprofessionals believe they are currently required to perform more librarian tasks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusion – The need to confirm the existence and magnitude of the crisis that will be created by upcoming retirements in Canadian libraries was a primary motivator for this study. Conclusive results were obtained that should inform each sector and geographic area in Canada. The percentages of staff over the age of 55 (librarians: 25%; paraprofessionals: 21%) is much greater than that of the Canadian workforce (11%). If there is no growth in the number of positions needed, there will be no short-term supply-demand crisis to fill the gaps left by retirements. There will be a librarian and technician shortage in ten years (a shortfall of 11% of the current supply) and a more significant crisis if the predicted growth in staffing is factored in. Recruitment to the librarian and technician professions is critical and the paraprofessional staff may be a potential pool of future MLIS candidates if the accessibility issues associated with the programs are addressed. Only nine per cent of organizations have a succession plan in place. There is great opportunity for the development of strategic solutions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn response to the open-ended question about motivation for choosing librarianship, no respondent indicated leadership, managing libraries or supervising others as their reason. This is of concern when 62% of librarians today work in a managerial role. Management and leadership skills are a significant concern for recent graduates, administrators, and librarians, with all indicating that the workplace needs are greater than the current preparedness. More cooperation with MLIS programs and professional associations is essential to ensure that leadership and management skill development are supported through the curricula and continuing education planning. Organizations must also develop and support a culture where leadership is encouraged and expected, and recognised.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere is a need for further development of continuing education opportunities, and training needs assessment and outcome assessment programs may be beneficial. Paraprofessionals and new librarians are less satisfied with the workplace training opportunities available to them than librarians in later stages of their careers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRole change will continue in libraries and planning will be essential to ensure that restructuring reflects the competencies that will be needed in the new mix. Workload and job stress appear to be rising and will require careful monitoring. There may be opportunity to define roles for “other” professionals in libraries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLibrary staff have a tendency to stay in their institution for much of their career, making decisions in the recruitment and hiring processes of critical importance. Loss of employees due to turnover is not a problem for most libraries, but the lack of turnover has affected the promotional opportunities for those who desire upward mobility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn interesting recommendation was made that two or more libraries may realise both cost savings and benefits through the sharing of staffing resources. If issues surrounding credentials can be addressed, there may be a potential pool of future immigrant librarians.</jats:p>"

A brief examination of a series of excreta and wastewater management systems from around the world and throughout history clearly shows that viewing faeces, urine and grey water as a worthless waste to be disposed of is only a modern concept, which ignores the realities of limited resource availability, and the obvious benefits to be had from closed-loop systems – as was clearly recognised in the past. While currently, expensive, technically complicated end-of-pipe sanitation systems dominate, several modern systems have been developed specifically to ensure an efficient resource recovery and reuse. Reconsidering and researching historical approaches to wastewater management and applying modern technologies to improve their functionality may contribute to the solution of many of today's sanitation and environmental problems.</jats:p>",

We show that bundling the two uncertainties leads a manager to underutilize a reliable source while over utilizing a cheaper but less reliable supplier. As in Dada et al. (working paper, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, 2003), we show that increasing quantity from a cheaper but less reliable source is an effective risk mitigation strategy if most of the supply risk growth comes from an increase in recurrent uncertainty. In contrast, we show that a firm should order more from a reliable source and less from a cheaper but less reliable source if most of the supply risk growth comes from an increase in disruption probability. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Each supplier can improve his performance by offering a return policy to the assembler while the best contract depends on that offered by the other supplier. We show that the non-cooperative contracts game between the firms has a unique and stable equilibrium in which the optimal return policies happen to fully coordinate the whole channel. Moreover, the suppliers still have the rights to negotiate with the assembler independently to share their profits properly. With such properties, the suppliers are encouraged to offer return policies to the assembler by following a simple rule derived from the favorable equilibrium, which will lead to a win-win-win situation. </jats:p>",

Demand for visits was calculated by applying age-, sex-, and time-from-diagnosis-visit rate data from the National Cancer Institute's analysis of the 1998 to 2002 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to the National Cancer Institute's cancer incidence and prevalence projections. The cancer incidence and prevalence projections were calculated by applying a 3-year average (2000–2002) of age- and sex-specific cancer rates from SEER to the US Census Bureau population projections released on March 2004.

Demand is expected to rise 48% between 2005 and 2020. The supply of services provided by oncologists during this time is expected to grow more slowly, approximately 14%, based on the current age distribution and practice patterns of oncologists and the number of oncology fellowship positions. This translates into a shortage of 9.4 to 15.0 million visits, or 2,550 to 4,080 oncologists—roughly one-quarter to one-third of the 2005 supply. The baseline projections do not include any alterations based on changes in practice patterns, service use, or cancer treatments. Various alternate scenarios were also developed to show how supply and demand might change under different assumptions. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> ASCO, policy makers, and the public have major challenges ahead of them to forestall likely shortages in the capacity to meet future demand for oncology services. A multifaceted strategy will be needed to ensure that Americans have access to oncology services in 2020, as no single action will fill the likely gap between supply and demand. Among the options to consider are increasing the number of oncology fellowship positions, increasing use of nonphysician clinicians, increasing the role of primary care physicians in the care of patients in remission, and redesigning service delivery. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

We assess reporting behaviour in the lending process for a sample of Russian companies in the years 1999–2004 and postulate that Russian companies manage their earnings in order to avoid showing losses when applying for bank financing. Once a credit has been granted, companies are predicted to manage earnings because of the bank's monitoring activities. By means of univariate and multivariate analysis we are able to attribute the discontinuity around a zero target in the earnings distribution with firms’ response to the banks’ assessment of accounting performance. This implies that financing considerations affect the reporting incentives of Russian companies.</jats:p>",

There are taste and odour (T&amp;O) problems in the finished water because the conventional treatment processes do not efficiently remove the T&amp;O compounds. This study evaluated T&amp;O removal by ozonation, granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment, powder activated carbon (PAC) and an advanced oxidation process in a pilot-scale treatment plant and bench-scale laboratory experiments. During T&amp;O episodes, PAC alone was not adequate, but as a pretreatment together with GAC it could be a useful option. The optimal range of ozone dose was 1 to 2 mg/L at a contact time of 10 min. However, with ozone alone it was difficult to meet the T&amp;O target of 3 TON and 15 ng/L of MIB or geosmin. The GAC adsorption capacity for DOC in the three GAC systems (F/A, GAC and O3 + GAC) at an EBCT of 14 min is mostly exhausted after 9 months. However, substantial TON removal continued for more than 2 years (&amp;gt;90,000 bed volumes). GAC was found to be effective for T&amp;O control and the main removal mechanisms were adsorption capacity and biodegradation.</jats:p>",

To the best of our knowledge this episode is the first time that this compound has been identified as an odour-causing compound in water. In a previous work the analytical method used for the identification of the compound causing the episode was described. The present work focuses its attention on how the episode was handled: action taken at the Sant Joan Despí water treatment plant and the sampling strategy on the river that led to the identification of the company responsible for the spill, a paper mill. It also deals with the role played by the FPA panel in the resolution of the episode: organoleptic description of samples of the problem in the initial phase of the episode (from the treatment plant, distribution network and customer complaints) and, once the compound responsible was identified, the determination of its organoleptic characteristics (odour threshold, odour descriptors, Weber-Fechner curve).</jats:p>",

In the context of the Millennium Development Goals, the global target of reducing the proportion of population without access to improved sources of water is expected to be met. A major contributor to success is India, where the proportion of population with access to water has increased from 68% in 1990 to 86% in 2002. However, micro-level evidence does not necessarily tally with the national picture of “tremendous progress.” This article attempts to probe deeper into access to water supply in India and draw important policy implications based on a brief institutional mapping of water supply, a critical analysis of national water policies, and a detailed case study of Chennai. This analysis highlights that issues of inequality, quality, and affordability are important in terms of access for the poor. An alternative entitlements-based indicator is proposed and some important challenges considered. </jats:p>",

Results support the proposition that firm satisfaction with alliance usage is positively associated with the proportion of exploration oriented agreements in a firm's relationship portfolio, especially for firms in environments characterized by low levels of environmental hostility. However, when environmental hostility is high, the proportion of exploitation oriented relationships in a firm's portfolio is positively associated with the firm's satisfaction with alliance usage.

The aim of this paper was to examine issues that affect the delivery of buprenorphine in the community setting. A cross‐sectional survey was conducted of 282 pharmacies participating in the methadone and buprenorphine programme across Victoria. Dispensing pharmacists completed the survey, designed to canvass issues around buprenorphine diversion and other issues related to the programme. Themes from the results indicated that there was concern from the majority of pharmacies with the issue of the supervision of buprenorphine and diversion of dispensed doses. The rate of suspected diversion was 1.5 times per 100 doses per month or 33 times per 100 clients per month. Seventy‐four per cent of pharmacists indicated that this was a negative aspect of buprenorphine treatment. Frequency of suspected and confirmed diversion was associated with the number of pharmacy clients. Pharmacists' perceptions of issues related to buprenorphine appeared to affect opinions of buprenorphine clients and the buprenorphine programme more generally.

Previous studies with nodulated alfalfa plants have shown that elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased the growth of plants grown under well‐watered or limited water supply conditions. The beneficial effects of atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment included higher photosynthetic rates, growth and water‐use efficiency and an increase in the root/shoot ratio. However, at the moment, we do not have information on the possible implications of the beneficial effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as it may relate to a higher capacity of the violaxanthin–antheraxanthin–zeaxanthin (VAZ) cycle, the dissipation of excess radiation as heat and the effect on photooxidation, and to an improved leaf antioxidant system (Halliwell–Asada cycle). The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of the interaction between CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (ambient, around 350 vs 700 μmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), temperature (ambient vs ambient + 4°C) and water availability (well irrigated vs partially irrigated) on the leaf antioxidant status of nodulated alfalfa during regrowth.

The beneficial effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment in well‐watered and limited water‐subjected plants were not associated with an increase in the capacity of alfalfa leaves to dissipate excess radiation as heat through the VAZ cycle or with an increase in the antioxidant capacity, measured in terms of Halliwell–Asada cycle enzymes and antioxidant compounds. Furthermore, elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> did not affect RGRs during the last 15 days of regrowth and reduced the activity of several antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase and ASA peroxidase in limited water‐subjected plants), suggesting a lower basal rate of oxygen activation and H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> formation, leading to a relaxation of the antioxidant system.</jats:p>",

Predicting the flow rates available from horizontal wells is an important step in evaluating the technology. A series of three-dimensional finite element models were developed to simulate a horizontal well located beneath a river and a parametric analysis of predicted flow as a function of pipe length, pipe diameter, depth below river bottom, and sediment hydraulic conductivity was conducted to determine optimum horizontal well configurations. The results indicated that the frictional head losses in the well screen have a significant impact on predicted withdrawal rates. Analysis of well length and pipe diameter indicates that for each specific well configuration there exists an optimum length, beyond which little increase in flow occurs. The simulations indicated maximum flows occur when horizontal wells are placed as deep as possible until they are within 0.5 to 2.5 m of an impermeable lower boundary.Key words: directional drilling, water supply, horizontal wells, river filtration. </jats:p>",

Molecular analysis of specific signatures showed that all TB cases reported in this study were caused by<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>and identified no<jats:italic>Mycobacterium bovis</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>Mycobacterium africanum</jats:italic>isolates. This result is unexpected, as<jats:italic>M. africanum</jats:italic>strains were reportedly the etiologic agent in 20% of TB cases 2 decades ago. The comparison of spoligotypes from Burkina Faso with an international spoligotype database (SpolDB4) showed that the majority of isolates belong to major clades of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>(Haarlem, 9%; Latin American-Mediterranean, 30%; and T, 20%). The predominant group of isolates (30%) corresponds to spoligotype 61, described in Cameroon as the “Cameroon family.” In Burkina Faso, as in Cameroon, this family could be associated with recent transmission of TB, suggesting a recent expansion in West Africa. Our data suggest a low level of primary drug resistance that may be a positive result of the Directly Observed Therapy Shortcourse program. Besides, based on spoligotyping plus MIRU-VNTR, data showed a high number of clusters in our sample, suggesting a high level of recent TB transmission in Burkina Faso. Nevertheless, an important genetic polymorphism was observed in this country, reflecting an endemicity situation where the control of TB would have less impact in the main towns.</jats:p>",

In vivo noninvasive imaging and immunofluorescence revealed the survival, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and incorporation of M‐PBMNCs into foci of vessel networks. More angioblasts were from blood cells after mobilization, and they also produced a number of antiapoptotic and proagniogenic factors that promoted angiogenesis in vivo. M‐PBMNCs and its conditioned medium augmented the vessel formation in matrigel plugs in vivo.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents the study of a starved hydrodynamic linear contact with a variable lubricant inlet layer. Variable lubricant films are likely to occur in piston rings-cylinder liner contacts. The lubricant layer is assumed to have a sinusoidal shape with a defined wavelength in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement. The contact is modelled in pure rolling. Two equally large zones can be defined: a severely starved central zone, around the minimum of the sine function, and a lightly starved zone, around the maxima of the sine function. This kind of inlet lubricant distribution affects the pressure and the lubricant distribution: after a passage, a part of the lubricant present in the lightly starved zone is transferred to the severely starved zone. An efficiency parameter ER of the lubricant reflow is defined. First, the results show the evolution of the lubricant reflow as a function of the operating conditions, i.e. speed, load and lubricant film thickness, and the wavelength of the lubricant distribution. Second, the number of passages necessary to reach complete lubricant redistribution is determined. Finally, a textured surface with a cross-hatched pattern is introduced. Such a surface reduces the number of passages necessary to reach the complete redistribution. The choice of an optimized surface pattern can reduce the risk of local contact failure because of local lack of lubricant. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>An optimized set of 24 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) loci, including a discriminatory subset of 15 loci, has recently been defined for the typing of<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>. Here, we evaluated the performances of this MIRU-VNTR typing system in combination with spoligotyping for the detection of transmission chains in a population-based study comprising 91% of culture-confirmed tuberculosis patients reported in 2003 in Hamburg, Germany. Of the 154 isolates investigated, more than 90% had high IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>copy numbers (≥6). IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing resulted in 13 clusters, 5 of which had a confirmed epidemiological link. All five, as well as six of the eight<jats:italic>IS6110</jats:italic>clusters with no identified epidemiological link, were perfectly matched by MIRU-VNTR typing with the 24 loci. Two IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>clusters were split by differences into 6 to 12 MIRU-VNTR loci, clearly supporting the absence of a link, as judged by contact tracing data. In contrast, only one MIRU-VNTR cluster, grouping what were probably epidemiologically unlinked isolates, was split by IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP. However, these isolates were also distinguished by spoligotyping. Both the optimized 24-locus and 15-locus sets thus showed a comparable to slightly better predictive value, especially when combined with spoligotyping, than the current gold standard IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>RFLP for the study of tuberculosis transmission in Hamburg. Because the epidemiological characteristics of this setting are similar to those of many developed countries, these results support the wide applicability of this real-time genotyping approach for population-based studies of<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>transmission.</jats:p>",

        "crops are ‘goods’ within the meaning of the CISG, even if, prior to delivery, they are still literally rooted to the ground. Furthermore, the goods may be solid or liquid. Generally, they can also be gaseous (see, however, the exclusion of elec-tricity, Art. 2(f) CISG). Still, there are a number of questions left open. In general, the CISG has been drafted for the sale of tangible goods; the terms ‘delivery’, ‘taking over’, ‘passing of risk in transitu’, etc. demonstrate this. In view of technological development, whereby more and more non-tangible products, such as computer software, are sold, it is important to decide whether these kinds of contracts fall within the scope of the CISG as well. Case law development can be observed, in particular, with regard to contracts for the supply of software. Please refer the following case excerpts in this respect. C1-2"
