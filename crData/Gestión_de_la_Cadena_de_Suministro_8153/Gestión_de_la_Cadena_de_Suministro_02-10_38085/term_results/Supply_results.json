      "abstract": "<jats:p>Foreign firms face many supply chain‐related difficulties in China. These include China’s overburdened, underdeveloped physical infrastructure; inexpert, underfunded state‐owned distribution companies; an enormous, fragmented distribution and logistics sector; and regional protectionism. Additionally, foreign firms face bureaucratic restrictions that prohibit them from legally importing, selling, and servicing products in a straightforward manner. Companies are looking to strengthen their supply chains in China in an effort to leverage the country’s cheap labor costs. This strengthening of the supply chain can be accomplished through three methods: the cluster approach; the use of non‐Chinese 3PLs; and the use of local carriers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A supply chain consists of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers, all linked together with a forward flow of material and backward flow of information. It encompasses all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw material extraction through end use. Supply chain management is the integration of critical aspects of strategy formulation, marketing, operations, and distribution. A critical aspect of supply chain management is the selection of an appropriate type of supply chain to achieve optimal performance. This paper classifies manufacturing supply chains into three types; namely, lean, agile, and hybrid. The characteristics of these supply chains are presented. It is proposed that the selection of an appropriate type of supply chain should be driven by the characteristic of product an organization is manufacturing. A model is then developed and implemented to assist organizations in supply chain selection.</jats:p>",

The so-called municipalisation of water supply — the purchase of private water companies by local authorities — began in earnest around mid-19th century and escalated as the century progressed. The experience of water supply in Bradford conforms to this pattern. At a time of water shortage, Many Wells Spring was identified as a copious source of supply that led the Bradford Water Company, provisionally formed in 1838, to concentrate on this single source. Water from the spring originated from the East Many Wells Farm owned by Edward Pickles and his family since the late 18th century. This chapter also discusses the Bradford Waterworks Act 1842, the incorporation of Bradford, the municipalisation of the Bradford water supply, and the role of Many Wells Spring in the water supply and consequently, the development of Bradford.</jats:p>",

In 1990 in Europe, the unemployment rate of workers aged 25 and less reached 31.5 per cent in Italy, 19.3 per cent in France, 32.3 per cent in Spain, 6.1 per cent in Sweden (in 1991), and 6.4 per cent in Germany (in 1989), whereas the rates of unemployment of workers aged 26 and older was, respectively, in these countries, 7.0, 7.8, 12.2, 2.0, and 6.9 per cent. Between 1963 and 1987 in the US, the relative wage of the male workers with 1-10 years of potential experience declined by 70 per cent with respect to the 26-35 years of experience, controlling for education and other characteristics (Juhn et al., 1993). In the UK, young male workers withdrew massively from the labour force. This evidence points out the fact that the youth problem in the labour market is two-fold, both in terms of low employment and in terms of low wages. Hereafter, by the denomination ‘youth employment problem’, I will refer to both aspects, which, combined, imply a downward trend to labour income of the young labour market participants.</jats:p>",

Though controversial at the time, today it is often invisible and taken for granted. This book explores why the common law, in contrast to civil law systems, developed in this way. During the industrial revolution, the town of Bradford in England, and with it the demand for water for industrial and domestic purposes, grew rapidly. The first part of the book explores, through an analysis of correspondence, records, and newspaper reports, the development of the Bradford water supply and the genesis of the dispute that ultimately flared into litigation at the end of the 19th century. Several aspects of the case are of enduring doctrinal importance 100 years on. The controversial and potent common law principle of interpreting statutes so as to protect property rights wherever possible is examined in depth, as is the legal uncertainty of subterranean water rights in the 19th century. The book also explains the common lawyers' refusal to recognise a continental-style doctrine of abuse of rights and the courts' failure to develop a prima facie tort doctrine to curb maliciously inspired behaviour.</jats:p>",

The dispute was finally resolved by the House of Lords in 1895, and the case — The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Bradford v Pickles (1895) AC 587 — has become a ‘leading’ one. It is important in legal terms for establishing that it is not unlawful for a property owner to exercise his or her property rights maliciously and to the detriment of others or the public interest. This is accepted by many as a bedrock principle of the common law, and, like bedrock, is often invisible and taken for granted. Both the litigation, which pit Edward Pickles as the property owner against the town of Bradford and its water supply, and its doctrinal significance are explored.</jats:p>",

Its competitive benefits include cost reductions and increased return on assets, and increased reliability and responsiveness to market needs. Recent advances in inter‐enterprise software and communication technologies, along with a growing use of strategic partnering and outsourcing relationships, has resulted in a confusing assortment of alternative information systems approaches for supporting collaborative SCM. This paper analyzes the alternatives and presents a framework for understanding the expected costs and benefits of each type of system. These costs include not only the total cost of ownership of the system, but also the partnership opportunity cost – the cost of being tied to a partner due to system inflexibility. The benefits of collaborative SCM include process, inventory, and product cost reductions as well as increased cycle times, service levels, and market intelligence.</jats:p>",

The judge viewed section 4 of the Bradford Waterworks Act of 1854 as the identical successor to section 233 of the original Bradford Waterworks Act of 1842, and interpreted that provision as preventing Pickles's appropriation of the underground water before it united into a defined stream or entered the Corporation's land. Pickles appealed the decision, arguing that North J. was wrong on the statutory interpretation point and right on the common law point that intention was irrelevant. The Corporation argued the converse, but this time the judges sided with Pickles. This chapter discusses the litigation, the elevation of the case to the House of Lords, the reaction of the press to the case, the financial strain caused by the litigation on Pickles, and whether Pickles was acting with malice in his dispute with Bradford over water supply.</jats:p>",

Such options allow hedging and valuation of supply curtailment risk, while explicitly accounting for the notification lead time before curtailment. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed instruments are priced under the traditional GBM price process assumption and under the more realistic assumption (for electricity markets) of a mean reverting price process with jumps.

The approach described places heavy emphasis on the need for interoperable, integrated, and cost‐effective business practices and capabilities within each individual organisation and across the supply as well as the value chains with respect to information technology. A reflection of the above approach will be realized by the efficient optimisation of the information supply chain and fractal company concepts which will in turn significantly affect the design and performance of the industry concerned (and particularly networked organisations).</jats:p>",

Being an important member of the supply chain, we propose that supply chains need to get closer to the end consumer ‐ forming collaborative relationships that center around demand planning. Developing subscription relationships with end consumers will lead to increased planning time, which will result in dramatic cost reductions and superior consumer value and satisfaction through lower costs, increased convenience, and improved availability of supply. Being a new and unique strategy, not all consumers will adopt subscription supply chains. However, we argue that some consumer segments will receive tremendous value and satisfaction purchasing certain types of products and services through subscriptions. Tremendous opportunities await those supply chains who target the right consumers, marketing the right products and services through a subscription supply chain.</jats:p>",

This may explain why the Bradford Water Company, and later the Corporation, did not secure rights to the continued flow of the water under East Many Wells Farm owned by Edward Pickles. The chapter also discusses the 19th-century development of water law in greater detail to put the decision in Pickles in a broader legal context. The absolute nature of the property right in underground water established in the case reverberates beyond the small corner of water law relating to appropriation of flowing underground water. The Bradford Waterworks Act 1842 is also considered, along with William Blackstone's treatment of water law and his conception of property, case law and literature between Blackstone and 1840, developments between the time of incorporation of the Bradford Waterworks in 1842 and the Pickles litigation in the 1890s, American law on water and property in the 19th century, legal category of subterranean water in a defined stream, pollution of percolating waters, and absolutism in property.</jats:p>",

Although the litigation concerned real property and water law, and possibly could have been confined to that sphere, its simple and memorable facts, together with the generalised statements of principle to be found in the judgments of several of their Lordships, have meant that it is usually taken as authority for the much wider proposition that abuse of rights is unknown to English law. This chapter examines what the common law turned away from, and why. It also discusses the doctrine of abuse of rights in French and Scots laws, equity and abuse of rights, and why an abuse of rights doctrine did not develop.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain management function is currently undergoing a dramatic change: it is adopting an increasingly strategic role. However, this growing financial importance is matched in only a handful of exemplary companies by a greater contribution to environmental protection initiatives in the supply chain. This paper explores some of the obstacles to greater supply chain management involvement in environmental protection and offers suggestions for greener supply. At a personal level, the gap between public opinion on the environment and managerial values needs to be closed, and the support offered by management education and by professional bodies needs to be improved. Within the organisation, the reward structure for supply chain managers needs to move away from narrow economic criteria. Greener supply would also benefit from a larger supply chain management role in corporate strategy making; the function could even be offered a seat on the Board of Management. Changes to the mode of supply chain management, including improvements to the information flow on environmental issues, the decision–making tools used in the face of complex environmental challenges and novel approaches to supply chain management need to receive urgent attention.</jats:p>",

The concept of internal relationship marketing is employed and a model is proposed to aid companies in identifying the variables associated with marketing to the internal customer. The motor carrier industry provides an appropriate service setting for the analysis, and implications for retaining the very best customer‐conscious frontline employees are outlined.</jats:p>",

Delivery sizes decrease as a result of more deliveries directly to the point of use. Customers are demanding products and deliveries customised to their specific needs.

This article analyses the opportunities of wireless product identification technology in transforming supply chain management. A new concept of item level supply chain management and enabling steps to achieve the benefits are proposed. Innovative companies already use wireless product identification with great benefits in specific functional areas, e.g. manufacturing and warehousing. However, the biggest potential is in supply chain wide solutions, i.e. item level supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The Corporation took its stand against Pickles on the statute first, seeking an injunction in respect of the alleged breach of statutory duty by Pickles. The case illustrates the potency of the common law principle that whenever possible, statutes will be interpreted by the courts to protect the property interests of individuals. This chapter considers the structure and content of the Bradford Waterworks Act 1842 and its successors in order to place the key provision (section 49) in context. The differing approaches of the judges to the interpretation of section 49 are then summarised, and some comments are presented regarding what the litigation illustrates about statutory interpretation and the common law mindset.</jats:p>",

The response of bedrock channel networks to repeated footwall uplift events leads to increasing sediment supply over tens of thousands of years as the networks initiate and then expand, followed by relatively constant sediment supply as the stream networks reach their maximum spatial extent. The distinct time lag between the onset of tectonic activity and attainment of maximum sediment supply leads to stratigraphies that are initially aggradational and then progradational. Much of the variation in sediment supply is the product of the complex response and reorganization of the stream networks to faulting‐related perturbations and is not directly related to specific faulting events. Increasing fault displacement drives the system toward a new steady state with a higher sediment supply but is initially expressed as a retrogradation as sediment supply lags behind increased displacement. The converse is true for a decrease in fault displacement, which is initially expressed as progradation. Continual stochastic variation in recurrence interval leads to a system that does not achieve a steady state and as a result exhibits continual variation in sediment supply. The model results emphasize the local tectonic controls on stratigraphic architectures developed within extensional basins and the complex manner in which stream network growth and response to tectonic activity can be expressed in the stratigraphic record.</jats:p>",

Compared with other Se‐containing proteins, the addition of purified selenoprotein P to the selenoprotein P‐depleted serum or a serum‐free medium was the most effective for the recovery of cellular glutathione peroxidase activity (index of Se status). These results suggest that selenoprotein P functions as a Se‐supply protein, delivering Se to the cells.</jats:p>",

A gradient power supply is presented that is capable of pulsing a custom built triaxial microcoil gradient system to an excess of 15 T/m (and as high as 50 T/m), representing pulsed currents in excess of 150 A into loads of ∼200 mΩ (gradient coil plus cables). The gradient power supply is switchable (from positive to negative gradient fields) within a time of ∼10 μs. An H‐bridge design, consisting of four metal‐oxide semiconductor field‐effect transistors (MOSFETs), is used for changing both the current and magnetic field gradient directions. In series with the H bridge is an additional MOSFET that is optimized to be a voltage‐controlled (adjustable) resistor to send the current through the gradient coils. Because MOSFETS require special driving circuits to overcome parasitic capacitances, the MOSFET fundamental design parameters are also presented to complete the circuit schematics. The gradient power supply presented allows for the high gradient fields required for microcoil MRI of small samples. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Edward Pickles's father and grandfather exploited the coal and stone under their land. A constant refrain of Edward Pickles and his solicitor in the long-running dispute with the Corporation was that all Pickles wanted to do was to work [his] stone and minerals as an ordinary landowner. Pickles claimed that there was valuable flagstone underneath his property close to the boundary with the Corporation's waterworks. There was considerable demand at the time for flagstone for street improvements. This chapter looks at the events that led to the water dispute between Bradford and Edward Pickles, triggered by Pickles's decision to dig a tunnel past his East Many Wells Farm.</jats:p>",

Precipitation is interpolated from gauges; evaporation is taken as the difference between precipitation and runoff, with the latter determined from basin discharge measurements and a simple storage‐delay model; and radiation is based on a recent analysis in which 8 years of satellite observations were assimilated into radiative transfer models. Objective estimates of precipitation errors are considered; results suggest that past estimates of ν may have been biased by systematic errors in estimates of precipitation. Under the assumption that the semiempirical relation applies also to annual values, long‐term mean observations are sufficient to predict the sensitivity of annual runoff to fluctuations in precipitation or net radiation. Additionally, an apparent sensitivity of runoff to precipitation can be inferred from the observations by linear regression. This apparent sensitivity is generally in good agreement with the predicted sensitivity. In particular, the apparent sensitivity increases with decreasing basin <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/wrcr9170-math-0003.gif\" xlink:title=\"equation image\" />/<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/wrcr9170-math-0002.gif\" xlink:title=\"equation image\" />; however, slightly excessive apparent sensitivity (relative to the prediction) is found in humid basins of the middle latitudes. This finding suggests a negative correlation between precipitation and net radiation: the increase in runoff caused by a positive precipitation anomaly is amplified by an accompanying decrease in surface net radiation, possibly induced by increased cloud cover. The inferred sensitivity of radiation (water flux equivalent) to precipitation is on the order of −0.1. Such a value is supported by independent direct analysis of annual precipitation and radiation data. The fraction of interannual variance in runoff explained by the annual precipitation anomaly (including any correlative influence of net radiation) varies systematically with climatic aridity, approaching unity in humid basins and falling to 40–80% in very arid basins. We conclude that the influence of seasonality of the precipitation anomaly on annual runoff is negligible under humid conditions, though it may be significant under arid conditions.</jats:p>",

However, the same technological advancements are changing the marketplace and providing an impetus for changes in strategic alliance and partnership structures. Successful leaders of the future will have to understand how to operate in the new marketplace and within the evolving organizational structures where alliances and partnerships are changing. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the current and future organizational structures in the logistics industry. Toward that end, traditional supply chain management (SCM), electronic supply chain management (eSCM), and the resulting impact on strategic alliances and partnerships will be explored. Additionally, considering the inherent ability of the eSC to be dynamic and adaptable, the new type of leader that is likely to be most successful in this new structure is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Spruce Budworm Decision Support System (SBW DSS) was used to estimate potential volume losses to a future spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) outbreak in New Brunswick. The SBW DSS was implemented separately on each of the ten Crown Timber Licenses, using data from forest industry management plan timber yields and harvest schedules; values were then compiled for all of New Brunswick. Potential volume losses on privately owned forest (industrial freehold and private woodlots) were estimated by matching stand types with those for Crown land. Total potential volume losses of 83 million and 195 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of sprucefir (Picea spp.  Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) were predicted for \"normal\" and \"severe\" budworm outbreak scenarios, defined based on past outbreaks in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and assumed to start in 2000. Simulated timber supply losses were 42 million, 40 mil-lion, and 1 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> on Crown, freehold, and federal land, respectively, under a normal outbreak scenario, versus 99 million, 92 million, and 3 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> under a severe outbreak scenario. On Crown land, 33% of the predicted loss in a severe outbreak occurred in stands scheduled for harvest over the next 30 years, 26% occurred in stands not scheduled for harvest for at least 30 years, and 41% was in the non-timber harvesting landbase (11% in Old Softwood Forest Habitat, 12% in Deer Wintering Areas, 14% in riparian buffers, and 3% in inaccessible areas). Harvest levels 1120 years in the future were very sensitive to reduction in yields caused by defoliation. Under a severe outbreak scenario, if 40% of the landbase was not protected for 2, 5, or 8 years to limit defoliation (simulating spraying the insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis, B.t.), 20072011 harvest level reductions of 4.0, 6.0, and 8.4 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> , respectively, would be necessary. We conclude that the only way that planned harvest levels for New Brunswick can be maintained, under a future spruce budworm outbreak, is with effective targeted use of insecticides for forest protection.

The total banana protein content rapidly increases during the first 60 to 70 d, but remains constant for the rest of fruit formation/ripening. During the phase of rapid protein accumulation, an inactive homolog of class III chitinases accounts for up to 40% (w/v) of the total protein. Concomitant with the arrest of net protein accumulation, the chitinase-related protein (CRP) progressively decreases and several novel proteins appear in the electropherograms. Hence, CRP behaves as a fruit-specific vegetative storage protein that accumulates during early fruit formation and serves as a source of amino acids for the synthesis of ripening-associated proteins. Analyses of individual proteins revealed that a thaumatin-like protein, a β-1,3-glucanase, a class I chitinase, and a mannose-binding lectin are the most abundant ripening-associated proteins. Because during the ripening of prematurely harvested bananas, similar changes take place as in the in situ ripening bananas, CRP present in immature fruits is a sufficient source of amino acids for a quasi-normal synthesis of ripening-associated proteins. However, it is evident that the conversion of CRP in ripening-associated proteins takes place at an accelerated rate, especially when climacteric ripening is induced by ethylene. The present report also includes a discussion of the accumulation of the major banana allergens and the identification of suitable promoters for the production of vaccines in transgenic bananas.</jats:p>",

The leaf/fruit ratio and girdling of the shoots on both sides of the fruit pedicel were used to manipulate the assimilate supply. Irrigation intensity was used to manipulate the water supply. There was a positive relationship between assimilate or water supply and fruit growth. The responses of organic acids to assimilate supply were different with fruit development. At the beginning of growth, fruits with high leaf/fruit ratio had lower malate and higher citrate concentration. Near maturity, greater assimilate supply is related to high malate and low citrate concentration. High leaf/fruit ratio increased quinic acid concentration at the beginning of growth. With development, quinic acid concentration in fruits with more assimilate supply decreased more. Shikimic acid concentration fluctuated differently with fruit development in the four years and was generally lower in fruits with more leaves. Irrigation tended to reduce acid concentrations but did not affect the seasonal patterns of the different acids. There were no interactions between tree irrigation and leaf/fruit ratio.</jats:p><jats:p>© 2002 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",
