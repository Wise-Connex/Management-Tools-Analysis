      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Several recent developments have led to significant changes in the way new products are developed. The emphasis on core competency has resulted in having many companies discard their manufacturing capability, and hence becoming dependent on outside manufacturing suppliers. At the same time, the cost of acquiring expensive modern manufacturing equipment has become prohibitive, and the pace of new manufacturing technology has quickened, making companies reluctant to invest in their manufacturing plants lest they become obsolete in a short time. In addition, the advent of global competition for quality and cost has increased the need for new product design teams to incorporate early manufacturing feedback into the design of the products. The confluence of these issues have led to a set of unique problems and trends in modern industry. Manufacturing has become a worldwide commodity through the growth of contract manufacturing companies, which supply product companies with manufacturing expertise and capability. The companies’ relationships with product design teams is much more formal and subject to a contractual bidding process, without the benefits of detailed designs that can be bid on.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper addresses the conflicting issues raised above by identifying the changes required to the traditional methods of new product development and proposing a set of tools and metrics to address issues of manufacturing supplier selection, communications, cost, quality and capability in the new product development cycle. Methodologies and tools discussed in this paper include the modification of the product development process to include the contractors’ role in the timely execution of the project plans, the necessary identification of cost and quality for each manufacturing technology as well as volume level, and the clear understanding of the tradeoffs involved in the design and manufacturing process selection. In addition, the paper explores the issues of reduced manufacturing expertise within the parent company. As manufacturing becomes a world wide commodity, a good understanding of these issues is very important to the future survival of the manufacturing contracting enterprise. Contract manufacturers need to balance their investments in maintaining the technological edge in the manufacturing process, successfully bidding on their customers new products and clearly identifying their capabilities and levels of capacity, costs and quality without the risk of exposing their future strategy.</jats:p>",

One benefit is reduction in operation and maintenance expenses, because less pumping energy and fewer chemicals are used in the acquisition, treatment, and disposal of water. Another benefit is the deferral or downsizing of capital facilities. Comparing current supply with projected demand aids in the identification of future needs for demand management or increased supply. In addition to cost factors, nonmonetary factors, including environmental effects, should be considered. In this article, case studies from Texas, California, Idaho, and New Zealand illustrate this balancing process.</jats:bold></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Stochastic modeling of harvesting behavior provides the structural insight to investigate when harvesting events will occur or how many such events will occur within a certain period of time. In this paper, a new stochastic model to predict harvesting behavior is proposed. This is derived from a generalization of Gentan probability theory, which was introduced in the early 1960s in Japan. Prediction of harvesting behavior is carried out by searching for felling probabilities of forest stands over different age-classes, where the tree diameter is assumed to be the only factor to affect a forest owners' harvesting decision. The proposed model is constructed to take a nonstationary growth function into account. Using a nonstationary growth function, the proposed stochastic model can become flexible enough to incorporate not only the tree diameter growth, but also forest stand volume growth and the present net worth growth to predict forest owners' harvesting behavior. Computational experiments show that incorporating a more realistic tree diameter growth process into the proposed stochastic model leads to lower felling probabilities and a longer harvesting time horizon. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The US auto industry has undergone tremendous changes during the past decade. Companies have increased their level of out‐sourcing and are relying more heavily on their supply chain as a source of their competitive advantage. Thus, determining which suppliers to include in the supplier chain has become a key strategic consideration. However, previous studies of supplier selection have not considered a company's position in the supply chain. In this paper, we compare supplier‐selection practices based on a survey of companies at different levels in the auto industry. Our findings rebut the common thinking that indirect suppliers who are more involved in commodity purchasing emphasize initial price and de‐emphasize relational considerations. We learned that selecting suppliers based on the potential for a cooperative, long‐term relationship is just as important to direct and indirect suppliers as it is to the auto assemblers. We also learned that price is one of the least important selection items, regardless of position on the supply chain. Further, contrary to the existing understanding that quality and delivery are separate constructs, they formed a single construct in our study. To summarize the empirical results, no differences among the auto assemblers, direct suppliers, and indirect suppliers were found for the importance placed on consistency (quality and delivery), reliability, relationship, flexibility, price, and service. Statistically significant differences were found between the auto assemblers and indirect suppliers on the importance placed on technological capability and financial issues.</jats:p>",

In contrast with the ideal ALE process, no saturation of the growth rate was observed with increasing TMA pulse time. In addition, with fixed pulse times the growth rate was strongly temperature dependent. These observations were interpreted in terms of a self‐decomposition of TMA. Despite the absence of self‐limitation, the films were uniform and showed good structural quality. The deposition temperatures were remarkably low, 325–425°C, compared with CVD processes employing the same precursors. Time‐of‐flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF‐ERDA) and nuclear resonance broadening (NRB) measurements indicated that the films contained hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen impurities.</jats:p>",
