      "abstract": "<jats:p> World supplies of industrial wood on a sustainable basis are estimated to be adequate to meet future demand to the year 2000 without effecting real price changes. A degree of uncertainty with respect to supply appears around 2025 by reason of demographic pressures on the indigenous (largely tropical) forests in many of the developing countries in the southern hemispere.Emerging global trends for the supply of and demand for industrial roundwood suggest a shift in the production, consumption and trade in forest products. Such a shift is predicated on a number of supply and demand factors. The key demand factor is the slowing down of population and economic growth in the developed countries accompanied by a greater application of technology in wood processing and/or new products. The key supply factor is the rate of establishment of plantation of fast-growing species in the tropical and sub-tropical regions.The notion of scarcity, as manifest in the forester's vision of increased timber production goals, will have to be tempered with the reality that market prices in real terms for the major categories of forest products have not materially increased and are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future.These potential developments suggest that Canada's comparative advantage based on old-growth stocks of timber will be diminished and future gains in trade will for the most part be based on new products/processes that in turn will call for a more dynamic approach to market development than that characterized by passive exploitation of a fortuitous endowment of natural resources. </jats:p>",

A broad overview of global timber supply is presented together with an overview of likely future sources. The discussion covers both regions of supply as well as the nature of the forest resource — old growth, second growth, and plantation forest. Within this broad perspective some long-term trends and tendencies are identified. The growing role of plantation and intensively managed forestry is discussed. Canada's strengths and liabilities as a forest resource supplier are discussed within this context. It is argued that Canada cannot compete successfully with semi-tropical regions in intensive forest management. Rather, Canada appears to have the features necessary to compete in world wood markets using a strategy of extensive forestry that takes advantage of Canada's vast forest land areas. </jats:p>",

However, a subsequent socio‐economic survey found that the village often lacked the financial resources needed to maintain and repair the water works which were to be installed. It was decided therefore to expand the programme to include assistance to the village for the establishment of community development enterprises, the profit of which would provide the funds needed to maintain the village water works. On the implementation of this programme, women became the major participants in the community development enterprises. This paper discusses the institutional structure of those community development enterprises (called ‘Lucrative Micro‐Projects’) and the role that women have played in them. The ‘Lucrative Micro‐Projects’ have been so successful that they have become a means of furthering social and economic development at the village level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The relationship between gluconeogenic precursor supply and glucose production has been investigated in 14-h and 86-h fasted humans. In protocols 1 and 2 [6,6-2H]glucose and [15N2]urea were infused to measure glucose and urea production rates (Ra) in response to infusions of glycerol and alanine. In protocol 3 first [15N]alanine, [3-13C]lactate, and [6,6-2H]glucose were infused before and during administration of dichloroacetate (DCA) to determine the response of glucose Ra to decreased fluxes of pyruvate, alanine, and lactate, then alanine was infused with DCA and glucose Ra measured. After a 14-h fast, neither alanine nor glycerol increased glucose Ra. Basal glucose Ra decreased by one-third after 86 h of fasting, yet glycerol and alanine infusions had no effect on glucose Ra. Glycerol always reduced urea Ra (P less than 0.05), suggesting that glycerol competitively inhibited gluconeogenesis from amino acids. DCA decreased the fluxes of pyruvate, alanine (P less than 0.01), and glucose Ra (P less than 0.01), which was prevented by alanine infusion. These findings suggest that 1) the reduction in glucose Ra after an 86-h fast is not because of a shortage of gluconeogenic substrate; 2) nonetheless, the importance of precursor supply to maintain basal glucose Ra is confirmed by the response to DCA; 3) an excess of one gluconeogenic substrate inhibits gluconeogenesis from others.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> The objective is to develop techniques to evaluate how changes in basic data networks can improve accuracy of water supply forecasts for mountainous areas. The approach used was to first quantify how additional data would improve our knowledge of winter precipitation, and second to estimate how this knowledge translates, quantitatively, into improvement in forecast accuracy. A software system called DATANET was developed to analyze each specific gage network alternative. This system sets up a fine mesh of grid points over the basin. The long‐term winter mean precipitation at each grid point is estimated using a simple atmospheric model of the orographic precipitation process. The mean runoff at each grid point is computed from the long‐term mean precipitation estimate. The basic runoff model is calibrated to produce the observed long‐term runoff. The error analysis is accomplished by comparing the error in forecasts based on the best possible estimate of precipitation using all available data with the error in the forecasts based on the best possible estimate of winter precipitation using only the gaged data. Different data network configurations of gage sites can be compared in terms of forecast errors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In laboratory tanks with bream (Abramis brama), perch (Perca fluviatilis), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen increased with time. Phosphorus was mainly released as soluble molybdate-reactive phosphorus (SRP); nitrogen almost exclusively as ammonium. The release increased with the species' tendency to forage on littoral sediments and with a smaller fish size. Bioassays with the test algae Selenastrum capricornutum showed that released phosphorus was readily available to algal growth. The total supply of phosphorus to the epilimnion of Lake Gjersjøen was calculated from the external supply from the tributaries and the estimated phosphorus release from total roach biomass. From May to October 1980 phosphorus release from the roach population contributed about the same order of magnitude as the total phosphorus loading from the watershed. During the period with the most serious phosphorus depletion to the phytoplankton (July, August, and September), the phosphorus supply from fish was about double that of the external phosphorus supply, confirming the important role of sediment-feeding fish populations in the eutrophication processes of lakes. </jats:p>",
