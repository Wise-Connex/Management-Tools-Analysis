Supplies are drawn from natural catchment areas in sand dunes, from the Rhine River, and from surface lakes as well as from groundwater. The dune‐water source is recharged with pretreated surface water before it is treated to potable quality for distribution. Industrial water, which is not of drinking water quality, is delivered separately to steel mills, paper mills, and an oil refinery. The pollution of the Rhine River concerns water suppliers in cities, such as Amsterdam, that are located across international boundaries from the sources of pollution. The author gives an overview of the sources of water supply, the treatment processes, and the distribution system that serve the capital city of the Netherlands.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this gross anatomic investigation was to determine the CMN's blood supply so that a structural base can be used to interpret studies of the bronchial circulation's role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema. In ten sheep, we cannulated the bronchoesophageal artery at its origin from the aorta and injected Microfil. This artery, which branches into cranial and caudal divisions 2–4 mm distal to its origin, supplied the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, and visceral pleura. The CMN is supplied by the caudal division, as it courses between the CMN and aorta. Microfil injected through the thoracic aorta did not enter the CMN when the bronchoesophageal artery was ligated at its origin. These results indicate that only the bronchoesophageal artery supplies the CMN. In eight sheep we cannulated the vein at the head of the CMN (dorsal mediastinal vein) and injected Microfil, both peripherally and centrally. Peripherally, injected veins reached the CMN and esophagus. The dorsal mediastinal vein extended posteriorly to the CMN in three of the eight sheep, eventually emptying into the left azygos vein near the diaphragm. Centrally, the dorsal mediastinal vein joined the left azygos vein near the heart in six of the eight sheep, including the three in which the dorsal mediastinal vein extended posteriorly to the CMN. In the remaining two sheep the dorsal mediastinal vein drained centrally into the right azygos vein. We conclude that the bronchoesophageal artery supplies the CMN and that either the left or right azygos vein drains it.</jats:p>",

In addition, the snow also serves as the support media for any structural foundations and hence the thermal aspects of water supply and waste disposal can be critical. Most activity has occurred on the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica and has ranged from small transient field parties to large permanent facilities in continuous use for over 25 years. Novel procedures to insure the reliable production of good quality water are described as well as the recommended criteria for water quantity depending on the size and duration of the activity. The various methods of wastewater disposal that have been used at temporary camps and permanent stations are described along with the results from studies that defined the fate of the wastewater following its discharge to the snow. Such definition is important to insure protection of the water supply as well as the thermal integrity of any structural foundation. Key words: water supply, water quality, sewage waste disposal, ice cap, glaciers, snowfields. </jats:p>",

Partial denervation of the amputated pectoral fins, i.e., resection of one or two of the three nerves of the brachial (= pectoral) plexus revealed that the presence of a single one allows the amputated fin to regenerate. From these data and others obtained previously, it is concluded that the nervous requirements for a teleost fin to regenerate are similar or slightly lower than those for tetrapods, for example in the newt, which are capable of appendage regeneration.</jats:p>",

Dietary guidelines have been published setting out changes to the nutritional content of the diet. Foods reach the consumer as a result of a complex system involving primary production, basic processing, manufacture, retailing and catering. Achievement of the guidelines can be facilitated or hampered by action taken at each of these stages. The author illustrates this by examples taken from each stage citing instances of good practice and areas with potential for improvement. However, the paper points out that the best efforts of those supplying foods can be undermined by inappropriate action by consumers and concludes that a concerted effort to implement dietary guidelines must involve everyone concerned with the supply and consumption of food with the support of various government agencies.</jats:p>",
