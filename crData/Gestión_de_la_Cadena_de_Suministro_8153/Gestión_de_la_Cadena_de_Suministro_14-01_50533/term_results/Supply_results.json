      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern business scenario Supply chain has become the back bone for every business organization. All supply chain partners are joined together in value delivery network of company that no one can perform better without support of other. The ultimate objective of this cohesive relationship is to deliver value to customers and gets desired state of customer satisfaction &amp; loyalty for the organization. For this purpose it is necessary to integrate the internal and external partners of Supply chain at different levels. The Purpose of the paper is to investigate the impact of supply chain integration on supply chain performance. The construct of Supply chain integration has been divided into three derivers that are information integration, coordination resource sharing and organizational relationship linkage. There are certain barriers to integration found in each industry that have moderating effects on the relationship b/w integration and organization performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last two decades, the topic of sustainability has moved from the fringes of supply chain management research to the mainstream and is now an area of significant research activity. In this paper, we argue that while this increase in acceptance and activity is welcome and has lead to a greater understanding of sustainability, our present knowledge is not sufficient to create truly sustainable supply chains. We build on this insight to identify five main issues that future research needs to address. We argue that when it comes to the theory of sustainable supply chain management, previous research has focused on the synergistic and familiar while overlooking trade‐offs and radical innovation. These theoretical issues are compounded by measures that do not truly capture a supply chain's impacts and methods that are better at looking backwards than forwards. The paper concludes by proposing a series of recommendations that address these issues to help in the development of truly sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its introduction over three decades ago, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has undergone numerous transformations. Today it is a prevailing theme in scholarly and popular research, and numerous disparate disciplines claim its ownership. Despite the field's evolution there continues to be little agreement on the domain and unifying theory of SCM, as well as a consensus definition. The result has been a lack of clarity as to the scope of SCM, “siloed” research methodologies, and parallel research efforts. We interviewed 50 academic scholars across disciplines, as well as 20 SCM business executives, to extract commonality of opinion and discuss the future of SCM. The most important of these findings are the identification of “common ground” regarding the definition and scope of SCM, establishment of the need for interdisciplinary research, the recognition of the existence of “inner” and “outer core” functions central to SCM, and the nature of functional involvement in interdisciplinary research. In this paper we present these findings and provide a path forward based on the collective wisdom of these scholars and executives.</jats:p>",

During the past 50 years, it has contributed substantially to the recognition and adoption of purchasing and supply management (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content>) as an academic and strategic business domain. Having been invited by the <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">JSCM</jats:styled-content></jats:italic> editors to provide some ideas on the future directions of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research, the authors discuss what can be done to further increase both its relevance and rigor. Rigor and relevance in academic research are interconnected. To improve its relevance, the authors argue that future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research should better reflect the strategic priorities raised in the contemporary strategic management literature. Next, future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research should be much better embedded in a limited number of management theories. Here, stakeholder theory, network theory, the resource‐based view of the firm, dynamic capabilities theory, and the relational view could be considered as interesting candidates. Rigor is connected with robustness of academic research designs and projects. To foster its rigor, future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research should allow for an increase in the number of replication studies, longitudinal studies, and meta‐analytical studies. Future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research designs should reflect a careful distinction between informants and respondents and a careful sample selection. When discussing the results of quantitative studies, future <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> research should report on effect sizes and confidence intervals, rather than <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐values. Adoption of these ideas would have some important implications for both the academic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PSM</jats:styled-content> community and academic journal editors.</jats:p>",

The most relevant security threats the companies fear, include hijacking of vessels (sea piracy), but also terrorism, and wars. Finally, the study highlights that the European Union has built a comprehensive portfolio of strategies to deal with scarcity of oil and gas resources. However, these approaches are not often synchronized with supply chain strategies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The paper provides guidance for supply chain managers dealing with critical suppliers located in conflict environments. The paper recommends that supply chain managers fine tune their strategies in coordination with governmental actions in foreign politics, dependence reduction and crisis management. This may be achieved by closer communication with governments and potentially through the creation of a pan-European sector alliance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– Previous research discusses the topic of supply chain resilience and supply chain risk management.

Openness to theory of other fields is on the one hand welcome and on the other hand denounced as arbitrariness hampering the progression of SCM. This paper aims to contribute to this debate outlining one promising framework that structures the field and provides guidance for its evolution. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper conceives SCM as a Lakatosian research program from a philosophy of knowledge perspective that allows for continuously developing the knowledge base of SCM. After outlining the peculiarities of knowledge development according to Lakatos, the hard core of the program is delimitated from its protective belt by means of various analytical criteria referring to the meta, discipline, and practice level. The distinction framework is illustratively applied to four SCM research articles. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Developing SCM as a Lakatosian research program entails two main challenges: consensus regarding the irrefutable hard core and theoretic and methodological openness regarding its protective belt. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Meeting these challenges requires distinguishing between hard core and protective belt.

However, inconsistent empirical results have been obtained with respect to the relationships between supply chain integration (SCI) and performance. Drawing on efficiency-flexibility arguments, this paper seeks to develop a SCI model that includes buyer-supplier-supplier relationships, and proposes a contingency framework for reexamining the SCI-supplier performance relationship under demand and technological uncertainties.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– A two-stage data collection process was conducted, and a total of 878 suppliers that listed in the Taiwanese “Center-Satellite Production System” with supply contract were contacted for this study.

Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses in this study.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Evidence indicates that SCI has a significant positive effect on the suppliers' performance.

Furthermore, based on transaction cost theory, this paper takes the nature of uncertainty into account for improving the theoretical background of the SCI-performance relationship arguments. Empirical results indicate the existence of an ambidextrous supply chain integration strategy which justifies the choice of which one is preferable in efficiency-flexibility dilemma arguments.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The identification of potential determinants of supply chain relationships and support programmes is based on literature on supply chain management and transaction cost economics. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Positive determinants of supplier support programmes are the degree of exclusivity of the buyer-supplier relationship, initial capital of the supplier, co-operation between suppliers, and foreign ownership of the buyer. Support programmes are less likely to be offered in very competitive environments. Support measures such as loans, physical inputs and guaranteed prices facilitate supplier investments. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Research is limited to cross-sectional data for a single country and further testing would help assess the generalizability of the findings. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The findings highlight the gains that can be made from openness to international firms. The negative competition effect suggests that buyers are constrained in their ability to monitor use of the provided services in an environment where a lot of buyers are competing for the same supply. Improving the enforcement capability of companies under these circumstances is an important challenge for the industry and policy makers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The novelty of the study lies in the investigation of the relationships between the nature of supply chain linkages and suppliers' investments.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Ultimately, the review is intended to assist member-companies of supply chains, mainly producers, improve their current management approaches, by directing them to studies that may be suitable for direct application to their supply chains and value chains for improved efficiency and profitability. We found that information on supply chain management and modeling techniques in general is available. However, few Canadian-based published studies exist regarding a demand-driven modeling approach to value/supply chain management for wood pellet production. Only three papers were found specifically on wood pellet value chain analysis. We propose that more studies should be carried out on the value chain of wood pellet manufacturing, as well as demand-driven management and modeling approaches with improved demand forecasting methods.</jats:p>"

Recently, increased focus by researchers has produced a solid literature base of academic research. In this article, a meta‐analytic approach is employed to provide a quantitative review of the empirical literature and examine relevant constructs. Fifty‐four samples across 69 peer‐reviewed journal articles, yielding a total of 9,386 observations, were obtained and analyzed. We used transaction cost economics and the resource‐based view as lenses to hypothesize a structural model of the relationships between relational governance structure, logistics customer service, and firm performance. Additional relationships were also found and analyzed, helping to clarify the mixed existing findings in the literature. The study concludes by mapping out future directions for 3<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PL</jats:styled-content> research, based on the study's findings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, a trend of forming dynamic supply chains with different trading partners over different e‐marketplaces has emerged. These supply chains, which are called “supply mesh,” generally refer to heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (often make‐to‐order), are formed across different parties. Conceptually, in a supply mesh a dynamic supply chain is formed vertically, mediating several companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level horizontally are either competitors or cohorts. A complex scenario such as this makes it challenging to find the right group of members for a dynamic supply chain. Earlier on, a multiagent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was proposed for the optimal formation of make‐to‐order supply chains. This paper contributes the particular agent designs, for enabling the mediation of CSET in a supply mesh, and the possibilities are discussed. It is demonstrated via a computer simulation, based on samples from the U.S. textile industry, that by using intelligent agents under the CSET model it is possible to automatically find an ideal group of trading partners from a supply mesh.</jats:p>",

Part of the planning process consists of finding the best possible chain configuration. For manufacturing firms, a production-distribution problem consists of defining the flow of products from plants to clients (markets) via a set of warehouses. Defining the location of such warehouses is also part of the decision-making problem. This problem is known in the literature as the two-echelon uncapacitated facility location problem (TUFLP). This chapter analyses the performance of a mathematical model that minimizes the total cost of warehouse location and production and distribution. This problem is studied and is solved using optimization methods. </jats:p>"

The unique feature of Qatar's LNG project is the integrated energy value chain, starting from offshore gas reservoir and wells then all the way to liquefaction, transportation terminal and delivery to international customers. The natural gas starts its journey from giant North Field reservoir; is produced through huge mono-bore wells, flow continues via subsea wet gas pipelines to onshore where it is separated into condensate, water and feed to the world's largest LNG trains. The major ventures Qatargas2 and Qatargas3&amp;Qatargas4 operate gas wells, completed in Khuff reservoir, spread over several wellhead platforms, transport gas through multiple multiphase wet gas pipelines to four mega LNG trains at onshore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The planning strategy for start from right amount of gas extraction with right composition while achieving uniform draw down at reservoir level continues until controlling gas volume from each well complying with facility design limit, within operating boundaries from flow assurance point etc. Time delay from offshore to onshore through pipeline transfers, must be considered on volume and composition estimation of gas. Several activities on wells, wellheads, subsea pipelines add further complexity to the process.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>As gas is becoming the energy of choice for the world community, sharing knowledge and experience of producing and continuous gas delivering to maintain the critical supply chain will add value to the hydrocarbon industry.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper is focused on the complexity of factors, challenges of planning and executing supply along with several other factors to this element of big energy supply chain. Multiple boundaries, affecting gas movement need to be respected, monitored and achieved. The responsibility lies in having complete knowledge of all factors, ability and experience to steer through the complex set up; fail proof procedures supported by world class execution style.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Qatargas - World's largest LNG Producer</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Qatargas Operating Company Limited was established in 1984 and became the largest LNG producing company in the world, with an annual LNG production capacity of 42 million tons per annum (MTA) in 2011. Qatargas LNG reaches to customers all over the world with LNG production through seven trains, of which four are the largest in the world - known as mega-trains.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Qatargas offshore production is located approximately 80 kilometers northeast of Qatar's mainland and is sitting on the world's largest non-associated gas reserve named Qatar North Field.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter focuses on the distribution-allocation problem with fixed cost for transportation routes in a two-stage supply chain. The supply chain considered in this research consists of suppliers, distributors and customers. Each transportation route is associated with a fixed charge (or a fixed cost) and a transportation cost per unit transported. The presence of this fixed cost makes the problem difficult to solve. This motivates the researchers to develop heuristics based on non-traditional optimization techniques that can provide near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. In this research, an ant colony optimization based heuristic is proposed to solve a distribution-allocation problem with fixed cost for transportation routes in a two-stage supply chain. The comparative analysis carried out in this study reveals that the solutions obtained using proposed heuristic are better than those obtained using an existing heuristic in terms of total cost and computational time. In addition, special emphasis is placed in developing heuristics based on ant colony optimization for solving supply chain related problems and identifying opportunities for further research in this area. </jats:p>"

The barriers are identified using secondary sources and expert opinions. The paper is a blend of theoretical framework and practical application and employs structural analysis to draw an interventional roadmap to facilitate the use of e-Application in the agri-food supply chain. The research shows that there exists a group of barriers having a high driving power and low dependence requiring maximum attention. These barriers are strategically important for e-Applications. This paper provides a useful insight to the policymakers and stakeholders by focusing on those key barriers which are important for effective e-Application in the agri-food supply chain. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper mainly studied the circuit parameter calculation theory and the methods based on damped oscillations in transient signals. The methods can be used for the location and origin of faults by calculating the circuit parameters of transient fault signals' path when the fault occurs in the power system transmission lines. It is important in theoretical and practical engineering to locate faults in powerlines by calculating circuit parameters based on damped oscillations which are the main component of the transient signals. In R-L and R-C circuits, relations of the characteristic parameters in damped oscillation voltage and current in time domain, with the circuit parameters as well as the component parameters are deduced. And the impedance characteristic of the circuit under damped oscillation is analyzed, which is defined as a pseudo-impedance based on the definition that impedance is steady and sinusoidal. Relations between the pseudo-impedance and circuit parameters are also found. Relations between component parameter and pseudo-impedance in series or parallel are also analyzed. So methods for circuit parameter calculation are proposed separately based on the characteristic parameters and pseudo-impedance, each of which is a kind of characteristic of the damped oscillation signal. Specific calculation methods are also proposed combining with the state-of-the-art signal analysis for damped oscillation signal. Analyses in this paper may lay an important foundation for practical engineering application. The proposed theory and methods are verified based on simulation of fault signals produced by MATLAB. The equivalent circuit of an actual distribution system is simulated by using PSCAD/EMTDC. Actual fault signals reappear in the simulation. Location of single-line-to-ground fault using damped oscillation signal proposed in the paper is proved feasible.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The new frontier of payments is called supply-chain finance \n(SCF). The core idea behind this innovative concept is the use of \nreal-time supply-chain data to accelerate payments and help \nsuppliers get their money earlier. In particular, banks can be \nlinked up with buying organisations and leverage the information \nabout their approved suppliers’ invoices, one step before they \nare converted into payments, to offer convenient financing to the \nsame suppliers. There are many reasons why SCF has been growing \nat double-digit rates in the last five years. Through SCF, banks \nmove the risk of financing towards the stronger party in the \nchain, ie the buyer. Despite the general credit crunch, SCF \nmobilises financial resources for small vendors in a very \nuncomplicated fashion. SCF improves the financial resilience of \nthe supply chain. Many financial institutions and third-party \nproviders have invested millions of dollars to build SCF systems. \nWhile SCF is still an evolving industry trend, the early adopters \nare already reaping the benefits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering the wide demand for daily meals, the issue of the institutional food system has become very important in highly developed societies and, also, how it affects the flow of energy and matter within a territory. This research originates from a wide multi-disciplinary project aimed at developing a self-sufficient approach to improve the institutional food system in an area of Northern Italy. Thus, the aim of this research is to give some guidelines to implement ideal scenarios of food production, processing, consumption, and waste management at the local level. To that end, the organization of the supply and demand within the local institutional food system is inquired. A methodology has been developed to analyze the main energy flows and matter related to this catering, and to outline possible optimal scenarios. This methodology also allows to analyze case studies and to formulate improvements in order to reduce their energy consumption while exploring all the steps of the supply chain (considering the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach). The use of quantitative indicators allows a comparison of the impacts related to the different steps characterizing the suggested scenarios. This paper presents results related to a test in the context of institutional catering in public schools.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Given the importance of operating and managing forward and reverse supply chains in an integrated manner, this article considers an integrated four-stage supply chain network with forward and reverse product flows. We consider a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network with primarily commercial returns, which could be potentially recovered by light repair operations or by refurbishing. The annual estimate of commercial returns in the United States is in excess of $100 billion. This paper discusses the optimal design of a CLSC network.A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to determine the optimal locations of the facilities and the distribution of flows between facilities in the CLSC to maximize the total profit. The model is illustrated using a realistic example applicable to the electronics industries. Even though recycling and refurbishing add cost, the overall supply chain profit increases due to a reduction in the raw material cost. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effect of return percentage and varying demands of customers who are willing to buy refurbished products. The analysis show that the total supply chain profit increases with the increase in refurbishing activity. Finally, changes in the network design with respect to the uncertainty in these return parameters are also studied. The results show that the changes in return parameters lead to changes in optimal network design implying the need to explicitly consider the uncertainty in these return parameters.</p>",

Dans quelle mesure la catastrophe de Fukushima Daiichi modifie-t-elle les prévisions de croissance de ce marché ? Quels sont les risques associés à la prolifération de nouveaux entrants dans ce secteur ? Cet article adopte une perspective inverse. Il analyse la structure et l’organisation de l’offre de la filière nucléaire. Quels sont les pays exportateurs ? Comment ont évolué les parts de marché respectives des différents acteurs ? L’industrie nucléaire est-elle une industrie globalisée ? La première partie présente une description succincte du marché mondial. De façon surprenante la taille du marché reste relativement modeste et les États-Unis y jouent un rôle mineur. Nous mettons en évidence les relations entre les filières nucléaires nationales et les marchés d’exportation. La deuxième partie discute les enjeux de l’organisation industrielle de la filière nucléaire. Nous nous appuyons sur une comparaison entre l’industrie de l’armement et le secteur parapétrolier. La troisième partie conclue par une analyse des conditions dans lesquelles l’industrie nucléaire pourrait devenir une industrie globalisée.</jats:p>"

The paper considers two different strategies for transporting finished products from the supplier to the retailers: In case of early shipments, deliveries to a retailer can be made while the production process at the supplier is still in progress, while in the case of late shipments, the supplier has to wait until the entire production lot has been finished before shipments can be made from the lot. The paper develops mathematical models for both strategies and derives optimal solutions for the cycle time, the container size, the individual order quantities of the retailers and the shipment sequence with the intention to minimize the average total costs of the system. The behavior of the models is analyzed with the help of numerical examples.</jats:p>",

The evaluation starts by considering that, in order to achieve the development goals associated with the expansion of water and sanitation services, the sustainability of these services-understood as the long-term maintenance of the quality of the service provided in the interventions-must be guaranteed at the technical, financial, and operational level. Once this quality can be sustained over time, it will be possible to improve the population¿s conditions, particularly in terms of health indicators. Accordingly, the evaluation seeks to identify the factors and good practices that can be correlated with higher levels of sustainability of the systems that were constructed. The scope of the evaluation includes 100 water and sanitation interventions in rural communities financed by the program in the eastern region of Paraguay.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose – The purpose of this paper is based on the fact that managing supply chains as a separate area of business management opens up numerous possibilities for improving the competitive position of business systems. Supply chain management is increasingly often named as the key offensive factor to increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of economic systems. Design – The purpose of the paper is to point to the fact that hospitality logistics fulfils its basic mission only then when high quality products are delivered to the right place, at the right time, in the appropriate assortment, with the lowest internal and external costs, while doing their maximum to meet the wishes, needs and the demand of the customers. Methodology – The methodology is based on proving the proposed hypothesis: Modern logistics traffic represents a condition sine qua non of rational supply chain management in hospitality. Approach – The approach of the paper is based on the fact that supply chain management represents a broader, strategically significant concept which includes the entire supply chain and has the following goals: customer satisfaction, formulating and implementing appropriate strategies and effective supply chain management. Findings – Although each modality of the traffic logistic system has its own specific mission, they all have a common basic mission: to prepare material goods for manipulation, transport and distribution, the actual transport and distribution of material goods and conducting various logistic activities connected to preparing, manipulating, transporting and distributing material goods. The originality of this research – The originality of this research is revisiting the traffic logistics model as an exclusive factor of the competitive micro-hospitality industry in tourist destinations on a theoretical level, which can be set up via simple, complicated and multimodal traffic logistic models in micro-hospitality industries.</jats:p>",

In the model, skills are endogenous and multidimensional, and two types of assignment occur: workers self‐select the type of skills to supply, and firms assign workers to tasks. The model shows that the impact of any skill‐biased technical change on wage inequality is tightly related to the distribution of skills in the population. When the supply of skills is endogenous, productivity effects can be overestimated or underestimated by wage data, and Johnson's (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ecca12071-bib-0015\" />) distinction between intensive and extensive technical change is impossible.</jats:p>",

The significance of the price and income elasticities of demand to agriculture is discussed. Also explained are the factors affecting supply of commodities, including the price of the commodity, the prices of all the other commodities that are within the firm's production possibilities, the prices of factors of production, the state of technology, and the goals of firms.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Yield potential is the genome-encoded capacity of a crop species to generate yield in an optimal growth environment. Ninety per cent of plant biomass is derived from the photosynthetic reduction of carbon dioxide to organic carbon (photoassimilates – primarily sucrose). Thus, development of yield components (organ numbers and individual organ masses) can be limited by photoassimilate supply (photosynthesis arranged in series with phloem transport) or by their inherent capacity to utilise imported photoassimilates for growth or storage. To this end, photoassimilate supply/utilisation of crop yield has been quantitatively re-evaluated using published responses of yield components to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations across a selection of key crop species including cereal and pulse grains, fleshy fruits, tubers and sugar storing stems and tap roots. The analysis demonstrates that development of harvested organ numbers is strongly limited by photoassimilate supply. Vegetative branching and, to a lesser extent, flower/pod/fleshy fruit abortion, are the major yield components contributing to sensitivity of organ numbers to photoassimilate supply. In contrast, harvested organ size is partially dependent (eudicots), or completely independent (cereals), of photoassimilate supply. Processes limiting photoassimilate utilisation by harvested organs include membrane transport of soluble sugars and their allocation into polymeric storage products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Multimodal primary forest fuel (PFF) transport using the railroad for main haulage has been quite uncommon to present, although it could provide considerable advantages in terms of economical, ecological and social parameters. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to assess barriers and drivers for the modal shift from truck to train. As methodological tool, we are using the concept of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) with the House of Quality (HoQ) â an approach that has not been used in forest management so far. As the most important barriers for the modal shift from truck to train in PFF transport in Austria, the following were identified: (i) bioenergy plant managers have a negative opinion and negative experience regarding the railroad in terms of high prices, a lot of bureaucracy, etc.; (ii) absence of rail sidings or relatively short rail sidings not suitable for block trains; and (iii) unwillingness to invest in new supply or unloading systems. On the contrary, the most important drivers for a modal shift are: (i) multimodal PFF supply chains using trains can provide high volumes; (ii) increasing catchment areas for larger CHP plants result in increasing transport distances; and (iii) rail transport has less negative environmental and social impact than road transport.</ja:p>"

A hybrid signal containing multiple frequency bands is boosted to obtain a high-voltage signal without bands change. Several frequency selection circuits are then used to separate individual signals in different frequency band from the high-voltage signal. Finally, these signals are rectified and filtered respectively to obtain multiple channel DC voltages. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is analyzed theoretically and verified by simulation. The hybrid signal containing multiple frequency bands is constructed by MCU (Micro Control Unit) and boosted using push-pull boost circuit. Low-pass, band-pass and high-pass frequency selection circuits are used to obtain the individual high-voltage signal in different frequency bands, and the amplitude frequency response characteristics of these filters are simulated using PSpice. Experimental results prove that each part of the scheme runs reliable and the output is stable and adjustable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Economic affordability and access to water and waste services (WWS) are extensively studied topics in economic literature. However, most papers focus on social rights or the importance of water provision for equity and development. The impact of different regulatory and/or management models, the measurement of affordability and efficient pricing have all deserved the attention of researchers, but few studies assess the actual revenue impact of the existing social support mechanisms. For Portugal, while some preliminary data collection has taken place, a comprehensive review is still lacking. With this paper, the Water and Waste Services Regulation Authority (ERSAR) takes a first step towards filling that gap, by calculating the amount of subsidisation inherent in the adoption of social tariffs in mainland Portugal municipalities. Starting with an account of the current status quo, the article analyses different subsidisation situations, including a hypothetical framework where social tariffs are administered according to ERSAR's guidelines. Results indicate that, if ERSAR's Recommendation were fully applied, the number of social tariff beneficiaries could be above current figures, possibly translating into a disproportionate burden on the remaining WWS users through the application of higher bills. In the context of the severe economic crisis that is forcing families into increasing budgetary constraints, the article stresses issues of feasibility, drawing on the policy implications of the adoption of such discounts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To explore the competitiveness of the Finnish dairy chain, we analysed its productivity performance relative to that of other Baltic countries: Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, and the three Baltic states. We used partial productivity indicators and indices of total factor productivity (TFP) to investigate productivity growth and productivity levels in both dairy farming and dairy manufacturing, using data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network as well as national industrial statistics. At farm level, there are enormous differences in the level of labour productivity across the eight countries: a dairy farmer in Denmark produces 13 times more milk than one in Latvia or Lithuania. Labour productivity in Finland is also significantly lower than in the other old EU countries – not only Denmark, the clear leader, but also Germany and Sweden. Further, there is evidence that Estonia is catching up with Finland in terms of labour productivity. A decomposition analysis then shows that the cross-country differences in labour productivity on farms are driven primarily by differences in labour requirements per cow, while differences in milk yields account for a much smaller share of the difference. Thus, the key to high labour productivity in dairy is the farm structure and the adoption of mechanical innovations, while differences in adoption of biological innovations (e.g., genetic improvement, feeds) are relatively less important. In a second step, a growth accounting exercise indicates that growth in farm-level production in the four older EU members has occurred through different channels, but that TFP growth rates have been roughly comparable from 1995 to 2010. Thus, the competitive position of Finnish dairy farms relative to those in Sweden, Germany and Denmark has not changed greatly over the last two decades. More positively, we find that in recent years (i.e., since 2004), TFP on Finnish farms has grown much faster than on German and Swedish farms. Altogether, Finnish farms appear in the process of raising their productivity to the level achieved by German and Swedish farms, while Danish farms are probably out of reach. Extending the comparison to include the new EU members reveals that dairy farms in those countries are lagging behind Finnish ones in terms of productivity and are not catching up. Although Estonian farms, which are on average relatively large, have recorded impressive increases in yields and labour productivity, this has been achieved more by substitutions of other production factors for labour than real efficiency gains. The processing level of the Finnish dairy supply chain appears more competitive when benchmarked against the processing sectors of the old EU members, although TFP growth has been slow in absolute terms. However, the productivity of dairy manufacturing in Poland and Lithuania is increasing rapidly and converging towards the levels observed in the older EU countries. Overall, the evolution documented in the paper is consistent with the view that transferring technologies and organisational forms from the productivity leaders to the productivity “laggards” is easier in the manufacturing sector than in primary production, due to the typical difference in the size of firms as well as the more pronounced reliance of the primary sector on country-specific agro-ecological conditions.</jats:p>"

We use a full-information maximum likelihood estimator for a duration model with endogenous binary variables. Results controlling for endogeneity suggest that both coresidence and working are associated with a delay in childbearing, reversing the effect of coresidence on the timing of first birth but not that of working. Women in earlier cohorts tend to choose coresidency and not working, and an increasing number of women from later cohorts choose to do both or to work only.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigate the optimal procurement design with supply disruptions and heterogeneous beliefs between the buyer and the supplier. We examine the impact of information asymmetry on the supplier's belief, the control right of the backup production, and the verifiability of supply disruption. The belief heterogeneity creates speculative gains and losses because the buyer and the supplier hold different estimates of the disruption probability. We demonstrate that the buyer's incentive to exploit this belief heterogeneity leads to real production inefficiencies in different scenarios. The production efficiency is not necessarily improved with more transparent information. Moreover, a very pessimistic supplier may have no incentive to invest in improving the reliability even if this is costless, and the supplier may produce more when the expected production cost becomes higher. When the buyer sees some value in using the supplier's estimate to update his own belief, we find that the main results hold unless the buyer completely abandons his belief. </jats:p>",

The need to reduce carbon emission is acknowledged universally irrespective of which side of the climate debate. The development of future electric vehicles will have significant benefits on the environment if this vehicle can be adopted by the general public as the primary mode of transport. However, the existing infrastructure for manufacturing and supporting fossil fuel based vehicles does not fit the operation model of electric vehicle. The industry, supply chain, community and general public need to understand how the new electric vehicle operation system works and what benefits it will bring to them. This paper examines the manufacturing and operational issues of electric vehicles and explores the view of a new global supply chain that will foster design, develop, manufacture and support of electric vehicles. A business plan is proposed to describe the rationale of how to create, deliver, and capture value in terms of economic, social and innovation for supplying electric vehicles to the community.</jats:p>"

So, dv/dt and di/dt can be decreased in the circuit; and the ripple noise and EMI of switching power supply are reduced vastly in this way. Experimental results show that the ripple noise of switching power supply could be reduced by 80% and EMI reduced 15dBμV. The experiment has proved that we can cut down the ripple noise and EMI of switching power supply by lessening the slew rates of the voltage and current of MOSFET switching tube.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the independent effects of propagule supply and resource availability on species diversity are widely recognized, there are conflicting predictions of how resource availability affects the strength of propagule supply. To determine how propagule supply and resource availability interact to control species richness, we compared the effects of grazer propagule additions on grazer and algal assemblages across an experimental gradient of algal productivity. Different levels of algal productivity (i.e., replacement rate of grazers' food resource) were maintained by manipulating light. Despite light‐driven changes in algal standing biomass and diversity, algal resource availability had no effect on propagule limitation of grazer species richness, nor on grazer community composition. Instead, augmenting grazer propagule supply had equally strong, positive effects on grazer richness at all levels of algal resource availability. Although there was evidence for competition and resource limitation in the high propagule supply/low resource treatment, competition was evidently too weak or the experimental duration was too short to lead to competitive exclusion and changes in species richness, evenness, and composition. Our results highlight potential differences in resource use between sessile producers and mobile grazers. Unlike plants that consume inorganic nutrients and light whose renewal is positive, donor‐controlled, and identity‐fixed, animals consume dynamic resources that can respond to consumption by increasing growth rates, or going extinct and being replaced by other species, as we observed in the replacement of easily ingested green algae by less preferred red algae. The dual nature of these dynamic resources may consequently weaken the link between resource renewal rates and propagule limitation in animal communities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply-chain finance (SCF) is growing in importance for transaction banking. In this paper, SCF is defined as the use of financial instruments, practices and technologies to optimise the management of working capital and liquidity tied up in supply-chain processes. SCF is largely driven by events in the physical supply chain. SCF is gaining the greatest momentum in local, domestic trade transactions. The current European cross-border SCF market size is still small, and is not yet as mature as that in the USA. Nevertheless, there is a growing demand from clients for cross-border SCF solutions. Bankers see double-digit growth (between 10 and 20 per cent) in cross-border SCF programmes (in terms of turnover) in Europe and the US over the next few years. Emerging countries in Asia and Latin America represent further opportunities for SCF adoption, given their trade focus. SCF is increasingly seen as a tool that could bring benefits to multiple parties across the integrated supply chain. Corporates are thereby recognising the working capital benefits of SCF, as well as its capacity to minimise supply chain risk and build better relationships with their suppliers. Initially, SCFs were offered by international banks as a way to counteract a contraction in traditional payment fees, to optimise the use of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and to identify additional sources of revenue in the working capital cycle. The industry of SCF services, however, is being revolutionised. New, innovative, non-bank players such as peer-to-peer lenders, dynamic discounting providers and others have entered the market, enabling SMEs to optimise their working capital, thereby challenging the banking financing industry. SCF is expected to grow not only in terms of turnover, but also in scope and appeal. As buyer–supplier relationships will continue to evolve and mature, the level of integration will move further up the value chain. This will also trigger buyer-centric SCF programmes to become increasingly available. There is likely to be an increase in syndicated supply chain programmes and greater integration of SCF solutions with capital market instruments. The main challenge for banks and innovative service providers is to translate the complexity of SCF into a proposition for corporates that is easy to understand and communicate.</jats:p>"

It seems that power influences the depth of collaboration, which is minimal if the actors do not have balanced power positions.

It enhances understanding of how power influences collaboration, and of how a wider network perspective could determine the power relations between the companies. Managers need to be aware of the effects of power on the nature of their relationships and, moreover, on the depth of collaboration. This enhances their ability to determine their positions in relation to other companies, and to develop relationships offering opportunities for deeper collaboration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The literature review reveals that the issues of power and collaboration in the network context have rarely been connected and discussed in relation to each other. This constitutes a clear and notable research gap given the implication that the relation between power and collaboration, in terms of the influence of power position, is still an unexplored area. Moreover, whereas most previous studies on the phenomenon of power concentrate on analyzing dyadic relationships, this study raises the question of the network context.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High temperature switch mode power supplies (SMPS) typically utilize magnetic solutions such as low permeability transformers for isolation from ground loops. However, imposed design constraints almost always restrict the size of switch mode power supply systems to less than the minimum space necessary for a good design, resulting in only adequate and sometimes unreliable switch mode power supply designs. Integrating the control loop and magnetic system functions is implemented by taking advantage of the bi-directional characteristics of transformers, which allows the designer an opportunity to further minimize the design space by eliminating unnecessary loop components. This is a prudent step prior to the construction of high temperature hybrids and multichip modules. Combining the operation of both the control loop and the magnetic transformer allows the designer to reduce the size of the design, regain the ability to provide a good design in the volume allotted, while still maintaining loop stability. The design procedure for this integrated control loop and magnetics system is examined, and an example circuit is simulated in SPICE with a Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model, and the circuit is realized through construction and measurements which are presented for a single forward based design targeted for operation at high temperatures.</jats:p>",

While the fate of this energy remains a subject of research, arguments have been presented suggesting that a fraction of it may get transferred to lee waves that, upon breaking, result in bottom-enhanced diapycnal mixing. Here the authors propose several parameterizations of this process and explore their impact in a low-resolution ocean–climate model, focusing on their impact on the abyssal meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of Antarctic Bottom Water. This study shows that, when the eddy energy is allowed to maintain diapycnal mixing, the abyssal MOC generally intensifies with increasing wind energy input to the ocean. In such a case, the whole system is driven by the wind: wind steepens isopycnals and generates eddies, and the (parameterized) eddies generate small-scale mixing, driving the MOC. It is also demonstrated that if the model diapycnal diffusivity, eddy transfer coefficient, and surface climate are decoupled from the winds, then stronger wind stress in the Southern Ocean may lead to a weaker MOC in the abyss—in line with previous results. A simple scaling theory, describing the response of the abyssal MOC strength to wind energy input, is developed, providing a better insight on the numerical results.</jats:p>",

We characterize the path of the optimal decisions and investigate the effects of various public child care fees and of the quality of public child care services on the parent’s time allocation and the child’s performance level. Our results show that different public child care policies may induce substantially diverging effects and reveal that each policy frequently faces a trade off between an encouragement of labor supply and an enhancement of the child’s performance. In addition, we find that, from an efficiency perspective, an income-based fee levied on public child care services is dominated by both a flat fee and a use-based fee system.</jats:p>",

The aim is to uncover factors that drive their modal choices and to assess the quality implications of the variability of the users' perceived satisfaction through the use of two statistical methods (ordered logit and linear mixed models) and comprehensive diagrammatic techniques. Five transit systems in the two major cities in Greece, Athens and Thessaloniki, have been examined. The analysis demonstrated that the most important satisfaction attributes are service frequency, followed by waiting conditions and network coverage, punctuality and in-vehicle transport conditions. A gender-based market segmentation analysis provided further insight into the differences among groups of the population. According to this analysis, female respondents tend to place their attention on punctuality, waiting conditions and driver behavior, while male respondents on in-vehicle transport conditions and the existence and quality of transfer information.</p>",

Due to this, the issue of green supply chain management has received more attention in the last decade. In this study, a closed-loop logistic concept which serves the purposes of recycling, reuse, and recovery required in a green supply chain is applied to integrate the environmental issues into a traditional logistic system. Here, we formulate a comprehensive closed-loop model for the logistics planning considering profitability and ecological goals. In this way, we can achieve the ecological goal reducing the overall amount of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emitted from journeys. Moreover, the profitability criterion can be supported in the cyclic network with the minimum costs and maximum service level. We apply three scenarios and develop problem formulations for each scenario corresponding to the specified regulations and investigate the effect of the regulation on the preferred transport mode and the emissions. To validate the models, some numerical experiments are worked out and a comparative analysis is investigated.</jats:p>"

Ocean carriers, land carriers and port terminal operators are considered. Port terminal operators, providing transportation services within a port complex, are regarded as a special type of the carrier, based on their behavior. The carriers make pricing and routing decisions at different parts of the multimodal network, having hierarchical relationships. Ocean carriers are regarded as the leaders in a maritime shipping market. Port terminal operators are the followers of ocean carriers as well as the leaders of land carriers. The individual carrier problem is formulated at each level using Nash equilibrium to find the optimal service charge and routing pattern for which each carrier obtains the greatest profit. Interactions among different types of carriers are captured in a three-level model. The concept of multi-leader-follower game is applied to a multi-level game. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the validity of the developed three-level model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ultrafiltration (UF) has been presented as an alternative to chemical disinfection to obtain safe drinking water, for its ability to remove microbiological contamination. Hollow-fiber UF membranes are designed as an effective barrier to microorganisms, for their high manufacturing integrity and for the ‘potting’ method adopted to seal fibers to the feeding/extraction manifold. While the main advantage over chemical disinfection is the drastic reduction of disinfection-by-product (DBP) formation, some chemicals are still required to control fouling and related sanitary risks. This study aims at an up-to-date assessment of UF use for surface water disinfection by compact, minimally-attended, automated plants. A 3.5 m3/h automated UF pilot-plant was run for 8 months for drinking quality purification of surface water from Pescia stream. Standard drinking water parameters, as well as specific microbiological parameters (Legionella, Mycobacterium, Adenovirus, coliphage) and DBP formation were monitored. Final results highlighted that the plant could reach a good removal of bacteria and a significant reduction of viruses. However, the adopted operation/maintenance policies had a strong impact on energy and water consumption, efficacy of bacterium/virus barrier and DBP formation. Hence, an accurate and competent operation, as well as the assistance of chemical disinfection, are still required for safe drinking water production.</jats:p>",

Comparison of virulent and attenuated members of the<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>complex has further contributed to identification of a specific secretion pathway, named ESX or Type VII secretion.

A supply chain strategy is a key issue for the improvement of the outside. Recent information technologies provide even small- and medium-sized supplier companies with a chance for entering into contracts with major supplier companies and large manufacturing companies in different Keiretsu groups, but will give the trouble for surviving in the dynamic supply chain environment at the same time. This chapter proposes a strategy for MTO (Make To Order) companies to find suitable business partners in the dynamic supply chain environment and to enter into proper contracts with the partners as well as to obtain appropriate profits. A supply chain model proposed in the chapter provides a negotiation protocol to determine suitable prices and delivery times for ordered products through the iteration of the negotiation process between the organizations, as well as through the modification processes of production schedules. A two-layered supply chain model is firstly proposed as a basic model for dynamic supply chain management of MTO companies. The model is extended to a three-layered supply chain model for representing the negotiation protocol among multi-layered organizations. A prototype of a supply chain simulation system is developed and computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of changing business partners and negotiating among the partners cooperatively. </jats:p>"

Additionally, the implementation of application access controls is often critical for ensuring an appropriate separation of duties and, ultimately, the reliability of a given transaction processing system. This paper describes a project where students act as consultants for Bellwether Garden Supply (BGS), a small retailer in Norcross, GA.1 In the case setting, BGS is in the process of completing the implementation of Sage 50. BGS management has asked student consulting teams to evaluate its current purchases and disbursements processes and organizational structure, to make any revisions necessary to accommodate the new technology, and to document the post-implementation process using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The case provides a rich, semi-structured setting where students can: improve their understanding of application access controls, separation of duties, and other key controls in the purchases and disbursements process; gain an appreciation of the importance of the context in which accounting applications are implemented; and enhance their communication skills using BPMN.</jats:p>",

The criteria were obtained from results of previous research findings and recommendations from several researchers. The criteria are divided into two categories, namely efficient and effective. To examine which criteria can be used to assess a supply chain performance measurement model, a survey was conducted by distributing questionnaires to supply chain actors from different industry fields (both manufacturing and services) in Indonesia using random sampling techniques. Data analysis using pairwise comparisons with an analytical Hierarchy Process model showed that efficient criteria were more important than effective criteria. Efficient criteria consisted of three sub-criteria: the amount of data is not too much and low cost and output is presented in a simple form. Effective criteria consisted of the criteria in the order of importance as follows: clarity, validity, comprehensiveness, responsiveness and dynamics. Further research is needed for developing a model that meets these criteria </jats:p>",

The usual pre requisite to model freight flows on between geographical zones, is an understanding of intra zonal production and consumption relations. This is in essence an aggregation of all individual firm to firm interactions taking place in form of production and consumption of goods, as well as transportation firms involved in the goods exchange process. In this paper, a demand driven micro-simulated supply chain model is presented. The presented model is a microsimulation model modeling the main firm types present in a traditional supply chain. It is a demand driven model using quantity of goods requested at the consumer side as a starting point. The different interacting firms use a modified Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model as the basis of the simulation process. The cost function used includes also transportation and labor costs. The model simulates also shipping and carrying firms and takes into account raw material suppliers able to supply all or some subcomponents needed by production firms. Different initial conditions can be used to mimic real life firm to firm interactions. Firm level and zone level scenarios are simulated and results are shown.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Accomplishing veritable demand in a timely manner is a true challenge in present business circumstances especially for the fashion products where the demand is to get more varieties in short interval. Managing demand and supply is not that naïve as the supply chain is complicated by the outsourcing trend. This study aims to assess how brands in the fashion industry are managing their demand-supply chains (DSCs) by considering both trendy and regular product. This paper is based on the literature review of demand chain management (DCM) and also supply chain management (SCM) of the fashion industry. Also the research on demand-supply chain management (DSCM) is studied as a scope of demand-supply management in fashion industry. Textile and apparel processing stages are also studied to understand the manufacturing and supply chain complexity. The review identified that the degree of fashion sensitivity adopted by the retail brands influences their supply chain strategy. Fast fashion retailers urge to respond quickly and they need a flexible and responsive supply chain and contrariwise, others do need fast response but more efficiency focus with economy of scale. chains. The demand side aspects and supply side alignment will contribute insights on DSC organization in textile-apparel supply chain. Also textile and apparel manufacturers may have a clearer picture regarding the structure of retailers’ DSCs. The findings may also prove useful for them who are not aligned with the fast track concept, but yet supplying product in timely manner is their top priority. The co-ordination of complex and multidimensional textile-apparel supply chain with individual interest is still a concern and yet to be resolved. The objective of the study is to add knowledge for perceiving the importance of the co-ordination for mutual benefit.</jats:p>"

It can adjust the water pressure dynamically, according to the changes of water flow. Therefore, it can economize the energy consumption significantly. In order to improve real-time performance, the system adopts STs STM32F407 series processor which is based on ARM® CortexTM-M4 32-bit RISC core. It is used to collect the water flow, pressure and other data in real time, and automatically adjust the output frequency to control the motor speed, according to the set pressure value, and ultimately control the flow and pressure of the water supply system. According to the test, this variable frequency and multi-pressure water supply control system based on STM32 processor can meet the design requirements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large amounts of carbon emissions and pollution are generated during the manufacturing process for consumer goods. Low carbon manufacturing has been increasingly enquired or requested by stakeholders. However, international trade blurs the responsibility for carbon emissions reduction and raises the questions of responsibility allocation among producers and consumers. Scholars have been examining the nexus of producer versus consumer responsibility among supply chains. Recently, there have been discussions on the share of producer and consumer responsibility. Both producer and consumer responsibility approaches have intrinsic shortcomings and are ineffective in curbing the rise of carbon emissions in supply chains. Shared responsibility based on the equity principle attempts to address these issues. This chapter relates a case study of carbon impact on China’s export and economy with scenarios which show that the benefits of carbon reduction by producers can trickle down along the supply chain and motivate the sharing responsibility under certain circumstances. The share of producer and consumer responsibility for low carbon manufacturing can be enabled when embodied carbon emissions in goods and services are priced and such accurate information is available. A mechanism engaging the global participation is recommended. The author calls for further research on the system pricing embodied carbon emission, the universal standard to calculate the embodied carbon emissions and to disclose the information, and the way to secure global cooperation and participation. </jats:p>"

RL is a research area focused on the management of the recovery of products once they are no longer desired (end-of-use products, EoU) or can no longer be used (end-of-life products) by the consumers, in order to obtain an economic value from the recovered products. This way, RL has become a matter of strategic importance, an element that companies are considering in their decision-making processes related to the design and development of their supply chains. In addition, a description of the implications of RL for SCM will be discussed and, finally, an analysis of some of the opportunities and challenges that RL implies for SCM will be presented. </jats:p>",

The AUTOMIXER is based on a fuzzy control system, which was implemented in a microcontroller using a LookUp Table. The operation of the device was validated using simulated data and actual patients. The results show that the AUTOMIXER is an important tool for decreasing the incidence of pathologies related to unsuitable handling (excess or lack) of oxygen.</jats:p>"

The results showed that whether the fuel supply advance angle is too large or too small, it will increase the fuel consumption. As the fuel supply advance angle is 20°CA, the brake specific fuel consumption is the best of the butanol diesel engine. When the supply advance angle becomes larger, the smoke and CO emissions can be reduced on the medium and high loads, but NO<jats:sub>X</jats:sub>emissions are significantly increased on a variety of load conditions. The engine will obtain the lowest HC emissions, as the fuel supply advance angle is 20°CA.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the experiences and lessons learnt in terms of effective stakeholder involvement gained from a case study on strategic sanitation planning in a peri-urban sub-district in the city of Darkhan, Mongolia. Conceptually the Darkhan case study builds on a participatory sanitation planning approach known in the literature as community-led urban environmental sanitation (CLUES) planning. Firstly, a brief introduction to the CLUES approach, its basic principles for effective stakeholder involvement and its adaptation to the Darkhan case study is given. Secondly, two relevant planning steps including the building and testing of pilot facilities are described and assessed in terms of effective stakeholder involvement. It is shown that even if not all basic principles could be fulfilled adequately, the participatory planning framework helped to improve the scientific outputs of the project – mainly the technological research and development – and to smooth the way for further actions towards the sustainable implementation of measures on a larger scale.</jats:p>",

We quantify the scarcity value of Treasury collateral by estimating the impact of security-specific demand and supply factors on the repo rates of all outstanding U.S. Treasury securities. We find an economically and statistically significant scarcity premium. This scarcity effect is quite persistent, passes through to Treasury market prices, and explains a significant portion of the flow-effects of LSAP programs, providing additional evidence for the scarcity channel of QE. Through the same mechanism, the Fed&amp;amp;#x27;s reverse repo operations could alleviate potential shortages of high-quality collateral.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study presents some specific problems concerning the DC–AC commutation of the power converters used in frequency controlled electromagnetic actuators. Starting from the initial conditions imposed for a low‐cost simple inverter used for driving an electromagnetic vibrator, two commutation possibilities are analysed (unmodulated voltages and simple modulated voltages). The harmonic analysis performed in this study, permitted the analytic determination of the load current distortion coefficient against the control angle in the case of simple modulated voltage. The energetic performances (the real power and the power factor) of the system were evaluated through the power factor, determined analytically as a function of the operating frequency and the control angle <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>. The influence of the control angle on the current distortion factor has been highlighted experimentally using a programmable source, which allowed the synthesis of different waveforms at different frequencies. The novelty of this study consists in the analysis of the influence of the control variable angle <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> on energy parameters of electromagnetic vibrators, which allows a lower distortion factor and an appropriate power factor, both at a lower cost and lower commutation losses compared with pulse width modulation converters. Section 1 presents the technologies using commutation techniques analysed in Sections 2 and 3; Section 4 represents an analysis of the energetic performances, whereas in Section 5 experimental results for a vibro‐compaction equipment are presented.</jats:p>",

This paper extends the problem of production-distribution centers assignment by considering sequencing decisions in the supply network. Nowadays, meeting delivery time of products is a competitive benefit; therefore, the objective is to minimize total tardiness. This problem is mathematically formulated by a mixed integer programming model. Then, using the proposed model, small instances of the problem can be optimally solved by GAMS software. Moreover, two metaheuristics based on variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing are proposed to solve large instances of the problem. Finally, performance of the proposed metaheuristics is evaluated by two sets of balanced and unbalanced instances. The computational results show the superiority of the variable neighborhood search algorithm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Orbital and retro‐orbital pain are relatively common clinical conditions that are associated with such disorders as trigeminal, lacrimal, and ciliary neuralgia, cluster headaches, paroxysmal hemicrania, inflammatory orbital pseudotumor, trochleitis, and herpetic neuralgia ophthalmicus, thus making the nerves supplying the orbit of great clinical importance. Surprisingly, how pain from this region reaches conscious levels is enigmatic. Classically, it has been assumed that pain reaches the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and travels to the descending spinal trigeminal nucleus. However, exactly where the receptors for orbital pain are located and how impulses reach V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> is speculative. In this project, we reviewed all of the reported connections between the orbital nerves and V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> in order to understand how pain from this region is transmitted to the brain. We found reported neural connections to exist between cranial nerve (CN) V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and CNs III, IV, and VI within the orbit, as well as direct neural branches to extra‐ocular muscles from the nasociliary, frontal, and supraorbital nerves. We also found reported neural connections to exist between the presumed carotid plexus and CN VI and CN V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, CN VI and CN V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and between CN V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and CN III, all within the cavernous sinus. Whether or not these connections are sympathetic or sensory or some combination of both connections remains unclear. An understanding of the variability and frequency of these neural connections could lead to safer surgical procedures of the orbit and effective treatments for patients with orbital pain. Clin.

Based on existing hydrological data and the optimal scheduling model, the optimized results are calculated and made to optimization curves. These optimization curves are used to guide the operation of the hydropower station.

In this design, the low density ocean current energy in deep-sea stored as mechanical energy in plane roll-up spring first. When the spring has enough potential energy, it drives the generator to generate electricity. Through this assistant start approach, the turbine can work in ultra-low-speed current.

This comes as a result of pressures that are mainly exercised from the legislation, the market and the society itself that, as a whole, show continuously higher interest for the environmental issues. It is also a result from factors such as gain of comparative advantages, reduction of operational cost, improvement of port profile, environmental sensitization of leadership. As the various port operations can lead to a variety of environmental and human effects, the need for a firm coexistence of financial development and environmental protection urges ports to the application of sustainable systems, plans and policies. The aim of this paper is to point out the need for an integrated environmental management of ports, to highlight the preconditions for the management of port environmental consequences through the development of appropriate Environmental Management Systems, to summarize and discuss the Hellenic reality concerning this issue and present a set of appropriate procedures and measures which could lead the Hellenic ports to the total environmental management in a cost-effective way.</p>",

We sought to evaluate correlates of occupational outcomes after KTX. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 336 working-age patients with at least one creatinine assessment in the 3-month screening period. We collected clinical information from medical records. All subjects answered a self-administered questionnaire, and a follow-up questionnaire was mailed to each participant after 6 months. Study outcomes were the Work Ability Index (WAI) and labor supply (the number of days each patient worked in the follow-up period). We estimated the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The mean eGFR was 52.76 ± 23.68 ml/min/1.73 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The age-standardized employment-to-population ratio was 62%. Comorbidities, self-reported work ability, gender, age, health insurance type, and time since transplant were associated with employment status at baseline. The WAI (38.79 ± 5.88) was associated with the severity of renal impairment, work attachment and comorbidities. After 6 months, labor supply (mean 19.4 ± 9.7 weeks) was associated with WAI item 1 (&amp;#x03C1; = 0.22; p = 0.03); eGFR was significantly associated with labor supply, and this association was slightly stronger in patients with physically demanding jobs. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We identified modifiable factors associated with poor occupational outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. Consistent with labor supply theory, our results suggest that health care coverage plays a key role in employment decisions after KTX independent of possible confounders. Additionally, our study provides the rationale to further evaluate the implications of renal function-preserving strategies for indirect cost savings and self-reported ability to work after transplant.</jats:p>"

Our analysis indicates that the proportion of women in the Democratic pool of potential candidates is now two to three times larger than in the Republican pool of potential candidates. Given the current association of party identification with gender and other characteristics, this gap is more likely to increase than decrease over the coming decade, with potential consequences for the descriptive and substantive representation of women in American politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emerging GaN power switches show advantages for integration in power modules at high temperature and/or high efficiency. These modules are good candidates for embedded power converters in harsh environment such as three phase inverters for Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMA) in the vicinity of internal combustion engines. The power range is usually within 1 to 5 kW, extending sometimes up to 50 kW, using a high voltage DC bus (HVDC) that is usually comprised between 200 V and 600 V. For aeronautical applications, GaN power switches could challenge SiC transistors for their high switching speed, hence reduced switching losses, therefore lower embarked mass. For automotive applications, it is the relative promise for lower cost per Amp that is pushing this technology up. This is why a project joining GaN device conception, power module development and gate driver optimization using high temperature technologies was set-up. This paper presents the first practical results: a functional GaN power inverter-leg driven by a specific high temperature gate driver with signal and power insulation. This building block requires an auxiliary DC supply with a input voltage of 14 V or 28 V and an external PWM control signal. Current rating is 20 A and breakdown voltage is 200 V.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The depletion of natural resource, the complexity of economic markets and the increased requirement for environment protection have increased the uncertainty of chemical supply and manufacturing. The consequence of short-time material shortage or emergent demand under extreme conditions, may cause local areas to suffer from delayed product deliveries and manufacturing disorder, which will both cause tremendous economic losses. In such urgent events, robust optimization for manufacturing planning and supply chain design in chemical industry, targeting the smart manufacturing, should be a top priority. In this chapter, a novel methodology is developed for robust optimization of manufacturing planning and supply chain design in chemical industry, which includes four stages of work. First, the network of the chemical supply chain needs to be characterized, where the capacity, quantity, and availability of various chemical sources is determined. Second, the initial situation under steady conditions needs to be identified. Then, the optimization is conducted based on a developed MILP (mixed-integer linear programming) model in the third stage. Finally, the sensitivity of the manufacturing and transportation planning with respect to uncertainty parameters is characterized by partitioning the entire space of uncertainty parameters into multiple subspaces. The efficacy of the developed methodology is demonstrated via a case study with in-depth discussions. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Although airports contribute to region's economic development, they have a negative impact on the environment and on the communities around them. Environmental impacts such as noise, air and water pollution, and natural resources consumption are some of the implications resulting from the operation of airports that have the ability to constrain airports further development. In addition, increased public concern, regarding climate change, imposes more restrictions on carbon use and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, many airports can no longer make full use of their capacity, especially when the mitigating cost is quite high. This paper is about airports environmental management and presents the results related to key components of the environmental plans that have been adopted in eight European regional airports. Key issue of the research is to investigate the differences and common practices in applied environmental strategies and systems. Even though most of the airports recognize the need to specify an environmental management strategy, not many regional airports have set specific targets about their environmental performance. Airports that serve more than five million passengers per year seem to have a more detailed environmental strategy; airports located in countries that do not have applied specific sustainable development strategies focus on facilitating growth, rather than taking measures to control their environmental disturbance.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A high temperature (&amp;gt;200 °C), quad-output, buck type switched-mode power supply (SMPS) IC capable of operating over a wide input supply range of 6 V to 15 V is described. The IC is a compact power supply solution for multi-voltage microprocessors, sensors, and actuators. The SMPS topology is a 112 kHz fixed-frequency, synchronous buck converter with slope compensation. A novel internal feedback design enables the output voltages to be pin-programmed to one of three common supply voltages—5 V, 3.3 V, or 1.8 V—while an external resistor divider can also be used for arbitrary voltage programming. Integrated power supply output MOSFET switches minimize the external part count and synchronous rectification reduces power dissipation and improves current capacity. The IC was fabricated in a conventional, low-cost, 0.5 μm bulk CMOS foundry process. Patented circuit design techniques allow the IC to operate in excess of 200 °C and circuit operation was demonstrated at ambient temperatures up to 225 °C. The foundry process is optimized for 5 V applications, however, the IC accepts input voltages up to 15 V and can produce outputs up to 10 V by utilizing extended drain single- and double-sided NMOS and PMOS transistors for the linear regulator pass transistor, error amplifier, and SMPS switches. The high-side FETs are controlled through capacitive coupled level shift circuits to ensure the gate-oxide voltage limits are not exceeded while still maintaining fast signal transitions. The IC also includes a tunable, 25 MHz monolithic oscillator that is programmable over a SPI serial interface. The oscillator bias current is comprised of a programmable constant-gm bias current and a programmable PTAT bias current. The programmability can be used to set the oscillation frequency, but can also be used together with a calibration curve on a microcontroller to achieve a more stable oscillation frequency over temperature. The output current of the quad SMPS was limited to 70 mA by a lower than expected saturation current of the extended-drain PMOS switch devices. The system showed good line regulation (&amp;lt;0.1%) and 50% load step response stability (+/− 100 mV) at a nominal output current of 50 mA when tested at 200 °C ambient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In business modeling the focus is shifting from individual enterprises to the supply chains in which they collaborate. Contemporary business modeling grammars should allow each enterprise taking part in a supply chain to develop its own information system and at the same time support the creation of system interoperability and information sharing amongst business partners in the supply chain. This paper presents a conceptual modeling grammar for representing business scripts in a way that is both observer-dependent and independent. That is, value chain information should be represented in a format that is suitable for the perspective of any partner in the supply chain (e.g., enterprise, supplier, customer, customer's customer, supplier's supplier) and for the perspective of a completely neutral third party (e.g., government). The proposed observer-independent conceptual-modeling grammar, which is given strength by grounding it in the mature Resource-Event-Agent model, is shown to represent information about business phenomena of diverse supply chain partners such that it can be integrated across enterprise boundaries</p>",

Wind power is one of the potential alternate energy resources and is being deployed actively. Wind power generation system comprises of wind turbine and electrical generator as essential parts interconnected through gear box. The conventional wind turbines are designed with adjustable blade pitch to regulate shaft speed of turbine or to withstand against heavy wind blows. In this paper, a technique for peak load sharing in the presence of utility supply using Pitch Frequency Control (PFC) is proposed for wind turbines. This technique has been simulated in MATLAB environment using Simulink. The simulation results show that PFC finds its applications with wind energy system having low speed axial flux synchronous generator as well as with the wind energy system with small gear ratio. This particular proposed PFC based control presents a cost effective technique for efficient peak load sharing and wind energy system free of power electronic converters.</jats:p>",

The task of estimating supply chain performance extent is seemed a complex problem entitled with multiple subjective performance measures and metrics; subjected to decision-making environment which involves an inherent vagueness, inconsistency and incompleteness associated with decision-makers (DMs) (expert panel) commitment towards assessment of various subjective (quantitative) evaluation indices. Consequently, it becomes difficult towards making a comparative study on performances of alternative supply chains. It is, therefore, indeed essential to conceptualize and develop an efficient appraisement platform helpful for benchmarking of alternative supply chains based on their performance extent. The paper aims to discuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The work explores the concept of grey numbers combined with multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MOORA) in perceptive to evaluate best alternative from among available alternative supply chains. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The method has been found fruitful to facilitate such a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem under uncertain environment and provides an appropriate compromise ranking order with respect to available possible alternatives. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Supply chain performance appraisement provides necessary means by which an organization can assess whether its supply chain is performing well, whether it has been improved or degraded as compared to the past record.

Consequently, businesses, communities, and governments have been environmentally conscious and shown growing concern for sustainable development, particularly following the establishment of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). This chapter provides further insights into sustainability and supply chain research through adopting a stakeholder perspective to understand drivers and consequences of supply chain sustainability in the United Arab Emirates. The results indicate that pressures enforced by champions and customers are positively related to supply chain sustainability. However, the relationship between government pressures and supply chain sustainability is insignificant. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that the impact of supply chain sustainability on the organizational sustainable performance is significantly positive. Supply managers can learn from these results in developing sustainable initiatives earlier along their supply chain through selecting and evaluating suppliers based on sustainability-related standards. In addition, environmental collaboration with customers and suppliers based on knowledge sharing and application may identify and reduce the total environmental impact.</jats:p>"

Social insect colonies integrate the balance of supply and demand across levels of biological organization such that the individual components are simultaneously serving as the supply transport network and also the source of energetic demand. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the per‐capita metabolic rates of individuals within social insect colonies decrease with increasing colony size, a metabolic hypometry much like the pattern exhibited by individual organisms. An important question is thus, whether this scaling pattern is a result of an energetic supply constraint or evidence for an emergent economy of scale. This review synthesizes theoretical models and results from empirical studies on the scaling of resource supply and demand in social insect colonies. Scaling in biology is a powerful tool to unify the study of diverse concepts and organisms; increased integration of mechanistic realism into metabolic models will improve our understanding of the evolution of complex biological systems.</jats:p>",

However, many industrial workers are not able to work until they have reached the increased retirement age. This problem is decreasing social security, increasing workers anxiety regarding the future and influencing the quality and timing of production processes. Disruptions and lower quality items produced in one activity cell of a supply chain can have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain. To solve this problem, we should put in place supplementary occupational pension schemes, which would compensate firms for the depreciated ability of their elderly workers to work when they have reached the previous retirement age but have not yet reached the new, higher retirement age. This article is introduces a model that is based on extended MRP Theory. The model can be used as a basis for negotiations between employers and employees to keep production at the same level of quality. The trade-off between higher contributions to supplementary occupational pension schemes and lower added values is considered. Contributions enable the early retirement of industrial workers at one or more workplaces in a supply chain, while lower added value is the result of lower quality and the perturbed timing of items that are produced in one or more activity cells of a supply chain: these issues have a ripple effect throughout an entire supply chain. The net present value approach is used.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a process which can directly produce a three-dimensional solid object by stacking up layers of materials. As the AM technology advances, 3D printing becomes a new approach for manufacturing industry, which will potentially reconfigure Supply Chain (SC) network. However, there are only a few pilot studies with simple assumptions on AM based supply chain optimization, which are far from the real situations. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to figure out how AM would reorganize supply chain network. Furthermore, we will investigate what factors should be taken into consideration while establishing an AM based supply chain. This study aims to identify the best configuration of AM supply chain using simulation approach. Various scenarios will be generated with the consideration of demands level, the machine types, cost and other supply chain performance. This study finds that an appropriate proportion of AM machine and conventional machine could sufficiently decrease the amount of WIP, processing time and material cost. Furthermore, this research aims to figure out how configuration and machine type would affect the SC through cost and time performance indicators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management (SCM) is one of the important competitive strategies used by modern organizations. The main objective of supply chain management is to integrate various suppliers in order to satisfy market demand.  Selecting and evaluating suppliers plays an important role in creating a supply chain. The old method of selecting and evaluating suppliers is focused on the needs of businesses and considering it for the entire supply chain of an organization fails to work. So this study presents a structured approach for selecting and evaluating suppliers based on the integrated supply chain structure. For establishing a procedure for the selection and evaluation of suppliers in the supply chain, first, the competitive strategy of the organization by analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) is specified. Based on competitive strategy, supplier selection criteria and indicators in order to establish a framework for selecting suppliers are elected. Subsequently, potential suppliers through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) are monitored. Finally, the techniques of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is used to rank suppliers. In this paper, a structured approach to select suppliers in an industry will be examined.</jats:p>"

Through the analysis of secondary data, the main practices, problems and challenges in these post-disaster humanitarian operations are identified. This study aims to understand the environment and circumstances in which these humanitarian operations occurred, assessing the main constraints encountered and the approaches adopted to ensure the supply of relief to victims of natural disasters. Finally, suggestions are proposed in order to improve the efficiency and success rate of the logistics process in other humanitarian response operations.</jats:p>"

Eighteen companies already practice the cost-efficiency paradigm. Only 2 companies exemplify empathy, not sympathy, when they pursue sustainability in the global supply chain. These two foreign multinational enterprises have developed a network of organizations to be socially, economically, and environmentally responsible. Their practice of empathy is due to the moral consciousness of their leaders and the persistence, compassion, and humbleness of their dedicated corporate social responsibility officers. </jats:p>"

There is a growing need to manage the security and efficiency of consignments. Tracking and tracing services, which are on the market, mainly concentrate on a single mode of transport, such as road vehicles, or transport units, such as containers. This chapter describes a concept for managing the security of multimodal supply chains using monitoring technology. A profound risk analysis was performed to identify threats and vulnerabilities during the different phases of the supply chain and key threat scenarios. A security service concept was developed to cope with the risks using monitoring technology. The technological solution depends on the needs of the supply chain actors and on the supply chain properties. The service concept was tested by monitoring different international shipments leaving from Finland. Intelligent monitoring devices, which were attached to the consignments, collected information on location and environmental parameters and transmitted in real-time to a background system. The chapter gives an overview of the framework, service concept, and the analysed results of multimodal shipments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the presence of fuzzy or linguistic and dynamic variables, dynamic modeling of real-world systems is a challenge to many decision makers. In such environments with fuzzy time-dependent variables, the right decisions and the impacts of possible actions are not precisely known. The presence of linguistic variables in a dynamic environment is a serious cause for concern to most practicing decision makers. For instance, in a demand-driven supply chain, demand information is inherently imprecise, leading to unwanted fluctuations throughout the supply chain. This chapter integrates, from a systems perspective, fuzzy logic and system dynamics paradigms to model a typical supply chain in a fuzzy environment. Based on a set of performance indices defined to evaluate supply chain behavior, results from comparative simulation experiments show the utility of the fuzzy system dynamics paradigm: (1) the approach provides a real-world picture of a fuzzy dynamic supply chain, (2) expert opinion can be captured into a dynamic simulation model with ease, (3) the fuzzy dynamic policies yield better supply chain performance, and (4) “what-if analysis” show the robustness of the fuzzy dynamic policies even in turbulent demand situations. Managerial insights and practical evaluations are provided. </jats:p>"

Data for this pilot study were collected through a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire consisted of nine questions. The survey was distributed through email, both as an online link as well as an electronic document that could be returned via email or in hardcopy. A total of 214 UK-based companies involved in the Agrifood products distribution sector were contacted. A correlation analysis shows that company perceptions about factors affecting decisions for the implementation of sustainable practices shares a relationship with the company’s expectations when applying sustainable initiatives. Further research built on this preliminary study will lead to the development of a model that will enable adoption of sustainable measures based on a needs and strengths analysis of the companies. </jats:p>"

Determined traffickers react remarkably well to consumer demand and under-regulated economic sectors and easily adapt to legislative weaknesses. Corporate globalization of manufacturing and storefronts is contributing to human trafficking; aiding in forced labor in becoming the fastest growing and the third most widespread criminal enterprise in the world. As technology advances, allowing greater and easier access to goods from more remote countries, vulnerable populations become easier targets for traffickers to exploit. Understanding U.S. markets are key destinations for goods, enlightened states are looking to bolster their anti-trafficking criminal codes by requiring businesses to better clarify their efforts to discourage human trafficking/forced labor within their supply chains. The California State Legislature has begun an aggressive approach aimed at fostering greater public awareness of slave labor by requiring certain businesses to clearly articulate their anti-trafficking/anti-forced labor policies. California was the first government – local, state or federal - to codify mandatory policy disclosures. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires businesses domiciled in California and earning more that $100 million to conspicuously disclose on their publically accessed webpage, what policies, if any, they have implemented to detect and fight slave labor. The legislature intended to equip the common consumer with the needed information to effectively hold businesses accountable for human rights abuses. In order for the public to properly hold businesses accountable for their labor practices, it is essential the names of business subject to the disclosure be made public. The California Public Records Act should be a tool for concerned consumers and advocates to obtain the statutory list of affected companies.</jats:p>"

By collecting, processing, and distributing information efficiently, organisations should be able to improve the efficiency of their transport logistics processes, lower their operational costs, and improve their portfolio of logistics services.

The success of Fair Trade has led to speculation over whether its portfolio could be broadened to include non‐agricultural products, a debate which, in recent years, has focused heavily on the precious minerals and stones being extracted by impoverished artisans. A lack of policy oversight, however, has resulted in Fair Trade being interpreted very differently in this context. In the absence of certified, internationally‐recognized guidelines for the implementation of Fair Trade mineral schemes, designers have drawn inspiration from a global mining development agenda that has become preoccupied with anti‐corruption and traceability. This article draws on the case of Malawi's Nyala<jats:sup>TM</jats:sup> ruby, described as a ‘Fair Trade Gem’ by its supplier, to illustrate how ethical mineral programmes are potentially being misbranded as Fair Trade. Although the scheme delivering Nyala<jats:sup>TM</jats:sup> ruby to markets is supplying a traceable commodity, in the process helping to alleviate consumers’ concerns about conflict minerals, it seems to be providing very little benefit to poor producers — the primary objective of Fair Trade.</jats:p>",

This paper introduces a predictive supply chain performance management model which combines process modelling, performance measurement, data mining models, and web portal technologies into a unique model. It presents the supply chain modelling approach based on the specialized metamodel which allows modelling of any supply chain configuration and at different level of details. The paper also presents the supply chain semantic business intelligence (BI) model which encapsulates data sources and business rules and includes the data warehouse model with specific supply chain dimensions, measures, and KPIs (key performance indicators). Next, the paper describes two generic approaches for designing the KPI predictive data mining models based on the BI semantic model. KPI predictive models were trained and tested with a real-world data set. Finally, a specialized analytical web portal which offers collaborative performance monitoring and decision making is presented. The results show that these models give very accurate KPI projections and provide valuable insights into newly emerging trends, opportunities, and problems. This should lead to more intelligent, predictive, and responsive supply chains capable of adapting to future business environment.</jats:p>"

Seasonal changes in quality are linked to seasonal changes in pumping rates that influence the distribution of flow into the well screens under pumping conditions and the magnitude and direction of intraborehole flow within the wells under ambient conditions. Groundwater flow and transport simulations with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MODFLOW</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MT3DMS</jats:styled-content> were developed to quantify the effects of changes in average seasonal pumping rates on intraborehole flow and water quality at two long‐screened, public‐supply wells, in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Modesto, California, where widespread pumping has altered groundwater flow patterns. Simulation results indicate that both wells produce water requiring additional treatment to maintain potable quality in winter when groundwater withdrawals are reduced because less water is derived from parts of the aquifer that contain water requiring less treatment. Simulation results indicate that the water quality at both wells could be improved by increasing average winter‐pumping rates to induce more lateral flow from parts of the aquifer that contain better quality water. Arsenic‐bearing water produced by the Albuquerque well could be reduced from 55% to 45% by doubling average winter‐pumping rate, while nitrate‐ and uranium‐bearing water produced by the Modesto well could be reduced from 95% to 65% by nearly tripling the average winter‐pumping rate. Higher average winter‐pumping rates would also reduce the volume of intraborehole flow within both wells and prevent the exchange of poor quality water between shallow and deep parts of both aquifers.</jats:p>",

We first consider the single‐item single‐echelon case where the retailer operates with a quantity based replenishment policy, ( r, Q), and the warehouse is an ample supplier. We model the transportation operations as a queueing system and derive the operating characteristics of the system in exact terms. We extend this basic model to a two‐echelon supply chain where the warehouse employs a base‐stock policy. The departure process of the warehouse is characterized in distribution, which is then approximated by an Erlang arrival process by matching the first two moments for the analysis of the transportation queueing system. The operating characteristics and the expected cost rate are derived. An extension of this system to multiple retailers is also discussed. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance and the sensitivity of the models and the value of coordinating inventory and transportation operations. </jats:p>",

High concentrations of salinity, iron and arsenic, and the unavailability of suitable aquifers, have deterred the exploitation of groundwater resources. In addition the cyclonic storm surge is a major threat to this system. Cyclones accompanied by storm surges in the coastal area cause significant deterioration of drinking water supply and sanitation. Water professionals have launched some initiatives to promote small-scale, alternative safe water sources (e.g. rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters and piped water techniques) to provide sustainable solutions to the problem. However, a systematic evaluation of the alternatives that considers social, technical and economic criteria has not been carried out so far. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the alternative options for drinking water supply in a cyclone-prone area. The authors conducted a multi-criteria analysis and reached the conclusion that rainwater harvesting is the most suitable option for the area. Moreover, the final result was shared with the users to obtain their feedback to ensure sustainability of the water source.</jats:p>",

Considering this gap in the literature, this study adopts the configurational approach to develop a conceptual framework that could configure the components of a SSC. In this respect, a process-oriented approach is utilized to classify and harmonize the design components. A natural-resource-based view (NRBV) is adopted to determine the central theme to align the design components around. The proposed framework presents three types of SSC, namely, efficient SSC, innovative SSC, and reputed SSC.

Fully consider the influence of the pipe network arrangement on the site selection when confirming the covering radius, analyze the best water supply radius of water treatment plants combining investment benefits and pipe network optimization theory, and take the best water supply radius as the covering radius. Make the pipe network optimization nest into the site selection problem meanwhile confirming the covering radius, which fully reflect the viewpoints of the integrated logistics arrangement system. Considering the multiple solutions of the set covering model, this paper introduces the model of which the cost’s present value is minimum to make the quadratic optimization and get the best site selection results of water treatment plant. At last, this paper verifies the model by combining with the cases of water supply project construction of a county; the results prove that the model is feasible and effective. This paper expects to provide some reference for the planning design of regionally centralized water supply projects concerning villages and small towns and the site selection and construction of water treatment plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the past decade, and expected for the next decade, Australia faces a significant health workforce shortage and an acute maldistribution of health workforce. Against this background the governments at both national and state level have been increasing the training places for all health practitioners and trying to redress the imbalance through a strong regional focus on these developments. Dentistry has been an active participant in these workforce initiatives. This study examines the increasing demand for academics and discusses the existing pathways for increase, and also examines in detail the advantages of a sustainable, shared-model approach, using dentistry as a model for other disciplines. Three non-exclusive pathways for reform are considered: importation of academics, delayed retirement and the shared resource approach. Of the various solutions outlined in this review a detailed explanation of a cost-effective shared model of senior academic leadership is highlighted as a viable, sustainable model for ameliorating the shortage. What is known about the topic? Little if any peer review literature has examined the academic workforce in oral health in Australia (or overseas). However, the lessons from other disciplines (including medicine) are that there is a growing shortage as the baby boomers move to retirement. What does this paper add? This manuscript provides some perspectives on the growing shortage of dental academics in Australia and examines one sustainable model for ameliorating this effect while Australia makes a fundamental shift in addressing academic workforce needs. What are the implications for practitioners? Academics and universities are facing growing issues with providing skilled, sustainable academic profiles in dentistry. This manuscript starts a dialogue as to options to address this issue into the future.</jats:p>"

Numerical simulations uses experimental design method to collect data for analysis into the relations and trends of the supply-air direction and the cooling efficiency.The sample points train approximation model, using radial basis function (RBF) neural network approximation model instead of the high cost of the simulation calculation. Multi-island GA is chosen to optimize the supply-air direction. The supply-air direction optimized and the supply-air direction vertical surface of inlet tuyere are calculated by simulation software respectively.Results show that the optimized direction making the car chamber cooling effect is remarkable, by the analysis of the heat flow value and temperature contours of before and after optimization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abundant supplies of oil form the foundation of modern industrial economies, but the capacity to maintain and grow global supply is attracting increasing concern. Some commentators forecast a peak in the near future and a subsequent terminal decline in global oil production, while others highlight the recent growth in ‘tight oil’ production and the scope for developing unconventional resources. There are disagreements over the size, cost and recoverability of different resources, the technical and economic potential of different technologies, the contribution of different factors to market trends and the economic implications of reduced supply. Few debates are more important, more contentious, more wide-ranging or more confused. This paper summarizes the main concepts, terms, issues and evidence that are necessary to understand the ‘peak oil’ debate. These include: the origin, nature and classification of oil resources; the trends in oil production and discoveries; the typical production profiles of oil fields, basins and producing regions; the mechanisms underlying those profiles; the extent of depletion of conventional oil; the risk of an approaching peak in global production; and the potential of various mitigation options. The aim is to introduce the subject to non-specialist readers and provide a basis for the subsequent papers in this Theme Issue.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, a road network was established for Jiangsu province, and the topological parameters of this network and the tourism degree of coordination among each prefectural city were calculated as well. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the spatial structure of the traffic network was not necessary for determining the supply-demand balance for tourism; thus, the collection of traffic flow data is required to perform further research. As a side result, it has been determined that the circuit routes are relatively absent from the Jiangsu traffic network, which might hinder tourism, and tourism resources are undersupplied to most prefectural cities in Jiangsu.</jats:p>"

The model takes an integrated portfolio perspective and addresses uncertainty in future prices. Decision variables include investments and disinvestments in infrastructure and vessels, chartering of vessels, the timing of contracts, and spot market trades. The model accounts for various contract types and vessels, and it addresses losses. The underlying mathematical model is a multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear problem. Industry-motivated numerical cases are discussed as benchmarks for the potential increases in profits that can be obtained by using the model for decision support. These examples illustrate how a portfolio perspective leads to decisions different than those obtained using the traditional net present value approach. We show how explicitly considering uncertainty affects investment and contracting decisions, leading to higher profits and better utilization of capacity. In addition, model run times are competitive with current business practices of manual planning. </jats:p>",

The electric system fails, if any of the two subsystems AB fails. The generation system A consists of three identical units. Initially only two units work and third unit is in standby. The standby unit is operated when any of the two units fails, through the automatic changeover, which is assumed to be perfect. The electric system goes to degraded state when only one unit of A is operable. The electric system may also fail due to critical human error and environmental failure. The failure time for the system follows exponential distribution whereas repair time assumes arbitrary distribution. Using Laplace transform various state probabilities and evaluated along with cost function. Numerical examples have been added to highlight the important results.</jats:p>"

The analysis has enabled three main topics to be identified: a) adoption and implementation of lean management, b) development of supply chain management, and c) deployment of lean principles and practices across the supply chain. A number of more specific lines of research are also proposed that have been assigned to each of these three main research topics. Finally, a set of challenges and opportunities for future research are set out, along with a range of academic and professional implications that could be useful not only for the aerospace sector but also for other industrial sectors that share similar contingent factors. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is considered an effective rotation crop in Australia’s northern grains region; however, concerns exist that grain yields of commercial crops are reduced because of nitrogen (N) deficiency related to inadequate nodulation and N2 fixation. As part of a program to address these issues, we report on the monitoring of 22 commercial fields around Moree, northern NSW, during 2005–07 that were designated for chickpea, and an associated farmer survey (81 respondents). Our objectives were to determine whether the monitored crops were limited by N and to develop recommendations that would optimise productivity for farmers growing chickpeas. In 2005, only soil water and nitrate data were collected from the six fields designated for chickpea. In 2006 and 2007, almost complete datasets were assembled from the 16 chickpea fields or crops, including soil water and nitrate at sowing, row spacing, plant density, plant height, stubble cover, weed density and composition, shoot biomass, grain yield, nodulation and N2 fixation (%N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) and total crop N fixed). The associated survey provided insights into farmer knowledge of, and practices related to, inoculation.\nField monitoring indicated moderate–high levels of soil nitrate at sowing (averages 114, 126 and 110 kg N ha–1 to 1.2 m depth for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively) and generally low plant nodulation (0.11–1.16 g fresh wt plant–1) and N2 fixation (0–62%Ndfa and 0–87 kg N ha–1). Grain yield varied between 0.53 and 2.91 t ha–1 across the 14 monitored crops, with averages of 1.89 t ha–1 in 2006 and 1.02 t ha–1 in 2007. Although total crop N and grain yields were highly correlated with total (i.e. soil + fixed) N supply, there was no evidence that the monitored chickpea crops were N-limited. Rather, we conclude that soil N and biologically fixed N were complementary in supplying N to the crops, the grain yields of which were primarily determined by the supply of plant-available water (PAW) and water-use efficiency (WUE). Simple and multivariate regression analyses showed that stubble cover during the fallow (positively correlated with sowing PAW) and sowing date (positively correlated with crop WUE) were significant determinants of grain yield. We conclude that farmers could improve inoculation practice by ensuring the time between seed inoculation and sowing is always &lt;24 h.\n</jats:p>"

The results show that simple treatment, with use of aeration and sand filtration or MF/UF membranes, does not remove pesticides. However, by reducing the content of key foulants, the techniques can be used as a pre-treatment for nanofiltration and low pressure reverse osmosis that has proved to be capable of removing pesticides. It was found that a lower fouling potential could be obtained by using the membranes, but that sand filter was better at removing manganese and dissolved organic matter. The results indicate that combining aeration, sand filtration and membrane techniques might be a good option for pesticide removal without any addition of chemicals and minimized membrane maintenance.</jats:p>",

In Norway, between 12 and 17% of a national target to increase the renewable energy share by 14 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TWh</jats:styled-content> can be sustainably met by mobilizing straw feedstocks. However, straw must compete in an energy market with a vast availability of forest‐based woody biomass, and a clean electrical energy pool, 95% of which is derived from hydropower. The performance of seven local straw supply chains was monitored over a period of 3 years to estimate straw yields, supply costs, operating costs of the heating plants, and to synthesiz experiences on supply solutions. Storage facilities for bales constituted the largest single cost in the supply chain. Square bales were both more economical to use and required considerably less plant management time, making them more preferable than round bales for small‐scale utilization. The total cost of straw firing averaged out in the range of 36–42 € <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MWh</jats:styled-content><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, which is 40–46% of the current cost of electric heating (∼90 € <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MWh</jats:styled-content><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>).

The data shows that citizens are provided with a rich online experience during election campaigns. Information is presented in engaging ways and candidates attempt to mobilise their supporters and offer various opportunities to interact with the campaign and other Website visitors. Interaction is augmented in particular by the use of social networking sites. Citizens, however, appear to mostly go online to find detailed information on the policies and programmes of the candidates. There appears little call for engaging communication, interactive opportunities, or details on the personal lives or personalities of the candidates. The data may, therefore, suggest that information may need to be packaged for accessibility and presented in a way that allows voters to make up their own minds, rather than following the norms of corporate sales campaign Websites.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of green supply chains is now accepted in many corporate organizations in Asia. Since the early nineties, when industry became aware of the increasing relevance of sustainable development, many business enterprises in Asia have adopted environmental initiatives as an integral part of their business practices. In time these organizations came to realize that the environmental initiatives needed to encompass not only the organization's own business practices but also the entire stretch of operations across the supply chain. In other words, they felt the need to include the employees, suppliers, customers, waste handlers, and other business partners in the greening process (Bacallan, 2000). Thus, an integrated supply chain approach was called for. Such an approach should be able to identify the environmental aspects at every stage, assess the environmental impacts associated with these aspects, prioritize them, and design action plans to mitigate their adverse effects on the environment if any. An integrated green supply chain approach would take into consideration the inbound logistics phase of the supply chain, the production or internal supply chain, the outbound logistics phase, and the reverse logistics phase (Rao &amp; Holt, 2005; Sarkis, 1999; Seuring &amp; Muller, 2007). For many organizations in Asia, the green supply chain approach has also emerged as a way to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability (Seuring et al., 2008). </jats:p><jats:p> However, there is a continuous need to measure and monitor the extent to which environmental performance is actually achieved. To assess this performance, a system of indicators across the supply chain is proposed, which is computationally easy to implement at the industry level. To demonstrate that the system of environmental indicators does measure performance, an empirical approach is adopted to test whether the system correlates with the four constructs of environmental sustainability: resource conservation, energy efficiency, reduction of hazardous waste, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Vachon &amp; Mao, 2008). </jats:p><jats:p> In order to check these linkages of environmental indicators to the constituents of environmental performance, four multiple regression models were run. In the first model, the dependent variable was resource conservation, the independent predictor variables being the 20 environmental indicators grouped under the four constructs: Inbound logistics, production or internal logistics, outbound logistics, and reverse logistics. In the second, third, and fourth models, the dependent variables were energy efficiency, reduction of hazardous waste, and minimization of emission of greenhouse gases, respectively. </jats:p><jats:p> Upon running the regression models, the models for resource conservation, reduction of hazardous waste, and reduction of emission of greenhouse gases were found to be significant at 5 percent significance level while the model for energy efficiency was significant at 10 percent level. </jats:p>",

The high prevalence of children’s emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) might have a negative effect on their mothers’ labor market outcomes because children with EBP require additional time for treatment. However, these children may require additional financial resources, which might promote mothers’ labor supply. Previous studies have only considered chronic conditions in analyzing the impact of children’s health on parental work activities. Moreover, most of these studies have not accounted for endogeneity in children’s health. This article estimates the effects of children’s EBP on their mothers’ labor supply by family structure while accounting for endogeneity in children’s health. We used the 1997 and 2002 Child Development Supplements (CDS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We used probit and bivariate probit models to estimate mothers’ probability of employment, and tobit and instrumental variable tobit models to estimate the effects of children’s EBP on their mothers’ work hours. Findings show negative effects of children’s EBP on their married mothers’ employment and on their single mothers’ work hours. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditional literature and policy approach to energy security focus on the security of energy supply. It is argued here that a supply-centric approach to energy security is too narrow to account for the complex nature of energy systems and tends to overlook energy users, their expectations from, interaction with and roles in future low carbon energy systems. From users’ point of view, be they households, businesses or governments, the supply of kWh or oil barrels is often meaningless. What matters is not the source of energy, but rather the services provided by it. Therefore, securing energy services seems to be the public and the government’s concern, and the security of supply is only one mean to achieving it. Stemming from science, technology and society studies, this discussion paper suggests that applying a multi-level socio-technical and user-oriented perspectives which focus on the energy services and considers also psychological, social and cultural aspects of energy consumption, could reveal new and overlooked actors, roles, means and strategies that may provide and contribute to energy services security.Keywords: energy security, energy services, socio-technical systems</jats:p>"

A model of the relationships between variables was derived from the literature. Data from 327 SMEs were analysed by confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) to verify the relationships. The findings show that market orientation indirectly and positively influences performance via supply chain integration. The direct relationship between market orientation (MO) and supply chain integration (SCI) was also confirmed. Likewise, the relationship between market orientation and supply chain integration was found to be strong and positive. The findings suggest that the generation of information in market oriented SMEs favours their sharing information both inter- and intra-organizational. A discussion of these findings, the implications for practice, and proposals for further research are provided.</jats:p>"

Simulation and modeling (SM) has been presented as an alternative approach for supply chain managers in healthcare organizations to test solutions and to support decision making processes associated with various SCM problems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Various policy instruments along with increasing oil prices have contributed to a sixfold increase in global biofuels production over the last decade (2000–2010). This rapid growth has proved controversial, however, and has raised concerns over potential conflicts with global food security and climate change mitigation. To address these concerns, policy support is now focused on advanced or second-generation biofuels instead of crop-based first-generation biofuels. This policy shift, together with the global financial crisis, has slowed the growth of biofuels production, which has remained stagnant since 2010. Based upon a review of the literature, this paper examines the potential long-run contribution of biofuels to the global energy mix, particularly for transportation. We find that the contribution of biofuels to global transportation fuel demand is likely to be limited to around 5% over the next 10–15 years. However, a number of studies suggest that biofuels could contribute up to a quarter of global transportation fuel demand by 2050, provided technological breakthroughs reduce the costs of sustainably produced advanced biofuels to a level where they can compete with petroleum fuels.</jats:p>",

Four parameters were considered in the HSCS: safety stock, maximum inventory level, transportation capacity, and the reliability of the HSCS. A full-factor experimental design was used to simulate an HSCS for the purpose of collecting data. The response surface method (RSM) was used to construct the regression model, and a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to obtain the optimal parameter settings for the HSCS. The results show that the best method of obtaining the optimal parameter settings for the HSCS is the simultaneous consideration of both the TSC and the PSL to measure performance. Also, the results of sensitivity analysis based on the optimal parameter settings were used to derive adjustable strategies for the decision-makers.</jats:p>"

Besides, mini hydros can cooperate with an impressively wide extent of water-related infrastructure, offering a broad potential for investment. In the present chapter, the integrated solution of hydro implementation in water supply systems is presented. Thus, the benefits of a water-supply installation (with constant Q) are extended to energy production. However, defining the optimum operation of such a project is a complicated task, which may involve environmental, hydraulic, technical, and economical parameters. In the present chapter a novel approach is presented, the optimum management of mini hydros in a water supply system with the use of an optimization algorithm (i.e. Harmony Search Algorithm [HAS]). This approach is applied at a site in Northern Greece and is used as a case study of the present chapter. </jats:p>"

While US federal chemical policy reform is being debated for the first time since 1976, some US businesses have voluntarily sought to improve their knowledge of chemical hazards in their supply chains, and several US states, the European Union, China, and other countries have moved forward with chemical policy reforms. Until policy reforms occur in the USA, the US chemical market will continue to experience problems associated with poor information on hazardous chemicals in supply chains. These market conditions make it difficult for consumer product companies to identify hazards and create safer products. Results from interviews with consumer product company representatives demonstrate that challenges in obtaining chemical-related information exist across sectors, and information on chemical hazards and uses can be conflicting, protected by trade secrets, lost in supply chains, or nonexistent. Interview results illustrate how some consumer product companies are exceeding regulatory requirements by voluntarily restricting from their products chemicals that could harm human health or the environment. Understanding the motivations behind—and barriers to—these actions could inform efforts to modernize US chemicals policies in ways that promote effective chemical management in supply chains. Using examples from the European Union and some US states, we introduce policy suggestions that would increase knowledge, market transparency, and information flows regarding hazardous chemicals and their uses; these would support the efforts of companies to develop and market safer products.</jats:p>",

In this study, we investigate the interaction between the capabilities of introducing the Internet channels, the pricing strategies, and the channel structure. We classify consumers into two segments: grocery shoppers attach a higher utility from purchasing through the physical channel, whereas a priori Internet shoppers prefer purchasing online. We find that when the Internet shoppers are either highly profitable or fairly unimportant, the manufacturer prefers to facilitate the channel separation either through his own Internet channel or the retailer's. In the intermediate region, however, the manufacturer encroaches the grocery shoppers and steals the demand from the retailer's physical channel. With horizontal competition between retailers, a priori symmetric retailers may adopt different channel strategies as a stable market equilibrium. The manufacturer may willingly give up his Internet channel and leverage on the retailer competition. When the manufacturer sells through an online e‐tailer, Internet shoppers may be induced to purchase through the physical channel. This reverse encroachment strategy emerges because selling through the e‐tailer leads to a more severe double marginalization problem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a rising trend in supplying chain management to employ simultaneous cooperation and competition (coopetition) among supply chain partners as an efficient strategy to create value. There exist, however, few models which analyze coopetitive situations mathematically. Cooperative game theory is the common tool in analyzing cooperative situations. However, the term “cooperative” in “cooperative game theory” is absolutely misleading since it ultimately leads to competition analysis and ignores the internal structure of the cooperation. Coopetition, however, results in structural transformations in players. Therefore, we require a mathematical modeling approach which takes into account the internal structural changes due to cooperation among competitors. In so doing, in this paper we propose, we assume that those parameters of each firm’s profit function are subject to transformation by cooperation as a function of cooperation level so as to determine the right level of cooperation and production of firms while considering technical cooperation between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the results of applying the idea to a supply chain situation where two similar suppliers participate. We conclude that under intuitive conditions coopetition strategy is superior to the pure competitive relationship between the suppliers in terms of profitability which validates the previous empirical results mathematically.</jats:p>",

Consequently, health systems throughout the world are searching for new and effective ways to make their services more responsive to new patients and the public's health needs and demands. The idea of patient engagement &amp;ndash; borrowed from the marketing conceptualization of consumer engagement &amp;ndash; moves from the assumption that making patients/clients co-producers of their health can enhance their satisfaction with the healthcare system as well as their responsibility in both care and prevention by improving clinical outcomes and reducing health delivery costs. To make people aware of their health services options by supporting them in the decision-making process and to engage them in enacting preventive and healthy behaviors is vital for achieving successful health outcomes and preventing waste of resources. In this chapter, we outline a model (PHE model) that explains the patients' subjective experience with their health management process and the levers that may enact the passage from one phase of the process to the other. Based on this conceptual model of patient engagement will be proposed a tool kit of priority actions that may sustain the patient in its process of engagement.</jats:p>"

We developed case studies and interviewed key informants to analyze the impacts of access to capital, regulations, infrastructure, and business acumen on the success of VBSCs. Communicating the benefits of VBSCs’ products to customers, as well as to the VBSC partners, was instrumental to the success of the VBSCs in our case studies. However, our key informants emphasized that additional communications are needed to develop markets for VBSCs’ products. Scale-appropriate infrastructure is also required, but funders are not convinced that these investments are secure. Successful VBSCs operate with economies of scale to broaden demand for their products while also generating fair returns to producers and other supply chain partners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chain networks (comprising buyer–supplier connections) are integral to specialized manufacturing industries and are vital to the growth and development of megaregions. Transportation planning in mega-regions requires an understanding of specialized industry sectors and the enhancement of the effects of the business network. Positive externalities and a competitive advantage can be augmented through transportation interventions. The directness of linkages and enhanced access between buyers and suppliers in any production network enables agglomeration economies, maximizes returns from investments, and can contribute to industry competitiveness. Physical transport networks are vital in ensuring directness in manufacturing sectors in which value chain segments are separated physically. This paper presents a framework for a behaviorally consistent directness measure explicitly linked to transportation infrastructure in megaregions, characterized by supply chains that enhance business networks. This index measures the enhanced accessibility provided by transportation by allowing systematic identification of links between buyers and suppliers in the value chain. The paper illustrates how the measure may be analyzed for an automobile manufacturing chain that is part of the southeastern Piedmont Atlantic megaregion. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we analyse the factors that will influence long-term oil supply and describe the future form of the global oil supply profile as an ‘undulating plateau’ rather than an irreversible, short-term peak or an ever upward trend of increasing production. The ultimate transition from a world of relatively plentiful and cheap oil to one of tight supply and high cost will be slow and challenging. An understanding of the signposts for the future path of supply and the drivers of that profile will be critical to managing the transition. The ultimate form of the global supply curve may well be dictated by demand evolution rather than a limited resource endowment in the longer term. Several factors will probably control future global oil supply. We believe that the scale of global oil resource will not constitute a physical supply limit for at least the next two or three decades. However, all categories of oil resources are already more expensive to develop than in the past, requiring high oil prices to stimulate supply growth. Lower rates of oil demand growth relative to economic growth, combined with more challenging supply growth, will probably lead to an undulating plateau sometime after 2040, with demand from non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development states continuing to dominate. Upstream investment requirements and oil price volatility will increase towards and beyond the undulating production plateau. In this new world, high oil prices will induce demand destruction, fuel substitution and ever increasing energy efficiency. As we discuss below, the fundamental differences between the IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (IHS CERA) view of the future of oil supply and many peak oil supply models are the timing of the onset of a dramatic slowdown in the rate of growth of supply and the existence or otherwise of a production plateau. We do not dispute that supply will plateau and eventually fall; the question is when, how and at what price? As the plateau approaches, oil prices are likely to increase strongly, with some very severe spikes along the way.</jats:p>",

Our objectives were to determine whether the monitored crops were limited by N and to develop recommendations that would optimise productivity for farmers growing chickpeas. In 2005, only soil water and nitrate data were collected from the six fields designated for chickpea. In 2006 and 2007, almost complete datasets were assembled from the 16 chickpea fields or crops, including soil water and nitrate at sowing, row spacing, plant density, plant height, stubble cover, weed density and composition, shoot biomass, grain yield, nodulation and N2 fixation (%N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) and total crop N fixed). The associated survey provided insights into farmer knowledge of, and practices related to, inoculation.\nField monitoring indicated moderate–high levels of soil nitrate at sowing (averages 114, 126 and 110kg N ha–1 to 1.2m depth for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively) and generally low plant nodulation (0.11–1.16g fresh wt plant–1) and N2 fixation (0–62%Ndfa and 0–87kg N ha–1). Grain yield varied between 0.53 and 2.91tha–1 across the 14 monitored crops, with averages of 1.89tha–1 in 2006 and 1.02tha–1 in 2007. Although total crop N and grain yields were highly correlated with total (i.e. soil+fixed) N supply, there was no evidence that the monitored chickpea crops were N-limited. Rather, we conclude that soil N and biologically fixed N were complementary in supplying N to the crops, the grain yields of which were primarily determined by the supply of plant-available water (PAW) and water-use efficiency (WUE). Simple and multivariate regression analyses showed that stubble cover during the fallow (positively correlated with sowing PAW) and sowing date (positively correlated with crop WUE) were significant determinants of grain yield. We conclude that farmers could improve inoculation practice by ensuring the time between seed inoculation and sowing is always </jats:p>"

We analytically investigate the decentralized retailer’s optimal decision. Our results demonstrate that the retailer has a unique optimal simultaneous decision on the retail price and the order quantity, under a mild restriction on the demand distribution. Moreover, as it can be shown that the decentralized supply chain facing price‐sensitive random demand cannot be coordinated with buy‐back contract, we propose a scheme for the system to achieve Pareto‐improvement. Theoretical analysis suggests that there exists a unique Pareto‐equilibrium for the supply chain. In particular, when the Pareto‐equilibrium is reached, the supply chain is coordinated. Numerical experiments confirm our results.</jats:p>",

A field study on early lactating cows (n = 80) and buffaloes (n = 82) was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding a balanced ration on milk production, microbial nitrogen (N) supply and CH4 emissions in different agroclimatic regions of India. CH4 emissions was measured using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, before and after feeding a balanced ration. Feeding practices revealed that intake of protein was adequate in the ration of experimental animals in most of the regions, except for the buffaloes of the western region. Metabolisable energy (MJ/cow.day) intake was higher by 7.6% and 13.6% in cows of western and northern regions, respectively. In buffaloes, energy intake (MJ metabolisable energy/buffalo.day) was higher by 11.5% in the western region but lower by 17.7% in the central region. Average calcium intake was deficient by 23.5% and 35.1%, whereas phosphorus intake was deficient by 33.2% and 56.2% in cows and buffaloes, respectively. Feeding a balanced ration increased (P &lt; 0.05) average daily milk production by 6.7% and 7.6%, whereas cost of production decreased by 13.7% and 9.9% in cows and buffaloes, respectively. Fat-corrected milk increased from 9.1 to 9.8 kg/cow.day and from 6.9 to 7.7 kg/buffalo.day. Intestinal flow of microbial N improved significantly by 25.5% and 26.7% in cows and buffaloes, respectively. Balanced feeding reduced CH4 emissions (g/kg milk yield) by 17.3% (P &lt; 0.05) in cows and 19.5% (P &lt; 0.01) in buffaloes. The present study indicates that feeding a balanced ration improves milk production and microbial N supply, and reduces CH4 emissions in field animals.</jats:p>"

This review addresses the roles of tectonic controls, glacial advances and retreats, sea-level changes, and coastal processes in sediment production, delivery and redistribution along the paraglacial Gulf of Maine coast (USA and Canada). Coastal accumulation forms are compositionally heterogeneous and found primarily at the seaward edge of the Gulf's largest estuaries; their existence is directly attributable to the availability of glacial sediments derived from erosion of weathered plutons within coastal river basins. Multiple post-glacial sea-level fluctuations drove the redistribution of these sediments across the modern lowland and inner shelf. Central to the formation of barrier systems was the paraglacial sand maximum, a time-transgressive phase of relative sea-level fall and enhanced fluvial sand export\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            2000–4000 years following deglaciation. Vast quantities of sand and gravel were reworked landward during the subsequent transgression and combined with additional riverine sediments to form the modern barrier systems. Today, reduced fluvial sediment loads, anthropogenic modifications of barrier and river systems, and sea-level rise have combined to exacerbate long-term coastal erosion and may eventually force these barriers toward a state of rapid landward migration.\n          </jats:p>",

In the fashion and textiles (FT) supply chain, the demand of most FT products (fashion clothing, vogue handbags, fashion shoes, and so on) varies over time due to the trends of fashion. In these conditions, a decision‐making framework with a multiple‐period supply chain becomes more realistic. In view of this, we investigate the optimal cooperative advertising strategies in a two‐period FT supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer in two different scenarios: (i) each channel member makes decisions within a cooperative program; (ii) the retailer is vertically integrated with a manufacturer. Also, we introduce a two‐way subsidy contract to coordinate the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Yet, evidence demonstrates that RL has remained unexploited mainly due to the lack of knowledge about its benefits, enablers, and major aspects of its adoption and implementation. In this context, promoting the adoption and diffusion of RL into the supply chain of organisations has been recommended frequently. This chapter provides a response to such need by (1) explaining the phenomenon and dispelling the confusions surrounding the RL concept, (2) clarifying the major drivers and barriers of RL and highlighting the role it can play in enhancing the performance of conventional supply chains; in addition, (3) the chapter intends to demystify the major aspects associated with implementing RL in organisations. The chapter also aims at familiarising potential readers with the major references available in the field. </jats:p>"

Since uncertainty is an inevitable issue of any real‐world production system, then to provide a realistic model, the concept of fuzzy sets has been applied in the proposed mathematical modeling. To illustrate and show the feasibility and validity of the model, a real case analysis, which is pertaining to a mineral water bottling production factory, has been used.

The study ascertains the many internal and external challenges that MSMEs face when trying to achieve equitable amounts of value from the lean supply concept with larger, more powerful suppliers. Internal issues—such as limited purchasing spends, restrictions in the availability of resources, and an inherent fear and distrust of long-term commitment—limit the potential for small firms to embrace the concept. External factors such as power and dependency and a reduced ability to influence the larger players in the market also contribute to the difficulties for MSMEs.</jats:p>"

The stump fuel supply chain is both challenging and complex, due to distance between resource and end user, material bulkiness, and the number of subprocesses involved. This study examined the impact of different aspects such as site characteristics, fuel quality, biomass losses, and machine performance on fuel cost. Two systems, including transport of comminuted and uncomminuted fuel, were studied. Discrete-event simulation was used to model systems and to analyse the dynamics of the supply chain and its various components. For a distance of 10 km, transportation of uncomminuted fuel gave the lowest costs. For distances from 30 to 70 km, site size (odt) determined whether to comminute or not before transport. For longer distances, comminution before transport proved to be necessary. Well-planned stump storage was shown to reduce the delivery costs significantly, while high moisture content (&gt;45%) had detrimental effects on system costs per unit energy delivered. However, the most influential parameters were productivity level and site characteristics (distance and site size).</jats:p>"

These footprints, however, do not address risk posed to city energy supplies characterized by insufficient streamflow to support energy production, such as cooling water intake (e.g., withdrawals) at thermoelectric power plants. Water withdrawal intensity factors for producing goods and services are being developed at the national scale, but lack sufficient spatial resolution to address these types of water‐energy challenges facing cities.</jats:p><jats:p>To address this need, this article presents a water withdrawal footprint for energy supply (WWFES) to cities and places it in the context of other water footprints defined in the literature. Analysis of electricity use versus electricity generation in 43 U.S. cities highlights the need for developing WWFES to estimate risks to transboundary city energy supplies resulting from water constraints. The magnitude of the WWFES is computed for Denver, Colorado, and compared to the city's direct use of water to offer perspective. The baseline WWFES for Denver is found to be 66% as large as all direct water uses in the city combined (mean estimate). Minimum, mean, and maximum estimates are computed to demonstrate sensitivity of the WWFES to selection of water withdrawal intensity factors. Finally, scenario analysis explores the effect of energy technology and energy policy choices in shaping the future water footprint of cities.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the results of these second questionnaires were further analyzed by GRA in order to explore the most potential supplier’s selection determinants in the modern supply chain management (MSCM). Beyond a series of measurements, the measured results have induced three contributive findings: (1) the empirical interviewed industrialists reported concern that suppliers have to provide a higher material yield rate and material delivery on time rate for the qualitative increment as well as a higher supplier’s gross margin ROI for the financial stabilization in MSCM; (2) the 15 experts concluded that material insurance rate is an important attribute to estimate risky assessments and the supplier’s gross margin ROI and warehouse operations cost as a percentage of sales are critical elements in the financial evaluations of potential suppliers; and (3) Supplier’s gross margin ROI, outbound freight cost as a percentage of sales, and material insurance rate are the three most decisive determinants in MSCM.</jats:p>",

This study seeks to identify how the interplay of supply chain network relationships, which are determined by situational factors affecting farms and their business environment, influences farmers' performance. A theoretical framework is developed and empirically applied to data obtained from a standardized survey of 81 Chilean raspberry producers, 80 Chilean avocado producers and 80 Chilean table grape producers using partial least squares analysis. The results of the comparative analysis of the three producer groups reveal that supply chain network relationships in the Chilean raspberry, avocado and table grape sectors highly predict each other's and the farmers' performance. Thereby, the results do not differ greatly among the three supply chains. The results provide interesting implications, indicating that Chilean small and medium-sized farms but also large farmers can increase farm performance by connecting more closely with trading partners. Furthermore, the findings give governmental offices the opportunity to increase their support for farmers. </jats:p>",

However, the quality safety issues of agricultural products still occur frequently because both specialized farmers’ cooperatives and supermarkets have insufficient safety investment. In order to study the necessity, goal, and incentive decision schemes of safety investment in “agriculture super-docking” supply chain, three kinds of models, which include noncooperatives distributed decision-making model, centralized decision-making model, and incentive coordination models led by cooperatives and supermarkets, are, respectively, set up in this paper. Conclusions are drawn as follows: when making the uncooperative decentralized decision, both cooperatives and supermarkets have the moral risks to decrease the safety investment, but appropriate measures can achieve the coordination of the supply chain; when achieving the coordination of supply chain, the two contacts under the guidance of cooperatives and supermarkets are the same, and the schemes of distributing profits are also the same. Moreover, a practical case is given to improve the effectiveness and feasibility of the incentive decision schemes.</jats:p>"

It has been covered extensively in literature that the Niger River has undergone changes along its course in the Holocene, as implied by the large bend it makes in Mali. However, other enigmatic bends further downstream are indicative of an older and more complicated history that has yet to be understood, and is the focus of this paper. Until now, sediment supply from the Niger River has been considered as being negligible compared to that of the Benue River. The results of this study imply that the contribution from the Niger River was more important than previously thought. The Niger River obtained its present-day geometry in three phases: a Bida Basin phase (Maastrichtian–Miocene); a Iullemmeden Basin phase (Miocene–Pleistocene); and a present-day Niger River phase (Holocene). In the Miocene, an important capture event occurred, increasing the incipient drainage basin by 10\n            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>\n            km\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            , thereby changing the provenance of the sediment supplied to the Niger Delta from mainly crystalline basement to mixed lithologies including sandstone, shale, limestone and volcanic outcrops.\n          </jats:p>",

The problem is based on a production network of two echelons with multiple plants, a set of potential distribution centers, and customers. The problem is formulated as an optimization model with two objective functions based on time and cost. This paper proposes three changes to the original model to compare the sets of efficient solutions and the computational time required to obtain them. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the existing literature by incorporating approaches for the supply of product to customers through multiple sources, the direct flow between plants and customers, without this necessarily implying removing the distribution centers, and the product flow between distribution centers. From these approaches, we generate mathematical programming models and propose to solve through the epsilon‐constraint approach for generating Pareto fronts and thus compare each of these approaches with the original model. The models are implemented in GAMS and solved with CPLEX.</jats:p>",

Results show that the increasing population and limitations in cultivated land will strain Egyptian food security. Only in high cultivated areas and high grain yield scenarios before 2020, or in high cultivated areas and mid grain yield scenarios before 2015, can food supply be basically satisfied (assurance rate ≥ 80%) under a standard of 400 kg per capita. Population carrying capacity in 2030 is between 51.45 and 89.35 million. Thus, we propose the use of advanced technologies in agriculture and the adjustment of plant structure and cropping systems to improve land utilization efficiency.

Spontaneous correction of the deficiency, also known as revertant mosaicism, is caused by a second somatic mutation that restores protein expression resulting in clinically healthy (revertant) patches surrounded by fragile (mutant) skin. Interestingly, in some patients, patches of revertant skin show hyperpigmentation. To study the possible role of affected proteins in pigmentation and melanocyte distribution, we investigated clinical documentation and skin biopsy specimens of 13 revertant <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EB</jats:styled-content> patients having correcting mutations in the <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">COL</jats:styled-content>17A1, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LAMB</jats:styled-content>3</jats:italic> or <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">COL</jats:styled-content>7A1</jats:italic> genes. Analysis revealed that lack of C17 led to decreased melanin intensity and melanocyte density in the epidermis when compared with the revertant patches. Reversions of <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LAMB</jats:styled-content>3</jats:italic> and <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">COL</jats:styled-content>7A1</jats:italic> in keratinocytes did not influence clinical pigmentation or density of melanocytes. We conclude that in human skin, melanocyte supply to the epidermis depends on C17 expression in keratinocytes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to assess the environmental performance and burdens of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The RFID application involves additional environmental impacts to the life cycle of the product to which it is applied. Environmental burdens are caused, for instance, by the emissions and energy requirements that occur during the tag production, transportation and disposal. At the same time, when RFID technology is applied to tag fresh food products, some environmental benefits can be achieved. As an example, food waste can be reduced by optimizing the supply chain processes; therefore, the related environmental impacts can be avoided. The environmental sustainability of the RFID technology is evaluated through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, considering its application to a fresh product, namely fresh milk. The assessment was made exploiting the midpoint indicators recommended in the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook, edited by the Joint Research Centre of European Commission. Results show that the RFID application reduces the environmental impacts in all the categories considered, and that, overall, the environmental benefits resulting from the food waste reduction significantly overcome the tag impacts (more than 5 times). Given the lack of studies focusing on the environmental impact of RFID technology, this work might represent an important addition to the literature. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Revenue-sharing contract is a kind of mechanism to improve performance or to achieve perfect coordination of supply chain. Considering a three-level supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a distributor, and a retailer who faces a stochastic and sales effort dependent demand, the paper analyzes the impact of sales effort on supply chain coordination and expounds the reasons why traditional revenue-sharing contract cannot coordinate supply chain in this condition. Given three cases: only the retailer bears the sales effort cost, only the manufacturer bears the sales effort cost, and the retailer bears the sales effort cost with the manufacturer, the paper proposes an improved revenue-sharing contract based on quantity discount policy to coordinate the supply chain. It illustrates that improved revenue sharing contract can coordinate supply chain by implementing it in one transaction or two transactions of three-level supply chain. The model of improved revenue-sharing contract is optimized, respectively, by addition form and multiplication form with sales effort dependent demand. Formulas are given to determine the optimal contract parameters. Finally, numerical experiments are given to test the accuracy of the model of improved revenue-sharing contract.</jats:p>"

Eggs were sampled (August to November 2009) from multiple locations across the impoundment, but occurred at highest densities in water shallower than 40 cm along shorelines with a dense cover of submerged terrestrial vegetation. The numbers of eggs declined over the study period and all samples were dominated by early developmental stages and high proportions of unviable eggs. The quality of the littoral spawning habitats declined over the study as flooded terrestrial grasses decomposed and filamentous algae coverage increased. Water temperatures at the spawning site exhibited extreme variations, ranging over 20·4° C  in water shallower than 5 cm.

We pick two typical carbon emission reduction policies to research how emission regulation influences the profit and carbon footprint of a typical supply chain. We use the input-output model to capture the interrelated demand link between an arbitrary pair of two nodes in scenarios without or with carbon emission constraints. We design optimization algorithm to obtain joint optimal production quantities combination for maximizing overall profit under regulatory policies, respectively. Furthermore, numerical studies by featuring exponentially distributed demand compare systemwide performances in various scenarios. We build the “carbon emission elasticity of profit (CEEP)” index as a metric to evaluate the impact of regulatory policies on both chainwide emissions and profit. Our results manifest that by facilitating the mandatory emission cap in proper installation within the network one can balance well effective emission reduction and associated acceptable profit loss. The outcome that CEEP index when implementing Carbon emission tax is elastic implies that the scale of profit loss is greater than that of emission reduction, which shows that this policy is less effective than mandatory cap from industry standpoint at least.</jats:p>"

The proposed embedded controller is programmed to perform MPPT for solar PV panel and WTG, SOC estimation and battery, maintaining a constant voltage at PCC and power flow control by regulating the reference currents of the controller in an instantaneous basis. The instantaneous variation in reference currents of the controller enhances the controller response as it accommodates the effect of continuously varying solar insolation and wind speed in the power management. It also prioritizes the sources for consumption to achieve maximum usage of green energy than grid energy. The simulation results of the proposed power management system with real-time solar radiation and wind velocity data collected from solar centre, KEC, and experimental results for a sporadically varying load demand are presented in this paper and the results are encouraging from reliability and stability perspectives.</jats:p>"

These different standards and missing guidelines for electronic procurement and supply in the healthcare domain lead to little or no interoperability between the participating procurement and supply systems.

Previous studies have minimized the additional cost with a network design that used the concept of level of service and unit delay cost; however, in cases of disruption in a regional distribution center (RDC), companies commonly must secure a bypass through another RDC and pay more to use a faster transportation mode. The aim of this study is to develop a dual-route distribution strategy to minimize the logistics costs that stem from the disruption in the RDC. The model addressed in this study determines the RDC allocation and the freight dualization ratio to establish a bypass before a disruption occurs and to ensure the punctuality of delivery without losses due to late delivery. An application of the model uses an actual company's network data. The results of this application show that the dual-route distribution strategy can be more advantageous than a single-route distribution strategy. The model provides a theoretical basis for the use of the dual-route strategy to minimize the direct and indirect costs associated with the RDC disruption. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter identifies potential areas in which firms can integrate green into current business practices based on the existing literature. An extensive literature review was conducted to examine research and practice with respect to the concurrent implementation of green, lean, and global supply chain strategies. The applied literature analysis identifies that lean not only serves as a catalyst but is also synergistic for green. Lean is beneficial for green practices, and the implementation of green practices, in turn, also has a positive influence on existing global business practices (Dües, Tan, &amp; Tim, 2013). The chapter provides an assessment of existing academic research on the relationship and links between lean and green supply chain management practices. Existing explanatory frameworks are explored and discussed, primarily based on objectives including: (a) identification processes where lean practices are synergized with a go-green philosophy of business, (b) advocating green practices as an essential element in the lean value chain, and (c) developing a green-lean framework based on existing literature for competitive advantage for business firms.</jats:p>"

The expanding service sector within the e-business industry, growing popularity of mobile phones, increased number of Internet users, and extensive competition in the e-commerce industry contribute to the astounding growth of China's Internet market. Despite all the optimism, there are still many issues challenging the development of e-commerce in China, particularly the constraints presented in the domestic and international supply chain systems.

If GM food products were introduced in the EU, the German food industry would be confronted with increased efforts to separate GM and non-GM processing lines and it would have to perform compulsory quality management. This paper analyses the costs of co-existence for producers of frozen pizza and chocolate in Germany. In order to provide an idea of the general magnitude of these costs, an adaptive calculation model was developed, supported by qualitative information from expert interviews for both sectors. The case studies reveal that the possibilities of the companies are quite different in terms of size, infrastructure, and available resources to operate parallel production. Companies which already have sufficient existing facilities to run separated production lines might have the opportunity for specialisation and could manage a possible emerging GM market situation.</jats:p>",

Water deficit reduced the total surface area per plant but increased the proportion of nonleaf to total plant surface area. Net photosynthetic rates of leaves declined rapidly beginning 25 days after anthesis. In contrast, the net photosynthetic rates of bracts and capsule walls were insensitive to soil moisture stress and decreased by a small amount between 25 and 45 days after anthesis. The relative contribution of bracts and stalks to canopy apparent photosynthesis (CAP) increased under water deficit conditions. Cotton seed weight in the conventional irrigation treatment decreased by 10.1–29.7% when the bolls (capsule walls plus bracts) were darkened and by 5.3–9.9% when the stalks were darkened. On a percentage basis, both boll photosynthesis and stalk photosynthesis contributed more to seed weight when the plants were grown under water deficit conditions rather than nondeficit conditions. In conclusion, nonleaf organs contribute significantly to yield when cotton plants are under water stress during late growth stages.</jats:p>"

In order to provide reliable month of death distribution for sheep/goats, the approach developed here takes into account uncertainties regarding the age-at-death and the month of birth, based on classic archaeozoological techniques. We show that sheep slaughtering rarely occurred from late spring to early autumn or from summer to mid-fall, both at Hârşova tell and Borduşani-Popină. Conversely, it is very likely that fishing activities took place primarily from spring to early autumn. This points to the existence of seasonal and complementary food supply strategies at both sites. Several possible explanations for these seasonal strategies are discussed. We also highlight the homogeneity in the management of domestic herds between the two sites, raising the question of a certain standardization in pastoral practices on a larger scale.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aiming to find the effect of the same status entities’ horizontal coordination on supply chain, this paper studied the coalition stability of dealers in a two-stage supply chain with one supplier and multiple dealers. First, a vertical sequential game model is built, where the supplier is leader and the multiple dealers are followers. In the second stage of the game, multiple dealers face two selections: playing Nash game with each other or developing a coalition. Then, according to the results acquired by comparing the dealers’ profits which depend on their coalition situations, the criterion of coalition stability is developed. Finally, numerical simulation is used to verify the validity of the model, and some insights are obtained. For example, if the sensitivity coefficient<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>of the market price is fixed, dealers’ coalition tends to be stable with the increasing of the substitution rate<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>in a reasonable range; the supplier’s optimal wholesale price is constant with and without dealer’s coalition, but dealers’ coalition causes demand to decrease, which leads to the decrease of the supplier’s profit too. The result of this paper provides an important reference for the formation of dealers’ coalition in IT or automobile supply chain.</jats:p>"

The demo board presented can be easily modified to drive other SiC and GaN transistors available in the market. The 200°C limitation of the demo board is due to passives, PCB material, and the solder paste used.

A multiobjective programming model which jointly minimizes costs, emissions, and employee injuries in a supply chain is first constructed. Using the weighted‐sum approach with weights setting by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the model is solved by normalization of the minima of the three objectives. A numerical example is conducted to test the model. The results show that it is indeed possible to integrate environmental and social metrics in supply chain system optimization. Multiobjective optimization can balance the social, environmental, and economic performance. This paper presents a new multidimension perspective for optimizing supply chain; it will inspire practitioners to change their decision ideas and improve supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The submarine canyons of the Brittany continental slope (Bay of Biscay—Northeast Atlantic) were studied to describe the conditions in which cold‐water corals occur in these areas and their consequences for coral metabolism. Near‐bottom current, oxygen, temperature, and particle flux, simultaneously measured for 2 yr at 850 m depth, revealed by spectral analysis the presence of several frequencies with a dominant semidiurnal tidal cycle and a current direction determined exclusively by the canyon topography. Sediment trap data also showed a seasonal input of material with a large peak of particles and carbon fluxes at the end of winter. Daily particle and carbon fluxes at 20 m above the bottom were 2.49 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 20 mg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. At the same area, in situ incubation of two cold‐water coral species, <jats:italic>Lophelia pertusa</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Madrepora oculata</jats:italic>, using the Calmar benthic chamber indicated a coral oxygen consumption rate of 7.3 µmol O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> dry weight g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and a production rate of ΣCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and NH<jats:sup>+</jats:sup><jats:sub>4</jats:sub> equal to 7.6 µmol CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 0.18 µmol NH<jats:sup>+</jats:sup><jats:sub>4</jats:sub> g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. The respiratory coefficient was equal to 1, indicating an omnivore food source. This conclusion was also confirmed by the O : N index. The coral energy requirement was equal to 2.1 mmol C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Comparison between carbon input in terms of particle flux and carbon oxidation rate by corals indicates that the energy supply to the bottom seems not sufficient to sustain the development and growth of cold‐water coral all year in the Brittany canyons. However, coral necessarily require another source of energy such as zooplankton, particularly in summer and autumn when particle flux is reduced. Overall, the presence of abundant cold‐water coral in the Brittany submarine canyons indicates that this location is ideal for their development given appropriate hydrological condition, favorable hard substrate, and also food availability.</jats:p>",

The remanufacturing cost depends on the quality of used product. The problem is maximizing the manufacturer’s expected profit by jointly determining the collected quantity of used product and the ordered quantity of raw material. Following that we analyze the model with a fill rate constraint and a budget constraint separately and then with both the constraints. Next, to handle the imprecise nature of some parameters of the model, we develop the model with both constraints in bifuzzy environment. Finally numerical examples are presented to illustrate the models. The sensitivity analysis is also conducted to generate managerial insight.</jats:p>"

Motivated by this real industrial practice, we study a single‐supplier single‐retailer two‐echelon fashion supply chain selling a short‐life fashion product of either a national brand or a private label. The supplier refers to the national/designer brand owner and the retailer refers to the department store. We investigate the supply chain coordination issue and examine the supply chain agents’ performances under the mentioned two contracts. We find the analytical evidence that there is a similar relative risk performance but different absolute risk performances between the national brand and the private label. This finding provides an important implication in strategic interaction for the risk‐averse department stores in product assortment and brand management. Furthermore, we explore the impact of sales effort on the supply chain system and find that the supply chain is able to achieve coordination if and only if the supplier (i.e., the national brand or the private label) is willing to share the cost of the sales effort.</jats:p>",

Specifically, it utilizes a hybrid Delphi-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to explore the relevant criteria for the formation and maintenance of a strategic alignment for heterarchical transport collaboration. The importance of this work is that it applies a novel hybrid approach for identifying criteria for success to a little-studied form of supply chain collaboration: heterarchical collaborative transport. The criteria for this form of collaboration identified by the application of Delphi-AHP include ones from the technical, risk, financial, organizational, and operational categories. This novel application of the hybrid approach leveraged the expertise of transportation collaboration experts from the U.K., France, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Italy to identify key criteria for a strategic alignment between heterarchical collaboration partners. Such collaborative initiatives are important in industry as an environmentally conscious, yet efficient and effective strategy for the transport of raw materials and finished products in the supply chain.</p>",

The maximum allowable PVGS installation capacity is obtained by executing load flow analysis without violating the voltage magnitude and voltage variation ratio limits. However, the estimated power generation of PVGS is applied to know its impact on the power system according to the hourly solar irradiation and temperature. After that, the cost-benefit analysis of payback years (PBY) and net present value (NPV) method is derived considering the cash flow from utilities annual fuel and loss saving, the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost, and the capital investment cost. The power network in Kiribati (PUB DNST) is selected for study in this paper.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In high-speed applications, MOS current mode logic (MCML) is a good alternative. Scaling down supply voltage of the MCML circuits can achieve low power-delay product (PDP). However, the current almost all MCML circuits are realized with dual-rail scheme, where the NMOS configuration in series limits the minimum supply voltage. In this paper, single-rail MCML (SRMCML) circuits are described, which can avoid the devices configuration in series, since their logic evaluation block can be realized by only using MOS devices in parallel. The relationship between the minimum supply voltage of the SRMCML circuits and the model parameters of MOS transistors is derived, so that the minimum supply voltage can be estimated before circuit designs. An MCML dynamic flop-flop based on SRMCML is also proposed. The optimization algorithm for near-threshold sequential circuits is presented. A near-threshold SRMCML mode-10 counter based on the optimization algorithm is verified. Scaling down the supply voltage of the SRMCML circuits is also investigated. The power dissipation, delay, and power-delay products of these circuits are carried out. The results show that the near-threshold SRMCML circuits can obtain low delay and small power-delay product.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the shipping chain configuration and the modeling of its relevant logistics choices, including number of stops and stop types. A brief descriptive analysis of the results of an online establishment survey to explore different shipping chain configurations used by decision makers (business establishments) was done. Also, a system of hierarchical database models of shipping chain choice for freight transportation was presented. A system of decision tree models was proposed to determine the shipping chain configuration of freight transportation by identifying number of stops and type of stops per chain. The results of the survey were used for analysis and model estimation. The proposed decision tree models were developed by using 80% of the observations in the data, and the remaining 20% were used to validate the models. The results of model estimation indicated that shipments’ attributes were the most significant variables in predicting the configuration of the shipping chain. The results of the validation showed that the estimated trees could predict the shipping chain configuration for the test data with an acceptable precision, which confirmed that decision tree models were powerful tools that could be used to predict shipping chain configurations of freight flows. </jats:p>",

However, the original revenue-sharing contract cannot coordinate the supply chain under disruptions in circumstances of certain incidents leading to significant changes in market demand and causing additional deviation costs. To solve the problem, this essay introduces two improved forms of revenue-sharing contract: a mixed contract form based on a quantity discount policy and a pure form, which are characterized by antidisruption ability. The model of improved revenue-sharing contract is optimized when the market demand is in the additive form or in the multiplicative form with price dependent demand. Formulas are given to calculate the optimal contract parameters. Finally, this essay demonstrates the accuracy of the model of improved revenue-sharing contract with the help of numerical examples.</jats:p>"

This led to the development of a surgical technique for an extended posterior approach to the hip and pelvis that exposes the supra-acetabular ilium and preserves the glutei during revision hip surgery. Proximal to distal mobilisation of the gluteus medius from the posterior gluteal line permits exposure and mobilisation of the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle between the sciatic notch and the entrance to the gluteus medius, enabling a wider exposure of the supra-acetabular ilium. This technique was subsequently used in nine patients undergoing revision total hip replacement involving the reconstruction of nine Paprosky 3B acetabular defects, five of which had pelvic discontinuity. Intra-operative electromyography showed that the innervation of the gluteal muscles was not affected by surgery. Clinical follow-up demonstrated good hip abduction function in all patients. These results were compared with those of a matched cohort treated through a Kocher–Langenbeck approach. Our modified approach maximises the exposure of the ilium above the sciatic notch while protecting the gluteal muscles and their neurovascular bundle. </jats:p><jats:p> Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2014;96-B:48–53. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the channel coordination issue of a supply chain with a risk-neutral manufacturer and a loss-averse retailer facing stochastic demand that is sensitive to sales effort. Under the loss-averse newsvendor setting, a distribution-free gain/loss-sharing-and-buyback (GLB) contract has been shown to be able to coordinate the supply chain. However, we find that a GLB contract remains ineffective in managing the supply chain when retailer sales efforts influence the demand. To effectively coordinate the channel, we propose to combine a GLB contract with sales rebate and penalty (SRP) contract. In addition, we discover a special class of gain/loss contracts that can coordinate the supply chain and arbitrarily allocate the expected supply chain profit between the manufacturer and the retailer. We then analyze the effect of loss aversion on the retailer’s decision-making behavior and supply chain performance. Finally, we perform a numerical study to illustrate the findings and gain additional insights.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents (1) a novel capacitated model for supply chain network design which considers manufacturing, distribution, and quality costs (named SCND‐COQ model) and (2) five combinatorial optimization methods, based on nonlinear optimization, heuristic, and metaheuristic approaches, which are used to solve realistic instances of practical size. The SCND‐COQ model is a mixed‐integer nonlinear problem which can be used at a strategic planning level to design a supply chain network that maximizes the total profit subject to meeting an overall quality level of the final product at minimum costs. The SCND‐COQ model computes the quality‐related costs for the whole supply chain network considering the interdependencies among business entities. The effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches is shown using numerical experiments. These methods allow solving more realistic (capacitated) supply chain network design problems including quality‐related costs (inspections, rework, opportunity costs, and others) within a reasonable computational time.</jats:p>",

The hemorrhage mainly occurred from IPDA. The abruptly branching of IPDA from superior mesenteric artery enabled successful catheterization of the IPDA with an angled microcatheter. Hemostasis was obtained by embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate. Gastroendoscopy depicted a duodenal hemi-circumferential ulcer. No symptoms related to hemorrhage were found at the last follow-up at 12 months.</jats:p>",

First, by analyzing the self-organization of supply chain, the supply chain resilience is described as a macroscopic property that generates from self-organizing behavior of each enterprise on the microlevel. Second, a MAS-based supply chain resilience model is established and its local fitness function, neighborhood structure, and interaction rules that are applicable to supply chain system are designed through viewing the enterprise as an agent. Finally, with the help of a case, we find that there is an agglomeration effect and a SOC characteristic in supply chain and the evolution of supply chain is controlled by parameters of MAS. Managers can control the supply chain within the resilient range and choose a good balance between interest and risk by controlling enterprises’ behavior.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a methodology for integrating the supply chain that can be applied in any type of business. To demonstrate its relevance, a case study is performed at a handmade shoe company.

Energy planning represents an investment-decision problem where information needs to be aggregated from credible sources to predict both demand and supply of energy. To do this there are varying methods ranging from the use of portfolio theory to managing risk and maximizing portfolio performance under a variety of unpredictable economic outcomes. The future demand for energy and need to use solar energy in order to avoid future energy crisis in Jiangsu province in China require energy planners in the province to abandon their reliance on traditional, “least-cost,” and stand-alone technology cost estimates and instead evaluate conventional and renewable energy supply on the basis of a hybrid of optimization models in order to ensure effective and reliable supply. Our task in this research is to propose measures towards addressing optimal solar energy forecasting by employing a systematic optimization approach based on a hybrid of weather and energy forecast models. After giving an overview of the sustainable energy issues in China, we have reviewed and classified the various models that existing studies have used to predict the influences of the weather influences and the output of solar energy production units. Further, we evaluate the performance of an exemplary ensemble model which combines the forecast output of two popular statistical prediction methods using a dynamic weighting factor.</jats:p>"

The port city of Chittagong is not only facing the problem of inadequate water supply but also serious threat due mainly to the scarcity of safe water. This paper attempts to characterize and analyze the supply water quality in Chittagong Metropolitan City (CMC) from health and environmental perspective using a set of parameters: physical, chemical and micro-biological. The paper focuses on key challenges facing the sector today, especially in the provision of urban water service delivery. The thrust there has been to identify weaknesses in current water supply management, and explore options to address the chronic lack of service provisions. The overall finding is that the dwellers of CMC have been suffering from irregular, inadequate and unsafe water supply due mainly because of inefficient management practices. The situation is worse in low income residential areas. Regular monitoring of water quality along the distribution networks, timely repair and maintenance, improving information systems, uses of advanced technology, provisions for staff training, awareness building among users and stakeholders, and promotion of community-based co-management governing systems have been strongly suggested. </jats:p>",

The closed-loop supply chain network consists of suppliers tier, manufacturer tier, retailers tier, and demand markets tier, in which the manufacturers collect used products from the demand markets directly. Product lifetime is introduced to denote the maximum times of manufacturing and remanufacturing, and the relation between adjacent periods is described by inventory transfer. By variational inequalities and complementary theory, the optimal behaviors of all the players are modeled, and, in turn, the governing closed-loop supply chain network equilibrium model is established. The model is solved by modified project contraction algorithm with fixed step. Optimal equilibrium results are computed and analyzed through numerical examples. The impacts of collection rate, remanufacturing conversion rate, product lifetime, and carbon emission cap on equilibrium states are analyzed. Finally, several managerial insights are given to provide decision support for entrepreneurs and government official along with some inspirations for future research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies the trust issue in a two-echelon supply chain information sharing process. In a supply chain, the retailer reports the forecasted demand to the supplier. Traditionally, the supplier’s trust in the retailer’s reported information is based on the retailer’s reputation. However, this paper considers that trust is random and is also affected by the reputation and the demand gap. The supplier and retailer have been shown to have different evaluations regarding the degree of trust. Furthermore, distrust is inherently linked to perceived risk. To mitigate perceived risk, a two-stage decision process with an unpayback deposit contract is proposed. At the first stage, the supplier and the retailer negotiate the deposit contract. At the second stage, a Stackelberg game is used to determine the retailer’s reported demand and the supplier’s production quantity. We show that the deposits from the retailer’s and supplier’s perspectives are different. When the retailer’s reported demand is equal to the supplier’s forecasted demand, the retailer’s evaluation of the deposit is more than that of supplier’s. When the retailer’s reported demand is equal to the retailer’s forecasted demand, the deposit from the retailer’s perspective is at the lowest level.</jats:p>"

Further, this paper analyzed the influence of the parameters by numerical simulations and concluded three conclusions. First, when the collection price is to a critical value, the system will be into chaos state. Second, when the sale price of remanufacturing products is more than a critical value, the system will be in chaos state. Last, the initial value of the collection price is sensitive, small changes may cause fluctuations of market price.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most of the recent advances in activity-based models (ABMs) have been on the demand side, that is, description of the individual needs for certain types of activities and travel as a function of person, household, and accessibility variables. The supply side of activities that describes characteristics of the locations where a certain activity can be undertaken remains largely unexplored. Two examples of specific activity generators for which the supply side of activity is essential for modeling are major universities and special events. Travel behavior and activity patterns of university students are different from that of the general population, and therefore modeling them with the necessary level of detail enhances the ABM forecasting ability. The same is true about special events such as sporting events. Special events participants can form a substantial part of the overall travel demand in the subarea on the event day, and therefore it is important to model them properly. Although previous studies have acknowledged the importance of modeling university students and special events participants, the challenge remains to integrate them in an ABM framework. This paper describes new practical methods for addressing the supply side of activities (using university students and special events as examples) in the framework of an operational ABM developed for Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. The paper provides details on the data and methods used to develop university and special events submodels. The methodology and technical approach used to incorporate these models in the ABM framework are presented. </jats:p>",

This model belongs to the context of oligopolistic firms that compete noncooperatively in a Cournot‐Nash framework under a stochastic environment. To satisfy the demands, we use two different channels: manufacturing new products and remanufacturing returned products through recycling used components. Since both the demands and product returns are uncertain, we consider two types of risks: overstocking and understocking of multiproducts in the forward supply chain. Then we set up the Cournot‐Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network whereby we maximize every oligopolistic firm′s expected profit by deciding the production quantities of each new product as well as the path flows of each product on the forward supply chain. Furthermore, we formulate the Cournot‐Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network as a variational inequality and prove the\nexistence and the monotonicity of the variational inequality. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our model.</jats:p>",

Different from general project performance evaluation, scheduling activities are usually continuous and multiperiod. Therefore, the weight of scheduling performance evaluation index is not unchanged, but dynamically varied. In this paper, the factors that influence the scheduling performance are analyzed in three levels which are strategic environment, operating process, and scheduling results. Based on these three levels, the scheduling performance evaluation index system of LSSC is established. In all, a new performance evaluation method proposed based on dynamic index weight will have three innovation points. Firstly, a multiphase dynamic interaction method is introduced to improve the quality of quantification. Secondly, due to the large quantity of second‐level indexes and the requirements of dynamic weight adjustment, the maximum attribute deviation method is introduced to determine weight of second‐level indexes, which can remove the uncertainty of subjective factors. Thirdly, an adjustment coefficient method based on set‐valued statistics is introduced to determine the first‐level indexes weight. In the end, an application example from a logistics company in China is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we introduce a possible modeling and algorithms to solve a multiproduct two‐layer supply chain network design problem. The decisions involved are the DCs location and capacity design decision and the initial distribution planning decision. First we describe the problem and give a mixed integer programming (MIP) model; such problem is NP‐hard and it is not easy to reduce the complexity. Inspired by it, we develop a transformation mechanism of relaxing the fixed cost and adding some virtual nodes and arcs to the original network. Thus, a network flow problem (NFP) corresponding to the original problem has been formulated. Given that we could solve the NFP as a minimal cost flow problem. The solution procedures and network simplex algorithm (INS) are discussed. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the model and algorithms, the performance measure experimental has been conducted. The experiments and result showed that comparing with MIP model solved by genetic algorithm (GA) and Benders, decomposition algorithm (BD) the NFP model and INS are also effective and even more efficient for both small‐scale and large‐scale problems.</jats:p>",

This paper contrasts the bullwhip effect for a two-stage supply chain consisting of one supplier and two retailers under three forecasting methods based on the market share. We can quantify the correlation coefficient between the two retailers clearly, in consideration of market share. The two retailers both employ the order-up-to inventory policy for replenishments. The bullwhip effect is measured, respectively, under the minimum mean squared error (MMSE), moving average (MA), and exponential smoothing (ES) forecasting methods. The effect of autoregressive coefficient, lead time, and the market share on a bullwhip effect measure is investigated by using algebraic analysis and numerical simulation. And the comparison of the bullwhip effect under three forecasting methods is conducted. The conclusion suggests that different forecasting methods and various parameters lead to different bullwhip effects. Hence, the corresponding forecasting method should be chosen by the managers under different parameters in practice.</jats:p>"

The service integrator can encourage cooperation from service suppliers by sharing their cost during the service, which we assume can increase the sales by accumulating the reputation of the supply chain. A differential game model is established with the logistics service supply chain that consists of one service integrator and one supplier. And we derive the optimal solutions of the Nash equilibrium without cost sharing contract and the Stackelberg equilibrium with the integrator as the leader who partially shares the cost of the efforts of the supplier. The results make the benefits of the cost sharing contract in increasing the profits of both players as well as the whole supply chain explicit, which means that the cost sharing contract is an effective coordination mechanism in the long-term relationship of the members in a logistics service supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we propose a new four-dimensional dynamical model to simulate the internal dynamic evolution process and predict future trends of water supply and demand. At the beginning, a new four-dimensional dynamical model with uncertain parameters is established. Then, the gray code hybrid accelerating genetic algorithm (GHAGA) is adopted to identify the unknown parameters of the system based on the statistic data (1998–2009). Finally, the dynamical analysis of the system is further studied by Lyapunov-exponent, phase portraits, and Lyapunov exponent theory. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed water resources supply-demand system is in a steady state and is suitable for simulating the dynamical characteristics of a complex water supply and demand system. According to the trends of the water supply and demand of several nonlinear simulation cases, the corresponding measures can be proposed to improve the steady development of the water resources supply-demand system.</jats:p>"

This model aims to minimize the average unit volume operation cost of logistics service integrator and maximize the average satisfaction degree of functional logistics service providers. In order to verify the viability and effectiveness of our model, a specific example is numerically analyzed. Some interesting conclusions are obtained. First, along with the increase of completion time delay coefficient permitted by customers, the possible inserting order volume first increases and then trends to be stable. Second, supply chain performance reaches the best when the volume of inserting order is equal to the surplus volume of the normal operation capacity in mass service process. Third, the larger the normal operation capacity in mass service process is, the bigger the possible inserting order’s volume will be. Moreover, compared to increasing the completion time delay coefficient, improving the normal operation capacity of mass service process is more useful.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the effect of a customer order decoupling point (CODP) on the time scheduling performance should be considered. To minimize the total order operation cost of the LSSC, minimize the difference between the expected and actual time of completing the service orders, and maximize the satisfaction of functional logistics service providers, this study establishes an LSSC time scheduling model based on the CODP. Matlab 7.8 software is used in the numerical analysis for a specific example. Results show that the order completion time of the LSSC can be delayed or be ahead of schedule but cannot be infinitely advanced or infinitely delayed. Obtaining the optimal comprehensive performance can be effective if the expected order completion time is appropriately delayed. The increase in supply chain comprehensive performance caused by the increase in the relationship coefficient of logistics service integrator (LSI) is limited. The relative concern degree of LSI on cost and service delivery punctuality leads to not only changes in CODP but also to those in the scheduling performance of the LSSC.</jats:p>"

The impact of advertising investment will last several planning periods besides the current period due to delay effect. Based on noncooperative game theory, variational inequality, and Lagrange dual theory, the optimal economic behaviors of the suppliers, the manufactures, the retailers,  and the consumers in the demand markets are modeled. In turn, the supply chain network equilibrium model is proposed and computed by modified project contraction algorithm with fixed step.

The main work of this paper is to analyze the impact of DGs on LSC so as to answer the three key questions. It resolves the planning problem through three steps: (i) two LSC models considering DGs’ access are developed, in which two different transfer strategies are considered: direct load transfer and indirect load transfer; (ii) the method of combined simple method and point estimate method is proposed. At last, based on a base case, when the configuration of DGs is changing, the impact of DGs on system LSC is studied.

In this paper, the literature on the supply chain profit is reviewed first, and then a two-level and four-party supply chain which consists of a supplier, an e-commerce platform, third-party logistics, and demander is taken into consideration. The profit function of supply chain under e-commerce is formulated by taking the price of product and the maximum supply amount under certain investment as decision-making variables and taking the expected value of random variables of price as the setting sales quantity. Finally, the existence of maximum profit in the supply chain is proved in the model, and the coordination of supply chain under e-commerce environment can be achieved by setting coordination parameters when the relevant cost parameters of supply chain members satisfy certain conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper studies how the combination of the manufacturer’s carbon emission reduction and the retailer’s emission reduction relevant promotion impacts the performances of a dyadic supply chain in low-carbon environment. We consider three typical scenarios, that is, centralized and decentralized without or with side-payment. We compare measures of supply chain performances, such as profitabilities, emission reduction efficiencies, and effectiveness, in these scenarios. To improve chain-wide performances, a new side-payment contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and numerical experiments are also conducted. We find the following. (1) In decentralized setting, the retailer will provide emission cutting allowance to the manufacturer only if their unit product profit margin is higher enough than the manufacturer’s, and the emission reduction level of per unit product is a monotonically increasing function with respect to the cost pooling proportion provided by the retailer; (2) the new side-payment contract can coordinate the dyadic supply chain successfully due to its integrating sales promotion effort and emission reduction input, which results in system pareto optimality under decentralized individual rationality but achieves a collective rationality effect in the centralized setting; (3) when without external force’s regulation, consumers’ low-carbon awareness is to enhance consumers’ utility and decrease profits of supply chain firms.</jats:p>"

Many retailers have been pushing their suppliers to invest this technology. However, its associated costs seem to prohibit its widespread application. This paper analyzes the situation of service level in a retail supply chain, which has resulted from misplaced inventory and lead-time. By newsvendor model, we analyze the difference between with- and without-RFID technologies in service level of centralized and decentralized supply chains, respectively. Then with different service levels, we determine the tag cost thresholds at which RFID technology investment becomes profitable in centralized and decentralized supply chains, respectively. Furthermore, we apply a linear transfer payment coefficient strategy to coordinate with the decentralized supply chain. It is found that whether the adoption of RFID technology improves the service level depends on the cost of RFID tag in the centralized system, but it improves the service level in the decentralized system when only the supplier bears the cost of RFID tag. Moreover, the same cost thresholds of RFID tag with different service levels exist in both the centralized and the decentralized cases.</jats:p>"

Standard 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit–variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing lacks resolution power for accurately discriminating closely related clones that often compose Beijing strain populations. Therefore, we evaluated a set of 7 additional, hypervariable MIRU-VNTR loci for better resolution and tracing of such strains, using a collection of 535 Beijing isolates from six world regions where these strains are known to be prevalent. The typeability and interlaboratory reproducibility of these hypervariable loci were lower than those of the 24 standard loci. Three loci (2163a, 3155, and 3336) were excluded because of their redundant variability and/or more frequent noninterpretable results compared to the 4 other markers. The use of the remaining 4-locus set (1982, 3232, 3820, and 4120) increased the number of types by 52% (from 223 to 340) and reduced the clustering rate from 58.3 to 36.6%, when combined with the use of the standard 24-locus set. Known major clonal complexes/24-locus-based clusters were all subdivided, although the degree of subdivision varied depending on the complex. Only five single-locus variations were detected among the hypervariable loci of an additional panel of 92 isolates, representing 15 years of clonal spread of a single Beijing strain in a geographically restricted setting. On this calibrated basis, we propose this 4-locus set as a consensus for subtyping Beijing clonal complexes and clusters, after standard typing.\n          </jats:p>",

Its improvement could enhance customer satisfaction and further increase customer demand while correspondingly it will increase service price and decrease customer satisfaction and demand. Therefore this paper discusses how to deal with such issues in logistics service supply chain (LSSC) with a logistics service integrator (LSI) and a customer. With the establishment of customer demand function for logistics services and profit functions of the LSI and the customer, three different decision modes are proposed (i.e., customization degree dominated by LSI, customization degree dominated by customer, and customization degree decided by concentrated supply chain); many interesting findings are achieved. Firstly, to achieve customization cooperation between LSI and customer, measures should be taken to make the unit increase cost of the customized logistics services lower than a certain value. Secondly, there are differences between the optimal customization degree dominated by LSI and that dominated by customer. And in both cases, the dominator could realize more profit than the follower. Thirdly, with the profit secondary distribution strategy, the modified decentralized decision mode could accomplish the maximum profit achieved in centralized decision mode and meanwhile get the optimal customization degree.</jats:p>"

We assume that the manufacturer launches a higher quality product in the second period for the technological innovation.

The analysis illustrates one‐stage, two‐stage, and three‐stage formulations of multiple‐period reservoir operation depending on the effects of operational constraints. There is a one‐stage model when storage capacity constraints are nonbinding. Release decisions depend on total water availability and exhibit equal marginal utilities. Binding upper (lower) storage capacity constraint blocks the effect of decreased (increased) water availability in the subsequent stages on release decisions in the preceding stages. When one storage capacity constraint is binding, multiple periods become two stages and a gap occurs between marginal utilities of water. When there are one upper and one lower binding storage capacity constraints, reservoir operation is characterized as a three‐stage model. Effects of forecast uncertainty and ending storage on reservoir operation are affected by reservoir storage capacity. When the storage capacity constraints are nonbinding, the reservoir can regulate streamflow in an extended timeframe, and current release decision is affected by forecast uncertainty of total streamflow and ending storage. When the storage capacity constraints are binding, the reservoir can regulate streamflow only in a short timeframe, and current release decision is primarily affected by forecast uncertainty of streamflow in the current stage.</jats:p>",

We consider the impact of a dominant retailer on the market retail price and his sales promotion opportunity and examine how the manufacturer can coordinate such a supply chain by revenue‐sharing contract after demand disruptions. We address the following important research questions in this paper. (i) How do we design an appropriate revenue‐sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain with a dominant retailer without demand disruptions? (ii) When demand is disrupted with variations in market scale and price sensitive coefficient, can the original contract still be valid? (iii) How do the demand disruptions affect the coordination mechanism under different disruption scenarios and how should the new contract change? Finally, we generate important insights by both analytical and numerical examples.</jats:p>",

In this paper, how an ocean carrier should set price of inbound container storage to the customer while facing the contract from the container terminal operator is first analyzed. Then, two different contract systems, the free-time contract system which is widely used in practice and the free-space contract system which is newly developed recently, are considered. In the two different contract systems, inbound container storage pricing models are constructed, and accordingly optimal solution approaches for the ocean carrier are provided. For comparison purpose, some numerical experiments for the two different contract systems are conducted to investigate the effects of the container terminal operator’s decision on the system outcomes. Numerical experiments show that (1) the carrier is more flexible in the free-space contract system and can receive more profit by using the free-storage-space as a pooling storage system and (2) the free-space contract system benefits both the carrier in profit and the busy terminal in traffic control.</jats:p>"

We establish the optimal portfolio policies for the firm with conditions to find the qualified suppliers. By defining a new function which contains the demand risk, the supplier’s risk, and the liquidity risk, we find that the optimal policy is to allocate different curves of this function to different suppliers.

This emergency system is modeled as a minimal queuing response time model of location and allocation. A solution to this complex mathematical problem is developed based on genetic algorithm.

This paper uses the model to research the effects brought about sharing demand information with potential entrants and building marketing channel, which reveals information sharing and channel building mechanism in the supply chain. The study found that the five-force model of Porter regards potential entrants only as a threat that is one-sided. When the channel competitiveness meets certain conditions, manufacturer and retailer will share demand information with potential entrants. Building composite marketing channel is the manufacturer's absolute dominant strategy. Channel construction will increase the entry barriers for potential entrants and weaken the effect of double marginalization; meanwhile, the performance of supply chain will be augmented.</jats:p>"

The intensity of emergencies is sequential and emergencies can be divided into two types (positive or negative) according to their effect on demand. When emergencies have negative effect on demand, the supplier’s sales will reduce and he would share information to the market. When emergencies have positive effect on demand, we find that when the price is under price cap the supplier will not share information to the market; when the price reaches price cap, the supplier will share a certain amount of information to the market. We were surprised to find that increasing demand is not always good for the supplier when there exist government price control and lost sales penalty, and information helps the supplier to effectively manipulate demand.</jats:p>",

To solve this NP-hard problem, a simple and improved differential evolution algorithm (IDE) is developed. The performance of the IDE is verified by benchmark functions. Moreover, results of comparative numerical example show the effectiveness of the proposed IDE. IDE can be used as a good candidate for the JR-CC model. Results of numerical examples also indicate that the JR-CC policy can result in considerable cost saving, and enhance the efficiency of a supply chain. But not all members in the supply chain can benefit a lot using this policy. Moreover, results of sensitivity analysis show that retailers have more willingness to adopt the JR-CC policy than the manufacturers because of the different cost savings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we propose two decision models for decentralized and centralized fresh produce supply chains with stochastic supply and demand and controllable transportation time. The optimal order quantity and the optimal transportation time in these two supply chain systems are derived. To improve profits in a decentralized supply chain, based on analyzing the risk taken by each participant in the supply chain, we design a set of contracts which can coordinate this type of fresh produce supply chain with stochastic supply and stochastic demand, and controllable transportation time as well. We also obtain a value range of contract parameters that can increase profits of all participants in the decentralized supply chain. The expected profits of the decentralized setting and the centralized setting are compared with respect to given numerical examples. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyses of the deterioration rate factor and the freshness factor are performed. The results of numerical examples show that the transportation time is shorter, the order quantity is smaller, the total profit of whole supply chain is less, and the possibility of cooperation between supplier and retailer is higher for the fresh produce which is more perishable and its quality decays more quickly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in traceability supply chains. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not effective and efficient to be used in RFID application systems. Following the analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. We adjust different smoothing windows according to different rates of uncertain data, employ different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguish ghost, missing, and incomplete data according to their apparent positions. We propose a comprehensive data model which is suitable for different application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequence, the position, and the time intervals. The scheme is suitable for cyclic or long paths. Moreover, we further propose a processing algorithm for group and independent objects. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates a collaborative scheduling model in the assembly system, wherein multiple suppliers have to deliver their components to the multiple manufacturers under the operation of Supply-Hub. We first develop two different scenarios to examine the impact of Supply-Hub. One is that suppliers and manufacturers make their decisions separately, and the other is that the Supply-Hub makes joint decisions with collaborative scheduling. The results show that our scheduling model with the Supply-Hub is a NP-complete problem, therefore, we propose an auto-adapted differential evolution algorithm to solve this problem. Moreover, we illustrate that the performance of collaborative scheduling by the Supply-Hub is superior to separate decision made by each manufacturer and supplier. Furthermore, we also show that the algorithm proposed has good convergence and reliability, which can be applicable to more complicated supply chain environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In real supply chain, a capital‐constrained retailer has two typical payment choices: the up‐front payment to receive a high discount price or the delayed payment to reduce capital pressure. We compare with the efficiency of optimal decisions of different participants, that is, supplier, retailer, and bank, under both types of payments based on a game equilibrium analysis. It shows that under the equilibrium, the delayed payment leads to a greater optimal order quantity from the retailer compared to the up‐front payment and, thus, improves the whole benefit of the supply chain. The numerical simulation for the random demand following a uniform distribution further verifies our findings. This study provides novel evidence that a dominant supplier who actively offers trade credit helps enhance the whole efficiency of a supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers the collaborative mechanisms of the Supply-Hub in the Assemble-to-Order system (ATO system hereafter) with upstream delivery uncertainty. We first propose a collaborative replenishment mechanism in the ATO system, and construct a replenishment model with delivery uncertainty in use of the Supply-Hub. After transforming the original model into a one-dimensional optimization problem, we derive the optimal assembly quantity and reorder point of each component. In order to enable the Supply-Hub to conduct collaborative replenishment with each supplier, the punishment and reward mechanisms are proposed. The numerical analysis illustrates that service level of the Supply-Hub is an increasing function of both punishment and reward factors. Therefore, by adjusting the two factors, suppliers’ incentives of collaborative replenishment can be significantly enhanced, and then the service level of whole ATO system can be improved.</jats:p>"
