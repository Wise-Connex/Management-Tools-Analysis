      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The food industry faces longstanding challenges in meeting sustainability practices within its supply chain, often prioritising commercial obligations and profit motives. However, there is a growing recognition of the critical role that sustainable food supply chain management (SFSCM) practices play in enhancing food security.Objectives: This study aims to establish the significance of SFSCM practices in enhancing food security. Furthermore, the study explores approaches to reduce challenges against implementation of SFSCM practices.Method: The study employed a qualitative approach and used stratified and purposive sampling techniques to interview 22 participants from a population of 9 gatekeeper institutions within the Zimbabwean food industry.Results: The findings highlighted several essential SFSCM practices covering waste management, logistics optimisation, water and energy conservation, employing qualified individuals, carbon emission reduction, corporate social responsibility, cost reduction, pricing efficiency, fair food distribution and continuous consumer taste surveys. Approaches to reduce SFSCM implementation challenges were also identified, and these include stakeholder communication plans, capacity building programmes, integrating sustainability into mission statements, budget allocation, lobbying for government support, and fostering collaborative engagements. Open information sharing was also emphasised.Conclusion: It is concluded that the adoption of identified SFSCM practices by food producers, intermediaries, suppliers, consumers and other stakeholders can significantly enhance food security and minimise hunger in nations.Contribution: This article contributes to the understanding of addressing SFSCM implementation challenges and provides valuable insights into the importance of sustainable practices in improving food security within the Zimbabwean food industry and the world at large.</jats:p>"

Yet, traditional research approaches to supply chain management (SCM) reflect only a limited understanding of process, offering accounts that overlook the constitutive role of dynamically interrelated processes and how their interplay over time shapes the trajectories of supply chains. This article argues that a process‐philosophical perspective is better suited as a starting point for identifying, analyzing, and interpreting the fluid and interwoven processes of supply chains and their co‐evolving environments. Drawing on examples from SCM research, the article offers insights into the nature of process‐thinking and process‐theoretical assumptions, including the analytical choices and challenges entailed in process research. Besides providing methodological guidance, the article highlights how process research methods equip SCM scholars with a powerful lens for studying transformational issues in this field, including sustainability, resilience, and the use of digitalization and technology.</jats:p>",

This study examines how variations in lead time affect key aspects of supply chain performance, including inventory management, production scheduling, and order fulfillment.\r\nMethodology: A mixed-methods approach is adopted, combining quantitative analysis through simulation modeling and qualitative insights derived from case studies of companies in the manufacturing and retail sectors. The simulation model accounts for different levels of lead time variability and its influence on stockouts, excess inventory, and overall supply chain responsiveness. Case studies are used to illustrate real-world challenges and strategies employed by businesses to mitigate the effects of lead time fluctuations.\r\nFindings: Findings indicate that higher lead time variability leads to increased inventory costs, stockouts, and delays in product deliveries. Companies that rely heavily on just-in-time (JIT) systems are particularly vulnerable to these fluctuations, whereas firms with flexible inventory strategies or buffer stock perform better in managing variability. Additionally, the study reveals that advanced demand forecasting and more resilient supplier relationships can significantly reduce the negative impact of lead time uncertainty. The analysis also highlights the importance of integrating lead time variability into the broader risk management framework of supply chains.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Based on these findings, recommendations include implementing more robust demand forecasting systems, optimizing safety stock levels, diversifying suppliers, and using advanced inventory management technologies. Moreover, it is advised that businesses foster stronger communication and collaboration with suppliers to reduce variability and improve lead time predictability. Future research should explore the potential of real-time data and AI-driven supply chain management systems to further mitigate lead time variability's impact on SCM.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Businesses may face different challenges in the realization and management of supply chain activities. To cope with these challenges and be successful in supply chain management, companies need supply chain strategies that are suitable for their product structures and objectives and strategic collaborations based on co-operation among supply chain members. In addition, to control and improve the results of the activities and strategies, the performance of logistics activities, which have a large share in the economic development of companies, should be measured and managed correctly. Therefore, supply chain strategies, supply chain integration, and logistics performance measurements have a critical importance in supply chain management, where the competition of companies is experienced and complexity is increasing day by day. In this framework, this study aims to investigate the relationship between the supply chain strategies and logistics performance of an enterprise and whether supply chain integration has a mediating role in this relationship. For this purpose, 417 data samples were collected and analyzed from the top 1000 exporter companies determined by the Turkish Exporters Assembly by a survey method, and the findings are analyzed and discussed. In the literature, there is no study that analyzes the relationship between the variables determined in this research from a mediator variable perspective. Therefore, this study presents original research in this field, and it is expected that the findings of the research will provide important benefits to companies and researchers and offer a new perspective to the literature. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that there is a significant and positive relationship between the supply chain strategies determined by companies and their logistics performance and supply chain integration. There is also a significant and positive relationship between supply chain integration and logistics performance. In addition, it has been concluded that supply chain integration plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between supply chain strategies and logistics performance. These results suggest the importance of supply chain strategies and supply chain integration in improving logistics performance. Therefore, in line with the research results, it is suggested that, to use supply chains for competitive advantage, managers should ensure supply chain integration by determining the right supply chain strategies in accordance with their objectives and product structures, and thus increase their logistics performance.</jats:p>"

Agility and collaboration are critical supply chain resilience elements for enhancing supply chain performance. However, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the impact of agility and collaboration on performance remains unexplored. Therefore, the major objective of this study was to examine the impact of supply chain agility and collaboration on supply chain performance within the healthcare sector in Qatar. In the same vein, it examined the moderating role of AI in these relationships. The study utilized 564 responses from supply chain and clinical unit managers in Qatar and was analysed using the partial least squares (PLS) path modelling technique. The findings of the study indicate a significant positive relationship between supply chain agility, collaboration, and performance. Furthermore, these relationships are found to be positively moderated by AI. This study supports the research paradigm and provides evidence regarding supply chain agility and collaboration and their impact on supply chain performance. More importantly, this study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on the moderating role of AI in enhancing these relationships.</jats:p>"

Moreover, enhancing the quality of export products is crucial for improving environmental sustainability, as it helps reduce waste emissions and other related factors. Therefore, this paper employs data from Chinese A-share-listed companies and customs data from 2001 to 2015 to investigate this relationship. The main findings are as follows: (i) The supply chain concentration negatively impacts the quality of export products, a finding that remains robust after testing. (ii) In some firms, such as those where top executives possess digital-related expertise, the adverse effects of the supply chain concentration are likely mitigated. (iii) The channels through which the supply chain concentration affects export product quality may include firm size, productivity, and supply chain efficiency. (iv) Enhancements in infrastructure resilience, firm structure resilience, and industrial structure resilience through investments in regional fixed assets, overseas subsidiaries, and advancements in industrial structure, respectively, are likely to mitigate the negative impacts of the supply chain concentration. These conclusions may hold significant value for promoting both societal and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

Threats such as military conflicts, port blockades, border instability, climate changes, and cyber threats introduce new challenges for companies, particularly Ukrainian ones, which require adaptive strategies to ensure the resilience of their supply chains. The purpose of this study is to systematize key geopolitical and geoeconomic risks affecting international supply chains and to identify optimal approaches to managing these risks under conditions of instability, especially for Ukrainian companies facing heightened threats. The study includes an analysis of global risks based on international scientific literature, specific risks in Ukraine and their impact on import, export, and transit chains, and the development of a generalized risk management model tailored to Ukrainian enterprises. The research identified effective risk management methods such as supply chain diversification, the creation of alternative routes, and the use of insurance mechanisms. A practical case study on risk management in the import of industrial fasteners illustrates the stages of collaboration with forwarders and carriers, partner selection, and response to disruptions, demonstrating approaches that can be used to minimize the impact of risks. The findings provide practical recommendations for Ukrainian companies, highlighting an adaptive approach to risk management that will help them maintain competitiveness and ensure supply chain resilience in a rapidly changing global environment. Future research should focus on integrating digital technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of international supply chains.</jats:p>"

The dominant club is characterised by high and growing concentration, which poses a risk to the trade network, as, over time, it makes trading partners more susceptible to supply-side shocks. Since the global economy has proven to be surprisingly homogenous in terms of concentration patterns, it seems justified that growing concentration could be considered a systemic feature for future theoretical international trade models. Our main methodological finding is that the WIOD database, which is still used as a standard for such analyses, may be misleading due to its limitations. While the results based on the ICIO and WIOD databases do not align, ICIO seems to be superior in terms of coverage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Transport systems are an essential feature of functional urban settlements. Yet, almost all of South Africa’s secondary cities and small towns lack a true public transportation system. Because of this, quasi-public, privately operated mini-bus taxis are the main form of transport for most urban residents. Thohoyandou, Limpopo, a town of over 70 000 people, is a typical South African town in this regard.Objectives: The purpose of this research was to understand passenger experiences of mini-bus taxis in Thohoyandou, Limpopo province, South Africa.Method: This study used semi-structured interviews to explore the mobility challenges faced by the residents of Thohoyandou.Results: This study revealed several negative aspects impacting passenger experiences. Passengers consistently reported concerns regarding driver’s behaviour that compromised safety and security. This included overloading of vehicles and disregard for traffic regulations. Passengers also highlighted the challenges posed by poor transport infrastructure and a lack of reliable service. Collectively, these factors contribute to limited mobility options, increased transportation costs and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, the shortcomings of mini-bus taxi services disproportionately affect people with disability, who already face significant societal barriers, further marginalising them within the transportation system.Conclusion: The government should increase investment in transport infrastructure, the enforcement of traffic laws and better driver training. However, a strong government combined with much political will is required if passengers and safety are to be the main priorities of the mini-bus taxi industry.Contribution: This study highlights challenges faced by public transport users in Thohoyandou, where mini-bus taxis serve as the main mode of transport. The challenges experienced by transport users not only reduce their mobility but also contribute to marginalisation of vulnerable groups, especially people with disability.</jats:p>"

However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the locational patterns of warehouses of different sizes in Africa.Objectives: To analyse the locational patterns of warehouses of different sizes within the City of Cape Town municipality, South Africa. The analysis focuses on the main factors influencing the placement of warehouses: transport infrastructure, land availability, proximity to customers and land-use zoning.Method: The study categorised warehouses based on their building footprint sizes, using the classifications of xx-small, x-small, small, medium, x-large and mega. A total of 396 warehouses were categorised accordingly. Proportional symbol mapping was then conducted in ArcGIS 10.1, assigning each warehouse type a specific weighting.Results: The study found that the areas surrounding the Port of Cape Town predominantly accommodated x-small warehouses. A diverse concentration of warehouses was identified along the railway, near the junctions of regional and national roads and within the areas enclosed by these roads. In addition, warehouses of diverse sizes were primarily situated in the main industrial zones of the municipality.Conclusion: The City of Cape Town municipality is encouraged to promote the consolidation of particularly large warehouses in strategic locations. These include industrial areas not geographically near the Port of Cape Town but with railway access to the port.Contribution: The study will contribute towards enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of logistics processes within the City of Cape Town.</jats:p>"

Accurate water supply and demand forecasting is critical for sustainable urban water management. Machine learning (ML) models provide new possibilities for forecasting compared with traditional models in handling non-linearity. This study aims to address the efficacy of ML models, long short-term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), for forecasting water supply and demand in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The ML modelling utilized daily water supply and demand, and climatic variables (rainfall and maximum temperature) recorded by Melbourne Water and the Bureau of Meteorology from 1990 to 2019. The stacked LSTM performs better than other models in forecasting with R2, RMSE, and MAPE values of 0.908, 335.74 ML, and 23.5% for water supply and 0.791, 94.88 ML, and 5.3% for water demand, respectively. The inclusion of climatic variables enhanced the accuracy of forecasting by improving R2 and reducing RMSE and MAPE. The results indicate effectiveness of ML models, particularly LSTM-based architectures, in forecasting water supply and demand. However, these models have limitations, particularly in forecasting extreme values, emphasizing the need to improve ML models for more reliable and accurate water management.</jats:p>",

We examine diversion risk in the context of prescription opioid sales in the United States. We ask how supply base attributes and nonprofit ownership influence the creation of opioid diversion risk. We use performance‐outcome expectancy theory to hypothesize that pharmacies organize supply bases to help them avoid negative evaluations and that nonprofit ownership alters expectancy concerning legal but questionable behavior. We develop and test multilevel hypotheses explaining how supply base complexity, chain size, and nonprofit ownership influence diversion risk. Our analysis of DEA data from 2006 to 2019 finds that after accounting for other attributes, supply base complexity is positively related to diversion risk, within and between firms. Retail chain size is negatively related to diversion risk in the within‐firm model, but positively in the between firm model. Testing our nonprofit hypothesis reveals that nonprofit pharmacies also use size and supply base complexity to manage diversion risk. This research sheds light on the dynamics of diversion risk in pharmaceutical supply chains. It has practical implications for the industry, potentially informing future policy and practice addressing this critical issue.</jats:p>"

This paper reviews existing literature on several key aspects of the EV supply chain, focusing on thermal management systems  (TMS), lifecycle environmental assessments, closed- loop supply chains (CLSCs), and the impacts of global  disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. Research by Murugan et al. (2022) underscores the importance of improving TMS for LIBs, noting that experimental validation remains sparse despite advances in numerical modeling. In addition, Rüdisüli et al. (2022) highlight the environmental benefits and limitations of different mobility technologies, emphasizing the need for advancements in seasonal energy storage systems. Gu et al. (2018) discuss the challenges of establishing profitable CLSCs for EV batteries, where reuse improves sustainability, but recycling faces economic hurdles. Finally, the analysis of Wen et al. (2021) on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact shows significant disruptions to the Chinese EV market and raises concerns about the global EV supply chain’s resilience. This review identifies gaps in the literature, such as the need for real-world validation of models, exploration of alternative battery chemistries, and improved supply chain governance, all of which are essential for advancing the EV industry toward sustainability.

The objective of this research is to analyze the best strategies and techniques for matching demand and supply, as well as for effective inventory management for this program. The research method used is qualitative, with data collection through literature study. After collecting the data, the analysis is done through several stages: filtering, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. The results show that good inventory management and supply-demand matching are key factors for the success of this program. Some strategies and techniques identified include careful planning, robust information systems, efficient supply chain management, good inventory management techniques, and diversification of supply sources. Diversifying supply sources helps the government reduce costs, improve food quality, support local economies, and strengthen national food security. By implementing these strategies, the government can ensure that the free nutritious food program can run efficiently and effectively and provide optimal benefits to the wider community.</jats:p>"

Problems often faced by textile companies are delays in raw materials, which result in the production and distribution of fabrics not reaching the target, so consumers are unsatisfied and switch to competing companies. In addition, solid waste from the production process is still disposed of, potentially polluting the environment. This study uses the Green Supply Chain Operation Reference (Green SCOR) approach to evaluate the performance of green supply chain management (GSCM) in textile companies located in Yogyakarta. The findings of this study could significantly impact the textile industry as they provide a comprehensive evaluation of GSCM performance. Twenty-two performance indicators have been validated using the Item-Content Validity Index (I-CVI) method and weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Based on the calculation results, the GSCM performance value is 60.208. Improvement recommendations are given for three indicators that need to be prioritized based on Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) matrix mapping and the actual condition of the company. Improvements can be made by using the Vacuum Flash Evaporation method so that recycled PVA can be reused, using natural materials or alternative auxiliary materials that are more environmentally friendly, increasing cooperation with companies engaged in processing weaving waste or textile waste appropriately and effectively, checking the concentration of starch solution not only when changing construction but every beam change, and forming a checklist form that is filled in for monitoring after machine settings and preparation of the production process.</jats:p>"

Methods: A two-level supply chain model consisting of a risk-averse cross-border e-commerce enterprise and two risk-neutral overseas suppliers is constructed to compare the optimal strategies and their coordination effects under the centralized and decentralized decision-making modes, and to deeply analyze the supply chain’s operation mechanism. Further, the quality cost factor is introduced and an option contract model is designed to quantitatively analyze the impact of different decision-making scenarios and parameter changes on the overall supply chain performance. The results of the study show that under the coordination of option contract, the profit of cross-border e-commerce companies tends to decrease as the risk of supply disruption increases, while the profit of suppliers rises accordingly. Meanwhile, improving the quality of agricultural products can significantly improve the overall profitability of the supply chain. The cost-sharing mechanism is positively related to the profit of cross-border e-commerce companies, but negatively affects the profit of suppliers. In addition, the adjustment of the option price is directly associated with the increase of the specific supplier’s profit and the decrease of the cross-border e-commerce enterprise’s profit. Conclusion: By constructing and analyzing the option contract model considering the risk of supply disruption, this study effectively reveals the key influencing factors and their interactions in the cross-border supply chain of low-carbon agricultural products, and provides cross-border e-commerce enterprises with specific strategies to achieve coordination of the supply chain contract, improve product quality, and mitigate the risk of supply disruption, and then promote the sustainable development of the supply chain of low-carbon agricultural products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currency rate fluctuations pose important risks to companies with large international supply chains in our current globalized economy. International sourcing is particularly affected by the unpredictable variations because they produce costs that vary, shipments that are substantially pushed back and operational disruptions—leading to challenges in industries such as Technology and Automotive. For this reason, successful supply chain risk management approaches are necessary for minimizing these risk factors. This research investigates empirically the impact of currency fluctuations on supply chain operations, particularly the strategies small, medium and large companies use to manage these risks, including currency hedging, contracting in stable currencies and forecasting tools.  Using a quantitative methodology, the research collects data by means of a structured questionnaire from 200 supply chain experts representing the Automotive, Technology, Retail and Manufacturing industries. To investigate the connexon between currency fluctuations, the performance of risk management strategies and the contribution of forecasting tools, data analysis was performed using SPSS. Application of statistical techniques including Chi-Square tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis and regression analysis facilitated our understanding of the insights from the data. The results demonstrate that currency hedging and contracting in stable currencies are the optimal strategies for diminishing the harmful results of currency changes, most notably for larger firms. Investigations demonstrate that prediction tools, largely dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, perform remarkably well in predicting currency flows, enabling organizations to address risks in advance. Small or medium enterprises (SMEs) find it hard to use the complex tools effectively owing to resource deficiencies, which leaves them even more susceptible to currency volatility. This research points out that it is very important to include currency risk management within broader supply chain strategies. Businesses that proactively use currency hedging along with sophisticated forecasting systems prove to be more resilient to the risks of currency rate volatility in a world economy that is growing more uncertain.</jats:p>"

Amid this rivalry, the private sector HEIs have realized the importance of designing and implementing strategically planned sustainable growth for institutions to provide value for their stakeholders. This study tested a theoretical model that includes two influencing factors– marketing mix strategy and strategic branding, and one moderating factor–competition, hypothesized to influence the performance and growth of HEI. Respondents (n = 322) from existing HEIs were surveyed to measure the key constructs. A multilinear regression supported a fit of data to the model. The study empirically revealed that marketing mix strategies designed and implemented by the HEIs do not positively influence the performance and growth of the institution. At the same time, strategic branding is a significant factor in influencing performance and growth. Moreover, the relationship between the marketing mix strategy and sustainability and the relationship between strategic branding and sustainability were moderated by the degree of rivalry that impacts the growth of the HEI. These results provide evidence to validate prior theories grounded in literature.</jats:p>"

      ],
      "type": "posted-content",
      "container-title": [],
      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<p>Background: The conventional formula for calculating food self-sufficiency cannot cover all the food we eat on a daily basis, and the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of each country cannot be calculated. The conventional food self-sufficiency ratio (CFSSR) can only calculate the FSSRs of each country for grains. To determine the actual state of food insecurity worldwide as accurately as possible, a method for calculating the FSSR of each country for all the foods we eat on a daily basis is needed. To address this situation, this study proposes the supply-side food self-sufficiency ratio (SSFSSR), which can be used to systematically calculate the self-sufficiency ratio of all foods in all countries/regions.Results: We compared the results of both calculations under the same conditions and used the same data to determine whether the CFSSR or the SSFSSR is a more suitable method for obtaining basic information and formulating measures of global food security. The results showed that the SSFSSR has advantages and practicality over the CFSSR. The SSFSSR can calculate self-sufficiency ratios for all foods in all countries/regions of the world, and the figures for various statistical tests are better. The food that is the subject of the calculation in the SSFSSR formula is the entire supply from production, distribution, storage, and consumption, excluding duplication in the calculation, and includes primary products required to produce secondary products, such as livestock products and edible oils. The study also highlighted the value of reducing the amount of primary products used to produce secondary products such as livestock and edible oils, thereby lowering the primary product conversion rate (PPCR).Conclusion: This study used actual data to estimate the SSFSSR for each country/region to demonstrate the applicability of this method and that lowering the PPCR would lead to an increase in the food self-sufficiency ratio. To further refine this methodology, we find that the most important tasks for the future are to collect more reliable data on calories per weight for a large number of foods, expand the number of types covered by more reliable PPCRs, and analyze those data.</p>"

It also presents the Drinking Water Services Act drafted for the state of Rajasthan in western India. The Rajasthan case is used to explain how various data on the physical environment, socioeconomic characteristics and institutional set up can be used for evolving various provisions of the Act, especially the criteria, norms, rules, guidelines and standards. The book has five well-written chapters, including one chapter covering the draft Drinking Water Supply Services Act for Rajasthan. The final chapter investigates why many water-related Acts in India fail or become ineffective.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food waste represents a significant global challenge, with approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption lost or wasted annually, leading to severe environmental, economic, and social consequences. The issue not only exacerbates food insecurity but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, waste of resources, and economic losses estimated at over $1 trillion each year. This paper aims to systematically review the causes of food waste across agricultural supply chains and explore effective supply chain optimization strategies to mitigate these losses. Through a comprehensive analysis, the paper identifies critical drivers of food waste, including post-harvest losses, inefficient processing, and aesthetic standards, while proposing technological innovations such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI) as solutions to enhance supply chain efficiency. Furthermore, it evaluates policy frameworks that support waste reduction, highlighting the role of government incentives and regulations in promoting sustainable practices. The findings underscore the importance of reducing food waste not only for environmental sustainability but also for economic profitability, as optimizing supply chains can lead to substantial cost savings and increased revenue for businesses. Ultimately, the paper emphasizes the necessity for collaboration among stakeholders—including governments, industries, and non-profit organizations—to create systemic change and effectively combat food waste on a global scale. By fostering innovative practices and policies, we can pave the way for a more sustainable agricultural future, ultimately contributing to the alleviation of food insecurity and the enhancement of economic resilience.</jats:p>"

This paper further examines the moderating role of technology integration on the relationship between organizational culture and healthcare SCR. Cross-sectional research was conducted, and participants were recruited from different hospitals in Jordan. An electronic survey was employed to collect the responses from 304 participants, including senior professionals designated as doctors, nurses, ray technicians, physical therapists, procurement officers, pharmacists, and lab technicians with more than three years of work experience. There was no statistically significant influence of rational culture on healthcare SCR (p-value = 0.156) and an adverse impact of hierarchical culture on healthcare SCR (p-value = 0.030). Group culture had a statistically significant impact on healthcare SCR (p-value = 0.007). Technology integration had an influential moderating influence on the association between rational culture and healthcare SCR&amp;amp;nbsp;(p-value = 0.042) and the association between hierarchical culture and healthcare SCR (p-value = 0.0129). However, technology integration had no moderating influence on the association between group culture and healthcare SCR (p-value = 0.331). The analysis revealed that group culture has an influential impact on healthcare SCR, while hierarchical culture has a negative impact on healthcare SCR. Moreover, technological integration was observed to improve the beneficial influence of rational culture and the negative effects of hierarchical culture on healthcare SCR. However, the technology integration was not observed to moderate the relationship between group culture and healthcare SCR.\nAcknowledgment The author acknowledges all the associated personnel who, in any reference, contributed to the completion of this study.</jats:p>",

Effective supply chain management plays a crucial role in safeguarding food. This paper explores the concerns of food safety that causes by unethical food supply chain. Case studies from both developed and developing regions illustrate successful initiatives and highlight lessons learned. The role of collaboration among stakeholders—producers, processors, distributors, regulators, and consumers—is emphasized as crucial for effectively managing risks and ensuring compliance with safety standards throughout the supply chain. This essay examines how supply chain issues affect food safety through three case studies: China’s oil scandal mixing edible and chemical oils, the 2022 U.S. peanut butter recall due to salmonella contamination, and antibiotic-contaminated Vietnamese shrimp amid Japan’s nuclear water release. Each case underscores the impact on public health and trust. By examining three current cases, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ineffective supply chain management can create food safety risks and reduce consumer confidence in the safety and integrity of the food supply chain and suggest possible course of action.</jats:p>"

The aim of this research is to develop an easily interpretable multicriteria classification matrix method and validate it in real-world scenarios with a robustness analysis. This method assigns alternatives to one of four classes defined by critical dimensions that integrate several evaluation criteria. Initially, a global search pre-classifies the alternatives using the PROMETHEE net flows. Then, two local searches are carried out that make use of the discriminant properties of the net flow signs to improve the quality of the assignments. This approach is specifically applied to pre-classified alternatives near the boundary between two or more categories. The method has been validated by segmenting thousands of customers. Four customer segments were identified: strategic, collaborative, transactional, and non-preferred. A comparison was made between the results and those derived from an alternative method. Through an extensive sensitivity analysis, the proposed method was shown to be robust to parameter variation, highlighting its reliability in real dynamic contexts. The method provides valuable, easily interpretable information, which constitutes the basis for developing personalised strategies to enhance customer relationship management.</jats:p>"

Despite this, integrating the water supply–demand balance and water supply security (SEC) into ecological health assessments—particularly through composite indicators—remains underexplored in arid regions. In this study, we assessed the ecological health changes in Xinjiang by utilizing multivariate remote sensing data, focusing on the balance between water supply and demand, the degree of SEC, and ecosystem resilience (ER). Our results indicate that while water supply and demand remained relatively stable in northern Xinjiang between 2000 and 2020, the conflict between supply and demand intensified in the southern and eastern agricultural regions. SEC evaluations revealed that 73.3% of the region experienced varying degrees of decline over the 20-year period. Additionally, ER assessments showed that 7.12% of the region exhibited a significant decline, with 78.6% experiencing overall reductions in ecological health. The indicators’ response to drought demonstrated that improvements in ecological health during wet conditions were less pronounced than declines during droughts. This study underscores the necessity of prioritizing areas with lower ecological health in future water allocation strategies to optimize water resource utilization.</jats:p>"

Two per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), were detected at concentrations in excess of drinking water standards in bedrock and overburden monitoring wells at the State Superfund site. A bedrock private water supply well sampling program and a PFAS source investigation, consisting of overburden investigations near potential sources (i.e., sites with a history of known or suspected use, storage, or discharge of PFAS), were undertaken to assess exposures and identify and potentially eliminate sources of PFAS contaminants in the bedrock drinking water supply.</jats:p><jats:p>Relative ratios of PFAS (i.e., PFAS signatures) were plotted geospatially to facilitate comparison of the characteristics of overburden groundwater sampling results to that of nearby bedrock private water supply sampling results. In addition, total PFAS concentrations in overburden groundwater and bedrock private water supply samples were compared to identify potential sources of bedrock groundwater impacts. The PFAS signature analysis revealed that (1) PFAS signatures of overburden groundwater samples were generally consistent with nearby bedrock private water supply samples; (2) total PFAS concentrations detected in overburden groundwater samples were marginally higher than concentrations detected in nearby bedrock private water supplies; (3) there was generally low variability in PFAS signatures throughout the study area (Assessment Area); and (4) overburden groundwater and bedrock private water supply PFAS signatures were similar to that of the nearby wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge, which represents a composite average PFAS signature for domestic wastewater from the area. Finally, septic system tracers were also detected in bedrock private water supply and overburden groundwater samples.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: To characterize the use of cambuci, a native Brazilian fruit, during the Festival in the village of Paranapiacaba, Santo André-SP, as a circular chain supply.\n \nTheoretical Framework: Supply chains are configured in linear or circular. Linear chain is an open system that ignores the extraction environment, resource yield, waste, assimilative capacity, and recycling. A circular chain is a closed system where the environment is part of the system, as it considers extraction, resource yield, waste, assimilative capacity and recycling. Gastronomic tourism was considered as a segment of cultural tourism.\n \nMethod: A qualitative study was carried out through testimonies as a methodological approach proposed by Meksenas (2002). For analysis, testimonies from 2023-2013 were selected, from electronic addresses. The categorization of testimonies transcribed from the corpus allowed the thematic analysis according to Jovchelovitch and Bauer, (2002).\n \nResults and Discussion: The community works in the extraction of cambuci, in the elaboration of derivatives, in the organization of the event, in the commercialization, but there are no testimonies about the destination of waste. Thus, cambuci is an open-system linear chain supply with no mention of waste. Gastronomic tourism requires proper planning to mitigate impacts on the destination.\n \nResearch Implications: Interviews coincided with the pandemic period.\n \nOriginality/Value: Gastronomy fosters cultural tourism. The participation of the community in the collection, elaboration, and organization of the event made it possible to describe the trajectory of cambuci as a supply of an open system production chain due to the disposal of waste. The methodological approach of testimonies optimized the study during the pandemic.</jats:p>"

Staged democrats are not a stable safeguard against illiberal politicians, because information shocks can reveal that they do not sincerely oppose illiberalism. Studying Switzerland, where referendums provide information on the sincere preferences of citizens, I collect data on referendum results, public opinion surveys, and party positions. My analyses show that if referendums reveal that the positions of far-right parties are more popular than expected, those parties become more exclusionary.

The available literature does not provide data on waste reduction for all listed solutions; however, these initiatives have had positive financial effects for hospitals through either direct cost reduction or cost avoidance. Although the cost of implementation may vary among hospitals, streamlining surgical packs (including custom packs) appears to be an effective solution with a lower cost than other strategies, and avoids the wasting of opened supplies that are not needed.</jats:p>",

The analysis revealed that the monthly time series of money supply is unstable and exhibits a general trend. To address this, the time series was converted into a stationary form to obtain the most effective models for predicting future periods. The study employed an ARIMA (0,2,2) model to predict future monthly data for M1 and an ARIMA (0,1,1) model for M2. The results indicated that ARIMA models can offer reliable short-term forecasts for money supply, but may not be suitable for long-term predictions due to external circumstances.

By examining these multiple flows in the evolution of global supply chains, our analysis goes beyond the singular focus on material flows that is common in recent economic and foreign policy discourse. Another defining feature of global supply chains is the strategic interaction between different actors. Following this line of thinking, we argue that de-risking is not a unilateral option for the West and its developed economy partners but rather an interactive and fluid development taking place around the globe. This can be seen in the U.S.'s growing emphasis on improving supply chain resilience through reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring, as well as in China's diversification into markets such as Russia and the global South, with broader implications for major economies. Looking beyond material flows to information, financial, and human flows is important to monitor these indicators of the ongoing transitions in global supply chains. policy implications\n• Policymakers must recognize that de-risking is not a unilateral process but involves strategic interactions among multiple global actors. • It is imperative to consider the implications of information, financial, and human flows, in addition to material flows, to develop effective de-risking strategies. • Ensuring political stability and policy continuity is essential to effective de-risking, particularly in the context of changing administrations and economic policies. • In implementing de-risking, efforts should ensure coordination across the four types of flows while addressing the challenges of increased complexity and potential lack of visibility into operations. • The role of emerging economies in de-risking is critical, as they stand to benefit significantly but also play a key role in achieving diversified and resilient supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the maturity of the smart meter embedded system integration mode, the power consumption information can be fed back to the management center by the intelligent terminal through the power Internet of Things. The smart terminal adopts the narrowband data communication mode. However, the narrowband channel interval is hindered by interference signals, resulting in serious data packet loss. Therefore, a stable and efficient acquisition scheme is needed to ensure its smooth interaction. Based on the application of smart meter data communication, we analyze the power consumption optimization and carrier transmission optimization of the power Internet of Things and propose a data analysis method based on self-learning and external characteristics, which is used to calculate the offline execution strategy of smart meters when they encounter factors such as power outage or intrusion. A production task-driving rule is designed. The external characteristics of deep learning data of the power Internet of Things are collected. The accuracy of data classification is judged according to the parallel Internet of Things of a convolutional neural network and a long-term and short-term memory deep neural network. When dealing with high-dimensional original data, the data network is graded to reduce the work of feature selection and the difficulty of training. Moreover, we improve the autonomous execution ability of an embedded terminal device in an offline state. We also strengthen the ability of abnormal data detection and judgment learning to meet the requirements of efficient and stable operation of the power grid. Simulation results verify that compared with the current mainstream schemes, the performance of the proposed scheme is improved by more than 17%. Besides, the fault tolerance rate is enhanced by 29%, and the power consumption after optimization is reduced by 26.3% and 42.8%. These effects highlight the role of data processing in embedded systems. It solves the problem of abnormal data and energy loss affecting the accuracy of error estimation of electric energy meters, opens up a new way for data acquisition and processing of large-scale smart meters, and further improves the service level of information management of power systems. </jats:p>"

EPC contracting is increasingly recognized for its superior resource allocation and integration efficiency. Within the EPC framework, procurement is pivotal, exerting a direct influence on project cost, schedule, and quality parameters. This paper argues that the incorporation of supply chain management into the procurement processes of international EPC projects can optimize efficiency and mitigate costs. Through forging collaborative partnerships with suppliers and stakeholders, EPC contractors may realize enhanced project outcomes. While the integration of supply chains has been efficaciously realized in the manufacturing domain, its transposition to the construction industry is nascent and predominantly resides within the ambit of scholarly inquiry. The present discourse endeavors to elucidate the imperatives and methodologies for supply chain integration within the procurement management of international EPC ventures, thereby furnishing both theoretical and pragmatic guidance for principal contractors. An extensive literature review and bibliometric analysis conducted herein delineate extant research lacunae and articulate prospective trajectories for scholarly exploration in the procurement management sphere of international EPC projects. The advocated integrative modality seeks to deliver a systemic and holistic solution framework conducive to the triumphant execution of EPC projects, engendering viable avenues and opportunities for the advancement and symbiosis within the pertinent industrial sectors. The integration of supply chain management in EPC projects is a burgeoning field that holds significant potential for advancing sustainability in construction. As the industry moves toward greener practices, the role of EPC contractors in driving sustainable procurement and project management becomes increasingly vital.</jats:p>"

The sharing economy, which involves temporary access to underutilized resources via digital platforms, has challenged traditional supply chain models, necessitating resilient and flexible collaborations. The research utilizes the Inter-organizational Relationships (IOR), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Resource-Based View (RBV) frameworks, highlighting dynamic capabilities. Through structural equation modeling and expert interviews, the findings reveal that trust and information sharing are essential, but their effects on e-collaboration are complex. Trust negatively correlates with e-collaboration, indicating that electronic platforms may mediate trust in low-trust environments. On the other hand, performance expectancy and facilitating conditions significantly boost e-collaboration adoption. The study identifies e-collaboration as a dynamic capability, improving operational performance, customer/supplier satisfaction, growth, and profitability. This research contributes theoretically by integrating organizational and individual perspectives on e-collaboration and elucidates the intricate relationships between trust, information sharing, and technology in supply chains. Practical recommendations are provided for leveraging technological innovations to enhance trust and information sharing in collaborative supply chains.</jats:p>"

Even while technology has only recently begun to be incorporated into supply chains, the manufacturing and distribution sectors have adopted it more quickly, emphasising the need for effective risk identification and mitigation techniques.  Notwithstanding the possible advantages of transforming the supply chain, there are obstacles and limitations that make an entire technological shift complex. The chapter also explores the concept explainable AI which can be understood as the set of techniques that makes the decision-making processes of AI systems comprehensible to humans.\nAcknowledging the inherent complexities and relationships within these chains, the goal of this chapter is to explore risk identification and management in high-tech supply networks. A competent and nimble stakeholder base can manage the complex landscape of the high-tech world through the incorporation of innovative technologies, proactive actions, and constructive alliances.</jats:p>",

In multiple settings, however, statistical forecasting methods are too simple to capture the complexity present in datasets – in these cases, a need for machine learning arises. Additionally, many forecasting initiatives touch hierarchical processes – forecasting has to be performed at multiple levels of hierarchies and then aggregated and corrected to yield accurate results. This paper aims to provide an overview of statistical forecasting ideas, prepare data for machine learning models, and tie everything together to form a hierarchical forecasting solution supplemented by a review of hierarchical forecasting use cases within the supply chain planning area. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising industries by enhancing connectivity among people, systems, and objects. With IoT device numbers predicted to rise from 9.7 billion in 2020 to 29 billion by 2030, its integration into supply chain management is increasingly critical, improving transparency, efficiency, and decision-making. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of IoT on supply chain efficiency within five Nigerian companies, a region where IoT's potential remains largely untapped due to infrastructural and technological challenges.Methods: The research employed a quantitative methodology, with purposive sampling used to select 50 participants across the 5 selected companies, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of IoT's influence across diverse sectors. A structured questionnaire was administered online to 10 senior managers from each selected company, collecting data on IoT adoption levels, applications, and impacts on supply chain performance. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS version 27, employing descriptive analysis and regression and correlation tests to examine the relationship between IoT adoption and supply chain metrics.Results: The analysis revealed a significant adoption rate of 74.4% across the companies, with notable enhancements in supply chain metrics. Specifically, a negative correlation coefficient of -0.345 was observed between IoT adoption and lead time, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.053). Inventory turnover showed marked improvement, with 60% of companies reporting increased efficiency in inventory management. Order accuracy saw substantial improvements, with 17 out of 43 respondents (39.5%) rating it as significantly enhanced. Despite these positive trends, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and high implementation costs were significant barriers, affecting the full realization of IoT benefits.Conclusion and Recommendations: The study concludes that while IoT adoption shows promise in enhancing supply chain operations in Nigeria, the benefits are unevenly realized, largely influenced by existing infrastructural deficits and high initial costs. Recommendations include enhancing digital infrastructure, developing supportive regulatory frameworks, and implementing pilot projects to better integrate IoT solutions tailored to specific operational needs. Investing in local expertise and fostering public-private partnerships are also critical for overcoming barriers to IoT adoption and leveraging its full potential for supply chain enhancement in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research introduces a groundbreaking approach to supply chain optimization and management, termed as Deep Reinforcement Learning based Supply Chain Optimization and Management (DRL-SCOM). At the core of this approach is the utilization of advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), specifically through the integration of Randomized Ensembled Double Q-learning (REDQ) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). DRL-SCOM is designed to effectively tackle the inherent complexities and dynamic challenges that are characteristic of supply chain management. One of the key strengths of DRL-SCOM lies in its use of REDQ, which plays a crucial role in mitigating the overestimation bias commonly associated with traditional Q-learning methods. This results in more accurate value estimation and policy improvement, a critical factor in the effective management of supply chains. Additionally, the integration of TRPO into the framework brings the advantage of safe and stable policy updates. Such stability is vital for maintaining the robustness required in the fluctuating environment of supply chain operations. The combination of REDQ and TRPO in DRL-SCOM creates a powerful synergy. REDQ’s ensembled learning approach, when fused with TRPO’s trust-region method, enables the framework to efficiently navigate the complex and high-dimensional decision space typical of supply chains. This allows for real-time optimization of decisions while staying within operational constraints. The DRL-SCOM methodology shows significant potential in addressing various aspects of supply chain management, from demand forecasting and inventory management to logistics, adeptly handling the nonlinearities and uncertainties that are prevalent in these areas. Thus, the DRL-SCOM framework emerges as an innovative solution, pushing the frontiers of traditional supply chain management. It paves the way for a more agile, responsive, and intelligent system, equipped to adapt to changing market demands and operational challenges. This approach represents a significant stride towards transforming supply chain management into a more advanced, data-driven, and adaptive field.</jats:p>"

The management of postal routes, transport safety, and the construction and equipment of stations were determined by the state, private entrepreneurs, and the local Kazakh population, who were taxed for these services. In addressing these challenges, the Russian Empire drew from European experiences, directly applying the postal station management model from Russia. Postal routes facilitated the transportation of correspondence, cargo, and passengers, thus solving essential communication issues within society. Government officials and soldiers also relied on these stations as key support points. Although the station attendants (overseers) were under the authority of post offices, they independently managed operations and relied on station-generated income. This arrangement was cost-effective for the state, allowing it to minimize expenses on postal institutions. The Russian government consistently worked to improve postal communication, and the system was subject to ongoing changes. However, despite some positive developments, both the Russian Empire and the postal system in Semirechye lagged behind European standards of postal transport.\r\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the crucial importance of supply chain resilience (SCR), especially in pharmaceutical companies. The disruptions exposed vulnerabilities compounded by the industry's globalized and complex nature. In Vietnam, the pharmaceutical sector is vital, serving approximately           97.33 million people. Despite significant growth, the industry faces challenges like heavy reliance on imported drugs, which make up nearly half of total consumption. The pandemic further strained supply chains, causing shortages and price hikes due to demand spikes and logistical issues. This study explores the perceptions of Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies regarding their supply chain capabilities and competencies and their impact on resilience. Using a survey methodology, data was collected from 109 pharmaceutical companies in Vietnam through convenience sampling, considering company size, ownership, and types. The analysis involved descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s Alpha reliability testing, and multiple regression analysis. Findings reveal that \"Information System Capabilities (ISC)\" and \"Supply Chain Management Strategies (SMS)\" significantly and positively influence both the agility and Robustness (RO) of supply chains. \"Risk Management Capabilities (RMC)\" positively and significantly affect RO alone. The study emphasizes the need for strategic investments in technology and risk management to enhance SCR, allowing companies to effectively handle uncertainties and disruptions while maintaining operational excellence.</jats:p>",

The demand‐driven contribution tends to decline during recessions, while the supply‐driven contribution tends to follow food and energy prices. Monetary policy tightening acts to reduce the demand‐driven contribution of inflation.

The results of the analysis indicate that SCM, logistics capability, and information sharing are all positively and significantly related to organisational performance. Effective SCM practices, including integration, collaboration, and strategic planning, are essential for driving organisational success. Logistics capability, including delivery speed, dependability, and flexibility, is crucial in improving customer satisfaction and overall efficiency. Information sharing is a critical enabler of effective SCM and organisational performance, fostering collaboration, decision-making, and innovation. The study also found that demographic factors (gender, age, education) had limited impact on the relationships between the constructs. This suggests that the findings are generally applicable across different demographic segments. Overall, this study's findings highlight the importance of effective SCM, logistics capability, and information sharing as key drivers of organisational performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The manufacture and allocation of forged drugs is an urgent and increasingly critical worldwide issue, especially in pandemics. The imperfect Supply and Block Chain system in the pharmaceutical industry is one of the reasons for drug counterfeiting. Drugs ownership changes from manufacturers to wholesaler, distributor, and then pharmacist before it reaches the customer thus making it difficult to keep track of it. In this paper, we have to Design a Block chain based Model for Secure and Effective Pharmaceutical Supply Chain. Finally, the study mainly focuses on increasing the safety of pharmaceutical products and reducing the manual operation of the supply chain with the most efficient architecture. This initiative will use block chain technology to address issues and inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The traditional pharmaceutical supply chain is vulnerable to problems such as counterfeiting, data inconsistencies, and a lack of transparency. The proposed solution uses a decentralized and transparent block chain technology to improve the entire traceability, security, and efficiency of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Historically, these obstacles have been examined from a consumer demand standpoint, focusing on aspects such as quality enhancement, pricing issues, and consumer awareness deficiencies. This study shifts the focus to the supply-side perspective, providing novel insights into the factors affecting the marketing and sale of olive oil. To investigate these factors, a comprehensive consultation with an expert panel consisting of industry leaders from olive oil mills was conducted. These experts evaluated 13 critical factors identified through a literature review and their practical experience. The findings from this panel offer immediate practical applications, emphasizing the importance of marketing strategies, professionalization, internationalization, and the utilization of social networks and e-commerce in driving olive oil sales. The implications of these findings suggest that companies must restructure to become more professional and market-oriented to navigate and surmount the traditional commercial barriers in the olive oil industry. Overall, this research enhances our understanding of the supply-side dynamics influencing the marketing and sale of olive oil in the Spanish context and beyond.</jats:p>"

The sensitivity of the contract and each determining variable is analyzed using the simulation method. Through the joint contract of ”revenue sharing + volume discount,” the production efficiency of the enterprise and the logistics service of the international warehouse can be improved. The genetic algorithm combined with simulated annealing was adopted. Finally, a concrete example is given to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results show that the member departments can work together better under centralized decision-making compared to the decentralized management mode. Manufacturers to increase production capacity and improve the level of logistics services in overseas warehouses will help improve the profitability of cross-border e-commerce.</jats:p>"

This paper focuses on constructing an evaluation index system for EPSE and exploring the relationship between the development level of the digital economy (DE) and EPSE in China. To measure the EPSE, the study employs the Undesirable Slacks-Based Measurement (SBM) Model across 30 provinces, cities and districts in China from 2011 to 2022. Furthermore, the research utilizes spatial econometric models, panel threshold effect models, and other methodologies to investigate the impact mechanism and non-linear relationship between DE and EPSE. The research shows that: (1) The overall level of EPSE in the study area is relatively low, with significant development differences observed; (2) The DE has a nota-ble spatial spillover effect on EPSE, with a significantly negative impact in neighboring areas; (3) The development of the DE promotes EPSE through the upgrading of human capital structure, industrial structure, and increases in local government fiscal revenue and corporate operating profits; (4) Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of DE on EPSE varies significantly across eastern, central, and western China, with positive effects pronounced in the eastern and western regions; (5) Regression results of the threshold effect indicate a significant single threshold effect on the impact of DE development level on EPSE. Specifically, when the threshold value is less than 0.1232, DE significantly contributes to the improvement of EPSE. This paper contributes new literature evidence and factual references to the understanding of the causal relationship between DE and EPSE. The findings highlight the importance of considering spatial spillover effects, impact mechanisms, and regional heterogeneity in analyzing the relationship between DE and EPSE. The research also suggests that promoting the development of the digital economy could be a viable strategy to enhance EPSE, especially in regions where the threshold value is below 0.1232</jats:p>"

This study addresses this issue by proposing an integrated approach to optimize biomass supply chain networks for energy production with the steam Rankine cycle. The approach takes into account the inherent variability of feedstock availability and energy market values, to ensure adaptability to fluctuating conditions. The biomass supply network is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, where the optimization objective is to maximize the economic viability of the system. The optimal configuration of the supply network includes the selection of biomass supply zones and storage facilities, the transportation links, and the optimization of the process variables within the conversion plants, taking into account the variable heat demand. The optimization approach is applied to a hypothetical case study of a relatively small region in Slovenia. The results show the economic viability of biomass utilization with a net present value of almost 300 MEUR, generating about 4 MW of electricity and 65 MW of heat. The uncertainties of the biomass supply, the fluctuations in product prices and the spatial scope of the case study are evaluated in addition. This analysis highlights and discusses the impact of these factors on the economic performance of the biomass supply chain network.</jats:p>"

As one of the country’s most important grain crops, corn plays a crucial role in various sectors including animal feed, human food, and as a key raw material in industrial applications. Over recent years, the corn market in China has witnessed substantial fluctuations in both supply and demand, driven by a combination of factors such as extreme weather events, shifts in trade policies, and other external influences. The Chinese government has responded to these challenges by implementing a range of measures aimed at bolstering the industry, including policy directives, financial incentives, and enhanced regulatory oversight. Additionally, the promotion of technological innovation has been identified as a critical component in improving efficiency and productivity within the sector. Looking forward, the corn industry is poised for more stable and sustainable growth, driven by deeper integration within the industry and increased international collaboration. These developments are expected to solidify the industry’s role not only within China but also in the global agricultural economy, ensuring its continued contribution to both national food security and economic development.\n</jats:p>"

By linking records of actual failures in water networks with new tools for stochastic modelling, the study provides more accurate estimates of network leakage behaviour. District metered areas (DMAs) have been adopted internationally as best practice for monitoring and controlling leakage, with the infrastructure leakage index (ILI) as the main performance indicator. The leakage exponent (N1), which quantifies the relationship between leakage rate and pressure, is a key parameter in describing DMA leakage behaviour. After analysing thousands of stochastic networks for different combinations of pipe material and ILI, the study found that different pipe materials have distinct leakage exponent distributions. Iron and asbestos cement (AC) pipes display N1 values close to 0.5, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes have the highest N1 values, and polyethylene (PE) lies between PVC and iron/AC. The study further showed that current guidelines linking ILI to N1 for different pipe materials depart substantially from the observed results, indicating that these guidelines may need to be updated. The study provides a tool for more realistic modelling of leakage that offers valuable insights into the behaviour of leakage in different pipe materials.</jats:p>",

The deficit can be partially filled by increased mine production, expanding currently installed mine production capacity, and increasing Cu recycling. However, satisfying demand in 2050 as the demand-to-mining supply gap increases will require the accelerated discovery of at least five large Cu deposits—individually producing &amp;gt;0.5 to &amp;gt;1.0 Mt/yr Cu—and their related mine development, by 2030. These five deposit discoveries are required to replace mines scheduled to close in the 2050s, given the &amp;gt;20 years needed to take a deposit from discovery to mine production.

We predict that the only solution to the future Cu demand-supply challenge for society and the mining industry in the short to medium term rests with simple demand-supply economics and a substantially increased Cu price. Copper substitution by other materials and recycling could potentially benefit from a significantly increased price; however, the major advantage will be conferred on deposits amenable to open-pit mining that are undeveloped because of price-dependent, failed feasibility studies.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The challenge of possibly doubling Cu supply by ca. 2050 through developing mines on large Cu deposits—both discovered and undiscovered, in an unprecedented number and in a shorter period—will require a major increase in the number of competent mining industry personnel.

There is an acute shortage of experienced professionals in cave mining, and the substantial number of open-pit mining professionals who are predicted to retire by 2030 will need to be replaced. On-the-job training of geoscientists and engineers after graduation, delivered by experienced practitioners through university-accredited professional development programs, is suggested as the solution.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nTax policy is “on the ballot,” so to speak in the 2024 US Presidential election. Trump’s economic advisors are arguing for an extension of the rate reductions in the 2017 Tax Act, which some have deemed “supply side, as were the Reagan tax cuts during the 1980s. The economic argument for supply side tax rate reductions drew on a policy mix framework developed by Robert Mundell as early as 1962. Within that framework, the easy fiscal/ tight monetary policy solution was intended for circumstances of either pressure on reserves or the exchange rate (as during the Kennedy Administration) or of serious domestic inflation (as under the Carter and Reagan Administrations). Tax cuts in the US since the 1980s have not had the intended stimulus effects because neither the currency weakness nor inflationary preconditions have existed. Absent such conditions, tax rate reductions will generate either domestic over-heating or a redistribution of income to those in higher brackets. Any argument in favor of the 2017 Tax Act, or for a similar tax reduction in 2025 or 2026, should not fall back on Mundell’s policy mix advocacy. In contrast, the case for an easy fiscal/ tight money policy may have unexpected force in situations of fixed exchange rates, or where domestic monetary policy options are otherwise constrained or absent – as has been the case in Eurozone periphery countries.\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19-induced strain on global supply chains led to significant market imbalances and unprecedented inflation, particularly affecting urban economies. Containment policies and stimulus packages resulted in unpredictable demand shifts, challenging urban supply chain planning and resource distribution. These disruptions underscored the need for robust risk management models, especially in cities where economic activity and population density exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities. This study develops a comprehensive risk model tailored for G-7 urban economies, analyzing the causal and cointegration relationships between key economic indicators. Using Granger causality tests and a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) approach, the study examines complex time series and high-dimensional variables, focusing on urban-specific indicators such as the Composite Leading Indicator (CLI) and Business Confidence Indicator (BCI). Our results indicate strong causal relationships among these indicators, validating CLI as a reliable early predictor of urban economic trends. The findings confirm the viability of this urban supply chain risk management model, offering potential pathways for strengthening urban resilience and economic sustainability in the face of future disruptions. This approach positions the study within the context of urban science, emphasizing the impacts on cities and how urban economies can benefit from the developed risk model.</jats:p>"

This gave rise to Parliamentary bills for large infrastructure projects to transfer water to London from outside the Thames watershed and for the transfer of private company assets to municipal management. Wales was the most frequently suggested source, as it was argued to have cleaner, softer, and more abundant water. London’s water companies favored using improved infrastructure, connected networks, and demand management. Despite substantial investment, London’s water company assets and responsibilities were transferred to the Metropolitan Water Board in 1904. Looking back in 1953, fifty years after it was formed to take over London’s water infrastructure, the Metropolitan Water Board noted that extensive acquisition of land for reservoirs and watershed protection by the water companies proved invaluable in securing a sustainable water supply for the metropolis a century later. </jats:p>"

This paper tends to dissect the power crisis in Nigeria with a view to narrowing down the malady in the industry to the various sub-sectors and proposing a suitable panacea. Whereas the quantum of energy being generated is abysmal for a country like Nigeria to start thinking of energy sufficiency, the transmission infrastructure is incommensurate with the capacity demand of power transmission. The distribution sub-sector on its part is; among others, bedeviled with revenue collection shortfalls, enough to impede the progress of the entire sector. With a conscious effort to expand the power generation base, by aggressively investing in Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), the decentralization of the transmission Infrastructure and stringent monitoring of the distribution sub-sector for improved accountability and system reliability, the dream of energy sufficiency in the Country will substantially be actualized.</jats:p>",

Through the comparative analysis of model solution results and numerical simulation, it was found that, in the centralized decision-making contract, the optimal collaborative effort and the optimal total revenue of enterprises in the prefabricated building supply chain were the largest; the optimal collaborative effort of enterprise in the prefabricated building supply chain reduced first and then tended to be stable; and the improvement of the BIM application level could promote collaboration in the prefabricated building supply chain.

Current complexity of varied needs in the health means that supply chains have evolved towards multi-channel networks. Some parallel chains have different objectives depending on the type of medication and type of client (hospital, pharmacy or clinic). We propose a methodology based on synergies for the reconfiguration of multi-channel supply chains. We consider aspects, such as risks, adapted to each type of client. Given a set of possible configurations in the design, AHP (Analytic Hierarchical Process) compares all of them combined with TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Synergies in the supply chains are evaluated at static and dynamic levels, referred to strategic, tactical and operative decisions. With the changes proposed, the cost may be reduced at least in a 31%, and the outbound time shortened in 0.5 days. The possible benefits for the distribution agents are shown mainly in costs or time, but also in reliability.\n\nKeywords: medicines, supply, multi-business, synergy, AHP, TOPSIS.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the application of AI-driven models in optimizing supply chain performance, focusing on predictive analytics, real-time data integration, and customer-centric personalization. A comprehensive experimental framework was employed, evaluating five distinct AI configurations against four key performance criteria: operational transparency, customer compatibility, cost efficiency, and delivery performance. Results demonstrated that the Real-Time Data Integration Model achieved a 20% improvement in operational transparency, allowing for enhanced visibility into inventory management and more agile responses to dynamic demand fluctuations. Additionally, the Customer-Centric Personalization Model increased customer satisfaction by 10%, emphasizing the critical role of tailored service delivery in modern supply chain management. The Cost Optimization Model yielded significant cost reductions, improving cost efficiency by 18%, though it showed a marginal decrease in customer compatibility. The findings highlight the trade-offs between cost efficiency and customer-centric strategies, suggesting that a balance is required to achieve a well-rounded and sustainable supply chain model. This research underscores the transformative potential of AI in driving efficiency, transparency, and customer satisfaction. Future work should explore the integration of advanced technologies such as 5G and further investigate scalable AI solutions capable of addressing the evolving challenges faced by global supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pengukuran kinerja manajemen rantai pasokan sangat penting bagi perusahaan yang bertujuan memenuhi permintaan pasar dalam lingkungan yang semakin kompetitif. Penelitian ini berfokus pada evaluasi kinerja rantai pasokan PT XYZ, sebuah perusahaan yang bergerak di industri tabung baja untuk LPG, dengan menggunakan model Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR). Model SCOR menyediakan kerangka kerja komprehensif yang mencakup lima kriteria kinerja utama: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, dan Return. Analisis menunjukkan bahwa kriteria Plan dan Deliver memiliki kinerja terendah, dengan skor masing-masing 40,00 dan 46,67, menunjukkan keandalan yang rendah. Sebaliknya, proses Return menunjukkan kinerja yang sangat baik dengan skor 100,00. Studi ini menyarankan bahwa peningkatan kriteria Plan melalui Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS), pelatihan karyawan, dan analisis data untuk peramalan yang lebih akurat dapat secara signifikan meningkatkan efisiensi keseluruhan rantai pasokan. Untuk kriteria deliver, rekomendasi termasuk optimisasi rute dan jadwal, peningkatan sistem manajemen transportasi, serta implementasi teknologi pelacakan dan penelusuran untuk meningkatkan keandalan pengiriman. Dengan berfokus pada area-area ini dan memanfaatkan teknologi canggih serta praktik manajemen yang lebih baik, PT XYZ dapat secara signifikan meningkatkan kinerja rantai pasokannya, memastikan efisiensi, keandalan, dan responsivitas yang lebih tinggi dalam memenuhi permintaan pasar. Penelitian ini memberikan wawasan yang dapat diimplementasikan dan rekomendasi praktis bagi perusahaan yang ingin mengoptimalkan operasi rantai pasokan mereka menggunakan model SCOR.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article examines the supply chain as a modeling object. The multi-criteria and contradictory goals in supply chain management are: on the one hand, the maximum level of service, on the other hand, minimizing logistics costs. Solving strategic optimization problems for this class of objects using classical optimization methods is difficult. The theoretical and methodological basis of the supply chain was considered from the perspective of a set-theoretic approach. The purpose of the study is to analyze the behavior of many different agents (suppliers, clients, etc.) with different needs and goals when making decisions. An agent is an active element of the system, possessing a certain autonomy and the ability to make independent decisions, relying on the information it has about the state of the environment and the actions of other agents. In turn, supply chains are a complex organizational (active) system, i.e. associated with human participation. The study of behavioral aspects and interorganizational interaction, the formation of new organizational forms are an extremely important aspect in the management and modeling of supply chains, a factor in the dynamic behavior of the logistics system. The conducted research represents an important contribution to the development of knowledge about the application of the set-theoretic approach in supply chain management. It demonstrates the applicability of this approach in practice through an analysis of a specific company, LLP «Knauf», on the Kazakhstan market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, an increasing number of companies, such as Huawei, Apple, and Adidas, are no longer confined to offline physical stores for product sales. They leverage third-party e-commerce platforms or establish online stores on their official websites. Modern consumers have access to various purchasing channels, including e-commerce platforms, offline stores, and manufacturer direct sales. In recent years, a new e-commerce model, live streaming sales, has emerged. In live streaming sales, professional salespersons or key opinion leaders (KOLs) showcase product performance, aiming to sell products online. Unlike traditional online channels, live streaming sales alleviate new consumers' uncertainty about product information through real-time interaction or comments from KOLs. Live streaming has been adopted by e-commerce giants worldwide, such as Taobao, JD.com, and Amazon, due to its significant sales revenue potential. Additionally, channels with KOLs may generate negative or positive spillover effects on other channels. These effects are crucial parameters for exploring the impact of seller profits in the multi-channel supply chain under live streaming conditions. Both domestic and international research have focused on live streaming sales, multi-channel sales, and spillover effects, with many studies yielding significant economic and social benefits. However, challenges faced by multi-channel supply chains, including complex channel management, difficulty in information synchronization, brand consistency issues, and increased costs, need to be addressed. To overcome these challenges, recommendations include integrating channel resources, optimizing channel experience, establishing cross-channel data analysis systems, strengthening supply chain coordination, continuous innovation and improvement, and strengthening brand building.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strategic procurement enables companies to develop and enhance their advantage over its competitors –both by cost advantage or differentiation advantage. Accordingly, modern and future procurement is highly strategic in comparison to traditional and e-procurement practices. However, the extent to which the graduates are prepared on procurement strategies for digital supply chains is scarcely known in Tanzania. In other words, very little is known on the competence level of graduates on digital supply chain management. Therefore, this study evaluated the competence level of graduates on procurement strategies for digital supply chains in Tanzania. It specifically determined the level of awareness of graduates on procurement strategies for digital supply chains; the extent to which the graduates are prepared on procurement strategies for digital supply chains while at educational institutions studying, and ranking of skills on digital supply chains acquired by the graduates in relation to hard and soft supply chain skills. This study used quantitative approach with descriptive cross-sectional survey design. The data were collected from 500 graduates of Procurement and Supply in Arusha, Dar es Salaam, Mbeya, Mwanza and Dodoma who were sampled using multi-stage sampling techniques.  The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings reveal that, majority of the graduates had low level of awareness on procurement strategies for digital supply chains. In addition, the majority of graduates were prepared on procurement strategies for digital supply chains to the very small extent. Moreover, skills on digital and soft supply chains were ranked thirdly/low in acquisition when at the education institutions compare to hard supply chain skills. The graduates acquired digital and soft supply chain skills in lower rate (rank) compare to hard supply chain skills acquired in moderate rate. It is generally concluded that, the graduates had low level of competence on procurement strategies for digital supply chains in Tanzania. This study advocates for serious engagement of both private and public stakeholders in collaborating with colleges/institutes in training on procurement strategies for digital supply chains in Tanzania in order to produce competent labour force for the digital world of work.</jats:p>"

The research employed a survey design and questionnaire as instruments for data collection. The total population of the study comprised 2,100 staff of the organization. Taro Yamane method was used to estimate the sample size which produced a result of 336. A proportionate allocation formula was applied in the distribution of the survey in the following states: River State, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Delta, and Edo State, Nigeria.  Out of 336 copies of a questionnaire sent to the participants, only 321 were returned and utilized for the study while the remaining 15 copies were not utilized for this study. The study hypotheses were statistically tested and analyzed using Pearson correlation methods at a 5% significance level. The findings of research hypothesis one indicates that artificial intelligence (AI) adoption positively contributes to supply chain visibility (SCV) when the p-value (.000) is less than a 5 % level of significance (p &lt; 0.05). The researcher recommends that businesses should create a demand forecast based on using historic sales to meet customer demands. Management of the Nigerian Brewery Plc should continue to invest in advanced technologies such as AI and IoT to further enhance supply chain operations. This will help maintain a competitive edge in the market by improving efficiency and reducing costs. This study adds to the body of knowledge by presenting data on the beneficial effects of technology improvements on supply chain management in the Nigerian brewery industry. The study would guide the Nigerian government to implement e-government, and e-health services to citizens.</jats:p>"

A single focal supply chain network might have hundreds of suppliers including those that supply both goods and services. These increase exponentially as one traces the network downstream. Using a pair of networks from the auto industry (Ford and General Motors) as a basis for the analysis, we apply a data mining technique to filter for significant supply chain relationships in each of these networks over the period spanning 2018–2022. We then examine the structural metrics for each of these networks and compare these measures with applicable financial measures to elucidate how supply chain network structure affects financial performance. Our regression analyses reveal that supplier network structures significantly affect customers’ market value. Specifically, Tobin’s Q is negatively related to the number of suppliers they source from and the importance of the customer (e.g., Ford) to its suppliers, but it is positively associated with the tightness of supplier customer connection and the density of the network.</jats:p>"

This sound law provides an etymology for the nominal suffix -oka- and can be supported by several independent data points. One consequence is the elucidation of the word kocwid as meaning ‘rite, cult supply’, leading to an improved understanding of three separate Lydian passages. An ongoing rounding of á to o when adjacent to f is also hypothesised, based on new evidence with observable a/o-vacillation.</jats:p>",

When applied to environmental risk assessment, green purchasing, and eco-design activities, these technologies will optimize Economies of Scale (EoS) and contribute to advancing GSSCM in companies. This review uses systematic literature review and thematic analysis and focuses on using various peer-reviewed sources to understand how these technologies support GSSCM and also reveal gaps and challenges such as the integration of innovative waste disposal technologies and sustainable partnership schemes. Research proves that actual assessment of environmental risk is possible through the implementation of AI in risk assessment; On the other hand, blockchain makes sustainable procurement and reverse logistics more transparent. Thus, some problems like high costs, limited time, and problems with the alignment of stakeholder goals remain. It is recommended that these gaps be overcome by innovating, partnering with industries, and implementing policies that can further improve the position of information systems as the foundation of GSSCM. Thus, policymakers have been urged to explore options like grants or subsidies in an attempt to promote the adoption of these technologies as a way of creating a circular economy. Consequently, this research offers insights that may be beneficial for industry managers and policymakers seeking to improve sustainability within the EU automotive and electronics sectors.</jats:p>"

This review examines how advanced AI-driven forecasting models, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and time-series forecasting models like SARIMA/ARIMA, are transforming regional agricultural practices and food supply chains. Through the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing, and blockchain technologies, these models facilitate the real-time monitoring of crop growth, resource allocation, and market dynamics, enhancing decision making and sustainability. The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, including systematic literature analysis and regional case studies. Highlights include AI-driven yield forecasting in European hydroponic systems and resource optimization in southeast Asian aquaponics, showcasing localized efficiency gains. Furthermore, AI applications in food processing, such as plasma, ozone and Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatments, are shown to improve food preservation and reduce spoilage. Key challenges—such as data quality, model scalability, and prediction accuracy—are discussed, particularly in the context of data-poor environments, limiting broader model applicability. The paper concludes by outlining future directions, emphasizing context-specific AI implementations, the need for public–private collaboration, and policy interventions to enhance scalability and adoption in food security contexts.</jats:p>"

As a novel approach to innovation, this paper aims at assessing whether or not blockchain technology could help overcome problems that have attributed lack of consensus between SCM and its stakeholders including, inadequate information flow, complex logistics, ad inadequate inter-organizational trust. As such, using scientific data I investigate how innovations built on the blockchain enhance efficiency, contain costs, and create instant permanent transparency, including in the supply chain. The research methods include a literature search and analysis, calculations of blockchain benefits in relation to the most important SCM indicators: transaction time, cost cutting, and transparency of suppliers. From our research, it can be suggested that advanced use of blockchain results in improved efficiency by around 20-25% of OM costs, while the error rate will be decreased up to 30%. In addition, by enhancing the history of each product, blockchains decrease fraud rates in high-risk sectors, including the pharmaceutical marketplace, by a half. These findings emphasize the positive impact that blockchain implements to alter the supply chain by promoting trust between the chain’s participants and allowing for secure transfer of necessary information. This research helps to complete the existing literature by giving concrete information about blockchain’s efficiency in the real business environment which could be useful for those companies and government agencies which are aiming to implement blockchain-based solutions in supply chain management.

The sample used was secondary data fetched from the Website of Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), since regulation on electronic payment method was officially issued by Bank Indonesia in May 2009-March 2023. The test results shows that e-money and money supply each, have a significant positive effect on gross domestic product variables. Gross domestic product variables had a negative effect on interest rates. E-money and money supply variables has a negative effect on interest rates, both directly or indirectly through the intervening variable of gross domestic product. Increasing e-money user and money supply, preponderant to gross domestic product, can decrease the interest rate. The results of this research are expected to provide benefits as a prediction of the Indonesian economy in the future, as a result of the issuance of electronic payment instruments. So for the regulators, they can set the right interest rate policy to be able to maintain stable economic conditions.\r\nKeywords: electronic money, money supply, gross domestic bruto, interest rate</jats:p>"

The system features a dual-tank configuration integrated with a solar collector, which optimizes thermal energy storage and ensures consistent feedwater temperatures. Therefore, continuous operation is possible despite fluctuations in solar radiation. An assessment of the system's performance under various solar radiation conditions predicted an average daily permeate flux of 14.4 kg/m2 and a specific energy consumption of 1810 kJ/kg, indicating superior thermal efficiency. The economic analysis revealed a competitive levelized water cost of $25.75 per cubic meter, highlighting the system's potential as a viable alternative to conventional desalination technologies. These findings suggest that the proposed DCMD system is a leading technology in the pursuit of sustainable desalination. Considering its thermal management and cost-effectiveness, the system presents a transformative solution for sustainable freshwater production in regions with abundant solar resources.</jats:p>",

However, since ammonia has fatal toxicity depending on its concentration and exposure time, discharged flow analysis of the ammonia fuel supply system is required. In this study, the flow characteristics of ammonia and nitrogen mixture discharged from the fuel supply system were analyzed by simulating the ammonia purging process with Aspen HYSYS. The fuel supply system was modeled for the ammonia engine under development from MAN ES, and some parts of fuel supply system were estimated. Purged ammonia was mixed with water in the ammonia catch system except for the amount that can be recovered. The investigation reveals that as the recovery pressure increases, the amount of recovered ammonia also increases. Simultaneously, the amount of ammonia discharged into the atmosphere through the water tank decreases. The results showcase a positive correlation between recovery pressure and the efficiency of ammonia recovery during the depressurization process. These findings contribute valuable insights for designing effective systems that prioritize the recovery and treatment of discharged ammonia, mitigating potential safety concerns.</jats:p>",

Work based on input-output tables has yielded valuable insights on interdependency and supported new types of policy based on “Scope 3” supply chain exposure. However current models suffer from coarse sector resolution which hampers their real-world utility beyond scholarship. To address this we elaborate the construction of an enterprise-level multi-regional input-output (EMRIO) table.

It is necessary to integrate value-adding processes, as this is the only way to maintain a high level of customer service. This is the way to create the value that the final customer will pay for and have his needs fully met. However, the question arises: do all companies really want to cooperate with each other at a high level? Alternatively, the question can be looked at from another angle: do all the links in the chain need to cooperate at a high level? The aim of this study is to examine to what extent corporate attitudes influence the form and extent of cooperation. To this end, the paper examines the use of contracting, one of the most popular instruments in the supply chain management literature. Using a case study, the result of the study is a composition matrix that shows the relationship between the preferred form of collaboration of companies and the contracts that best support this. To do this, it is first necessary to identify the possible forms of cooperation and their characteristics, after which the contracts and their conditions and characteristics of application must be understood. By putting the two pieces of information together, a matrix can be created, which can be used to recommend the most appropriate contract for the relationship that best matches the company's attitudes to improve cooperation and coordination between the members.</jats:p>"

The research method used is quantitative descriptive analysis with the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) using the Eviews application and secondary data in the form of monthly data from 2011 to 2023 obtained from the official websites of Bank Indonesia and Finance. This study utilizes data on cryptocurrency transaction values and electronic money transaction values in Indonesia by analyzing the VECM model, which can observe the long-term and short-term impacts of the use of digital money on the money supply and monetary stability, in this case, viewed through the Indonesian exchange rate. The research results indicate that there is a one-way causality between electronic money and cryptocurrency, but not the other way around, and there is a one-way causality between the money supply and cryptocurrency, with the money supply as the dependent variable influencing cryptocurrency. The results of the VECM estimation indicate that in the long term, electronic money has a negative and sifnificant impact on the money supply. Meanwhile, the short-term estimation shows that both cryptocurrency and electronic money significantly influence the money supply, but their effects are dynamic and vary based on different lags. The long-term estimation with the exchange rate as the dependent variable shows that cryptocurrency does not have a significant impact on the exchange rate, while in the short term, both cryptocurrency and electronic money have a negative and significant effect on the exchange rate.               </jats:p>"

When OW's capacity is reached, extra stock is held in RW at a high holding charge compared to OW. The dual warehouse inventory problem of a supply chain constrained by limited storage capacity in OW for non-instantaneously decaying commodities under inflationary conditions has been investigated in the current study. There is a partial backlog in shortages, and the demand rate is depending on inventory. Because of the quick changes in the environment, preservation technology has become increasingly crucial in today's global society. In order to slow down the deterioration of goods with a high rate of deterioration, preservation technology is specifically used in this article.

Since COVID-19, asset prices across various countries have shown differing trends due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar supply. Housing prices, a key focus in asset pricing research, have been affected to varying degrees. This thesis utilizes seven house price indices from representative cities worldwide from 2020 to 2023 to compare the differential impacts across various countries using an empirical approach.

Supply chains involve a large number of members, and in order to work together effectively, it is necessary to coordinate the value creation processes of these members in some way to ensure that the 'customer is king' principle is upheld and a high level of customer satisfaction is guaranteed. Because of the large number of members, chains are now considered as networks in the literature. Many opportunities are available to achieve the right level of coordination between members. One possible coordination tool is the contracts. This paper is focused on the chance of coordination improvement with the help of one interesting contract, which is the buy-back contract. This type of contract has a very sensitive point: the buy-back price. If this value is too low or too high, it results in negative influences on one or both parties. That is the reason why it is very important to determine an optimal buy-back price. The paper includes a model, which can help to understand the influencing factors of buy-back price, and with the help of this, an analytical model can be presented for the calculation of the optimal buy-back price.</jats:p>"

Traditional time series models, such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), are effective in modeling linear relationships but often fall short in handling the nonlinear complexities characteristic of volatile demand patterns. Conversely, deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have proven adept at capturing intricate temporal dependencies, though they are computationally intensive and require substantial data. This study introduces a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM framework that leverages the linearity strengths of ARIMA in conjunction with LSTMs capacity for learning non-stationary, nonlinear patterns. The hybrid model decomposes the demand series, modeling linear trends with ARIMA and residual nonlinear components with LSTM. Empirical evaluations of real-world supply chain data reveal that this integrated architecture outperforms standalone ARIMA and LSTM models, achieving superior predictive accuracy and robustness in handling demand variability. Our findings underscore the hybrid models potential as an advanced predictive solution for dynamic, data-driven supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Presenting a hub location model for the green supply chain can address the current status of facilities and significantly improve demand coverage at an acceptable cost. Therefore, in this study, a network of facilities for hub location in the service site domain, considering existing and potential facilities under probable scenarios, has been proposed. After presenting the mathematical model, validation was performed on a small scale, followed by sensitivity analysis of the main parameters of the model. Furthermore, a metaheuristic algorithm was employed to analyze the NP-Hardness of the model. Additionally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the model, two metaheuristic algorithms, NSGAII and MOPSO, were developed. Based on the conducted analysis, it can be observed that the computational time increases exponentially with the size of sample problems, indicating the NP-Hardness of the problem. However, the NSGAII algorithm performs better in terms of computational time for medium-sized problems compared to the MOPSO algorithm.</jats:p>"

This research investigated the impact of chemical modification using fly ash on hydraulic conductivity. The coefficient of hydraulic conductivity along the bedding plane at different angles of orientations was predicted by employing machine learning techniques such as gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and regression tree (RT), considering various influencing parameters. As the amount of fly ash in the porous medium rises, the hydraulic conductivity decreases. The statistical results demonstrate that the proposed ANN model effectively forecasted the horizontal hydraulic conductivity. It achieved the highest R2 value (0.989), the lowest mean absolute percentage error value (5.772), the lowest scatter index value (0.040), and the lowest Akaike Information Criterion value (−2,359.914) compared to the GEP, RT, and previously established approaches. Moreover, a novel equation has been proposed for determining horizontal hydraulic conductivity, which can be used for any stratified medium, distinguishing this work from previous ones. These findings can inform global practices in mitigating groundwater contamination, enhancing irrigation efficiency, and improving the design of subsurface fluid flow systems, making it a valuable contribution to both academic and practical applications worldwide.</jats:p>",

The paper proves that the objective functions of the optimization models are all convex functions of the supply capacity. The optimal supply strategy and the expression for each business model are then derived. Next, the intervals for enterprises to choose the profit-optimal business model are given and visually demonstrated through graphs. These findings lead to managerial insights: in economically underdeveloped regions, it is appropriate for enterprises to conduct community group buying businesses; in economically developed regions, it is appropriate for enterprises to conduct prepositioned warehouse businesses; and in regions with average economic development, it is appropriate for enterprises to conduct both businesses. Finally, this paper verifies the optimal supply strategy for the online retail model for agricultural products through numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses for different cost parameters.</jats:p>"

In the past, efforts in building a global supply chain were initially focused on “visible products” of manufacturing and other industrial sectors. In recent years, however, the use of global supply chains in business strategies has spread beyond the manufacturing industry into such areas as the IT service sector, which target “invisible products.” Many developing and emerging countries in Asia have excellent IT companies and engineers as the IT service sector is one of the most suitable industries for starting a new business because there is no need to collect large capital investments or hold inventories of materials and components. For this reason, there is a high entrepreneurial spirit in the IT service fields in developing and emerging countries. This paper discusses the current state and challenges of global supply chains in Japan's IT service sector, in which Japanese and overseas IT companies are involved.</jats:p>",

Microplastics can absorb other pollutants and pose risks to both humans and the environment. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of MPs in tap water from the drinking water distribution system of Isfahan, Iran, and to determine the exposure to MPs from drinking tap water. Methods: Samples were collected from different points in the drinking water distribution system of Isfahan, Iran. Samples were prepared for analysis through filtration and chemical digestion. The MPs were counted using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the composition of MPs was analyzed using a micro-Raman spectrometer. Results: The concentration of MPs in tap water was found to be 287.0 ± 65.9 MPs/l. MPs ≤ 10 µm were the predominant sizes, and fibers were the predominant shape. Polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, and polypropylene were the most frequently identified MPs, respectively. Conclusions: Considering that the Iranian population consumes 7 - 15 liters of water daily for drinking and cooking, it is estimated that the average intake of MPs through cooking and drinking water is 2009 - 43,051 particles per day.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply enterprises significantly impact local communities by providing essential services. These companies face high electricity costs for water extraction, purification, and transportation, affecting efficiency and reliability. Therefore, implementing innovative technologies to enhance sustainability in the water supply sector is crucial. This article explores the opportunities and strategies for renewable energy transition at water supply companies. Using investment, sensitivity, and strategic analyses, as well as a case study approach, the research examines technologies, conceptual frameworks, mechanisms, and approaches to integrate green power into water supply operations, addressing high energy costs and promoting sustainability. The article identifies solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal energy technologies as the most prominent renewable power solutions for water supply enterprises. The developed conceptual framework for implementing these technologies includes needs assessment and goal setting; resource assessment and technology selection; system design and integration; financing and investment; regulatory compliance and permitting; stakeholder engagement and capacity building; and monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement. The mechanisms and approaches to integrate green energy solutions within the developed framework can involve on-site renewable energy generation, power purchase agreements, energy storage and microgrid systems, energy efficiency and demand management, and collaborative and community-based models. As a case study, the article examines a 120-kW solar power plant project for a water supply enterprise, demonstrating profitability with a net present value of 60,370 USD and an internal rate of return exceeding 21%. The project's payback period is estimated at 8.38 years, acceptable within industry standards. Sensitivity analysis indicates the project's financial resilience. Increasing electricity prices will boost profitability, justifying the solar power plant investment amid inflation and economic instability. Additionally, the project ensures reliable water transport and environmental benefits by reducing CO2 emissions through solar energy use. Thus, transitioning to renewable energy at water supply enterprises is feasible and essential for long-term sustainability, transforming operations to be more resilient, efficient, and environmentally friendly.</jats:p>"

The developed mathematical optimization model focuses on fleet selection (private/outsource) and incorporates the concept of ‘inter-warehouse collaboration’, which addresses key logistics considerations. Integrating mining, processing, storage and transportation, the model encompasses decision variables like extracted carnallite amount, production, storage levels and shipped potash amount. Illustrated through a case study on the Arab Potash Company in Jordan, the results showcase the model’s proficiency in meeting local and international market demands. The model ensures resilient and sustainable supply chain performance by emphasizing logistics optimization, particularly in fleet selection. The study attains the highest ‘warehouse-to-warehouse’ support for Standard and Granular potash types in the international demand scenario, contributing to efficient production planning and fleet management. In conclusion, the presented mathematical model is a valuable tool for potash industry stakeholders, offering insights for strategic decision-makers involved in production planning and fleet management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The selection of suppliers represents a pivotal aspect of supply chain management and has a considerable impact on the success and competitiveness of the organization in question. The selection of a suitable supplier is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem based on a number of qualitative, quantitative, and even conflicting criteria. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel MCDM approach dedicated to the supplier evaluation problem using an ordered fuzzy decision making system. This study uses a fuzzy inference system based on IF–THEN rules with ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs). The approach employs the concept of OFNs to account for potential uncertainty and subjectivity in the decision making process, and it also takes into account the trends of changes in assessment values and entropy in the final supplier evaluation. This paper’s principal contribution is the development of a knowledge base and the demonstration of its application in an ordered fuzzy expert system for multi-criteria supplier evaluation in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The proposed system takes into account the dynamic changes in the value of assessment parameters in the overall supplier assessment, allowing for the differentiation of suppliers based on current and historical data. The utilization of OFNs in a fuzzy model then allows for a reduction in the complexity of the knowledge base in comparison to a classical fuzzy system and makes it more accessible to users, as it requires only basic arithmetic operations in the inference process. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the assessment of suppliers against a range of criteria, including local hiring, completeness, and defect factors. Furthermore, the potential to integrate sustainability and ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) criteria in the assessment process adds value to the decision making framework by adapting to current trends in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Supply chain sustainability performance needs to be carried out to determine sustainability under current conditions and to design appropriate strategies to increase sustainability. This study aims to design a sustainability performance assessment model for the sago agro-industry supply chain and identify critical indicators for sustainability improvement. Methods The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) evaluates sustainability on three levels: economic, social, and environmental. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is then used to aggregate the overall sustainability performance. The cosine amplitude method (CAM) was used to analyze key indicators. This study assessed the sustainability performance on industrial- and small-medium-scale sago agro-industry. Results The results show that the supply chain sustainability performance on the industrial scale is 44.25, while it is 48.81 for the small-medium scale with the same status, almost sustainable. Key indicators for improving sago agro-industry supply chain sustainability performance include profit distribution among supply chain actors, institutional support for supply chains, waste utilization (reuse &amp; recycle), and the availability of waste management facilities. The implication of this research for managers regards assessing the current status of sustainability performance and key indicators as a reference for formulating sustainability strategies and practices. Implication The sago agro-industry sustainability performance evaluation methodology uses industry-relevant metrics to assess supply chain sustainability, promoting collaboration among stakeholders and assisting in the creation of sustainable strategies. Conclusions The results of the study will enable supply chain actors to understand the key indicators for improving sustainability performance in the sago agro-industry supply chain, especially in Meranti Islands Regency, Riau Province. The proposed model can be applied to other agro-industries by adjusting the indicators used and assessing data availability and suitability for the research object.</ns4:p>"

The particular type of food aid in focus is large-scale collaborations between charitable non-profit organisations and the food industry, through which food surplus is turned into food aid for people in food insecurity. The first examples of such food aid emerged less than 10 years ago in Sweden, but it has since experienced a dramatic growth. The development in Sweden follows a pattern known from many other European countries, with the exception that it is going faster, as if Sweden is catching up. This makes food aid in Sweden an interesting case for an empirical study. The article is based on an interview study performed in 2022. Staff and managers at two large, national organisations were interviewed about how the rapid growth in food aid has affected their work and the institutional logics of their organisations. They also provided their thoughts on the role of food aid in Swedish society. One of the main findings is that the growth in food aid bring both the benefit of more people in need receiving help, and the challenge of strain as well as concerns regarding ethics and mission drift in the organisations. Another finding is that the growth is driven by both a growth in demand for food aid, but also by a growth in supply of food from the charities and their corporate partnerships.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p><bold>Background</bold>: Foodborne disease caused by <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Few studies have been conducted on the prevalence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> contamination along milk supply chain, which is important for reducing public health risks.\nThe objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> in milk along supply chain; milking environment (floor, teat surface, and storage containers); milkers’ hands, diarrheic patients and to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia.\n<bold>Methodology</bold>: A cross-sectional study design was used to collect a total of 644 samples from 106 dairy farms, comprising tank bulk milk (n=106), cow’s milk (n=133), milkers’ hand swabs (n=59), teat surfaces (n= 51), floors (n= 37), milk storage containers (n=55), collectors’ bulk milk (n= 50), retailers’ bulk milk (n= 50), and stool from diarrheic patients (n= 103). The isolation and identification of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> were performed following standard bacteriological methods, and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method against 14antimicrobials.\n<bold>Results</bold>: The overall prevalence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> was 19.6% (126/644; 95% CI: 16.6 –226–22.8). The highest prevalence (28.8%; 95% CI: 17.7 – 42.1) was observed in hand swab samples, while the lowest was observed in bulk milk samples (14.2%; 95% CI: 8.1 – 22.3). The prevalence was 24.3% (49/202; 95% CI: 18.52 – 30.77) in the milking environment, 18% (61/339; 95% % CI: 14.1 - 22.5) in the milk supply chain samples and 15.5% (16/103; 95% CI: 9.2- 23.9) in the diarrheic patient samples. However, the difference in the prevalence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> among the different sample types was not statistically significant (Chi-squared = 8.12; p = 0.422). Among the <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolates tested, 89.7%, 88.5%, 77.8%, 77.8%, 66.7% and 63.3% were resistant to amoxicillin, ceftazidime, ampicillin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and tetracycline, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin, and 81% of them were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was detected in 88% (44/50) of the isolates. The MDR was higher at the farm than milk collectors and retailers.\n<bold>Conclusion and Recommendation</bold>: Our study revealed a high prevalence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> along the milk supply chain, in milking environment, and in humans, suggesting the need for intervention. The isolates were phenotypically resistant to most antimicrobials used in the medical and veterinary practices. Moreover, the antimicrobial resistance profile and MDR indicates the emergence of innovation of drug of choice for the treatment of disease of human and animals. Further studies on the genetic relatedness of the isolates from different sources, quantifying the risk of consumption of milk contaminated with<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>and identifying the determining factors are required to design tailored and effective measures to ensure milk safety.</p>"

As the industry faces increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices due to environmental concerns, regulatory demands, and consumer expectations, these technologies offer significant potential for improving traceability, reducing waste, and optimizing operational efficiency. The research highlights how blockchain enhances transparency and ethical sourcing, IoT enables real-time monitoring to minimize waste, and AI optimizes demand forecasting and inventory management, reducing overproduction and resource waste. However, the study also identifies substantial barriers to the adoption of these technologies, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These challenges include high implementation costs, a shortage of skilled labor, and concerns over data security and privacy. To address these issues, the study recommends starting with pilot projects to mitigate risks, investing in continuous workforce training, enhancing data security measures, and leveraging government support and industry collaborations. By overcoming these challenges, Malaysia's food industry can effectively integrate these innovations, leading to more sustainable, efficient, and resilient supply chains. This research underscores the importance of strategic planning and continuous improvement in fully realizing the benefits of technological advancements, thereby positioning Malaysia’s food industry as a leader in sustainable practices within the global market.</jats:p>"

Cities, towns, and peri-urban settlements typically benefit from piped systems, while rural areas rely on water supplies from surface sources like rivers and canals, as well as ground sources such as wells and tube wells. When traditional methods fail, alternative water supply systems emerge in both urban and rural areas. This paper addresses the question of whether alternative water supply arrangements are sustainable in terms of system reliability, consumer acceptance, cost-effectiveness, convenience, perceptions of service levels, and ease of access to service providers. This paper examines the status of alternative water supply arrangements in Turkana County, Kenya, and Orangi in Karachi, Pakistan, using qualitative methods. It highlights that underprivileged communities commonly turn to alternative water supply arrangements when conventional methods are unavailable or underperforming.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In response to international sanctions, Russia has restructured its hydrocarbon commerce through trade deflection, redirecting exports from sanctioning to non-sanctioning countries. Theresearch aimed to analyze hydrocarbon trade deflection under theRussia–Ukraine conflict within thecontext of theChina–Russia Strategic Partnership and BRICS, and to assess therestructuring of Russia’s crude oil and natural gas supply chains from 2020 to 2023. Two questions were addressed: Whether trade deflection shifted towards non-sanctioning countries, including China and other BRICS countries; whether Russia’s oil and gas supply chains were restructured towards these regions? Design incorporates themethod developed by theauthor which generates and utilizes an integrated database of Bill of Lading and export data to analyze supply-chain trade restructuring, identifying specific shifts in trade flows by product, country, and enterprises. Findings reflected that after sanctions were imposed in early 2022, Russian hydrocarbon exports to sanctioning countries declined sharply, while exports to non-sanctioning countries, particularly China and India, increased significantly. Findings demonstrate theeffectiveness of trade deflection as a strategic response to sanctions. This strategy has mitigated theadverse impacts on Russian oil and gas industry, with significant increases in exports to China and India. TheComprehensive Strategic Partnership with China has helped secure a substantial market for Russian crude oil and increased China’s energy security. This study enhances understanding of trade deflection mechanisms and provides a framework for analyzing theinterplay between international trade, geopolitical strategies, and economic resilience. Geopolitical alliances and trade partnerships have ensured ­resilience and continuity in global trade. This shift indicates strategic diversification towards Asian markets and increased Central Asian involvement. BRICS engagement has provided Russia with a platform to advocate for energy security and challenge Western dominance in global energy governance. Future research should explore other supply-chain components and analyze trade within theBRICS+ group and Russia–China bilateral trade.</jats:p>"

A two-stage emergency supply chain mixed integer programming model is constructed. At the same time, an adjustable robust optimization model is constructed based on robust optimization theory to enhance the network's ability to cope with uncertain factors, and the constraints with uncertain parameters are transformed through linear duality theory. In order to improve the solution effect of the model, an optimize cuckoo search (OCS) algorithm is proposed, and a benchmark example is introduced to verify the superiority and applicability of the OCS algorithm in solving multi-objective functions. Finally, the emergency material distribution data during the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan is used to study the emergency supply chain network decision-making problem with uncertain parameters, and the effective suppression of the robust control coefficient on uncertain disturbances is proved through sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

Specifically for the construction industry in Tasikmalaya City to manage the construction supply chain, this study was conducted with the title Identification of Sustainable Construction Supply Chain Patterns in Projects in Tasikmalaya City. This study aims to identify the supply chain system patterns of construction service companies, especially contractors, and what development patterns can be carried out by construction service companies to increase the competitiveness of construction service businesses in Indonesia through literature reviews and case studies on contractor companies in Tasikmalaya. This research method uses descriptive microanalysis from the results of semi-structured interviews. Data collection will be collected by direct interviews with construction project owners or managers in their respective projects. Based on the results of descriptive analysis of the information obtained, a general model is compiled that describes how the supply chain system pattern is carried out. The preparation of the supply chain pattern resulting from the identification will refer to the pattern developed by Susilawati in previous research, where the supply chain pattern has a relationship from the owner to the lowest subcontractor. This study identified three supply chain patterns where the pattern has a maximum of 4 tiers, and the selection of the supply chain pattern is based on the type of project being worked on and the company's ability to manage the project. The critical points for building an integrated supply chain are knowing the value desired by the client, building long-term relationships with suppliers, integrating activities, collaborating to manage costs, developing continuous improvement, and mobilizing and developing human resources.</jats:p>"

However, efficiently managing residual biomass poses significant challenges, particularly in optimizing supply chain operations. Advanced modeling approaches are necessary to address these complexities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for creating simulation models tailored to agroforestry residual biomass supply chains. Methods: The study employs a hybrid simulation approach, integrating geographic information system mapping with a case study analysis. The simulation was conducted over a 365-day period, using the anyLogistix software (version 2.15.3.202209061204) to model various supply chain dynamics. The framework also accounts for financial, operational, customer satisfaction, and environmental metrics. Results: The simulation results showed a total expenditure of EUR 5,219,411.3, with transportation being the primary cost driver, involving 5678 trips and a peak capacity of 67.16 m3. CO2 emissions were measured at 487.7 kg/m3. The model performed as expected, highlighting the need for sustainable logistics strategies to reduce costs, lower losses, and improve productivity. Conclusions: This study presents one of the first detailed methodological frameworks for simulating agroforestry residual biomass supply chains. It provides valuable managerial insights into the financial, operational, and environmental aspects of supply chain management. The findings may stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance the sustainability of biomass utilization in energy production.</jats:p>"

Despite efforts to improve water access, issues such as inadequate government funding, inconsistent development aid, limited community involvement, water leakage, and high energy costs hinder the efficient operation of these systems. These inefficiencies compromise service delivery, leading to unreliable access to clean water and heightened operational costs. Therefore, this study examines the impact of government funding, development aid, and community contributions on the efficiency of water supply systems in Babati District. Utilizing a cross-sectional research design, data were collected from 76 respondents, including government officials, water utility workers, and community leaders. Regression analysis revealed that government funding, development aid, and community contributions have a significant positiveimpact on water supply efficiency. In contrast, water leakage and high energy costs were found to negatively affect efficiency, with population density also presenting a marginally significant challenge. Based on these findings, the study recommends increased public investment in infrastructure, greater community engagement, and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies to improve water service sustainability and performance in the district. These insights provide a framework for policymakers and stakeholders to address water inefficiencies and improve service delivery in similar rural contexts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To keep up with the rapid development and to increase spectral efficiency, emerging communication systems like 5G will need to transfer data at speeds significantly faster than those of current systems. The subject of this study is radio frequency (RF) circuit systems, with an emphasis on efficiency enhancement for RF power amplifiers (PA). To cut costs and size, the majority of a smartphone's components are now integrated into a single chip. Regardless of the input signal's magnitude, the fundamental idea behind the envelope tracking (ET) approach is to operate the linear PA in its high-efficiency area. This is achieved by modulating the linear PA's supply voltage, which is as low as 1V, after determining the input signal's magnitude. In view of reducing the chip area and enhancing the efficiency of the PA, an 18nm FinFET node has been used and a comparator-based approach is demonstrated. Keeping the parameters of the 5G specifications in mind, a single-bit comparator is designed to operate at the Sub-6 GHz frequency band with a centre frequency of 3.5 GHz. The propagation delay of the comparator is as low as 67.18ps, and the 8-bit comparator, designed by cascading single-bit comparators, serves as the dynamic power source for the supply modulator. This study provides scope for further development in integrating the comparator with an RF PA for efficiency enhancement. The digital approach of using a comparator instead of bulky circuits provides an upper edge in terms of power consumption and reduction in chip area.  The power consumption of the entire efficiency-enhanced PA in an 18nm FinFET technology is expected to reduce considerably in comparison with the CMOS technology.</jats:p>"

But despite the increase in power system capacity, which is outstripping the dynamics of electricity demand, the need for the most expensive peak power sources and energy storage systems is growing, which leads to an increase in electricity prices in addition to the investment component. A positive feedback has been identified that reduces the structural stability of the energy sector, namely: between rising electricity prices; reduction of electricity consumption from the network as a result of the installation of their own generation by some consumers; increasing costs of generating and network companies; more intensive growth in electricity prices and increased motivation to install their own generation for that part of consumers who continue to use grid electricity. The ways are proposed and the solutions are considered aimed at forming new connections between participants in the single technological process of production, transmission and consumption of energy resources, with the aim of reducing the energy supply costs and improving the specific performance indicators of the energy system, and in the future reducing the costs of integrating renewable energy sources into it.</jats:p>"

Enterprises face various challenges, including cybersecurity threats, market volatility, technological change and changing global conditions. A strong SCR not only ensures continued business operations but also maintains market stability and consumer well-being. Digital transformation helps businesses anticipate market changes, optimize inventory management, improve operational efficiency, and assist in management decisions when necessary by providing unprecedented data transparency and real-time insights. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of digital transformation in the supply chains of physical firms globally through a literature review, to identify the factors influencing the resilience of digital transformation in the supply chains of physical firms, and to discover the barriers to digital transformation in the supply chains of physical firms. The study finds that the digital transformation of physical firms' supply chains is still in its infancy, and there are barriers at both managerial and physical levels. Solutions to address these barriers include enhancing employee training, correctly introducing appropriate digital technologies, and improving information security.</jats:p>"

In recent years, much scientific research and studies have been conducted in China and Europe regarding China’s transport evolution era, from the production stage to the physical distribution stage, involving multiple steps until loads are in customers’ hands. The article considers the optimisation problem of a supply chain with multiple periods and diverse means of transportation. The considered problem can be formulated as a dynamic multi-criteria decision-making problem, in which the criteria are minimising the total cost, minimising the carbon footprint, and minimising the average transporting time. </jats:p>"

Additionally, underexplored applications such as food donation and redistribution, supply chain financing, animal welfare, food waste management, and data analysis are identified, revealing opportunities for further innovation. The research employed NVivo 14 to analyze the extent of Blockchain’s implementation in various food supply chain drivers, and the findings informed the development of a more diverse framework for Blockchain integration. Key insights demonstrate Blockchain’s transformative potential, particularly in enhancing data integrity, trust, and operational efficiency through its immutable ledger and smart contracts, which streamline transactions, cut administrative costs, and reduce fraud. In terms of sustainability and safety, Blockchain improves traceability, accelerates safety responses, promotes environmental sustainability by tracking resource usage, and enhances humanitarian efforts with transparent, efficient resource distribution. Additionally, Blockchain facilitates food waste reduction by optimizing inventory and distribution, while ensuring surplus food reaches those in need. The study concludes by offering a roadmap for future research, pointing toward untapped dimensions of Blockchain’s application in food traceability, sustainable supply chain management, and environmental &amp; social impact. While the review provides a comprehensive understanding of Blockchain’s current usage in food supply chains, the scope is limited by the systematic review process and specific inclusion criteria.

Solution of theoretical and practical problems on providing digital control of a pulse converter using high-speed microprocessor tools in the output current stabilization mode with provision of a specified duration of transient processes caused by an increase in load voltage and output current astaticity, which allows to obtain significant advantages over analog versions.\nMethodology. Review of literary and patent sources on the subject, theory of pulse automatic control systems, mathematical modeling of processes in pulse current stabilizers in the MATLAB / Simulink software environment and physical prototyping.\nFindings. A simulation model of an autonomous power supply system based on a converter using soft switching technology of transistors and an arc load is presented. A control law is synthesized and a model of a pulse current stabilizer is developed. A method is proposed and ways are found to control a pulse current stabilizer that provide a given duration of transients and astatism of the output current. A model of a pulse stabilizer with digital control based on a single-crystal computing module is developed and manufactured. The results of the study confirm the achievement of a finite duration of transient processes caused by a step change in the load voltage, close to 3-4 periods of conversion and output current astaticism. It is shown that the use of a pulse stabilizer using a fully digital control circuit has undeniable advantages over analog systems.\nOriginality. The problem of synthesizing a digital controller for a given control time by the method of desired transfer functions for a soft switching operating converter on an arc load is solved. In addition to the given control time, additional quality requirements in the steady state are provided.\nPractical value.The use of microprocessor technology makes it possible not only to implement complex and new highly efficient control algorithms for a converter operating in the pulse current stabilizer mode, but also to perform additional functions for overload protection, self-diagnostics and telemetry of pulse converters. The use of this same digital device simultaneously for the purpose of controlling a pulse converter will allow to abandon analog PWM controllers and thereby reduce its own energy consumption and weight and size characteristics, increase the reliability of the functioning of pulse converters in power supply systems as a whole.</jats:p>"

This paper explores financial risk assessment in supply chain management using advanced deep learning techniques on big data. The Adaptive Serial Cascaded Autoencoder (ASCA), combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP), is used to evaluate financial risks. A data transformation process is used to clean and prepare financial data for analysis. Additionally, Sandpiper Galactic Swarm Optimization (SGSO) is employed to optimize the deep learning model’s performance. The SGSO-ASCALSMLP-based financial risk prediction model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to traditional methods. It outperformed GRU (gated recurrent unit)-ASCALSMLP by 3.03%, MLP-ASCALSMLP by 7.22%, AE-LSTM-ASCALSMLP by 10.7%, and AE-LSTM-MLP-ASCALSMLP by 10.9% based on F1-score performance. The SGSO-ASCALSMLP model is highly efficient in predicting financial risks, outperforming conventional prediction techniques and heuristic algorithms, making it a promising approach for enhancing financial risk management in supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

However, hydrogen has indirect warming effects. In this work, we conducted a life cycle assessment of electrolysis and steam methane reforming to assess their emissions while considering hydrogen’s indirect warming effects. We find that the primary factors influencing life cycle emissions are the production method and related feedstock emissions, rather than the hydrogen leakage and the indirect warming potential of hydrogen. A comparison between fossil fuel-based and hydrogen-based steel production and heavy-duty transportation showed a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, of approximately 800 to more than 1400 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e per tonne of steel and 0.1 to 0.17 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e per tonne-km of cargo. While any hydrogen production pathway reduces greenhouse gas emissions for steel, this is not the case for heavy-duty transportation. Therefore, we recommend a nuanced approach in choosing application areas for hydrogen.</p>"

We examine these challenges for Taiwan and Thailand, surveying major trends in the emerging space industry and exploring four analytical perspectives on how government-business relations shape adaptive national industrial policies in high-technology sectors with proliferating end-users. We argue that the Asian developmental state model is evolving in response to specific challenges of a global supply chain for commercial space activities dominated by leading space firms and government regulatory actions in the United States. Significant differences in Taiwan’s and Thailand’s space and industrial policy approaches will likely create divergent technological trajectories and reinforce current constraints on improving national security.

By employing a two-way, fixed-effects model, mediation analysis, and a moderation model, the study provides comprehensive insights. The findings reveal the following: (1) The ESG performance of target firms in automotive manufacturing significantly improves the TFP of downstream customers, and this conclusion is robust even when using instrumental variable methods, additional control variables, and rigorous robustness tests. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that the ESG performance of target firms alleviates the financing constraints of their customers, thereby positively impacting the customers’ TFP. Additionally, the study finds that the monopolistic power of the target firm negatively moderates the relationship between its ESG performance and the TFP of its customers.

The mediating role of competitive advantage and the moderating role of supply chain environmental uncertainty in the relationship between competitive advantage and operational performance were examined.\nDesign/ Methodology/ Approach: This paper used quantitative approach to confirm the conceptual model. Data was collected through questionnaires from directors/operational managers in 121 large and medium-scale manufacturing companies in Southeast Sulawesi Indonesia. The analysis employs Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA) to test the direct, mediating, and moderating effects of supply chain environmental uncertainty.\nResults: The findings demonstrate a significant positive influence of supply chain environmental uncertainty on competitive advantage and operational performance. However, competitive advantage does not significantly affect operational performance. The study reveals that competitive advantage is perfect mediator between supply chain environmental uncertainty and operational performance, while supply chain environmental uncertainty is a moderating predictor between competitive advantage and operational performance.\nPractical Implications: The research has implications for manufacturing company managers adapting to supply chain environmental uncertainty through supplier, customer, and technology considerations. It emphasizes the importance of adapting to supply chain environmental uncertainty to enhancing competitive advantage and operational performance in the manufacturing industry. Efforts to improve operational performance and strategically integrate competitive advantage should consider the business environment, including suppliers, customers, and technology.\nLimitations:  This research is limited to large and medium-scale manufacturing industries, hindering generalization to other industries, particularly small-scale ones. Additionally, researchers can consider additional contextual factors such as supply chain integration, supply chain agility, and total quality management.\nOriginality/Value: This study expands the theoretical framework of supply chain environmental uncertainty, competitive advantage, and operational performance through empirical testing of a theoretical model. The findings support the proposed model's validity and highlight the mediation role of competitive advantage and supply chain environmental uncertainty, providing a reference for future theory development and model building.</jats:p>"

In this review paper, peer‐reviewed publications (experimental data) dealing with the role of K administration in the control of cereals growth under drought stress are reviewed and analyzed. Most published research on the impact of K administration on cereals growth under drought focuses primarily on bread wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) and maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.), along with barley (<jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic> L.), rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.), pearl millet (<jats:italic>Pennisetum glaucum</jats:italic> L.), and sorghum (<jats:italic>Sorghum bicolor</jats:italic> L.). The beneficial effect of K on cereals growth under drought has been related to maintenance of water balance in the crops, increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes, increased synthesis of osmolytes, contribution to a low sodium (Na)/K ratio, extension of the grain filling period, and increase of the grain growth rate and weight. Moreover, K was suggested as a possible way for enhancing nitrogen use efficiency (e.g., bread wheat and sorghum). Nevertheless, the beneficial effect of foliar applied K in dried soil during grain filling differed among bread wheat cultivars, highlighting that the effect of K supply on grain weight may differ depending on application method, that is, administration through the soil or the foliage. Overall, K supply could be exploited as a tool for increasing cereal tolerance to drought, for example, by considering late administration of K through top dressing applications or foliar sprayings. Yet additional information is needed on the rate and the K form, along with the most suitable growth stage for application. Such information could help agronomists develop strategies for high‐quality cereal production in stressful environments.</jats:p>",

However, given the variety of alternative market conditions and EU forms, the attractiveness of cross-border electronic commerce (CBEC) between China and the EU has fallen far short, and there is an urgency to create a harmonious and uniform environmental environment for the exchange of information to facilitate the convenience of cross border electronic commerce. This study examines the CBEC of agricultural goods and its cooperative management technique inside the logistical supply chain. It details the complete transaction model and fundamental components and presents a theoretical framework for the CBEC distribution network. The Block Chain can effectively bridge the obstacles to CBEC in Chinese and European countries by providing a valuable source of benefits from decentralization, trust, anti-counterfeiting, consensus, innovative procurement, and extraordinary techniques, which will provide the basis for building an Embedded Provider Platform for Electronic Commerce, Risk Management System for Deposit Risk Management, Supply Chain (SC) Management System, Cross Border Logistic System, Customs Supervisory Computer, etc. The paper examines how blockchain science can assemble CBEC SC computing devices for agricultural goods between global places in Central Europe. Firstly, it expounds on the theory and characteristics of the blockchain. Then, the paper introduces the troubles that arise in the CBEC supply chain. Then, the thesis proposes a blockchain-based CBEC SC structure, analyzes the aspects and relations among each other, and provides a framework for developing a China-European blockchain cross-border electronic Commerce. The test findings indicate that the system satisfies the criteria for tracking agricultural items and enhances fresh farm commodities' quality and security.</jats:p>"

Disruptions are a real threat to supply chains, especially as the supply chains become longer and more complex. When buyers and sellers write a purchase contract, specifying every possible contingency related to disruptions may not be realistic. However, the ability to renegotiate once a disruption occurs can help buyers and suppliers find efficient solutions. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment consisting of three studies, each exploring different conditions regarding relationship length, bargaining power, and communication. Our findings indicate that the ability to renegotiate increases buyer profit and decreases disruption inefficiency in short-term relationships but not in long-term ones. In free bargaining, where bargaining power is equal, the impact of renegotiation is greater than in ultimatum bargaining, where bargaining power is unequal. Additionally, when communication is not allowed in ultimatum bargaining, renegotiation significantly enhances buyer profit and reduces disruption inefficiency. These insights can assist managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments prone to supply disruptions. The findings can aid managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments with supply disruptions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For supply chain management to be efficient and productive, a warehouse's ideal location is essential. Here are 10 crucial ideas for a warehouse's introduction and ideal location. The cost and efficiency of product distribution are strongly influenced by the location of a warehouse. A well-placed warehouse speeds up deliveries, improving customer satisfaction. A crucial factor is proximity to transportation networks including highways, railroads, and ports. The availability of transportation infrastructure and access to a skilled labour pool are important considerations. To choose acceptable sites, market demand and client distribution patterns should be examined. The placement of the warehouse should support corporate objectives like cost containment and operational effectiveness Geographical elements such as climate, natural calamities, and local laws should be considered. A centralised position allows for efficient routing and lower transportation expenses. To serve various markets and improve inventory management, several warehouses may be needed. Warehouse location analysis may be performed using cutting-edge technology like geographic information systems (GIS).These bullet points offer a succinct summary of the significance and factors to be taken into account when choosing the best location for a warehouse. The effectiveness of the supply chain and customer satisfaction are directly impacted by the best warehouse location. Proximity to transportation networks and access to skilled labour are crucial factors. Finding ideal sites benefits from analysis of consumer distribution patterns and market demand. It is important to evaluate geographic elements including the climate, laws, and natural catastrophes. Advanced technology and centralised sites can improve routing while lowering costs and optimising inventory control   Studying the best place for a warehouse has research implications since it may enhance supply chain management and commercial operations. The importance of the research is highlighted by the following 5 points. Cost cutting Finding the best place for a warehouse may result in savings on labour, transportation, and inventory management, which can boost profitability. Customer satisfaction: Quicker delivery times, improved customer satisfaction, and increased customer loyalty can all contribute to corporate success. Competitive edge: Choosing the best warehouse site might provide you an advantage over rivals by enabling quicker responses to market needs and more effective distribution. Sustainability and environmental impact: Investigating the best warehouse sites may help you make decisions that are good for the environment by lowering transportation costs and emissions, boosting sustainability, and decreasing your ecological imprint. Making strategic choices: Businesses may better align their operations with long-term development objectives by understanding the impact of warehouse location before making choices about distribution centre expansion, consolidation, or the creation of new facilities. Research into the best spot for a warehouse is important overall because it may increase operational effectiveness, cost savings, customer happiness, and sustainable business practices—all of which are necessary for success in a cutthroat market. The following phases are often included in the technique for locating a warehouse in the best possible location:data gathering Obtain pertinent information on market demographics, customer distribution patterns, transportation systems, labour availability, and location-specific costsSite-selection standards: Define the criteria in accordance with the particular requirements of the company, such as closeness to suppliers, consumers, transportation systems, and labour markets. Depending on each criterion's proportional value, give it a weight. Geographic analysis: Use geographic information systems (GIS) to visualise aspects like traffic patterns, population density, and competitor locations while analysing spatial data. To find suitable warehouse locations that match the given requirements, do a geographical analysis. Analyse the costs connected with each prospective site, including the purchase of land or buildings, the price of construction or refurbishment, taxes, utilities, labour, and transportation. Think of long-term elements like scalability and possible growth. Risk assessment: Examine possible hazards and vulnerabilities related to each place, including weather-related catastrophes, political stability, regulatory restrictions, and regulatory restraints. Assess the effects on operations and put risk-reduction plans in place. Decision-making: Compare and order the prospective warehouse sites based on the data that has been gathered, the analysis, and the cost factors. Choose the greatest location for your company, taking into account aspects like cost-effectiveness, market reach, and operational efficiency.  Warehouse A, Warehouse B, Warehouse C, Warehouse D. Stock holding capacity (unit) {SHC}, Movement flexibility, Average distance to shops (km), Average distance to main suppliers (km), Unit price {UP} shows the rank of Alternatives Warehouse A, Warehouse B Warehouse C, Warehouse D. In order to achieve supply chain efficiency, customer happiness, and overall business success, a warehouse's ideal location is essential. Businesses may choose the best location for their warehouse operations using a structured technique that includes data collecting, analysis, and decision-making.</jats:p>",

At present, research is scarcely focused on the influence of the adoption of digital technologies (DTs) on establishing comprehensive relationships within the context of a circular economy (CE), and the supply chain (SC) framework to contribute to the Resource-Based View (RBV) theory. This study utilizes survey data collected from 235 manufacturing practitioners employed by Turkish manufacturing enterprises to explore a model elucidating the relationship between DTs adoption and sustainability performance (SP) through supply chain traceability (SCT), supply chain resilience (SCR), and circular economy practices (CEPs), based on 10R strategies. Through this linkage, this research accentuates that the exclusive integration of CEPs with digital technology solutions is insufficient for industrial enterprises to attain their long-term sustainability goals. It underscores the necessity of ensuring SCT and/or SCR in this context.</jats:p>"

The research was underpinned by a positivist philosophy which supported in being able to carry out an objective analysis of AICAP's mediation between AI and SCMP. Regression analysis with a deductive way was used to investigate the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The ability to quantitatively analyze the data supported a comprehensive examination of hypotheses originally posited. Findings indicated that there is a strong positive association (r = 0.816) between AI and SCMP, with R2 of the variance in SCMP accounted by AI as 66.5%, therefore, continued support for H1 was established. Moreover, the mediating role of AICAP is significant (total effect = 0.8239 and mediation effect = 0.1862, implicating H2 as well.

Assessing mineral resource supply chain resilience is an important pillar of mineral resource supply chain stability management. The globality, heterogeneity and complexity of supply chain bring challenges to the resilience assessment of global mineral resource supply chain. To solve this problem, a method based on multi-region input-output model, network percolation model and econometric model is proposed, which is able to measure the resilience of global mineral resource supply chain and its influencing factors from the perspective of the whole system. The percolation phase transition is introduced to measure the critical state of global mineral resource supply chain system collapse facing external disruption. Using the proposed method, this paper conducts an empirical study on the evolution of global mineral resource supply chain resilience from 2005 to 2014. The results show that the resilience of global mineral resource supply chain declined by 39.6% in 2005–2014. Most of the critical links that caused the collapse of the global mineral resource supply chain network are the manufacturing sector and its upstream and downstream sectors. The structure of supply chain network plays a key role in network resilience. Increasing the number of linkages in upstream and downstream could improve network resilience, but the increase of linkage strength would deteriorate network resilience.</jats:p>"

This paper addresses the scheduling and routing plans for maintenance of power generation assets over a multi-period horizon. We model this problem as a multi-period team orienteering problem. To address this multi-period challenge, we propose a dual approach: a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework and a biased-randomized heuristic algorithm. The RL-based method dynamically learns from real-time operational data and evolving asset conditions, adapting to changes in asset health and failure probabilities to optimize decision making. In addition, we develop and apply a biased-randomized heuristic algorithm designed to provide effective solutions within practical computational limits. Our approach is validated through a series of computational experiments comparing the RL model and the heuristic algorithm. The results demonstrate that, when properly trained, the RL-based model is able to offer equivalent or even superior performance compared to the heuristic algorithm.</jats:p>"

The MatLab software application was used to develop a block-modular model for a transformer substation with the proposed controlled voltage regulator and measurement modules. The developed model was used to investigate the current and voltage non-sinusoidality in different parts of a power supply system when stabilizing the voltage at the consumer end at a given level. The study was carried out using a shop transformer with a capacity of 1 MV∙A and a voltage of 6/0.4 kV under an active-inductive character of the load with the load current phase angle of φ=45 deg. The obtained results confirm that, due to the extended functional capabilities of the proposed technical solution, the voltage at consumers is maintained at a given level under high technical and economic performance. When the network voltage is reduced by 5% and the activeinductive load current is increased by 35%, the proposed device was shown to create voltage non-sinusoidality. The voltage non-sinusoidality value does not exceed the permissible domestic and international norms. In addition, the proposed device is capable of maintaining the voltage at the consumer end at a given level. The obtained integral characteristic of voltage stabilization shows that the application of the proposed technical solution instead of the existing mechanical voltage regulator of the “switching without excitation” type allows the nominal voltage at the busbar of the switchgear to be retained. Further research will investigate voltage stabilization at consumers with simultaneous compensation of reactive power for complex improvement of technical and economic indicators of power supply systems under the conditions of unstable supply voltage and load current.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>In recent years, a significant rise in international sudden risk events has resulted in impacts and disruptions to maritime supply chains. The resilience of maritime supply chains has garnered attention from the academic, industrial, and government sectors. The paper proposes a methodological framework based on the structural equation model (SEM), Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and utilizes questionnaire data from the maritime industry in China to evaluate the resilience in MSC. The computational results indicate that: (1) The high resilience of MSC is the result of the synergistic interaction among multiple factors, and these factors boost MSC resilience through diverse paths; (2) There are four pathways for high MSC resilience: the 'synergy + carbon reduction + digitization' path, the 'early warning + synergy' path, the 'agility + early warning' path, and the 'carbon reduction' path; (3) Digitization level can play a catalytic role in increasing the resilience of MSC by helping other factors. This paper reveals the multiple routes to enhance the resilience of MSC, which can instruct MSC members to choose the correct resilience management strategies based on their existing resources and situations and can help both practitioners and researchers to understand in more detail of the various dimensions and nuances of resilience in the context of MSC.</p>"

Corn, a staple in Indonesian agriculture, is predominantly cultivated with limited post-harvest activities, impeding rural economic growth. This study examines the supply chain management of the corn agro-industry to enhance value addition and competitiveness. Utilizing the Hayami method, the research identifies stages in the corn processing chain, including cleaning, grinding, filtering, and drying, and evaluates the value added at each stage. The analysis reveals that the supply chain involves multiple stakeholders, from farmers to retailers, and highlights the disparity in value addition among different actors. The study concludes that effective supply chain management, risk mitigation, and strategic interventions are vital for sustaining the corn agro-industry.

One such topic is cultural awareness. However, despite its critical relevance in today's global landscape, the topic is often underrepresented in PSM curricula. This gap is further compounded by the unique learning preferences of Generation‐Z, who are less inclined toward traditional “reading and writing” methods, presenting additional challenges for educators in teaching such complex topics. This underscores the need for innovative teaching strategies that engage students and improve knowledge retention. We propose employing an Entertainment‐Education approach by integrating movies into PSM courses. We describe a specifically tailored activity for a PSM course that includes a movie available on an over‐the‐top platform implemented at two state universities in the United States. The outcomes from both universities offer evidence supporting the development of cultural understanding within the PSM domain among the students. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of movies as educational tools, our research is one of the first within the PSM domain to investigate their potential for cultivating cultural awareness, thereby paving the way for further research into the role of movies in PSM education.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is focused on the problem of compensation of payment of a penalty for improper performance (non-performance) of the duties by the parties to legal services supply agreement. The author has indicated that the protection of the rights and interests of the subjects of civil relations, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 8, 9 of Part 2 of the Art. 16, paragraphs 3, 4 of Part 1 of the Art. 611 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, can be carried out by means of compensation of damage and other methods of compensation for property damage, compensation for moral (non­property) harm and award of a penalty. The analysis of case-law shows that compensation of damage by customers of legal services, along with termination of contracts, is ranked first within the structure of judicial protection methods in obligations to provide legal services. Talking about the compensation for moral harm and award of a penalty, such methods of protection are applied extremely rarely. Accordingly, the author believes that the problem of the responsibility of a provider of legal services, in particular the matter of classification of the appropriateness (or, on the contrary, inappropriateness) of performing own duties by this party of the obligation, causes the most problematic issues both from the point of view of the doctrine of civil law and legal enforcement practice\r\nThe author of the article has noted the possibility of applying a penalty for such types of offenses as delay in fulfilling the main obligation (delay in providing a legal service per se) and delay in returning funds to a customer. The legislation of Ukraine does not provide the possibility to apply a penalty in relation to improper (low-quality) service provision. Therefore, if a provider began to provide legal services in time, but provided them improperly, then the application of a penalty (fine) to his illegal behavior will be possible only if the contract concluded between the provider and the customer of legal services specifically stipulates a relevant term. Taking into account the known advantages in the position of legal services’ providers regarding certain dictates of contractual terms at the stage of concluding contracts, such a penalty clause is unlikely to appear in such contracts. The difficulty of applying this type of a penalty is also explained by the problem of determining the criteria for assessing the quality of legal services’ provision. As we have noted, there are no such clear criteria. Therefore, the application of a penalty (fine) for the “low-quality” legal service fulfilled by the provider is also complicated by objective reasons.\r\nThe author has substantiated the provisions that the composing elements of an offense are required in order to apply a penalty in legal relations on supplying legal services. In contrast to compensation of damage, lesser form of an offense is sufficient for awarding a penalty: wrongfulness of the performer’s behavior and his guilt. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition, we step aside from studying these aspects, since they are sufficiently thoroughly researched in the material of this subsection on compensation of damage.</jats:p>"

A new two-objective optimization model based on cohesive hierarchical clustering and electricity is proposed. Three distribution schemes are developed based on customer demand, shortest transportation time and the combination of both. When the overall satisfaction of the supply chain is the highest, the total revenue is maximized, which is suitable for the optimization of the supply chain of emergency materials under emergencies. Firstly, the power data and behavior data of power users are cross-analyzed to obtain the typical data characteristics of power users. Secondly, the cohesive hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to analyze the power users, and the cohesive hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to improve the calculation operation of score similarity. The adjustment factor is introduced to improve the calculation operation, and the comprehensive weight of each emergency point is determined as the parameter of the objective function by considering the subjective and objective factors that affect the importance of emergency points. Finally, through the simulation analysis of an emergency materials scheduling based on electric power, and compared with the results of random scheduling, the science and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified.</jats:p>"

Our study applied to a real network model that employs a 24-h simulation with 1-h time steps and evaluates the impact of leaks and loss in the pipe cross-sectional area on WDN hydraulic performance as experienced by end users. Adhering to a UK utility's 20-m head pressure requirement as the water main benchmark, we present two new customer-oriented performance indices (CPIs) centred on network reliability and pressure deficit severity. The new CPIs adeptly quantify network performance degradation due to pipe deterioration. This degradation translates directly to a poor customer experience, highlighting the potential for these CPIs to pinpoint areas of the network where performance levels are compromised. Furthermore, the CPIs identify individual pipes within the network where defects would severely impact network performance and the sets of pipes which, when simultaneously experiencing defects, would lead to a more severe loss in network performance. Results show that the CPIs capture relatively small performance declines and identify sensitive pipes impacting network performance, providing insights for optimised inspection and maintenance intervention to provide better customer service.</jats:p>",

The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model, which is subsequently linearized into a mixed integer linear programming model and hence able to obtain a global solution. Numerical examples in the manufacturing supply chain where customer demand follows normal distributions are used to assess the effect of quantity discount policies. Key findings demonstrate that the integration of quantity discount policies significantly reduces total supply chain costs and improves inventory management under demand uncertainty, and decision makers need to decide a balance level between service levels and profits.</jats:p>"

This has become an important area of research in sustainable energy development. The notable characteristic of this integration is its ability to improve the overall efficiency and reliability of the heat supply system. This study reviews the research conducted on the building heating system, which combines geothermal energy with solar energy, wind energy, and air-source energy. A thorough analysis of how previous studies have utilized renewable energy sources to address the drawbacks of geothermal heating systems has been performed, with a specific focus on energy consumption efficiency, soil temperature variations, system power supply, and cost analysis. Geothermal energy coupled with solar energy can mitigate the instability of the solar energy supply and reduce the ground temperature attenuation. The integration of geothermal and wind energy can produce electricity, thereby satisfying the power requirements. The combination of geothermal energy with an air-source heat pump system can enhance the overall performance and reduce the borehole heat exchanger depth. Through the detailed analysis of these hybrid systems, we aim to promote the development and popularization of the coupled system and provide a reference for renewable energy utilization.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to examine the role of workplace communication on employee performance within Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), focusing on how communication influences job correctness, decision-making, planning, and overall employee productivity. The study utilized a descriptive research design to collect data. A total of 36 participants were sampled using simple random. Data were gathered through questionnaires and analyzed using SPSS for quantitative data insights. The findings indicate a significant correlation between effective communication and enhanced employee performance. Specifically, open communication with supervisors was strongly linked to increased job correctness and performance (mean = 4.81). Communication was also found to facilitate decision-making and planning (mean = 3.53), and there was a recognized relationship between effective communication and overall employee performance (mean = 3.97). However, the traditional top-down communication approach was noted, with a mean score of 3.65, suggesting areas for improvement in adopting more inclusive communication practices. The study confirms the critical role of effective workplace communication in enhancing employee performance at TANESCO. Open and transparent communication, particularly with supervisors, significantly contributes to job accuracy and employee productivity. The study recommends that TANESCO implements structured programs to foster open dialogue, develops comprehensive communication strategies that balance hierarchical and inclusive approaches, and invests in regular training and assessment of communication practices. Additionally, adopting an 'open door' policy and engaging in active listening are suggested to enhance the communication framework within the organization.</jats:p>"

Traditional strategies focus on restoring operations to pre‐disruption states while largely maintaining the existing supply network structure. Recent cases, however, highlight a different approach: supply chain plasticity, wherein firms undergo significant structural shifts in supply network design as a response to disruptions with the goal to improve performance. Drawing on the foundations of supply chain responsiveness and network theory, we investigate how (and if) firms redesign their supply chains against a backdrop of increased disruptions and the implications supply chain plasticity has on resilience. Rooted in network theory, this study not only theoretically compares, contrasts, and connects prior concepts with supply chain plasticity but also empirically investigates whether firms exhibit a plastic response by modifying their supply chain network structures—specifically focusing on structural holes, centrality, and clustering network dimensions. Furthermore, we hypothesize that network plasticity impacts firm performance in the form of time to recover from a disruption. The findings demonstrate that the existence and significance of network plasticity in shaping firm responses to disruptions are indeed present and can be beneficial. We also provide evidence that supply chain plasticity is an efficacious strategy to enhance resilience and recovery performance amidst heightened disruption frequency. As firms increasingly face dynamic and complex environments, understanding and leveraging network plasticity will be vital for sustaining competitive advantage and achieving long‐term success.</jats:p>",

Despite growing massively over the last couple of decades, its growth is far from over. In fact, the pandemic has acted as an accelerator and the growth momentum is continuing despite people returning to the conventional brick and mortar shops. Ecommerce innovations are constantly being rehashed and improved – especially after the global pandemic this transition is now innovating at a much faster pace. For responding to the ever-increasing demand for swifter yet efficient fulfillment of customer order along with timely shipment, a larger number of e- commerce businesses are turning towards third-party logistics or 3PL providers. While it offers them the freedom from the hassles of storing and delivering finished products to the end-users, the human resource that is therefore freed, can then focus on core competencies of the business thus allowing them to give attention to product development, innovation along with marketing and sales. There is always the risk of poor fulfillment and delayed shipments or goods getting damaged in transit which deteriorates customer satisfaction and company profitability. This article compares the use of third-party logistics (3PL) against building in-house capabilities and highlights the virtue of careful selection and employment of experienced 3PL in helping an enterprise ride the anticipated growth wave by offering cost advantages and flexibility.</jats:p>"

Raised bed planting increased grain yield by 24% compared to flat cultivation. This increase for biological yield was about 17%, the number of ears was 7%, and the number of seeds per ear was 21%. Drought stress caused a significant decrease in grain yield (46.4%), number of ears (20.5%), seed number (30.3%), biological yield (45.9%), chlorophyll a (31.8%), chlorophyll b (28.1%) and relative water content (5.3%) and increased, proline content (24.3%) and ion leakage (147.3%). Water use efficiency was increased in raised bed planting and deficit irrigation treatments. The decrease in yield due to drought stress was moderated to some extent in the raised bed system and therefore cultivation on raised beds is suggested as a suitable planting pattern to improve yield and WUE in wheat under conditions similar to the experimental area, especially under water shortage conditions.</jats:p>",

The PDA requires a relationship, called node–head–flow relationship (NHFR) between available head and available flow at a node to know whether the demand is fulfilled completely, partially, or not at all, depending on the available pressure. Several types of NHFRs have been suggested in the past and mostly a single type of NHFR is used at different nodes. An assessment of these NHFRs is carried out to know how accurate the use of a single type of NHFR is for the lumped nodes. The errors in prediction of the available nodal flows through the available NHFRs and that obtained through the detailed analysis are quantified using chi square. It is observed that actual NHFR is not as smooth as approximated by the different available NHFRs. A nonlinear behaviour between available flows and available heads exists for partial flow conditions and requires proper values of constants to define any NHFR. Furthermore, NHFRs at different lumped nodes in a network are different. This study recommends the consideration of different relationships at different lumped nodes of the network for PDA.</jats:p>",

Slavery, forced labour, and related practices are strictly prohibited under international law. Forced labour is a longstanding and complex obstacle in global supply chains, frequently associated with the desire for inexpensive products and the outsourcing of manufacturing processes to nations with lax labour regulations. The growing power of transnational corporations (TNCs) poses significant challenges to workers at the bottom of supply chains. However, disagreements have made it unclear how to deal with new forms of forced labour, or modern forms of slavery. This confusion highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to combating these issues. Efforts to stop or restrict forced labour will be made easier with a clear legal definition at both the national and international levels, particularly with an emphasis on the human rights perspective.</jats:italic>\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies the influence of different picking policies in a stock of perishable items on the quantity of waste, the degree of freshness of the stored products and the profit. We consider a push-pull supply chain with three echelons (an agricultural producer, a manufacturer and a retailer), in which the quantity ordered from the upstream supplier is determined using a forecast based on a simple exponential smoothing of historical sales data of perishable products. To meet a stochastic demand that is symmetrically distributed around a given average, the stock of this perishable product must be sufficient without exceeding the expiration dates to avoid any waste. If the demand exceeds the available stocks, the manufacturer can resort to external suppliers on a spot market to deliver the products very quickly. We developed a simulation model to compare three picking policies (FIFO: first-in-first-out, LIFO: last-in-first-out and RDM: random picking policy) and their performance in terms of the average age of stored goods, the quantity of waste and the profit. A counterintuitive result showed that under certain conditions, the LIFO policy led to better performance than the FIFO policy, a result we proved mathematically. We then simulated different scenarios by varying product depreciation and margin rates. When margins decrease linearly with product age, the FIFO policy is the least competitive. In the case of normally distributed demand, LIFO is the most efficient picking policy, whereas in the case of uniform demand, the RDM policy performs better. We also studied the sensitivity of the model to the parameters of the demand function and the smoothing coefficients used to forecast the quantities of perishable products to be supplied. Finally, we applied our model to some specific features of the poultry and meat industry and simulated a policy of preventive production reduction.</jats:p>"

In this context, optimism is defined as a cognitive bias in which third-party sellers underestimate the probability of encountering low market potential. We present a game-theoretic model to characterize the equilibrium strategies of both the platform and the sellers. Our analysis reveals that when both sellers exhibit optimism bias, this bias invariably leads to lower expected profits for them. However, seller optimism can benefit both the platform and the whole system. That is, as sellers become more biased, the profits of the platform and the entire supply chain increase. Moreover, when a biased seller competes with a sophisticated one, unilateral optimism can result in a win–lose outcome in which the optimistic seller benefits from her bias at the expense of her sophisticated rival. Indeed, we demonstrate that optimism can confer a competitive advantage in a duopoly, allowing the more biased seller to earn higher profits than its less biased competitor—even if the latter is unbiased or sophisticated. Our work sheds light on the conditions under which optimism bias may have detrimental or beneficial impacts on e-commerce supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

Through comprehensive quantitative analyses, including panel data regression, multivariate regression, and time-series analysis, we dissect the relationship between GDP growth rates, inflation, unemployment rates, interest rate fluctuations, exchange rate volatility, stock market trends, and supply chain performance metrics. Our findings highlight a significant correlation between economic growth and supply chain efficiencies, the exacerbating effect of inflation and unemployment on supply chain costs and demand, and the nuanced impacts of financial market dynamics on supply chain financing and operational strategies. Moreover, we delve into the transformative potential of digitalization, automation, blockchain technology, and advanced analytics in mitigating risks associated with economic fluctuations and financial uncertainties. The empirical evidence suggests that technological innovations not only enhance supply chain resilience but also offer strategic advantages in navigating the complexities of global economic landscapes. This study underscores the critical need for adaptive strategies that leverage technological advancements to sustain supply chain competitiveness in an era of economic and financial volatility. </jats:p>"

In 2023, broiler chicken production is projected to reach 5.8 million/ton/year, while chicken meat consumption is estimated to reach 7.46 kg/capita/year. Indonesia is actively trying to increase livestock productivity in an effort to meet the nutritional needs of the community. The main objective of this research is to analyze supply chain management and the level of efficiency of the broiler chicken supply chain implemented by UD Budi. The research methodology includes descriptive analysis and examination of marketing efficiency. Research findings reveal that broiler chicken supply chain management has three streams. The product flow moves downstream, starting from the supplier at the slaughterhouse and ending with the final consumer of the chicken. On the other hand, financial flows move upstream, namely flowing from consumers back to producers (RPH). The flow of information is reciprocal and occurs in each link of the chain. Among the various marketing channels, the level I marketing channel (Producer (Slaughterhouse) â€“ Wholesaler (UD Budi) â€“ Consumer) shows the highest efficiency, with an efficiency value of 3.13%.Â Keywords:Â Broiler Chickens, Marketing Efficiency, Supply Chain</jats:p>"

Chinese oil fields predominantly employ continuous water injection methods, which incur substantial electricity consumption and costs. Embracing new energy sources for supply promises substantial reductions in electricity costs. However, the intermittent and unpredictable nature of wind and solar power generation does not align with the consistent and stable electricity demand required for continuous water injection, necessitating the exploration of novel water injection models compatible with new energy supplies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In pursuit of minimizing water injection electricity costs, this study proposes an intermittent water injection model grounded in the distinctive characteristics of new energy supply. During peaks of green electricity output surpassing production demand, \"increased injection\" is implemented, while during troughs of green electricity output falling below production demand, \"reduced or halted injection\" strategies are adopted. Insights derived from well test interpretations using shut-in pressure drop data guide the fine-tuning of water injection parameters. This transition shifts the water injection regime from the conventional \"24-hour stable flow continuous water injection\" to an \"X hours injection/ 24-X hours shut-in intermittent water injection\" approach. The feasibility of this model is comprehensively evaluated through real-time monitoring, engineering tests, and well test interpretations, assessing injection capacity, water absorption efficiency, reservoir characteristics, and productivity across the project lifecycle.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A 5-month intermittent water injection trial was conducted across two injection-production well pairs in the low-permeability reservoirs of the Jilin oilfield. Three distinct intermittent water injection protocols were designed: \"15 hours injection/ 9 hours shut-in\", \"13.3 hours injection/ 10.7 hours shut-in\", and \"12 hours injection/ 12 hours shut-in\". The injection rates, set at 1.6 times, 1.8 times, and 2.0 times the rate of continuous water injection, respectively, were determined by these protocols. Trial outcomes demonstrate reasonable high-speed injection pressures, satisfactory injection volumes, intact reservoir conditions, a 2.5 % reduction in water cut, and a delay of over 1.5 % in natural decline. Calculations based on new energy generation costs reveal a reduction of over 60% in daily electricity expenses compared to continuous water injection methods.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The successful field trial validates the feasibility of intermittent technology in low-permeability reservoirs, showcasing substantial savings in electricity costs and offering robust technical underpinning for the efficient development of such reservoirs.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to delineate potential groundwater zones in the Jedeb watershed, using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) model. Nine thematic layers, including lithology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, land cover and land use, lineament density, rainfall, soil, and static water level, were considered. The thematic layers obtained were integrated into a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment to generate the groundwater potential map. Four classes of groundwater potential have been identified: low, moderate, high, and very high. The low classes represent 12.8% and 7.02%; moderate 25.35% and 34.84%; high 38.8% and 33.11%; and very high 23.05% and 25.03%, for the AHP and FR models, respectively. The result map was also validated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve from which result accuracy was obtained is 85.6% and 88.3% for the AHP method and FR method, respectively. The study's validation verified that the FR model produced more efficacious results than the AHP model. This study, will be helpful in providing planners, and decision-makers with rapid decision-making when it comes to managing groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

The study aimed to assess the effect of e-tendering on performance of humanitarian United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in South Sudan.\r\nMethodology: The study methodology adopted an explanatory research design of cross-sectional type for the population under study. There were over 235 National Non-governmental organizations, 150 International organizations in addition to over 15 United Nations agencies, bringing the total target population to 400 organizations. This study targeted 400 humanitarian organizations operating in South Sudan. Therefore, the sample size of 200 humanitarian organizations operating in South Sudan was selected using a stratified random sampling technique. Data was collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.\r\nResults: Reliability findings indicated that e-tendering had a Cronbach Alpha Coefficient of 0.873, and performance had 0.859. The study established that e-tendering had a positive and significant relationship with performance significant (β=0.282, P=0.000).\r\nConclusion: The study concluded that e-tendering has a positive and significant effect on performance of humanitarian United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. This study hence suggested that all NGOs and humanitarian agencies should ensure they adopt the use of e-tendering in their solicitation and sourcing processes in conducting procurement activities. The study cited advantages such saving time, wide coverage of markets and reaching more potential suppliers and finally save environment from printing more paper works attaining sustainable procurement practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase in new energy grid connections has reduced the supply-side regulation capability of the power system. Traditional economic dispatch methods are insufficient for addressing the flexibility limitations in the system’s balancing capabilities. Consequently, this study presents a day-ahead scheduling method for renewable energy systems that balances flexibility and economy. This approach establishes a dual-layer optimized scheduling model. The upper-layer model focuses on the economic efficiency of unit start-up and shut-down, utilizing a particle swarm algorithm to identify unit combinations that comply with minimum start-up and shut-down time constraints. In contrast, the lower-layer model addresses the dual uncertainties of generation and load. It employs the Generalized Polynomial Chaos approximation to create an opportunity-constrained model aimed at minimizing unit generation and curtailment costs while maximizing flexibility supply capability. Additionally, it calculates the probability of flexibility supply-demand insufficiency due to uncertainties in demand response resource supply and system operating costs, providing feedback to the upper-layer model. Ultimately, through iterative solutions of the upper and lower models, a day-ahead scheduling plan that effectively balances flexibility and economy is derived. The proposed method is validated using a simulation of the IEEE 30-bus system case study, demonstrating its capability to balance system flexibility and economy while effectively reducing the risk of insufficient supply-demand balance.</jats:p>"

Despite its global implementation, centralized procurement has not yet been widely adopted in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Hence, the study aims to investigate the application of centralized procurement of construction supply chains in Sri Lanka. A qualitative survey was conducted using an interview strategy, with data collected through ten semi-structured interviews with experts in the field. The collected data was analyzed using manual content analysis. The findings of the study elucidate the positive and negative impacts of practicing centralized procurement in this context. Key positive impacts include possible cost reduction opportunities, precise procurement operations monitoring, and assistance in making intelligent procurement choices. The vital negative impacts were restricted competition, loss of client satisfaction, less innovation, and diminished stakeholder confidence. Key factors that hinder strategy adoption include the lack of uniformity in procurement practices, resistance to changes in the construction business, and obstacles from legal and regulatory bodies. The recommended solutions include creating transparent and uniform procurement procedures through standards, developing explicit norms for supplier selection, bidding procedures, and contract administration, and fostering collaborations with legal professionals and government entities. The study provides valuable insights into adopting centralized procurement in the Sri Lankan construction industry. It highlights its positive impacts and strategies to overcome obstacles and offers a foundation for further research on using digital technologies to enhance procurement efficiency and potentially benefit similar developing countries' construction industries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic revealed profound weaknesses in global pharmaceutical supply chains, resulting in widespread shortages of critical medical supplies, delayed drug manufacturing, and disruptions in vaccine distribution. These supply chain vulnerabilities were exacerbated by several key factors, including an overreliance on a limited number of countries for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), insufficient local manufacturing capacity, and logistical constraints in transportation and distribution networks. The pandemic also exposed inefficiencies in regulatory frameworks, leading to delays in approvals and limited agility in responding to rapidly changing demands. Furthermore, the lack of transparency and real-time monitoring across global supply chains hindered effective decision-making and coordination, aggravating the crisis. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the critical factors that contributed to pharmaceutical supply chain disruptions during COVID-19, identifying missing links such as the need for diversification of supply sources, enhanced flexibility in manufacturing processes, and the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation for supply chain optimization. The analysis highlights how supply chain visibility, digital innovation, and risk management strategies could improve resilience in the face of future global health crises. In addition to identifying these challenges, the paper proposes solutions to address the missing links in pharmaceutical supply chains, including the decentralization of production, the development of regional manufacturing hubs, and the creation of public-private partnerships to bolster local production. The role of government policies in facilitating faster regulatory approvals, fostering international cooperation, and incentivizing innovation is also explored. Case studies on successful post-COVID-19 adaptations, such as the rapid scale-up of vaccine production and the reconfiguration of personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chains, offer insights into effective strategies for building more resilient systems. Ultimately, this paper underscores the importance of a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach to ensuring the stability and security of pharmaceutical supply chains. It calls for proactive measures to strengthen global supply chain infrastructures, improve regulatory agility, and embrace emerging technologies that can predict and respond to disruptions. These steps are crucial to safeguarding the continuous delivery of essential pharmaceuticals during future pandemics or other large-scale disruptions, ensuring global health security in an increasingly interconnected world.</jats:p>"

Using the case of Mumbai, this paper illustrates how consistently this wicked problem was chiselled and selectively problematised to turn it into a tame problem – a problem of water shortages at the city level. The chiselling included neglecting the essential aspects of urban water supply, such as supply coverage, pressure and leakages, which define the quality of urban water service received by citizens. Through chiselling and selective problematisation, the paper illustrates how the problem of providing universal urban water access in Mumbai was ignored for decades and the issues of water shortages were emphasised alone to justify and prioritise the development of dams. </jats:p>"

The article is devoted to the study of complex issues of fee setting related to the connection of capital construction facilities to utility networks using the example of connection to a centralized water supply and sanitation system. The article examines the rules and circumstances of the revision of the cost of connecting to technological networks. As a result of the analysis of the specifics of tariff legislation in the gas industry, the necessary adjustments in legislation in the field of water supply and sanitation have been identified. It is proposed to amend the rules for connection to centralized water supply and sanitation systems, allowing for the adjustment of connection fees based on expertise and design calculations, which will reduce the financial risks of resource supply organizations associated with the increase in the cost of construction materials and equipment. The authors consider the possibility of concluding contracts based on a preliminary calculation, which will allow coordinating design and estimate work with actual costs. The issue of connecting preferential categories of subscribers in various regions of the Russian Federation is also being investigated. In general, the proposed legislative changes are designed to improve the sustainability of the industry by making the connection process more transparent and economically sound.</jats:p>"

Evaluating supply chain resilience is essential to avoid escalating disruptions. However, the literature on this topic is fragmented, and the assessment of resilience remains an open gap due to the lack of a clear definition of the dimensions and elements for its evaluation. To fill this gap, this study integrates a systematic literature review (SLR) and a systematic literature network analysis (SLNA) to propose a MAturity MOdel for REsilient Supply Chains (MaMoReS). Through content analysis and stringent selection of 15 resilience maturity models (ResMMs) via SLR, along with an SLNA on 6,474 sources, this method defines dimensions and sub-dimensions. The proposed MaMoReS is framed around five levels and five dimensions: risk management, agility, flexibility and adaptability, redundancy and robustness, transparency and visibility, and collaboration and relationships. The MaMoReS is applied to two case studies, pinpointing the practicality of the MaMoReS for measuring the resilience maturity level of the two companies along with their dimensions and sub-dimensions scoring. Thus, the MaMoReS can be used as an assessment tool by supply chain managers and researchers to evaluate the resilience of a supply chain.</jats:p>"

Strategic innovation in energy supply chains has emerged as a solution to address these challenges. This paper explores how innovative strategies, technologies, and practices are reshaping the energy supply chain to balance operational efficiency with environmental sustainability. The integration of digital technologies, such as big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, has revolutionized energy management, optimizing resource allocation, improving energy production processes, and enhancing distribution. Additionally, the push for renewable energy sources and carbon reduction practices is fostering an environment where sustainability is integrated into every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption. The paper also discusses the key drivers of strategic innovation, including regulatory pressures, consumer demand for greener alternatives, and technological advancements. By examining case studies and current trends, the paper highlights how strategic innovation is not only improving efficiency but also driving the energy sector towards a more sustainable future. The balance between these two factors is essential for achieving long-term energy resilience and reducing the global carbon footprint. Ultimately, this discussion underscores the importance of adopting a holistic approach to energy supply chain management that aligns economic, environmental, and societal goals.</jats:p>"

Engineers and researchers utilize different techniques in order to design the photovoltaic systems with low cost and high performance. This research aims at designing an optimal on-grid PV system to feed a school, located at Babel, Iraq using PVsyst program. The PVsyst methodology includes defining the geographical location of the project, determining the demand electrical load, selecting the type of the PV system components, and finally running the simulation. Detailed results, including the produced energy, loses diagram, economic and environmental evaluations can be obtained. The results show that a PV system comprising of 90 (450 Wp) panels and 3 (12 kWac) inverters on an area of 198 m2 can produce a net output energy at 70.23 MWh. The economic evaluation show that the project cost can be recovered within less than 10 years, and a net positive gain up to 20,000 USD can be attained during the 25 years project lifetime. A huge carbon emission equal to 1279.6 tCo2 can be saved as a result of this PV system installation. There is an obvious need to invest in solar energy for economic and environmental considerations. The main drawback of PV systems installations is the high capital cost. Using commercial packages, particularly PVsyst program, can significantly contributes toward optimizing the system design and hence reducing the project cost.</jats:p>"

Among the different sectors, road transport becomes one of the most difficult due to the large energy consumption and infrastructure requirements. In this context, although zero-tailpipe-emission vehicle adoption is seen as a promising route, the energy provision through renewable sources is still uncertain, especially with hydrogen. This paper explores a 100% renewable energy supply scenario for both power-generation and road transport sectors in the isolated system of Tenerife. With this aim, the island’s energy system has been modelled in the software EnergyPLAN. Taking as reference the current renewable technology roadmap in the island, the impact of a full deployment of zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles on the energy system has been evaluated, providing the power and energy storage capacity requirements. The obtained results indicate the need for 6 GW of renewable power (nearly 20 times the current figures) and 12 GWh of a yet non-existent storage capacity. This deployment must be accompanied with approximately 1 GW of dispatchable sources and 1.3 GW of electrolysis capacity to carry out a complete decarbonisation of the transport sector in the island. Finally, a series of recommendations to policy makers are suggested to support the definition of future roadmaps.</jats:p>"

Risk strategy was also found to exert a positive effect on supply chain performance everything being equal. \nImplications: Although supplier optimization has a positive impact on supply chain performance, the effect is insignificant. This suggests that while the strategy is directionally sound, it may need to be enhanced or refined.

However, recent research has shown that important economic variables like trade flows and economic growth are typically affected asymmetrically by the exchange rate. The primary aim of the present study is to examine the long term and short-term association among economic growth, exchange rate changes, money supply and government expenditure for a period of 1980-2022 in India. The study employed nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL) to examine the asymmetric relationship among the scrutinised variables. Furthermore, we used Granger causality test to check the direction of causal association. The results of NARDL confirm the long-term relationship among economic growth, exchange rate changes, money supply and government expenditure. The findings show that undervaluation affect economic growth negatively in the case of the Indian economy whereas overvaluation promotes it. Moreover, we found asymmetric impact of exchange rate change on economic growth in India. The Wald test confirms the asymmetrical relationship between exchange rate and economic growth for both short-run and long-run. The results of causality test show bidirectional causality among exchange rate, government expenditure and economic growth. While, one-way causal effects run from money supply to economic growth. The findings of the study have some policy implications. Exchange rate governing organisation should place a priority on restoring stability and work towards developing more robust exchange rates in order to achieve the goal of sustained economic growth and, ultimately, sustainable development\nJEL: B22, CO1, E51, H50</p>"

Corn, a staple crop for billions, is particularly vulnerable to heat stress, a primary driver of yield variability. While many studies have examined the climate impact on average corn yields, little attention has been given to the climate impact on production volatility. This study investigates the future volatility and risks associated with global corn supply under climate change, evaluating the potential benefits of two key adaptation strategies: irrigation and market integration. A statistical model is employed to estimate corn yield response to heat stress and utilize NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate data to project future production volatility and risks of substantial yield losses. Three metrics are introduced to quantify these risks: Sigma (<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>), the standard deviation of year-on-year yield change, which reflects overall yield volatility; Rho (<jats:italic>ρ</jats:italic>), the risk of substantial loss, defined as the probability of yield falling below a critical threshold; and beta (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>), a relative risk coefficient that captures the volatility of a region’s corn production compared to the globally integrated market. The analysis reveals a concerning trend of increasing year-on-year yield volatility (<jats:italic>σ</jats:italic>) across most regions and climate models. This volatility increase is significant for key corn-producing regions like Brazil and the United States. While irrigated corn production exhibits a smaller rise in volatility, suggesting irrigation as a potential buffer against climate change impacts, it is not a sustainable option as it can cause groundwater depletion. On the other hand, global market integration reduces overall volatility and market risks significantly with less sustainability concerns. These findings highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach to adaptation in the food sector. While irrigation can benefit individual farmers, promoting global market integration offers a broader solution for fostering resilience and sustainability across the entire food system.</jats:p>",

It aimed to examine to what extent GSCM practices and SD schemes are perceived in the food industry. As there is a growing concern and raising awareness of traceability among consumers in the food supply, researches can have a contribution to develop sustainability in food industry.  As such, six GSCM practices, namely Eco-design (ED), Internal Environmental Management (IEM), Investment Recovery (IR), Green Purchasing (GP), Environmental Cooperation (EC) and Reverse Logistics (RL) were employed. These six GSCM variables were used to analyze structural relationships with the three dimensions of the SD, that is to say economic, environmental and social performances. The proposed model was tested using a questionnaire based survey via two modes of face to face and emails using a plant survey, senior managers of 88 food companies in Lebanon. The data were analyzed in SPSS and AMOS statistical programs. An Exploratory (Unrestricted) Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory (Restricted) Factor Analysis (CFA) and multiple regressions were applied. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that the GSCM practices IR, GP, ED and IEM had significant relationships with one or more of the SD dimensions.On the basis of the findings, implications that may ameliorate the effect of GSCM practices on the SD dimensions can be taken into consideration. For instance, the enhance of the environmental cooperation with the suppliers and customers, improving the image of the company in the mind of their customers, reinforcing the commitment of GSCM from managers, utilization of cleaner technology, activation of internal performance evaluation system, enhancing the labor conditions and performing special training for workers on environmental issues.</jats:p>"

Based on observations of fresh e-commerce practices, we studythe role of blockchain in an environmentally friendly fresh e-commerce supply chain. Firstly, the positive and negative impacts of adopting blockchain technology on the operation of fresh e-commerce are considered. After providing quantitative descriptions on these impacts, we construct a two-echelonsupply chain game model under different power structures, with and without the adoptionof blockchain technology. Secondly, the optimal pricing, the optimal commission, the optimal per-unit carbon reduction, and the blockchain investment decisions for the supply chain are derived across different scenarios. Differences in supply chain performances before and after the adoption of blockchain technology under two power structures (decentralized decision-making and integrated decision-making) are contrasted, as well as the variations between two power structures before and after blockchain adoption. Finally, in the mathematical simulation section, we also analyzed the impact of the level of information disclosure based on blockchain on supply chain decisions and the conditions for adopting blockchain technology. We found some interesting results: When adopting the blockchain technology, integrated decision-making does not necessarily have an absolute advantage in terms of system profit and product price. Especially when only partial product information is disclosed, the advantage of this power structure in integrated decision-making is weakened. Compared with suppliers of fresh agricultural products, the intrinsic motivation for e-commerce platforms under the agency model to adopt blockchain technology is stronger. When the conditions for demand sensitivity factors or technology cost factors are met, integrated decision-making following the adoption of blockchain technology can outperform decentralized decision-making in every aspect.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: The increasing demand for fresh produce, particularly greens, presents unique challenges in inventory management due to their short shelf life and susceptibility to spoilage. Inefficient management often results in significant waste, leading to financial losses for retailers and increased environmental burdens from the disposal of spoiled goods. Despite various strategies being employed in the agri-food sector, gaps remain in understanding how to optimize inventory levels to minimize waste at the retails level while maintaining high service levels for customers. This research aims to develop an inventory management model tailored to fresh produce that can mitigate these issues by balancing stock availability and minimizing wastage, particularly in large retail shops. To address the research problem, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed, focusing on three service levels—90%, 92%, and 95%—to evaluate the trade-offs between customer satisfaction and total inventory costs. The model incorporates key constraints, including stock balance, shelf-life limitations, and demand satisfaction. The model was validated using actual data, including stock, sales, and wastage records for the month of August, 2024. The objective function aimed to minimize total costs, encompassing holding costs, wastage, and lost revenue. The findings indicate that higher service levels, while reducing stockouts, significantly increase costs due to excess inventory and waste. The most cost-effective solution was observed at the 90% service level, which balanced waste reduction and customer satisfaction. The study also emphasizes the importance of integrating total cost reduction and minimize wastage. Future work should focus on incorporating consumer behavior patterns and extending the model to multi-echelon inventory systems, which include both distribution centers and retail outlets, to capture a more holistic view of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The paper focuses on three key elements of elite consumption – silverware, livery, and wine – to tease out important aspects of the elite’s use of consumer goods as a means of self-expression and for the construction of status. The study identifies important differences as well as similarities between English and German retail systems and in doing so further questions the notion of a single model of retail development: Germany was not a stage behind England on a linear development trajectory, but was instead characterised by a dispersed yet integrated system of retail centres. The complex interplay of local, regional and national systems of supply highlighted in this study has implications far beyond these elite families and invites a reassessment of the prevalent notions of consumption history.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews theoretical and practical frameworks of the logistics industry to examine how service providers in the sector can achieve a balanced economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Businesses are purposely created to maximize profits; however, increased awareness of corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability has made them to look beyond that. Logistics service providers that adopt sustainable practices stand to benefit from long-term cost savings, improved brand reputation, and enhanced stakeholder relationships. Performed research leads us to point out that IoT, big data and blockchain are a some of the digital enablers that improve sustainability. Such advancements are necessary to minimize carbon emission, enhance the transparency of supply chain, and minimize negative effects on environment. At the same time, the literature analyzes emphasizes the fact that collaboration between various actors also contributes to the creation of incentives for achieving the goal of creating sustainable logistics systems. The literature points to stakeholder theory whose focus is on the issues of transparency, cooperation, and novelty in managing supply chains. The model gives a structure for achieving business objectives of generating returns without considering environmental and social factors. Obtained results also highlights those policies such as tax incentives given to companies that meet environmental standards weigh in greatly. Such measures have the potential to steer the logistics sector towards more sustainable operations with a corresponding competitiveness and economic growth. However, it is important to point out that more radical changes are required for reaching the desired state of sustainable development. Consequently, continuous investment in sustainable technologies, supportive government policies, and stakeholder collaboration are key to fostering a profitable logistics industry</jats:p>"

Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring data dependability, security, and operational efficiency. Digital twins (DTs), which replicate real-world components and processes, have emerged as essential tools for enhancing predictive analytics, simulation, and product lifecycle management in Industry 4.0. However, traditional DT development relies on centralized systems, which are vulnerable to data tampering and security breaches, especially in the management of transaction logs and historical data. To address these challenges, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of integrating blockchain with DTs. Using a qualitative research methodology, including desk research, case studies, and interviews with industry experts, we analyze various blockchain-based DT applications across industries and specifically in supply chain management. The findings reveal that blockchain-enhanced DTs can significantly improve data integrity, traceability, and security, thus boosting operational efficiency and quality control in supply chains. Additionally, this study identifies key integration techniques and the role of blockchain in automating processes through smart contracts. This review provides insights into the practical implications of blockchain-based DTs, highlighting their potential to enhance the reliability and scalability of Industry 4.0 operations.</jats:p>"

The transformation from manual to digital management is also necessary for the oil and gas industry. A digital supply chain is a management approach that uses technology to manage the flow of goods, information, and finance across the entire supply chain. This study attempts to evaluate the impact of the digital supply chain on business performance in the oil and gas industry. The study sample was 523 PETRONAS staff members who were involved in operating two main units, namely, a gas processing and oil refinery. The results of multiple regression analysis found that the digital supply chain significantly and positively influences firm performance across the three study samples, namely gas processing, oil refinery, and the overall sample. Technology-driven supply chain management has had a significant positive impact on every aspect of the supply chain. This can be observed in enhanced efficiency, improved visibility, time savings, and increased company competitiveness. Nonetheless, the influence of the digital supply chain is not absolute because other factors such as communication, competence, transparency, and training empirically affect the firm's performance. All of these factors are complementary to the effectiveness of digital supply chain implementation. In line with this, steps are being taken to optimize digital applications across all aspects of the supply chain, along with certain elements related to human capital, to create a unique resource capable of fostering competitive advantage and enhancing firm performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main export shipments of grain to Ukraine are carried out through commercial seaports of the Black Sea, while the complex and multiphase transportation process creates delays and leads to additional costs at the points of connection of various types of transport. The purpose of the study was the process of transporting grain cargo for export through commercial seaports. Ukraine is a developed agricultural country that produces a significant share of the world’s grain volume, most of which is exported. The optimisation simulation model of multimodal grain cargo transportation developed in the study, in contrast to the existing ones, is a multiphase process with many initial parameters, subsystems, and technological elements that adequately reflect all components of the technological process of organising transportation by road, rail, and sea, and helps to optimise these processes. The model consists of several transport and technological subsystems, each of which corresponds to the process of grain transportation by road, rail, or water. The minimum total duration of cargo transportation from the place of origin to the moment of sending grain cargo for export by sea was chosen as the optimal criterion. To establish the minimum required number of replications and the minimum required model time, a series of experiments were performed, where the key and systematic modelling measurement parameter is the total time of grain delivery by land, from the point of origin to the sea trade terminal. As a result of modelling, the optimal number of rolling stock of different types of transport and the transportation time for each phase of the process were determined. Logistics operators of the agro-industrial sector can apply the model to improve grain delivery routes and schemes, evaluate and improve technological parameters, and minimise transportation time and costs</jats:p>",

The paper involves a thorough review of existing marketing standards, including research on FLW due to marketing standards, and proposes the implementation of targeted key actions within four key food sectors: fruits, vegetables, dairy, and cereals. The study provides a detailed analysis of the significant impact marketing standards have on FLW at various stages of the supply chain, including primary production, processing, retail, and consumption. By focusing on these critical points, the research underscores the necessity of addressing marketing standards to achieve meaningful reductions in FLW. The proposed framework aims to foster improved business practices and drive the development of innovative, sector-specific solutions that balance sustainability goals with economic viability. The holistic approach followed for this research lays the foundation for ensuring that the proposed framework is adaptable and practical, leading to measurable improvements in reducing FLW and promoting sustainability across the food industry.</jats:p>"

The joint carbon emission reduction strategies of this four-tier system are analyzed from a dynamic perspective by considering random factors that affect the endogenous variables. Three stochastic differential games are proposed to examine the mechanism between each player, namely the cooperative model, Nash non-cooperative model, and Stackelberg master–slave model. Compared to the Nash non-cooperative game, the manufacturer/supplier-led Stackelberg master–slave game leads to Pareto improvement in the profits of the entire supply chain system and each player. The cooperative game demonstrates the highest expected emission reduction and corporate social responsibility goodwill, but also the highest variance. More importantly, the reference low-carbon level embraces consumers’ subjective initiative in the dynamic of carbon emission reduction. This level is an internal benchmark used to compare against the observed low-carbon level. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for strategic decision-making in emission reduction, contributing to sustainable development.

In order to map the application of theories in the Supply Chain Management sector, it conducts a review of the literature. We examine the main areas of SCM research, highlight important theories, and offer recommendations for future developments in the area. There has been little theory development in SCM, with a few well-known macro theories from other fields impacting the themes and conceptualization of Supply Chain Management that have been researched thus far. By using particular approaches, looking at less-studied elements of SCM, and testing novel frameworks, more theoretical advances could be made. Based on our assessment, we offer a thorough map of the most widely held theories in SCM and suggest future directions for the field’s advancement. A number of suggestions are offered to direct further investigation. This study represents a first step towards comprehending the development of Supply Chain Management theories and the conceptualization of SCM.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence and relative importance of supply chain collaboration dimensions on manufacturing competitiveness based on resource-based theories.\nDesign/methodology/approach: This study employs a deductive approach to derive empirical evidence from the responses of 300 officials of manufacturing firms. The PLS-SEM is used to test the significance of conceptual predictions and IPMA is used to benchmark the most important collaborative dimensions. \nResults: It is revealed that manufacturing firms capitalize on all supply chain collaboration dimensions. However, customer collaboration and supplier collaboration have a significant and positive direct influence while internal collaboration exhibits a complementary partial mediation effect. Customer collaboration is the most important dimension followed by internal collaboration and supplier collaboration.\nLimitations of the investigation: This study employed a cross-section design lacking the longitudinal effect. Nevertheless, the identification, testing and validation of the conceptual model, backed up by an extensive literature review, could assist researchers in developing meaningful comparative studies.\nOriginality/value: The study applied PLS-SEM and IPMA to reveal the role and relative importance of supply chain collaborative dimensions on manufacturing competitiveness. Managers of manufacturing firms can emulate this knowledge within their settings and be able to compete amid increased competition and supply chain complexity.</jats:p>"

The inventory model in this research is designed to determine the minimal inventory levels required to achieve predefined fill rates across various operational constraints. The supply chain’s inventory model simulates optimal responses to normally distributed market demand within 365-day periods characterized by mean and two levels of demand variability through two fill rate levels, two workweek schedules, 15 review periods, and 16 lead times. By conducting an extensive analysis of the 192000 simulation experiments of the supply chain under periodic review (R, s, S) inventory system, complex influences between system variables and economic outcomes of supply chain operation measured by ordering, transportation, holding, penalty, and total costs along with greenhouse gas emissions arising from inventory-related transportation according to the ISO 14083 standard are analyzed. The insights from this research have significant practical implications, providing valuable guidance for supply chain managers, researchers, and freight companies offering guidance for improving economic and environmental performance.</jats:p>"

Climate change further exacerbates declining water availability. Against this backdrop, the techno-economic feasibility of four water supply and sanitation alternatives for small and medium scale cities in Jordan were explored, using local unit costs and Al-Mafraq as a case study. City level piped network combined with household rooftop rainwater harvesting and surface runoff collection into local ponds and piped networks with treatment using the nature-based solution of root-zone for sanitation were demonstrated to provide the highest benefits in terms of cost, convenience and water conservation. Our work highlights the need to invest in long-term urban infrastructure networks to promote sustainable future growth of cities. This is vital to address severe water scarcity challenges that ultimately impact those at the urban fringes most.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The maize yield potential is constrained by a diverse range of biotic and abiotic factors, ultimately leading to di- minished crop yield, and quality. Nitrogen (N)-an indispensable fertilizer element is known to exert an influence on incidence and severity of these biotic stresses. This paper describes the effect of various levels of N application and contrasting maize genotypes on weed infestation, maydis leaf blight (MLB) and fall armyworm (FAW) inci- dence in maize. The field experiment was carried out at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi during two consecutive years (2021 and 2022). Treatments comprising 6 maize genotypes (PJHM 1, PC 4, DKC 9167, PMH 13, AH 4271 and Pusa Vivek QPM 9-I) and seven N levels (0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 and 240 kg N/ha) were arranged in a factorial randomized complete block design. Results showed that genotypes with profuse growth, greater leaf area and higher light interception (PJHM 1, DKC 9167 and PMH 13) had minimum weed inci- dence and may be considered as a key element of integrated weed management in smallholder agriculture. Dis- ease severity in PV QPM 9-I (5.3) was higher than all other genotypes while least in AH 4271 (2.7). The maximum and minimum pest incidence was observed in PJHM 1 (4.9 and 5.6,) and PV QPM 9-I (2.1 and 2.4), respectively. In general, the total (-9.4%) and broad-leaf weed density (-26.4%) reduced with increasing use of nitrogenous fer- tilizers, while the application of lower N rates reduced the prevalence of narrow-leaf weeds (34.2%). The early leaf senescence and poor photosynthetic rate at lower rates of N application decreased the plants immunity against MLB disease. Oppositely, the increased succulency at higher N doses led to severe FAW incidence in maize over control. Therefore, the study demonstrates that planting of competitive/resistant genotypes and use of 160 kg N/ha resulted in relatively less overall burden of biotic stressors on maize crop.</jats:p>"

Methodologically, a qualitative approach with descriptive scope is employed, using a documentary review and direct observation. The findings indicate that the main difficulty lies in the absence of integrated logistics and management strategies, which leads to the isolated operation of the links in the chain, reducing the efficiency and competitiveness of the companies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing energy demand is directly proportional to the growing population and technological advancements. The energy needs in Indonesia largely rely on fossil fuels, which are limited and environmentally unfriendly due to their emission characteristics. The potential of solar energy in Indonesia is around 4.8 kWh/m2, making it a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that can be utilized for Solar Power Plants (PLTS). The aim of this research is to design an on-grid PLTS system and conduct techno-economic analysis using PVSyst software. This design requires 14 Longi Solar/LR5-72HPH-550M solar panels and 1 Huawei SUN2000-6KTL-M1 inverter. The estimated electricity production is 10,852 kWh/year in the first year. The initial investment cost for this PLTS system is Rp. 120,343,517.00, with estimated savings over 25 years amounting to Rp. 270,115,412.00. Economically, based on the feasibility analysis using the LWBP tariff calculation method, the NPV is Rp. 2,174,707.00, BCR is 1.68, and PBP is 11.8 years. Meanwhile, based on the feasibility analysis using the LCoE calculation method, the NPV is Rp. 74,877,690.00, BCR is 2.61, and PBP is 7.5 years. Based on the conducted research, the construction of this PLTS is deemed feasible to be implemented.</jats:p>"

The burgeoning interest in the supply chain management (SCM) literature toward consumer‐centric research is capturing the attention of scholars and sparking diverse calls to action. While a significant growth in SCM research has centered on consumers as the unit of analysis over the past decade, it remains necessary to improve understanding of how the role of consumers as actors within the supply chain dynamic has evolved. We aim to enhance consumer‐centric SCM research by conducting a systematic literature review that summarizes and synthesizes SCM studies that focus on consumers as the unit of analysis. Our review encompasses 174 articles from 16 leading journals. We bundle the literature based on two key trajectories: (i) major functions involved in SCM activities, and (ii) phases of the customer journey. To synthesize the literature, we develop a framework that encompasses the following elements: (i) factors influencing consumer‐centric SCM, (ii) resultant consumer‐related outcomes, and (iii) retail supply chain structures. Based on the literature review, we propose a research agenda that serves as a basis for advancing SCM research by identifying research questions that are relevant to scholars and practitioners.</jats:p>",

With the gradual expansion of the scope of Internet +, traditional trade has gradually evolved into e-commerce, and relatively simple domestic trade has gradually expanded into cross-border transactions. With the help of e-commerce platforms, sales channels can be expanded, and the share of agricultural exports can be increased. The development of cross-border e-commerce is highly valued and mutually supportive of the agricultural product supply chain (APSC), which promotes the international trade of agricultural products. Optimised APSC provide high-quality produce to meet consumer demand. Technological innovations such as big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) bring smart and efficient optimisation solutions to APSC, improving the efficiency of product distribution. This paper reviews the research on cross-border e-commerce and APSC by some scholars in recent years, summarises the current development of cross-border e-commerce, describes the problems of APSC, and proposes solutions. Reviewing and summarising the relevant research literature aims to help scholars understand the development of cross-border e-commerce and APSC more systematically and comprehensively, and to provide strong support for future research and practice.</jats:p>"

However, there is a lot of noise signals in the negative pressure waves generated during leakage accidents, making it difficult to identify leakage signals, and thus seriously affecting the accuracy of leakage detection. Therefore, in this study, we carried out leakage test of water transmission pipeline on our self-built test platform for transient flow with long-distance water transmission pipeline (pipeline length is 160 m, and diameter is 100 mm), and obtained the transient leakage pressure signals under various flow rates (15–55 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h). An improved wavelet filtering algorithm was proposed to filter the leakage pressure signal by optimizing the calculation of decomposition layers and the threshold processing strategy, and then compared with the traditional wavelet filtering method. The results show that the improved algorithm can denoise the leakage signals effectively, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are all superior to those of the traditional wavelet algorithm. The results can provide support for leakage detection and location of water supply pipeline systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The accelerating expansion of renewable energies in Europe and the rest of the world leads to the challenge of adapting energy demand to the increasingly volatile renewable electricity generation. To contribute to this goal, thermal supply systems can be used for demand response by utilizing their dedicated and inherent thermal energy storages and optimizing the loading and unloading operation. In this paper we present a method for the data driven system identification and operational optimization of industrial thermal supply systems. This method aims at developing optimization problems for the control of thermal supply system and identifying system dynamics specifically for this purpose. The method includes parameter identification and validation of individual components, such as compression chillers and thermal storages, using the system's measurement data. From the identified component dynamics an overall optimization model is formulated and tested, taking into account the interactions between single components. Finally, the optimization model is deployed, and the optimized control signals are passed onto the real systems components. For permanent application of the optimization, monitoring und maintenance of the model are integrated as a last and recurring step of the method. This includes updating model parameters in case of increasing mismatch between model and reality over time. These steps are successfully implemented in the real-world example of the cooling supply system of a climatized room at the ETA Research Factory at the Technical University of Darmstadt. In this example the room's thermal capacity is used to vary its cooling supply depending on time-variable electricity prices. The model is deployed as a model predictive control loop, regularly updating its optimal trajectory using electricity prices of a representative period from 2023. Just by optimizing the room's temperature control a reduction in energy cost of 10.06% compared the conventional operation was achieved. This results in a reduction of electricity related carbon emissions of 4.93%.</jats:p>",

This study considers network externalities and the probability of consumer satisfaction with products in the advance selling decision‐making problem in the supply chain. Using game theory and prospect theory, three scenario models—advance selling considering network externalities, advance selling without considering network externalities, and nonadvance selling—are designed to construct theoretical models for supply chain decision‐making. The optimal decision‐making problem of supply chain members is discussed. Furthermore, through a comparison of pricing, demand and profits, the impacts of advance selling with or without considering network externalities on the decisions of retailers and manufacturers are analyzed. By comparing the differences in decision‐making between manufacturers and retailers, the feasible area for advance selling under network externalities is obtained. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, the impacts of the strength of network externalities, and the probability of consumer satisfaction with products on the decision‐making of supply chains are analyzed.</jats:p>",

It aimed to explain how SCM practices like strategic suppliers’ alliances, information sharing, and collaborative governance impacts the performance of SMEs in Nigeria. SME success was measured using a continuum of operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability. To reach the study's goal, a survey research approach was used, with a sample of 352 respondents representing the owners and senior management members of registered SMEs in Nigeria. Because the study depended on quantitative analysis, respondents' opinions were collected using a standardised closed-ended questionnaire. The gathered data was analysed using IBM SPSS 28 and IBM AMOS. The study found a positive and substantial correlation between chosen SCM practices and the performance of SMEs in Nigeria, as shown by the coefficients and p-values (SSA = 0.544; P &lt;.001; IFS = 0.621; P &lt;.001; CGV = 0.673; P &lt;.001). It is therefore argued that SCM techniques such as strategic partnerships with suppliers, information sharing, and collaborative governance have a favourable and significant influence on the performance of SMEs in Nigeria. Consistent with the findings and current literature, this study recommends that Nigerian SMEs form strategic supplier relationships by sharing continuous improvement programs with important suppliers and include key suppliers in their planning and goal-setting processes.\r\nKeywords: Supply Chain Management, Strategic Supplier Alliance, Information Sharing, Collaborative Governance, Performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Silicon carbide (SiC) is a niche nonmetallic material that is essential in many industrial processes. Here, we integrate material flow analysis and supply chain resilience analysis to understand global SiC stocks and flows and to assess its supply chain. We use industry interviews to fill data gaps and collect information on the SiC system to overcome data scarcity. We find that globally around 1000 kt of SiC is produced each year. The biggest use of SiC is the abrasives industry (40%), followed by metallurgy (28%), refractories (20%), technical ceramics (0.7%), other uses (0.7%), and semiconductors (0.01%). As an energy‐intensive material, the SiC supply chain is under pressure, increasing the relevance of resilience considerations. Besides typical supply chain risks such as low diversity of supply and geopolitical trade restrictions, SiC particularly faces risks due to its energy‐intensive production process and associated emissions. In the SiC semiconductor supply chain, losses of nearly 75% are a particular issue. Due to high demand in the SiC market, stockpiles are negligible, and substitution is difficult in most sectors. We find that in the case of SiC, sustainability measures such as use reduction, recycling, or decreasing energy use or emissions would also positively contribute to supply chain resilience.

A study of a supply chain aiming for circularity was conducted in a real setting for a renowned multinational company in the food processing industry to explore how environmental orientation shapes collaborative practices. The model was applied to reveal the significance of the circular practices that supply chain members follow within the case company. The interpretive ranking process (IRP) was further applied to rank the stakeholders in the supply chain of this company. Results reveal that raw material suppliers, farmers, customers, and volunteers occupy a significant position in implementing circularity in this supply chain. It is essential to provide incentives to suppliers in order to encourage them to adopt practices that promote circular supply chains. Simultaneously, local communities need to play an active role in implementing effective waste management practices. This case study underscores the critical imperative of nurturing a pro‐environmental mindset while fostering synergetic collaboration among stakeholders, thereby paving the path towards achieving circularity.</jats:p>",

It allows stakeholders to assess the quantitative impact of investing in decarbonization technologies on supply chain sustainability. Investing in decarbonization technologies reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The most substantial GHG emission reductions can be achieved if upstream ARPSC actors invest according to an aggressive investment strategy between 2031 and 2040. However, even with an aggressive investment strategy, investing in decarbonization technologies alone is likely to be insufficient to achieve the European Green Deal goals. Furthermore, barriers to investment in decarbonization technologies and a low rate of progress in doubling the European Union’s circularity rate may put extra stress on achieving the European Green Deal goals for the European ARPSC. Instead, ARPSC actors will additionally need to optimize the recycling of aluminum rolled products and adopt strategies for resource sufficiency, e.g., by sharing cars and using packaging multiple times.</jats:p>"

This creates a coevolutionary process where service suppliers and customers interact, leading to an increase in the number of differentiated service offerings. We introduce a framework for local economies, wherein business-service sectors evolve in response to local demand potential, while non-business-service sectors grow based on each economy’s supply potential. Business service growth is more rapid in local economies with higher demand potential, while non-business-service sectors expand faster in areas where the business-service supply potential is greater. A key assumption is that business service firms operate in a monopolistic competition environment, where an increase in business-service capacity leads to an expansion in the variety of services offered. This, in turn, enhances the diversity of service offerings in municipalities with strong demand potential. Additionally, service providers not only deliver innovation-related information to client firms but also unintentionally disseminate knowledge within the region, fostering knowledge spillovers among firms.</jats:p>",

During recent years many developing and developed countries have witnessed the expansion of markets and supply chain networks; in the progress of these market and supply systems SMEs find various complexities when they are implementing or improving the technology integration of their supply chain. The current body of literature often addresses the adoption of technology in a general manner or within larger organizations, resulting in a significant gap in study about the specific circumstances and requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study employs a rigorous methodology that analyzes relevant papers to examine the drivers, challenges, and opportunities for adopting supply chain technology among SMEs in Malaysia. By implementing supply chain technology, Malaysian SMEs can increase their performance in many areas of key performance indicators. This includes improving efficiency, optimizing inventory management, achieving cost savings, enhancing customer service, and increasing market competitiveness.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Hydrogen is an important energy carrier for the transition of the energy sector towards decarbonization. An attractive option for its sustainable production are independent offshore wind farms that include all systems for the hydrogen production directly on the wind turbine platform. However, these systems face a challenge in maintaining a constant electric power supply on the turbine platform during periods of calm winds as they are not connected to the onshore electrical grid. This study evaluates and compares different technologies for a backup power supply on the wind turbine platform. Due to the limited energy storage capacities of battery systems and thus, short energy bridging times, systems are investigated that make use of the platform-produced hydrogen to generate electricity and consequently provide long bridging times. Three different backup power supply systems are investigated: A fuel cell system combined with a battery storage system (H2-FC+BS) as well as a hydrogen internal combustion engine with and without a battery storage system (H2-ICE+BS and H2-ICE). These systems are examined in terms of efficiency (hydrogen consumption), lifetime, robustness, maintenance requirements, space consumption, and costs. The results suggest that the hybrid system of a hydrogen combustion engine with an accompanying battery storage unit provides an optimal solution, offering a balanced compromise between efficiency, robustness, and minimized maintenance demands.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>PURPOSE. The article is devoted to an urgent problem for domestic district heating. A widespread situation is considered when consumers from heat supply systems with a closed connection scheme for hot water supply plants are switched to an open heat supply system from a thermal power plant. METHODS. Study of operating modes of operating heat supply systems was performed. Data collection was carried out using an online system for monitoring and commercial accounting of energy resources. Methodology for calculation of compared mode parameters is proposed. RESULTS. Using the example of the existing heat supply system, it is shown that the effect of the measure to switch subscribers of uneconomical boiler houses to heat sources with combined heat and power generation is leveled by legislative restrictions on the development of open heat supply systems, as well as by the regulatory method for determining heat consumption in hot water supply systems. The main technical and economic indicators were selected for comparative analysis of the operation of the centralized heat supply system in conditions of complete switching of hot water supply plants according to an open circuit and in the presence of a certain number of hot water supply plants with a closed connection scheme. CONCLUSION. The period of inefficient operation of the centralized heat supply system was determined and the amount of annual economic damage was calculated, which made it possible to prove the need to bring all schemes for connecting hot water supply plants in one heat supply system to a single type.</jats:p>"

The article examines the elasticity of the domestic supply of the main types of livestock production per capita in Ukraine by income and price based on statistical information on the volume of production in farms of all categories, the dynamics of retail prices, and average wages. The production volume of the main types of animal husbandry products in Ukraine was analyzed for 2017-2023. The dynamics of the average retail prices of the main types of animal husbandry products and the average wage in Ukraine were also studied to determine the corresponding elasticity coefficients. Based on statistical research methods, in particular, correlation-regression analysis, the influence of the selling price and the average wage on the domestic volume of supply of the main types of livestock products per 1 person in Ukraine was determined, and the relationships between the variables and the effective indicator of the volume of domestic supply were established. The average elasticity of the supply of the main types of livestock products by price and average salary in Ukraine for 2017-2023 was determined. According to the study results, it was established that the supply by the price of the main types of livestock products per 1 inhabitant during the researched period is not elastic and is generally from -0.05 for beef to 0.71 for pork. The income offered is also characterized by a lack of elasticity, considering the value of coefficients from 0.05 – for beef to 0.26 – for poultry meat. It was determined that a 1% change in supply accounts for an average of 1.33-4.3% change in sales price, depending on the type of livestock production in Ukraine during the studied period.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The agri-food supply chain in Bangladesh is critical for the nation's economic stability and sustenance but faces significant challenges such as lack of transparency, inefficiencies, and information asymmetry. Although Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and blockchain databases have proven effective in addressing these concerns, most blockchain and IoT-based models recommend using cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. However, the use of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies not yet legal in Bangladesh. Given the widespread use of mobile banking solutions such as Bkash, Nagad, and Rocket, there is a need for a legal and practical alternative.\n \nObjective: This research investigates how integrating digital financial solutions (DFF) with blockchain technology influences the transparent flow of physical goods and information (PHF) and subsequently enhances transparency in the agri-food supply chain (TASC) in Bangladesh. The study examines two main hypotheses: the impact of DFF on PHF and the resulting effect of improved PHF on TASC.\n \nMethods: Utilizing a detailed methodological approach, the study employed IBM SPSS for exploratory factor analysis and IBM AMOS for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). These tools were used to evaluate the relationships between DFF, PHF, and TASC, based on data gathered from 400 respondents within Bangladesh's agricultural sector.\n \nResults: The study's findings support both hypotheses, revealing a significant positive impact of DFF on PHF, which in turn positively influences TASC. These results underscore the importance of DFF in improving supply chain transparency.\n \nResearch Implications: This research offers empirical evidence of the effectiveness of integrating DFF with blockchain technology in addressing transparency challenges within the agri-food supply chain. It highlights the potential of these digital solutions to improve efficiency, decision-making, and consumer trust in the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh.\n \nOriginality/Value: This study offers unique insights into the role of DFF in boosting transparency and efficiency in the agri-food supply chain. Focusing on Bangladesh, it presents significant implications for industry practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, demonstrating the transformative potential of integrating DFF with blockchain technology in agricultural supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the theoretical principles and practical implementations of optimization models aimed at refining supply chain operations in the metal fabrication business, giving the maximum profit. It begins with a comprehensive survey of optimization theory, encompassing linear programming, integer programming, and stochastic optimization. It proceeds to their application in addressing diverse challenges encountered in supply chain management. The discussion includes deterministic models, such as those optimizing facility location under capacity constraints and transportation logistics, alongside stochastic models designed to manage uncertainties inherent in demand forecasting and inventory control. Advanced methodologies like metaheuristic algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques are examined for their capacity to navigate the intricate and often conflicting objectives within supply chain networks. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and a study of the supply chain model developed for the metal fabrication business, this paper contributes to advancing knowledge in mechanical engineering and supply chain management, offering insights pertinent to practitioners and researchers alike. Ultimately, it emphasizes the critical role of optimization models in optimizing efficiency, reducing costs, improving profit margin, reducing CO2 emission, and enhancing competitiveness in modern supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

In this study, monthly water and energy demand data from 2011 to 2022 in an arid city was used to predict the corresponding demands from 2023 to 2032 using the seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method. The aim is to estimate future water and energy supply risks both individually and jointly, using cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) derived from historical data. The main focus is to calculate the combined risk of water and energy, referred to as the water–energy nexus (WEN) risk. Based on the interdependent relationship between water and energy, the Copula function was utilized to model the bivariate distribution between these two variables. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong correlation between water and energy supplies. Among the distributions fitted to the data, the log-normal and gamma distributions were the best fit for water supply and energy supply systems, respectively, with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. The Gumbel Copula, with a parameter of 1.66, was identified as the most suitable for modeling the joint distribution, yielding the lowest AIC value. The results indicate that the risks associated with energy supply, water supply, and their joint dependency could exceed 0.8% in the future, highlighting a potentially critical situation for the city. The trend analysis revealed that forecasted water and energy demands and their corresponding risks and the WEN risk are expected to have a significant upward trend in the future. Finally, local authorities need to explore alternative sources to supply water and energy in the future to address the ever-growing water and energy demands.</jats:p>"

In February 2022, the Joint Research Platform Healthcare Infrastructures (JRP HI) was established consisting of Hospital Strategic Directions and Industrial Partners in Italy. Starting from the WHO Techincal Brief “Hospitals of the Future”, a national survey was carried out via web-survey and semi-structured interviews with a sample of 30 stakeholders to collect the main drivers and constraints for innovation and the framework from a One Health perspective and in terms of sustainability. The main needs to be addressed through the guidelines refer to digitalization (27%), flexibility (32%), environmental sustainability (36%) and economic sustainability (27%) as well as flow management (18%) and hospital infection (14%). The participants consider SDG-3 ‘Good Health and Wellbeing’ to be the most relevant for development activities. Hospital managers prioritize SDG-8 ‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’ (23%); vice-versa the industrial partners suggest SDG-11 ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ and SDG- 13 ‘Climate Actions’ (32%) as topics to be addressed. Furthermore, 57% of the respondents state that they lack adequate training, budget or leadership to apply innovative strategies in the day-to-day management of the healthcare organization. The survey highlighted a lack of initiatives, budget, and standardization for enhancing environmental sustainability in healthcare infrastructures. The sustainability of building systems depends on factors such as energy consumption, alternative energy sources, thermal comfort, water usage, waste management, ventilation, lighting efficiency, air quality, and construction materials. Ensuring the adoption of monitoring systems and harmonized standards of performance measurement is crucial for increasing the environmental sustainability.</jats:p>",

Results show that 4 months after the operation of the system, the rate of enhancement in water transparency reached 550%, and with a dissolved oxygen (DO) uplift rate of 322%, in addition, this system achieved 77.98, 77.78 and 74.41% removal of the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) respectively, and the effluent water quality meets the target water quality standard. The process not only has a good pollutant removal effect, low cost and other characteristics but also can enhance the river landscape and improve biodiversity. It can provide a reference for similar river pollution water quality improvement.</jats:p>",

An essential research goal is to understand the overall structure of research and what has been completed in the area so far to build a strong research program to address forthcoming GSCM problems. The purpose of conducting a bibliometric analysis of GSCM in its current state is to gain insights into the existing body of knowledge, identify trends, and understand the research landscape. Several literature reviews concentrating on certain elements of GSCM have been published from 2002 to 2021 (data update time is April 10, 2021).  Thus, this study used a bibliometric method to examine the present level of research on the GSCM. The Scopus database, one of the world-leading publishers-independent global citation databases, was used to search for documents related to GSCM. A bibliometric tool called Bibliometrix was executed to examine the data collected from the search, which generated 717 documents.  This software was used to build maps based on scientific publication network data, revealing relationships between researchers, countries, and journals. This comprehensive mapping of the field serves to graphically depict the evolution of publications over time as well as identify current research interests. Finally, the findings of the bibliometric analysis point out a growing trend in green supply chain studies around the world, indicating that people are becoming more conscious of the need for environmental management and protection, and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The findings reveal that the overall performance of the fresh milk supply chain was moderate, with performance scores of 84.25% forfeed suppliers, 77.47% for Farmers Group XYZ, and 82.05% for consumers. Notably, areas requiring enhancement include reliability, responsiveness, and cost-efficiency. Consequently, we have developed strategic recommendations aimed at augmenting supply chain effectiveness. These include enhancing the transportation system to ensure timely deliveries (Reliability), shortening order fulfillment times and improving the flexibility to adapt to demand fluctuations (Responsiveness), and optimizing logistics and storage to reduce costs (Cost). Implementing these strategies will bolster collaboration and fortify relationships among suppliers, producers, and consumers, contributing to a more robust dairy industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine created economic impacts felt across the whole world and has high potential to derail the economic outlook for Zimbabwe among many other countries that heavily depend on imports. Starting in early 2022, fertiliser prices rose almost 30% due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In this study, the effect of the RussiaUkraine conflict on the cost of maize inputs, maize productivity and profitability of maize production was evaluated in Chikomba District, located within Mashonaland East Province for the 2021-2022 and 2022- 2023 maize growing seasons. Simple random sampling was used to obtain a sample size of 385 participants derived from the conversion of a standard deviation of 0.5 at a 95% confidence level into a z-score. Questionnaires were used to obtain primary data from the participants. Benefit cost ratio (BCR) and gross margin budget analysis were used to evaluate the profitability of maize production. Out of the five explanatory variables that had a significant impact on maize productivity, AN use had the most significant effect in both seasons, 2021/22 and 2022/23, with (B=0.575, p=0.025) and (B=0544, p=0.025), respectively. Given that the Russia-Ukraine conflict period was characterised by exorbitant AN price increases that reduced affordability by many smallholder farmers across Zimbabwe, it therefore, means that the conflict has had a negative impact on maize productivity by farmers. This is due to the use of a lower fertiliser rate in response to the 57% and 71% price hike in basal and top-dressing fertiliser, respectively, lowering the yield/productivity of maize, meaning that there will be less maize to sell for covering costs and making a profit. The reduction in input levels lowered both the cost of production and the potential yield that could be produced for the market. There is need for further study aimed at  developing solutions that enhance the farmers‟ resilience to the effects of conflict on input prices, productivity and profitability of maize production</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural issue is a focal point of concern for each country, and e-commerce assistance to farmers, as an emerging model, is gaining increasing attention. Considering this trend, this paper bases on e-commerce assistance to farmers and considers four types of government subsidies: no subsidy, price subsidy model with the farmer as the subsidy target, price subsidy model with the e-commerce platform as the subsidy target, and area subsidy model. Based on this, a game model of the contract farming supply chain involving a farmer and an e-commerce platform was established to explore the optimal decision-making in the contract farming supply chain considering various government subsidies under the background of e-commerce assistance to farmers. The results indicate that: (1) Consumer preference for supporting farmers and consumer premiums can stimulate the farmer to expand farm size, increase agricultural production, increase the purchase price of agricultural products and promote the growth of profits for the farmer and the e-commerce platform, contributing to the growth of social welfare. Output volatility can lead to a decrease in farm size and a reduction in the purchase price of agricultural products. (2) Government subsidies can support the farmer in expanding farm size and contribute to increased profits for the farmer and the e-commerce platform. However, government subsidies do not universally have a positive impact on every variable. The influence of government subsidies on the purchase price of agricultural products is contingent upon the method of subsidy distribution. Similarly, the effects of government subsidies on social welfare are influenced by factors such as price elasticity and agricultural productions per unit area. (3) From the perspectives of farm size, the purchase price of agricultural products, and profits of the farmer and the e-commerce platform, the government will have different and more targeted subsidy models, and the corresponding subsidy models are influenced by the agricultural productions per unit area. The research conclusion can provide references for optimal decision-making in contract farming under the model of e-commerce assistance to farmers.</jats:p>"

Indonesia is one of the countries with the highest natural hazards in the world, so the newly-built NPPs are susceptible to station blackout (SBO) accidents one of the highest contributors to the core damage frequency (CDF). The study proposes a dedicated, independent, and direct electrical connection between a pressurized water reactor to a nearby hydropower plant as the alternative off-site power supply during the extended SBO. The study shows that the proposed strategy successfully reduces the SBO frequency by 90%—a net 33% CDF reduction without a major modification to the existing PWR design.</jats:p>",

The main advantages of long-term contracts for all energy market participants are indicated. Features of the functioning of consumer companies in the competitive market are highlighted. The main risks for large consumers when working on the day-ahead market are presented. Factors of the expediency of functioning on the balancing segment are given. Current trends in the development of world energy and their impact on energy security are analyzed. The necessity of diversification of energy supply sources for Ukraine is substantiated. The influence of the European integration processes on the reform of the energy sector of Ukraine is studied. The current state of the energy market was analyzed, and the analysis of factors affecting development trends and ensuring protection in the energy market was carried out. The influence of the European integration processes on the reform of the energy sector of Ukraine is studied. The conjuncture of the energy market of Ukraine is determined, in which it is necessary to analyze not only the peculiarities of the domestic sphere, but also the influence of international relations, international trade and the world market. The PEST analysis of the energy industry of Ukraine is presented, which allowed to identify the level of influence and the neighborhood of the group of influencing factors on the formation of the strategic potential of the energy market of Ukraine. Directions for increasing the level of energy security through modernization of the energy infrastructure, development of renewable energy sources, and integration into the European energy space are proposed. It is noted that the creation of conditions for the effective use of internal resources and the development of appropriate technologies are of strategic importance. The country's government is working on integration into the European energy community, which requires compliance with European standards and the implementation of effective management models of the energy market of Ukraine.\nAccording to the results of the strategic potential of the energy industry of Ukraine, economic factors exert the greatest influence - 1.147, which just emphasizes the important role of the energy industry in the country's economy. In second place in terms of influence are political factors - 0.847. The analysis of the market just showed the rather important role of the political component in the functioning of the energy market of Ukraine, namely in the aspect of its joining the European energy market and the transformation of Ukraine into the European Union with the rights of an equal state. In third place are technological factors - 0.553, which confirm Ukraine's determination to decarbonize the energy market. And the fourth place is occupied by socio-cultural factors - 0.537, which are only marginally inferior to technological factors. This indicates a strong influence of consumer preferences when choosing interaction models in the market.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to investigate the contamination of MPs throughout the drinking water supply chain in Haikou City, China, and to conduct risk assessments regarding the relationship between MPs contamination and human health. The results revealed that the abundance of MPs in raw, treated, and tap water was 0.6 ± 0.6, 5.2 ± 2.7, and 1.2 ± 1.1 particles·L−1, respectively. Fragments were identified as the most prevalent shape across all samples, with the size category of 20–50 μm showing the highest abundance of MPs. Among the 11 types of polymers identified, polyethylene and polypropylene accounted for 50% and 29%, respectively. The potential risk index values were significantly higher for treated water (370.26) and tap water (303.85) compared to raw water (13.46), suggesting that plastic pipes may be a key contributor to MPs contamination in drinking water. Therefore, efforts should be directed toward developing pipes with low release rates of MPs, as well as improving detection methods for smaller particles and accurately assessing associated risks.</jats:p>"

It has a simple and robust construction as well as a higher power density. It is a self-starting motor, therefore easier to start as compared to other types of electric motor. As the other benefit, a three-phase induction motor requires fewer maintenance measures. In order to maintain proper and continued operation, many parameters of a three-phase induction motor are constantly monitored. Among them is motor vibration. This is an important operation parameter frequently used to determine repair and maintenance needs to be taken on the motor. The vibration of a three-phase induction motor might be caused by mechanical as well as electrical problems. In this paper, the effect of magnitude unbalance of a three-phase voltage supply on the vibration of a three-phase induction motor is carefully investigated. To achieve this objective, two different laboratory experiments have been conducted. The first one is a three-phase induction motor supplied from a balance three-phase voltage supply. The second one is a three-phase induction motor supplied from an unbalance three-phase voltage supply. The unbalanced three-phase voltage supply condition is achieved by making the magnitude of one phase-voltage is 3%, 4%, and 5% lower than the magnitude of the other two phase-voltages. The vibration measurement is then taken in three different directions of the motor non-drive end (MNDE), i.e., horizontal (MNDEH), vertical (MNDEV), and axial (MNDEA). The experiment data show higher vibration in all directions, MNDEH, MNDEV, and MNDEA, as a load of the three-phase induction motor increases. Further, experiment data also show that higher vibration in all directions, MNDEH, MNDEV and MNDEA, is produced when unbalanced in magnitude voltage supply is higher</jats:p>",

On this basis, considering the mobile game's individualized operational characteristics with respect to production and sales, the supply chain's and its participants' decision‐making models are established with the expected utility as an objective function. Second, the supply chain collaboration is modeled as a Stackelberg game. This paper obtains the optimal decisions of the participants and reveals the effects of the participants' risk attitudes on the optimal quality investment, promotion investment, and pricing policy. Finally, this paper further reveals the relationship between participants' risk attitudes and their expected profits. It is found that participants' risk attitudes will change the relationship between the expected profits under centralized decision‐making and those under decentralized decision‐making. These characteristics remain valid when a different demand format is employed or the supply chain members play a Nash game.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigated a temporally well-constrained shallow-marine succession in the Tremp Basin to test the control of sediment supply variations on the development of deltaic sequences during the early Eocene. We analyzed the paleoenvironmental record (sedimentary facies and δ13Corg values) of the Morillo Limestone and the Castigaleu Formation (52.2–50.6 Ma). The first progradation of the deltaic system is marked by the abrupt appearance of thick delta-front sandstones and associated with the first negative carbon isotopic excursions (CIEs) in the measured δ13Corg record. Subsequent phases of progradation align with subsequent negative CIEs. Conversely, positive CIEs correspond to finer-grained, more-distal prodelta deposits. A series of hyperthermal events occurred during the deposition, globally identified as negative CIEs on δ13Ccarb reference curves, which we tentatively correlate with our δ13Corg data. We therefore suggest that during deposition of this Lower Eocene shallow-marine succession, the primary trigger behind sequence generation was the high-frequency climate-induced variation in sediment supply, specifically the hyperthermal events, rather than changes in accommodation. This linkage underscores the complex interactions between climate dynamics and sedimentary responses that shape the stratigraphic architecture of shallow-marine settings.</jats:p>",

The market of medical institutions is an important component in the structure of the market of medical services, evidence of this is the intensive development and expansion of not only medical, but also cosmetic services, improving their quality and level of service.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine the essence of managing the strategic development of medical institutions. The main achievements of foreign and domestic science in the medical field, the strategic planning of its development and the application of the principles of strategic management of medical institutions became the theoretical and methodological basis of the research. The formation and development of strategic management is an important part of corporate management not only of a manufacturing enterprise, but also of health care institutions as a whole. Without effective medical care, citizens are not interested in solving secondary problems, because the issue of preserving and maintaining health always comes first. With the spread of market development priorities, the management of medical institutions is gaining importance.  The study analyzes different approaches to strategic management, such as innovation management, resource management, implementation of digital technologies and patient orientation. Special attention is paid to practical aspects of strategy implementation, including assessment of the external and internal environment, development of strategic plans, optimization of operations and risk management. The research results are intended to suggest ways to increase the competitiveness of medical institutions and the quality of the services provided by them, which will contribute to their sustainable development in the conditions of modern challenges in the field of health care.</jats:p>"

This work is part of a European project (SUSHEAT) which focuses on developing a novel technology that integrates several innovative components: a Stirling cycle high-temperature heat pump (HTHP), a bio-inspired phase change material (PCM) thermal energy storage (TES) system, and a control and integration twin (CIT) system based on smart decision-making algorithms. The objective is to develop highly efficient industrial heat upgrading systems for industrial applications using renewable energy sources and waste heat recovery. To achieve this, the specific heat requirements of different European industries were analyzed. The findings indicate that industrial sectors such as food and beverages, plastics, desalination, textiles, ceramics, pulp and paper, wood products, canned food, agricultural products, mining, and chemicals, typically require process heat at temperatures below 250 °C under conditions well within the range of the SUSHEAT system. Moreover, two case studies, namely the Pelagia and Mandrekas companies, were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the system. An analysis of the annual European heat demand by sector and temperature demonstrated that the theoretical potential heat demand that could be met by the SUSHEAT system is 134.92 TWh annually. Furthermore, an environmental impact assessment estimated an annual significant reduction of 19.40 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. These findings underscore the significant potential of the SUSHEAT system to contribute to the decarbonization of European industry by efficiently meeting heat demand and substantially reducing carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

In this research, the smart system of the sports stadium is evaluated considering the renewable energy resources, and the electric vehicles are also one of the demanded loads. The studied system uses a solar cell to supply the electric load, which is used to model the equipment using GAMS software. Different scenarios have been evaluated considering the uncertainty in solar radiation intensity. Furthermore, the conditional value at risk measure is considered to manage and reduce the risk of smart sports stadium energy supply cost. Finally, the effects of the battery capacity of electric vehicles on the installed solar cell power and the cost of the produced energy have been evaluated. The results indicate that in a scenario based on a system consisting of an electric vehicle under a photovoltaic cell and a battery, the energy cost will be equal to around 111.2 cents, which represents a 34% reduction compared to a different scenario. This can be an important achievement in the design of sports stadiums under smart energy systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rising costs, complex supply chain management, and stringent regulations have created significant financial burdens on business sustainability, calling for new and rapid strategies to help enterprises transform. Supply chain digitalization (SCD) has emerged as a promising approach in the context of digitalization and globalization, with the potential to reduce an enterprise’s debt costs. Developing a strategic framework for SCD that effectively reduces the cost of debt (CoD) has become a key academic challenge, critical for ensuring business sustainability. To this end, under the perspective of four flows, SCD is deconstructed into four distinct features: logistics flow digitalization (LFD), product flow digitalization (PFD), information flow digitalization (IFD), and capital flow digitalization (CFD). To precisely measure the four SCD features and the dependent variable, COD, publicly available data from Chinese listed manufacturing enterprises such as annual report texts and financial statement data are collected, and various data mining technologies are also used to conduct data measurement and data processing. To comprehensively investigate the impact pattern of SCD on CoD, we employed the explainable machine learning methodology for data analysis. This methodology involved in-depth data discussions, cross-validation utilizing a series of machine learning models, and the utilization of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to explain the results generated by the models. To conduct sensitivity analysis, permutation feature importance (PFI) and partial dependence plots (PDPs) were also incorporated as supplementary explanatory methods, providing additional insights into the model’s explainability. Through the aforementioned research processes, the following findings are obtained: SCD can play a role in reducing CoD, but the effects of different SCD features are not exactly the same. Among the four SCD features, LFD, PFD, and IFD have the potential to significantly reduce CoD, with PFD having the most substantial impact, followed by LFD and IFD. In contrast, CFD has a relatively weak impact, and its role is challenging to discern. These findings provide significant guidance for enterprises in furthering their digitalization and supply chain development, helping them optimize SCD strategies more accurately to reduce CoD.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to its unique climate and geography, Taiwan experiences abundant rainfall but still faces significant water scarcity. As a result, rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs) have been recognized as potential water resources within both water legal and green building policies. However, the effects of climate change—manifested in more frequent extreme rainfall events and uneven rainfall distribution—have heightened the risks of both droughts and floods. This underscores the need to retrofit existing RWHSs to function as stormwater management tools and water supply sources. In Taiwan, the use of simple and cost-effective passive release systems is particularly suitable for such retrofits. Four key considerations are central to designing passive release RWHSs: the type of discharge outlet, the size of the outlet, the location of the outlet, and the system’s operational strategy. This study analyzes three commonly used outlet types—namely, the orifice, short stub fitting, and drainage pipe. Their respective discharge flow formulas and design charts have been developed and compared. To determine the appropriate outlet size, design storms with 2-, 5-, and 10-year return periods in the Taipei area were utilized to examine three different representative buildings. Selected combinations of outlet diameters and five different outlet locations were assessed. Additionally, probably hazardous rainfall events between 2014 and 2023 were used to verify the results obtained from the design storm analysis. Based on these analyses, the short stub fitting outlet type with a 15 mm outlet diameter was selected and verified. For determining the suitable discharge outlet location, a three-step process is recommended. First, the average annual water supply reliability for different scenarios and outlet locations in each representative building is calculated. Using this information, the maximum allowable decline in water supply reliability and the corresponding outlet location can be identified for each scenario. Second, break-even points between average annual water supply and regulated stormwater release curves, as well as the corresponding outlet locations, are identified. Finally, incremental analyses of average annual water supply and regulated stormwater release curves are conducted to determine the suitable outlet location for each scenario and representative building. For the representative detached house (DH), scenario 2, which designates 50% of the tank’s volume as detention space (i.e., the discharge outlet located halfway up the tank), and scenario 3, which designates 75% (i.e., the discharge outlet at one-quarter of the tank height), are the most suitable options. For the four-story building (FSB), the outlet located at one-quarter of the tank’s height is suitable for both scenarios 2 and 3. For the eight-story building (ESB), scenario 2, with the outlet at one-quarter of the tank’s height, and scenario 3, with the outlet at the lowest point on the tank’s side, are preferred. The framework developed in this study provides drainage designers with a systematic method for determining the key parameters in passive-release RWHS design at the household scale.</jats:p>"

After the first investigation, results revealed that all water samples collected had elevated concentrations of fluoride ions (2.3 ± 0.1) mg/L to (4.5 ± 0.2) mg/L above the WHO guidelines (less than 1.5 mg/L). To mitigate the F− levels, the use of bone char (BC) as an adsorbent material was proposed and its performance was tested. BC was prepared from bovine bones at different calcination temperatures (350 °C, 450 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C) and residence times (1 h and 2 h). The prepared materials were characterized in detail by SEM/EDS, BET, FTIR, and XRD. The BET findings indicated that the surface area of BC samples decreased with increasing calcination temperature and residence time. At a lower heating temperature and holding time (350 °C, 1 h), the prepared BC exhibited a higher specific surface area (112.3 ± 0.3) m2/g and adsorption capacity for F− in the sampled water. Also, the batch adsorption experiments showed that the optimized adsorbent dose of 8 g/L facilitates the reduction in the F− level of the sampled water below the acceptable limit level (1.5 mg/L) within 5 min of treatment. The presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in natural water has a positive effect on the removal of F− in BC resulting in a high adsorption performance range of (72.5 ± 1.4)% to (80.3 ± 0.6)%. It was found that the adsorption of Ca2+ on the BC surface occurs via cation exchange with Na+. However, an increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the treated water limited the application of BC. Overall, the study presented a cost-effective adsorbent for the removal of this recalcitrant ion in the water source.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the significant impact of China’s strategic initiatives, notably the “Going Global” strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), on the operational practices of Chinese enterprises involved in overseas investments. Central to this transformation is the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) model, which emphasizes the integration of supply chain management and stakeholder collaboration to enhance performance in international EPC projects and underscores the crucial role of these elements in promoting sustainability. Incorporating insights from social network data analysis, this study reveals that contractors collaborating with various stakeholders—such as owners/consulting engineers, domestic and foreign customs departments, and group headquarters/design parties—exhibit a high degree of similarity in personnel profiles. This suggests that the internal organizational structure and personnel allocation of contractors could be optimized to enhance operational efficiency, aligning with the collaborative patterns identified. This study addresses a critical research gap by exploring how effective supply chain management and collaborative stakeholder engagement within multinational EPC projects contribute to sustainable outcomes. Employing advanced social network analysis software, the research examines the complex interactions among stakeholders and their influence on procurement dynamics. Findings indicate that strong relational networks and strategic collaborations significantly enhance procurement efficiency and project success, underscoring the importance of supply chain integration. Ultimately, integrating supply chain management principles into the EPC model not only offers innovative perspectives for advancing sustainability in international projects but also provides actionable insights for improving project outcomes within the BRI framework. This research underscores the pivotal role of supply chain organization and stakeholder cooperation in achieving sustainability objectives, thereby enriching the discourse on sustainable enterprise operation and supply chain management in the context of global initiatives.</jats:p>"

Our research framework was to identify the direct effects even the pandemic and later the energy crisis, arose as a consequence of Russian aggression against Ukraine. On the other hand, we try to follow the changes of housing market trends not just in the city alone, but in the surroundings, too, concentrating on suburbanisation, as an emerging phenomena after the transition (post-1990 period) in a post-socialist context. The case study area was Pécs, one of the regional centres in Hungary, with a university town character, and less successful pole of FDI led re-industrialisation. Our major results suggest, that global challenges affect local markets directly. In a wider term, we find the 2020s as a turning point, after a long regeneration period in housing market after the global fiscal crisis (2008-2013 in Hungary). The COVID-pandemic closed the era of conjuncture and the next few years did not show a clear characteristic, but short-term micro-cycles followed each other, influenced by the elements of the governmental support system. To point out the recent changes, we used a quantitative methodology, based on different data sources (CSO, self-built) and find some correlation between some basic indicators. Suburbanisation, as a ‘western’ type phenomena could be register around Pécs, but the de-concentration of well-off groups prefer only a few settlements close to the city, and neglect a higher number of smaller villages with worse accessibility, lower level of local services, less diverse local economies and less perspective wages. Connecting with our theories we used, the production of space, and agency theories has the more direct causality with our results. The professional developers, the local governments and the most powerful actor, the central government fuel the changes in the local (urban area level) housing market trends, through forming the space following the needs of middle- and high-income groups. The spatial transformation of the suburban area around Pécs deeply rooted in the post-socialist (neo-liberal) way of development in the majority of East-Central-European space. This study is part of a larger long-term project financed by the NRDI Fund of Hungary („The effect of housing market processes on spatial (social) structure of Hungarian regional centres” – K131534) concentrate on five larger cities, including Pécs, and their suburb.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In an environment marked by global economic volatility and geopolitical uncertainties, the stability of Taiwan’s supply chain takes on heightened importance, particularly given Taiwan’s crucial role in the global semiconductor supply chain. In recent years, semiconductor companies in Taiwan have faced increasing inventory pressures, which will reduce their competitiveness and increase operational costs over the long term. Although previous studies have explored the influence of trade facilitation on macroeconomic and trade efficiencies, its specific impacts on the semiconductor industry have been less frequently addressed. This study integrates corporate inventory, trade facilitation, and geopolitical factors within a unified analytical framework to construct a model that explores mediating and moderating effects. This study conducted regression analysis on data from 52 Taiwan-listed integrated circuit companies from 2014 to 2022. Contrary to traditional findings that trade facilitation decreases inventory in other industries, it predominantly fosters inventory accumulation within Taiwan’s semiconductor sector by expanding market size, thereby affecting supply chain efficiency. Moreover, geopolitical factors were found to intensify the effects of trade facilitation on corporate inventory. Elevated geopolitical risks lead to greater inventory accumulation, which ultimately threatens long-term competitiveness and diminishes the semiconductor industry’s advantage in Taiwan, further influencing supply chain efficiency. Consequently, this study recommends that to more accurately forecast market size, semiconductor companies in Taiwan are encouraged to expand their manufacturing investments in Chinese mainland. Additionally, the prudent handling of cross-strait relations by the Taiwan authorities is an important strategy to mitigate geopolitical risks affecting the semiconductor supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the process of recharging groundwater by rainfall flood water recharge from an anti-filtration recharge well was simulated by indoor sand column test, and the change of permeability coefficient, turbidity at the outlet, and the distribution of suspended particulate matter at the end of the experiment were measured and computed, so as to analyze and study the effect of filtration in anti-filtration recharge wells and carry out the contrast test with ordinary recharge wells without a recharge pool. Compared with ordinary recharge wells, the anti-filter layer in the recharge pool of anti-filtration recharge wells can largely remove suspended matter in recharge water and intercept suspended matter at the surface, thus preventing aquifer clogging, and it is recommended that the anti-filter layer should be cleaned up and replaced regularly according to the experimental results, and this study provides a reference for the practical application of anti-filtration recharge wells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Different industries have been affected by the shortage of semiconductors globally, and one of the most affected industries is the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) industry within Australia. Semiconductors play a massive role in NEV features like battery management and power management. These factors include the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise in electronics demand, natural calamities, and most importantly the shortage which has affected NEV production and sales in Australia. This paper discusses the consequences of the lack of supply of such components on the Australian NEV supply chain: They stop production, low inventory levels, financial losses, and slowed innovation. It brings out vulnerability issues including dependence on limited suppliers from Asia and the absence of chip-making factories within North America. Based on the identified threats, the paper outlines the following solutions: supplier diversification, increasing inventory levels, raising supply chain visibility, investing in domestic semiconductor production, incentives for buyers, and sourcing non-semiconductor material technologies. Such measures are strategic and intended to secure an NEV supply chain in Australia that is both sustainable and environmentally friendly. </jats:p>"

The study revealed that digital marketing indicators are positively correlated with non-delivery indicators. In particular, Social media interactions and Failures to deliver (0.75), Social media likes and Failures to deliver (0.74), Social media interactions and Biweekly Failures to deliver volume (0.78), Social media likes and Biweekly Failures to deliver volume (0.78). It was assumed that this state of affairs may be determined by increased demand due to digital marketing, for which companies may not always be ready.

Firstly, a combined heat and power microgrid system considering hydrogen energy systems was constructed based on the thermoelectric cogeneration characteristics of fuel cells and electrolyzers. Then, a data-driven two-stage distribution robust optimization scheduling model is built by combining typical historical data of wind power output, photovoltaic power output, and load. The results show that the distributed robust method reduces the running cost by 6% compared to the deterministic method. The proposed method and model are capable of meeting the demand for thermoelectric loads within the microgrid in a more cost-effective manner, thereby achieving stable and independent operation of the system.</jats:p>"

The research aims to assess the roles of marine capture and mariculture in meeting rising food demand and ensuring nutrition security, given the limitations of land-based food production. Using data from 2003 to 2021, the study highlights several key trends: mariculture, focused on shellfish and algae, now outpaces marine capture, which remains centered on fish and crustaceans. Significant regional disparities are observed, with mariculture expanding rapidly in several coastal provinces as marine capture declines. Nutrient supply from marine capture has followed a three-phase pattern of growth, stagnation, and decline, while mariculture’s nutrient output has steadily increased, particularly in protein. By 2019-2020, mariculture surpassed marine capture in energy and protein supply, though fat supply remains lower. Regional differences in nutrient supply show mariculture leading in multiple provinces. The study concludes by recommending strategies to promote sustainable, diverse, and environmentally friendly practices for China’s marine food systems.</jats:p>"

Customer-centric demand forecasting addresses this challenge by considering customer characteristics when determining inventory levels. This study proposes a solution framework comprising two steps: (a) segmentation using customer characteristics and (b) demand forecasting for each segment using transparent and responsible artificial intelligence techniques. We employed k-means, hierarchical clustering, and explainable AI (XAI) to segment, model, and compare several machine-learning techniques for demand forecasting. The results showed that support vector regression outperformed the autoregressive models. The results also showed that the two-step segmentation and demand forecasting process using hierarchical clustering and LSTM outperforms (Weighted average RMSE across segments = 61.57) the conventional single-step unsegmented forecasting process (RMSE overall data = 238.18). The main implication of this study is the demonstration of XAI in enhancing transparency in machine learning and an improved method for reducing forecasting errors in practice, which can strengthen the supply chain resilience for perishable products.</jats:p>"

Applying AI in supply chain logistics, such as demand forecasting, inventory optimization and transport route planning, can provide accurate data analysis and decision support. It can help reduce inventory costs, shorten transportation time and optimize resource allocation in the supply chain. However, AI and blockchain technologies still face several challenges, such as data privacy and security issues, technology costs and standardization.

To meet the increasing demand for metals in a sustainable way, one of the strategies that could be implemented would be the recovery of metals as by-products. This would decrease the amount of hazardous materials filling mining dumps. The present study investigates the potential for producing antimony as a by-product at the Olympias separation plant in Northern Greece. This plant works a skarn mineralization that shows interesting amounts of Sb. Boulangerite (Pb5Sb4S11) reports on Pb concentrate levels reached 8% in the analyzed product. This pre-enrichment is favorable in terms of boulangerite recovery since it can be separated from galena through froth flotation. Boulangerite distribution in the primary ore is quite heterogeneous in terms of the inclusion relationships and grain size. However, a qualitative assessment shows that the current Pb concentrate grain size is too coarse to successfully liberate a good amount of boulangerite. The use of image analysis and textural assessments is pivotal in determining shape factors and crystal size, which is essential for the targeting of flotation parameters during separation. The extraction of antimony as a by-product is possible through a two-step process; namely, (i) the preliminary concentration of boulangerite, followed by (ii) the hydrometallurgical extraction of the antimony from the boulangerite concentrate. The Olympias enrichment plant could therefore set a positive example by promoting the benefits of targeted Sb extraction as a by-product within similar sulfide deposits within the European territory.</jats:p>"

Inhibition of SGLT2 or lack of renal Glut2 induces massive loss of glucose (energy) in urine in humans and rodents. Despite this massive glucose loss, both the humans and rodents are able to maintain normal supply of energy even when they are fasted. Molecular basis of the compensatory mechanisms responsible for maintaining the normal blood glucose levels despite high glycosuria remains unknown. Therefore, here we aimed to determine how renal Glut2 KO mice maintain normal energy and glucose homeostasis at baseline despite massive loss of glucose in urine. Given the role of mitochondria in energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that quantifying mitochondrial proteome and metabolome in the kidneys would identify novel adaptive pathways to explain this phenotype. To test the hypothesis, we used 8-10 weeks old male renal Glut2 KO and their littermate control mice produced on the C57BL/6 genetic background. We isolated mitochondria from kidneys and adopted 2D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry to quantify mitochondrial proteome. In addition, we used untargeted metabolomics to determine changes in metabolite levels in kidneys. We also performed western blot to validate the results obtained from the proteomic analyses. Mitochondrial proteomics revealed significant alterations (1.5 up/down fold change; p ≤ 0.05) in proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy homeostasis. Using western blot, we validated the downregulation of pyruvate carboxylase involved in gluconeogenesis (CON vs KO: 100 ± 9.9 vs 33.1 ± 5.6; % of control, p&amp;lt;0.05) and glycine amidinotransferase, involved in amine, polyamine and creatine biosynthesis (CON vs KO: 100 ± 30.4 vs 3.9 ± 0.5; p&amp;lt;0.05). These results indicate the adaptive responses of renal Glut2 KO mice to maintain their energy homeostasis. Remarkably, kidney metabolomics demonstrated that mannose levels were 18 fold higher in the KO mice as compared to control group. Mannose is known to enter glycolysis pathway to provide adequate supply of energy when glucose is unavailable. We further confirmed the involvement of mannose metabolism as an alternative source of energy by observing increased levels of phosphomannose isomerase (CON vs KO: 100 ± 9.9 vs 248 ± 39.7; p&amp;lt;0.05) which is an essential enzyme to interconvert fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate and thereby produce mannose. Our data shows that loss of glucose in urine causes reprogramming of mitochondrial function to increase the efficiency of ATP synthesis and enhances mannose production in renal Glut2 KO mice. The findings identify novel compensatory pathways that make up for the glucose loss in urine and can thus be targeted to improve the efficiency of SGLT2 inhibition in treatment of diabetes mellitus.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Presentation: 6/2/2024</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aims to understand ‘what works and what doesn't’ and the need for sustainability of urban potable water management in Dumai City, Rokan Hilir Regency, and Bengkalis Regency through cross-sectoral collaboration and develop the best model to be developed for this collaboration. This study uses a soft system methodology in the urban potable water supply system of Riau Province with a wide range of stakeholders through in-depth interviews, thematic analysis, and the creation of purposeful activity models and rich pictures to uncover and address complex issues. The study found that the implementation of collaborative water management in urban areas with the collaborative water governance approach has worked well in the short term. However, it has not enhanced organizational autonomy or fostered trust and reciprocity dimensions in the long term. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of a collaborative supervisory board that will open internal and external opportunities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing emphasis on sustainability in global food and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industries has prompted companies to seek innovative strategies for integrating sustainability without compromising cost-effectiveness. This study proposes a comprehensive model that bridges the gap between sustainable practices and cost-efficiency in food and FMCG supply chains. The model emphasizes the adoption of circular economy principles, lean manufacturing, and green logistics to reduce waste, lower carbon emissions, and optimize resource use. It also highlights the role of digital technologies, such as blockchain for traceability and artificial intelligence (AI) for demand forecasting, to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency. The framework incorporates supplier collaboration, emphasizing ethical sourcing and the use of renewable materials to align with both environmental goals and consumer expectations. Furthermore, it explores the importance of agile inventory management to minimize overproduction and reduce storage costs, which directly contributes to profitability. The economic feasibility of the model is examined through case studies demonstrating how businesses have successfully implemented sustainable practices without incurring excessive costs. A key focus of the study is balancing sustainability with cost-effectiveness by leveraging economies of scale, strategic partnerships, and technology-driven solutions. By doing so, companies can achieve a competitive advantage while meeting regulatory requirements and increasing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.

Hence, supplier engagement has emerged as a critical strategy for achieving net‐zero emissions. However, studies about how purchasing firms engage with suppliers and how such engagement mitigates Scope 3 emissions are relatively scant. This study fills this important gap in supply chain management literature. The study employs a multiple‐case study approach. Overall, 42 semi‐structured interviews with senior managers from four purchasing and four supplying firms are undertaken. The results unveil six of the best strategies that purchasing firms have deployed to effectively engage suppliers and bring them on track to reduce Scope 3 emissions. These include effective communication, building trust, providing support and guidance, using suppliers' data effectively, refining engagement programs through consistent feedback, and developing supplier incentive programs. The study offers both theoretical insights and practical implications. For instance, it suggests that effective engagement with suppliers will help suppliers mitigate Scope 3 emissions, and buyers can also overcome conflicting targets to reduce Scope 3 emission targets in procurement. The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and suggestions for future research.</jats:p>",

It substantiates the relevance of supply chain management (Supply Chain Management SCM). It has been determined that in order to competitive advantages in the market sector, business sector need to improve supply chain management properly, which will reduce the cost of production to delivery, optimize times, as well as customer satisfaction. It is proposed to consider the risk management mechanism in business sector as a set of mutually agreed methods, procedures, management tools, taking into account the role of each subject of the supply chain. It is concluded that the correct risk assessment mechanism in the supply chain for business sector should constitute an appropriate tool for assessing the effectiveness of risk management from the point of view of all business sector in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses modern methods of assessing the efficiency of logistics processes, which are one of the most important components of the successful functioning of any company, especially in today's fierce competition and globalization. The article assesses the efficiency of logistics processes, which are an integral part of the company's strategic management and allow ensuring its stable development. The analysis of modern methods for assessing the efficiency of logistics processes in a company has allowed to identify three important tools, such as: data envelopment analysis (DEA), ABC analysis and cost analysis and control method. It is proved that the DEA method can be applied to a wide range of logistics systems, regardless of their complexity and specificity. In addition, DEA allows to identify factors that limit efficiency and develops recommendations for its improvement. The value of ABC analysis is highlighted, which lies in the potential to increase sales volumes by improving the availability of goods that are most valued by customers. An assessment of the efficiency of logistics processes in a company using ABC analysis is proposed. The importance of such a method as cost analysis and control is analyzed. Thanks to a detailed analysis and control of costs, it is possible to identify bottlenecks in the logistics chain, optimize delivery routes, reduce storage costs and increase the efficiency of vehicle use. The author proposes the key stages of the logistics cost analysis based on the “Five Steps” system. It is proved that the joint use of the proposed methods creates synergy, allowing for a deeper and more accurate analysis than when each of them is applied separately. The methods we have studied complement each other, providing company managers with tools for comprehensive analysis and evaluation of logistics efficiency.</jats:p>"

A few years ago, this technology was implemented for the first time in the financial sector, which is currently extended to be used in many other areas, mainly the health-care sector. The success of this technology stems from its ability to enhance the performance, security, consistency of sharing medical data within the whole system and the analysis of medical records. Technically, the BT is defined as a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions between the stakeholders in a supply chain.

The results indicate that: Tourist hotels in most eastern provinces exhibit the U-shaped pattern in terms of carbon emissions. the majority of indirect carbon emissions from these hotels originate from the food and tobacco processing sectors. Indirect carbon emissions of tourist hotels in recent years might be decoupling with economic growth because of its decreasing trend. The implementation of energy-saving technology can enhance the carbon efficiency of tourist hotels, while regional economy growth can benefit the carbon emissions efficiency indirectly. Environmental pollution control investment and employment population are external driving factors affecting carbon emissions from tourist hotels.

However, seizing these opportunities is not without its challenges; critical tensions inevitably arise. This paper, based on a systematic review of 287 SC studies, identifies and discusses five key tensions: (1) increased trade‐offs between sustainability and efficiency; (2) competing priorities between SC sustainability and resilience; (3) mismatched sustainability expectations causing stakeholder pressure; (4) conflicting demands between global and sustainable operations; and (5) unintended consequences of technological innovation, disadvantaging stakeholders with limited resources and capabilities. To mitigate these tensions while leveraging on the opportunities, the study proposes several strategic pathways, including adopting circular economy principles, optimizing inventory and distribution management, employing holistic measurement and forecasting, balancing risk‐hedging with proactive risk management, fostering inclusive stakeholder engagement, balancing globalization and regionalization, and integrating advanced digital technologies alongside with SC ecosystem wide change management. These strategies offer practical guidance for building sustainable and crises‐ready SCs and set the stage for an extensive research agenda to further explore SC sustainability in multi‐crisis environments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hospital selection patterns are essential for evaluating medical accessibility and optimizing resource management. In the absence of medical records, early studies primarily used accessibility functions to estimate potential selection probabilities (PSPs). With the advent of travel data, data-driven functions have enabled the calculation of observed selection probabilities (OSPs). Comparing PSP and OSP helps to leverage travel data to understand hospital selection preferences and improve medical service evaluation models. This study proposes a selection probability-based accessibility model for calculating PSP and OSP accessibility. A case study in Shenzhen employed nighttime navigation data to reduce interference from different travel modes. The distance decay function was validated, with exponential and Gaussian functions performing best. For hospitals, the PSP distribution closely aligned with OSP, except in areas with high hospital density. This discrepancy may result from the PSP function overestimating the selection probability for nearby hospitals, a limitation that could be addressed by fitting the distance decay function to actual data. PSP-based accessibility and Gini coefficients differ from those of OSP. However, when parameters are fitted to actual data, the PSP- and OSP-based functions produce nearly identical results. Fitting to actual data can notably improve the accuracy of PSP and the corresponding accessibility outcomes. These findings may provide valuable references for medical service evaluation methodologies and offer insights for planning and management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>La cadena de suministro es un componente crítico en el funcionamiento eficiente de las empresas, ya que abarca todas las actividades necesarias para mover un producto desde el proveedor hasta el consumidor final (Smith, 2022). Una cadena de suministro bien gestionada no solo minimiza los costos operativos, sino que también mejora la calidad y la velocidad del servicio, creando una ventaja competitiva significativa (Brown, 2023). Las tecnologías emergentes, como el Internet de las Cosas (IoT) y el análisis de datos, han transformado la forma en que las empresas monitorean y optimizan sus cadenas de suministro, permitiendo visibilidad en tiempo real y una toma de decisiones más informada (Chen &amp; Wu, 2021). Además, la resiliencia de la cadena de suministro ante interrupciones, como desastres naturales o crisis globales, se ha convertido en un aspecto crucial para garantizar la continuidad del negocio (Miller, 2022). Finalmente, la sostenibilidad y la responsabilidad social corporativa también desempeñan un papel importante en la gestión de la cadena de suministro. Las empresas están cada vez más comprometidas con prácticas que reducen el impacto ambiental y promueven condiciones laborales justas a lo largo de la cadena (Davis, 2023). Implementar estas prácticas no solo contribuye al bienestar global, sino que también mejora la reputación de la empresa y la lealtad del cliente (Taylor, 2024). En resumen, la cadena de suministro es fundamental para la competitividad y sostenibilidad de las empresas en el mercado actual.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the policy implications and economic incentives designed to promote sustainability within these industries, focusing on regulatory frameworks, market-driven mechanisms, and industry-specific challenges. It highlights how government policies, including environmental regulations, tax incentives, and subsidies, can encourage businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices, such as reducing carbon footprints, optimizing transportation logistics, and improving packaging solutions. The study also examines economic incentives like green certifications, consumer demand for sustainable products, and the potential for cost savings through energy efficiency and waste reduction. Moreover, the paper discusses the role of international trade policies and agreements in shaping sustainable supply chains, particularly in emerging markets where infrastructure and regulatory enforcement may be weak. The research identifies the growing trend of companies integrating sustainability goals into their core strategies to enhance corporate reputation, meet investor expectations, and gain a competitive advantage. However, it also highlights the barriers to widespread adoption, including cost concerns, limited access to sustainable materials, and the complexity of supply chain networks. The findings suggest that a combination of well-structured policies, economic incentives, and public-private partnerships is essential for accelerating the transition to sustainable supply chains. Additionally, fostering collaboration among stakeholders—governments, businesses, and consumers—can help overcome the existing barriers. The paper concludes by recommending strategies for policymakers and industry leaders to align economic growth with environmental sustainability, ensuring long-term benefits for both the planet and the economy.</jats:p>"

As such, there is increasing concern among academics to understand systematic risks and its determinants in emerging markets. Hence, the need to investigate the effect of interest rate and money supply as determinants of systematic risk associated with return in the Nigerian Exchange. The study was correlational in nature, and data for the study was collected from the CBN statistical bulletin and the Nigerian Exchange. Monthly data from April, 2012 to December, 2022 were used for the analysis. The study conducted data analysis using autoregressive distributive lag model and other preliminary analysis. Result from the study revealed that money supply has positive significant effect on systematic risk. On the other hand, interest rate exhibited negative and statistically insignificant effect on systematic risk. The study came to the conclusion that money supply is a determinant of systematic risk as it can influence its behaviour significantly while interest rate can affect systematic risk but the magnitude is statistically insignificant. Therefore, the study recommended that investors should continuously study the changes in the behaviour of the determinants in order to make sound investment decision and maximize their return from the market. The government through the CBN should also ensure that they consistently improve their policies on interest rate and money supply. This will help the market to operate efficiently.</jats:p>"

The article discusses the accomplishments, challenges, and regulatory framework of NAFDAC, emphasizing GS1 technology-driven traceability, and presents the results of the field scanning activities conducted in July 2023. The approach involved a phased public sector pilot, showcasing the feasibility and challenges of tracking vaccine movement through the supply chain. The result shows the detection of 43 unique products across 1022 facilities from a total of 110,113 scans, offering valuable insights into vaccine distributions. The strategic goals of the project aligned with developing safety surveillance systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to facilitate patient access to global health products. Similarly, significant improvement in traceability through automated data capture (barcode scanning) and expanded coverage for COVID-19 and selected RI vaccines in Nigeria was found. Against this background, the information derived from this report will build confidence in patients regarding vaccine authenticity, establish a transparent and robust supply chain, and foster pharmacovigilance capability through integration with the track-and-trace systems. Thus, the study provides invaluable insights and opportunities for global health practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to incorporate track-and-trace into regulatory systems by other national regulatory authorities.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, the study involves OWEN Logic programming environment, which manages pumping stations through programmable relays. The paper presents functional diagrams that have been introduced into standard macros to increase the reliability of pumping units. In addition, the paper demonstrates that the implementation of multi-level management facilitates the improvement of existing water supply and wastewater disposal systems, thereby increasing their functional capabilities and ensuring the efficient operation of technological equipment. The conducted analysis shows that the adoption of this method for managing technological processes will enhance the reliability and durability of the equipment, ensuring uninterrupted operation of pumping stations. With a change in the performance of water supply and wastewater disposal systems, the installed devices will allow for modernization with minimal economic costs, and reprogramming the operation of the low-level automation without affecting the performance of other levels.</jats:p>"

Concurrently, an optimization problem was derived from the evaluation issue, with the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) used to identify a reasonable default point and distance. To simplify the identification of these points, we enhanced the traditional WOA, resulting in an improved version, the IWOA, which demonstrated very good optimization performance. The IWOA's optimization capabilities were applied to determine the optimal ratio of short- and long-term debt coefficients, identifying the default point in the Kealhofer, McQuown, and Vasicek (KMV) credit monitoring model, replacing fixed values and yielding more precise results. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel analytical approach to credit risk measurement, advancing the development of related theories and methods. Accurate analysis of financial stability and risk is crucial in industrial sectors, including engineering and manufacturing. The simulation using specific data revealed that the IWOA-KMV model exhibited better and faster optimization capabilities, with greater discrimination ability compared to the KMV model. Overall, this study examines the risk factors in the cloud warehouse financing model, offers an improved version of the WOA, introduces a modified IWOA-KMV model to create a scientific, practical credit risk assessment framework, and provides guidance for risk control in cloud warehouse financing, a novel financing service.</jats:p>",

We focus on two dimensions of national culture—individualism/collectivism (IDV) and power distance (PDI)—for their close relevance to structural changes that occur during post-acquisition integration. We find that while differences in PDI are negatively associated with post-acquisition performance, differences in IDV positively affect such performance. We also find that the acquirer's cultural learning from supply chain partners helps mitigate the negative impact of PDI differences on post-acquisition performance, especially when the partner has a similar national culture in PDI to the target. Our theoretical development and empirical findings contribute to the operations and supply chain management research by illuminating the differential effects of national cultural differences on post-acquisition integration outcomes. Also, our study sheds new light on the possibility that working with supply chain partners may provide an opportunity for cultural learning that can be utilized in a post-acquisition integration setting. </jats:p>"

Existing research on inter-basin transfers and their impact on water systems between Singapore and Johor is abundant, but there is a notable lack of research specifically addressing Johor’s water system during this time. By examining the historical context and socio-economic dynamics that shaped the inter-basin transfer, this study aims to contribute a unique perspective to the existing body of knowledge. The findings will enhance our understanding of the impacts of inter-basin water transfers and provide valuable insights for water resource management in the region. It also contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of such transfers on contemporary water scarcity issues and provides practical insights for sustainable water resource management globally.</jats:p>",

Given the expense and political sensitivity of providing water for the environment, greater certainty regarding the expected benefits of environmental flows is required. We assessed the role of managed flows (for both environmental and consumptive purposes) in delivering sediment and plant propagules to facilitate riverbank recovery. Using artificial turf mats, we determined sediment and seed deposition from 11 flow events over 3 years of varying magnitudes, durations and timing in a heavily regulated lowland river in south‐east Australia. At three sites on the Goulburn River, Victoria, mats were placed on different geomorphic features along an elevation gradient (bars, benches, banks and ledges) before a flow event, and the sediment deposited during the event was analysed and assessed for seedling emergence. A total of 401 kg of sediment and 110 980 seeds were sampled. Mats that were inundated via managed flow releases had an order of magnitude more sediment, and around twice the richness of seed taxa, than mats that were not inundated. More sediment and seed taxa were deposited on low‐lying bars than on more elevated features, while seed composition but not abundance varied across features. A longer duration of inundation was associated with the deposition of more sediment, but not seed taxa or abundance. Unexpectedly, there was no evidence that managed flows delivered less sediment and seeds compared with unregulated tributary inflows. Our findings suggest that in regulated rivers, environmental flows are likely to be critical for providing the sediment and seed necessary to restore geomorphic conditions and promote plant recruitment. Longer flow durations are likely to provide more sediment, while high‐flow events may be particularly important for promoting diverse native riparian plant communities across the full range of in‐channel geomorphic features.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the integration of electric vehicles and crowdshipping systems into smart CMMCs to improve urban logistics operations related to the distribution of products to consumers. The aim of this study is to improve the LMPD performance of these integrated systems and to provide alternative solutions for sustainable city logistics using the potential of crowdshipping and vehicle sharing fleets (VSFs) in the city logistics nodes (CLNs) of CMFMCs. The issues presented by the loading–unloading operations and sustainable crowdshipping scenarios for LMPD in CMFMCs are considered. This paper presents a new performance evaluation model for crowdshipping LMPD in CMFMCs using VSFs. The case study shows that the proposed model enables the analysis of LMPD performance in CMFMCs, taking into account their finite production capacity, and that it facilitates the planning of cargo turnover and the structure of VSFs consisting of e-bicycles, e-cars, and e-light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs). The model is verified based on a case study for sustainable LMPD scenarios using VSFs. The proposed model enables the planning of both short- and long-term logistics operations with the specified performance indicator of VSF usage in CMFMCs. The validity of using the integrated potential of crowdshipping and vehicle sharing services for LMPD under demand uncertainty in CMFMCs is discussed. This study should prove useful for decision-making and planning processes related to LMPD in CMFMCs and large cities.</jats:p>"

In today’s global supply chains, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and environmental responsibility is critical, yet the lack of real-time visibility and data fragmentation presents significant challenges. The framework addresses these issues by merging data from multiple sources, including IoT devices, operational databases, and external environmental factors, using advanced data fusion algorithms. DLT, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature, ensures the integrity and security of the data, allowing all stakeholders to access accurate and tamper-proof information. The fusion of data within a DLT infrastructure not only improves traceability and accountability but also enables the automation of sustainability checks via smart contracts. These contracts can trigger actions based on predefined sustainability metrics such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, and resource efficiency. Furthermore, predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms integrated into the system provide real-time monitoring and optimization of sustainability performance throughout the supply chain. The proposed review offers numerous benefits, including enhanced transparency, reduced operational costs, improved sustainability outcomes, and risk mitigation. It also addresses challenges such as scalability, data privacy, and regulatory compliance, offering solutions to overcome these hurdles. By exploring case studies of successful implementations, this review demonstrates the practical applications and future potential of combining DLT and data fusion for sustainable supply chain management, positioning it as a critical tool for organizations aiming to meet environmental and regulatory demands in an increasingly digital and eco-conscious world.</jats:p>"

It does this by examining 55 pertinent publications that were published between July 2024 and 2015. Sources for the literature included reputable research resources such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus. With an emphasis on machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, and conventional statistical techniques, the paper demonstrates the wide variety of predictive modelling techniques used in the field. The results show that the use of machine learning techniques is becoming more common, and these techniques have been shown to offer a great deal of promise for enhancing SCM decision-making and forecasting accuracy. Deep learning frameworks are becoming increasingly potent instruments as well, especially for handling big datasets and identifying intricate linkages in the supply chain. This review provides a thorough resource for researchers and practitioners who wish to understand the advantages and disadvantages of various prediction modeling techniques in AI for SCM. It also highlights some noteworthy weaknesses, such as issues with data quality, model interpretability, and the requirement for domain-specific knowledge. Lastly, the synthesis of findings shows that although AI-driven prediction models can improve efficiency and responsiveness in SCM, their successful implementation requires careful consideration of organizational context and operational constraints.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to map the use of sweeteners in relevant packaged food categories and to assess and compare the nutrient profile of non-sugar (including sugar alcohol) vs. added sugar sweetened food products in Hungary. The foodDB software, developed by University of Oxford, enables automated online data collection, and was used to compile data of all foods and drinks available from four major Hungarian supermarket websites, selected by market share in March 2021. Only products containing either added sugar and/or non-sugar sweeteners were included in the study. These were categorized into 12 food groups using specific search terms. After data cleaning the final product number was 2016. 72% of the products was sweetened with added sugars only, 15% of them with non-sugar sweeteners only and 13% contained both sugars and non-sugar sweeteners. Chewing gums (92%), soft drinks (60%), energy drinks (50%) and pickles (35%) contained non-sugar sweeteners in the largest proportion. More than 90% of flavoured alcoholic beers, chocolate bars, breakfast cereals and yogurts were sweetened with added sugar only. Nine categories included food items containing multiple non-sugar sweeteners per product. The most common non-sugar sweeteners were acesulfame-potassium, sucralose, aspartame present in 15%, 10%, 9% of the total products respectively. Muesli bars with non-sugar sweeteners contained less energy but also less fibre than muesli bars with added sugars only; whereas pickles with non-sugar sweeteners contained less energy but were significantly higher in salt than those products with added sugars only. The presence of non-sugar sweeteners is widespread in the Hungarian food supply; however, their use does not guarantee a more beneficial nutrient profile.

However, the shift from linear to circular supply chains is still at an early stage and still needs more research. The current study seeks to test the direct effects of artificial intelligence‐based dynamic capabilities on frugal innovation and circular supply chains in a group of retail firms operating in Jordan. The current paper also aims to test the potential indirect effect of frugal innovation. To achieve these objectives, a research framework was developed that explains hypothesized relationships between the previous constructs and was tested empirically through a sample of 212 respondents from the top administrative level in these firms. The casual and quantitative approach was employed to test the hypothetical relationships, and the partial least squares‐structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) approach was employed as a tool to analyze the data. The empirical results reported through data analysis showed acceptance of all hypothesized relationships that were hypothesized in this study, as there was a positive effect of both artificial intelligence‐based dynamic capabilities and frugal innovation on circular supply chains. In addition, the mediation was statistically significant, as frugal innovation mediated the relationship between artificial intelligence‐based dynamic capabilities and circular supply chains. This study had a set of interesting contributions at the theoretical and the managerial contributions, as this paper is the first work in the body of the literature that explores these innovative relationships. The current paper also contributed to developing recommendations that would improve sustainable performance in the retail sector by enhancing its dynamic capabilities based on artificial intelligence tools, which leads to strengthening circular supply chains.</jats:p>",

Monitoring the water-energy nexus allows for optimal management of extracted water volumes and consumed energy. The Nabeul region of Tunisia was selected where 14 farmers, whose wells were equipped with smart electricity and water meters (SWEMs), for instant monitoring of pumped water volumes and the electrical energy required for irrigation. Monthly data over a period of eight months were used to study the variations in water volumes and active energy. The analysis of variance classified farmers into four groups based on water volumes and five groups based on active energy. Spatial variability analysis using kriging showed that the northeast zone is the most solicited in terms of water pumping and energy consumption with water volume exceeding 4,000 m3/month and active energy reaching 2,500 kWh/month. The prediction of energy based on water volume using machine learning techniques such as random forest and support vector machine was successfully conducted. The tools generated by the methodology were applied to a chosen case in the region to estimate active energy and validate the results obtained. The implemented framework allows for better management of groundwater resources for irrigation.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, HASEL actuators are driven by high-voltage (HV) power supplies, which are expensive to control accurately and difficult to scale up for multichannel applications, e.g., prostheses. This paper presents a low-cost HV power supply designed for HASEL applications that generates 2–10 kV DC at 5% of the cost of the existing HV power supplies used in HASEL actuators. At the core of our design, there is a new control strategy based on controlling the charging and discharging of the actuator from the supply’s low-voltage (LV) side rather than switching the HV side with expensive HV optocouplers. Discharge is achieved via a secondary transformer and multiplier circuit, generating a negative HV output capable of discharging the HASEL effectively and safely up to 10 kV.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rapid development of e-commerce in China, “live broadcast + e-commerce” has become an emerging mode of the e-commerce industry. The speedy growth of the digital economy has also provided a favorable external environment for fresh agricultural products to ride on the e-commerce express train. As a result, more and more suppliers of fresh agricultural products choose to sell their products on e-commerce platforms and conduct live streaming. This paper utilizes the e-commerce supply chain field survey data, takes tomato as the specific analyzed variety, and studies the revenue distribution pattern of each subject in the supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to explore the optimization strategy of the revenue distribution of an agricultural e-commerce supply chain, and the results show that the agricultural e-commerce supply chain effectively promotes the matching of supply and demand of medium- and high-end agricultural products, realizes the quality premium of medium- and high-end agricultural products, and significantly improves the overall revenue level of the supply chain. The field survey found that under the supply chain model of “farmers + cooperatives + e-commerce platform”, farmers, cooperatives, and e-commerce platforms gained $2865, $3098, and $1111, respectively, for operating one mu of tomatoes in a year. According to the traditional Shapley value method, from the point of view of the contribution to the cooperative income, part of the income of the farmers and cooperatives should be compensated to the e-commerce platform, and the specific results are as follows: the income of the farmers should be reduced from $2865 to $2729, the income of the cooperatives should be reduced from $3099 to $2955, and the income of the e-commerce platform should be increased from $1111 to $1390. According to the Shapley value method based on the risk coefficient correction, from the perspective of risk compensation, part of the earnings of the e-commerce platform should be compensated to farmers and cooperatives, so as to establish a more equitable and reasonable pattern of earnings distribution, with the specific results: the earnings of farmers should be increased to $3205, the earnings of cooperatives should be increased to $3148, and the earnings of the e-commerce platform should be reduced to $722.</jats:p>"

Particularly, it appears that there have not been studies on the relationship between supply chain channel strategy formulation within the agricultural industry in Nigeria. The lack of literature by scholars with respect to supply chain channel strategy in the agricultural industry to trigger innovations in channel techniques and strategies could properly be the root cause of ineffective marketing performance of agricultural products’ firms in terms of customer’s service, profitability and product availability. The researchers therefore sought to discuss this limitation, thereby bridging the acknowledged gap. Based on the objective of the study, a systematic survey was utilized to obtain information from 376 management staff of agricultural product enterprises, and three hypotheses were developed. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The results demonstrated a favorable and significant association between marketing success of agricultural product companies and channel management. It was concluded that if supply chain channel strategy is well implemented, there would be an increase in marketing performance as measured by client fulfillment, profitability and product availability. Considering the results, it was recommended that sales, supply chain and marketing managers should manage their supply chain channels by placing more emphasis on channel strategy.</jats:p>"

While I4.0 technologies hold immense potential for Business Model Innovation (BMI) and supply chain (SC) sustainability, a gap exists in understanding how firms can leverage BMI and SCS effectively. This study addresses this gap and explores the impact of implementing I4.0 on BMI and its effects on SC sustainability. Utilizing an exploratory case study approach, the research investigates an Indian automobile SC and highlights how I4.0 technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, analytics, and automation contribute to BMI, enhancing operational efficiency and SC sustainability. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of fostering collaboration among SC entities and the need for support from large‐scale manufacturers for the initial adoption of I4.0 technologies at the small‐scale supplier level. Based on these findings, the study develops the ‘I4.0‐enabled BMI for SC Sustainability’ framework, providing a structured approach for integrating I4.0 and BMI to enhance SC sustainability. This research investigates and applies Dynamic Capability (DC) theory to examine I4.0 transformations and contributes to DC theory by demonstrating how I4.0 facilitates BMI across the value chain, leading to improved sustainability performance.</jats:p>",

However, numerous organizations within the agrifood industry are struggling to incorporate sustainable supply chain management practices and address the concerns. Therefore, this research is designed to identify the key critical factors, such as drivers, enablers, and barriers to adopting sustainable practices. This study considers the Ethiopian coffee industry, which is an important sector not only for the Ethiopian economy but also for the global agrifood supply chain. To accomplish the objectives of this study, we applied a systematic literature review and empirical survey. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify critical factors for adopting sustainability in agrifood supply chains. An empirical survey was then undertaken in the Ethiopian coffee industry to rank the key critical factors. Hence, the study has revealed that economic and productivity improvement, cost effectiveness and improvement in the overall performance, and difficulty in mindset and cultural changes as the key critical factors that determine the adoption of sustainability initiatives from the perspectives of the Ethiopian coffee supply chain. The findings can be used as input by government regulatory bodies and policymakers to craft strategies and policies to adopt sustainability initiatives and ensure sustainable development. Furthermore, the research is expected to contribute to the existing literature by bringing in the perspective of suppliers in developing countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of China's national economy and the acceleration of urbanization, the production and life of society are increasingly dependent on power supply. Thus, how to ensure the safety and reliability of electric energy is becoming more and more important. It would cause substantial losses in case of a large‐scale blackout, which is what we need to avoid. The recovery speed of the power outage is one of the most vital core issue, fast recovery of power supply in the distribution network is a significant way of improving emergency disposal efficiency. In order to make full use of the emergency resources and improve the efficiency of distribution network emergency repair, this paper presents a coordinated optimal scheduling of emergency power supply vehicles and emergency repair teams in the case of multiple faults. First, the emergency repair disposal path optimization model is created, with the goal of minimizing emergency disposal time and outage losses. Second, an emergency power supply vehicle scheduling model is established, with the goal of maximizing the economic benefit. And the optimal dispatch model of the emergency power supply vehicle with the highest value of the recovery load is built by using the transfer strategy matrix. Finally, the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm is used to solve the optimization models in the IEEE33 node distribution network model. The results indicates that the optimized scheduling strategy considering the coordinated dispatch of emergency power supply vehicles and emergency repair teams can be obtained, and the validity of the proposed method is verified. © 2024 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This review examines how blockchain technology can be leveraged to enhance data privacy and security in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). As global supply chains become increasingly complex and the demand for sustainability grows, ensuring data privacy and security has become a critical concern. Traditional supply chain systems often face challenges such as data breaches, lack of transparency, and difficulty in tracing products and materials. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent architecture, offers a promising solution to these challenges. Blockchain can enhance data security by ensuring that data is tamper-proof, traceable, and encrypted, thus protecting sensitive information across the supply chain. It provides transparency while allowing permissioned access, ensuring that stakeholders can verify data without exposing confidential information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption allow verification of data without compromising its security. Smart contracts enable automated compliance with regulatory frameworks like GDPR, reducing the risk of human error and improving operational efficiency. The integration of blockchain in SSCM can improve traceability, transparency, and accountability, thereby promoting environmental and social sustainability. By tracking the origin and journey of goods, blockchain helps verify ethical sourcing practices and reduce carbon footprints. However, the technology also presents challenges, including scalability, integration with legacy systems, and cost considerations. Through case studies in industries such as food, textiles, and renewable energy, this review highlights the practical applications and benefits of blockchain for SSCM. It concludes that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize supply chain operations, but careful consideration must be given to overcoming its technical and financial barriers to widespread adoption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food wastage is a pervasive issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Approximately 40% of produced food goes to waste after harvest[1], while 10% of the world's population goes to bed hungry each night[2]. The food industry is also known to have some of the highest emissions, and the environmental impact from produce that gets wasted post-harvest is a significant overhead to the industry's carbon footprint. On these accounts, there is an imminent need to detect and reduce food loss. In an effort to reduce such loss, in this work, we ask the question: Can we use wireless technology to track the change in food quality and nutrition, post-harvest, as it travels through the global supply chain? Current methods for monitoring food quality are sparse and prone to manual error. Literature shows that moisture content in produce is a good proxy for quality and nutritionnutrition[3,12]. However, the inability to accurately and efficiently track moisture content at scale leads to substantial loss. To address this challenge, we propose FreshSense, a novel wireless sensing system that enables real-time, non-invasive monitoring of moisture content in produce as it moves through the supply chain.</jats:p>",

The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on supply chain management by offering insights into how fairness principles can be applied to improve the restoration of disrupted networks. A mixed-integer programming model was developed to simulate these fairness-based distribution strategies, focusing on a water supply chain network of a privet company in Saudi Arabia. The SCN consists of a single supplier and ten demand nodes, each requiring multiple commodities. The model was tested under 100 random disruption scenarios, each reducing the capacity of randomly selected network segments. The performance of each <jats:italic>fairness-based distribution</jats:italic> approach was evaluated based on how quickly and effectively the SCN returned to its required service levels (SLs) across all demand nodes. Results indicate that Fairness Distribution Type I, which aims to minimize unmet demand across the entire network, generally outperformed Type II in terms of speed and efficiency. Type I was more effective at restoring SLs quickly at most nodes, while Type II showed localized advantages, particularly in restoring SLs for specific commodities at select nodes. The study concludes that while Type I is more suited for overall supply chain recovery, Type II may be beneficial in scenarios requiring focused recovery at specific demand nodes. These findings provide actionable insights for supply chain managers seeking to enhance network resilience through <jats:italic>fairness-based distribution</jats:italic> strategies, and suggest avenues for future research on hybrid and context-specific approaches.</jats:p>",

The Author of the book is Dariusz Grala, a Colonel in the Polish Army, a Doctor of Engineering, and the current Dean of the Faculty of Management and Command at the Academy of War Studies.\nThe monograph introduces the reader to an extensive, erudite discourse at the intersection of political science research, security studies, and management and quality. The Author meticulously and logically discusses areas related to the security of military supply chains, which have previously been underexplored in the literature. The term \"security\" is understood here in various contexts, encompassing both states and processes that influence military supply chains. The Author highlights their role as a set of cooperating structures aimed at delivering goods essential for the execution of military training operations, operational activities, and combat missions.\nThe literature often encounters the term \"defence sector supply chains\"; however, in the military context, the perspective on the functioning of these supply chains has a broader and often sensitive significance. This \"sensitive\" nature of the security of military supply chains —understood from the intentions expressed in the Introduction — has become the subject of the Author's research, which integrates theories and practices from military logistics and supply chain management. The considerations focus on the processes occurring within these chains under various conditions. This approach is particularly important in the realm of security and defence, as civil supply chain publications often overlook, assuming it to be self-evident, the specific security considerations related to military needs. This publication, in a sense, bridges these two worlds.</jats:p>"

In general, the efficient use of remote sensing method and geographic information systems to monitor ecosystem services had received widespread recognition. Following this scenario, the current study used geospatial analysis with dasymetric method which was integrated with supply and demand formulas for ecosystem services provision, food availability, and remote sensing. Geographic information system was also used for land cover interpretation data. The results showed that three districts in Sukabumi Regency, namely Cicurug, Cibadak, and Cicantayan, had “exceeded” condition when the environmental condition already passed the threshold or were unable to support population's needs. Meanwhile, the other districts have “not exceeded” condition, when the environmental conditions were still able to fulfill the needs of population. Finally, the changes in agricultural land cover had a significant influence on the condition of ecosystem services.</jats:p>"

Coniferous extract, as the main component of the feed coniferous phytoadditive (FCA), obtained under low-temperature conditions, in addition to beneficial biologically active substances, contains phytoncides, which, when entering the digestive tract, release compounds that disinfect the incoming feed of the main diet. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of FCA on the fish-farming and biological parameters of growing bester fry using the technology of feeding sturgeon fish with combined starter feeds in recirculating aquaculture systems. Four groups (n=50) of bester fry with an initial live weight of 1.5 g were formed, which were fed FCA as part of the feed in the amount of 0 (control), 0.5; 1.5 and 3% of the feed weight. At the end of the growing period lasting 90 days, in the 3rd and 4th groups, versus the control, the final weight of bester fry increased by 14 (P&lt;0.001) and 35% (P&lt;0.001) and the fatness coefficient by 4.1 and 7.2%, while feed costs per 1 kg of live weight gain decreased by 13 and 27%, respectively. Сoncluded that the introduction of  FCA into the feed of bester fry in the amount of 3.0% by feed weight. has a positive effect on the fish-breeding and biological indicators of growing young bester in closed water supply systems.</jats:p>",

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis using data sourced from publicly available databases, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and reports from blockchain technology providers. Descriptive analysis identified supply chain disruptions (M = 3.74, SD = 1.17) as the most significant risk, followed by counterfeit parts (M = 3.34, SD = 1.20). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) demonstrated that part authentication and provenance tracking had the strongest impact on improving traceability (β = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001) and transparency (β = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001). A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) revealed a positive return on investment, with cost-benefit ratios up to 2.31. Blockchain adoption was also found to reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 25%, while improving operational efficiency through shorter procurement lead times and lower administrative costs. However, regulatory misalignment and interoperability challenges remain barriers to full adoption. The study concludes that blockchain is a transformative tool for enhancing traceability, security, and sustainability in aerospace supply chains.</jats:p>"

The paper introduces buyback and put option contracts to reduce inventory risk. These contracts were compared in three different cases via a numerical analysis approach. In the first case, the holding cost (h) of a retailer for surplus orders in the buyback contract is equal to the option price (o) in the put option model. The relationship between exercise price (e) in the put option model and buyback price (b) in the buyback contract was obtained by comparing the optimal values in the models. This study found that the exercise price in the put option contract will be greater than the buyback price. Furthermore, it is more likely that the retailer gave more benefits under the buyback agreement than the time the retailer chooses the put option contract. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the retailer chooses the buyback agreement in this situation, can gain more benefits. The study provides essential managerial insights to compare agreements and presents recommendations to choose a suitable contract.</jats:p>"

The analysis used a multiple regression model and found that exchange rate and money supply have a similar effect on inflation rates, with a statistical level of 0.01 and 0.05 respectively. The interest rate was not statistically significant. However, the exchange rate has a greater impact than the money supply. If the exchange rate increases by 1%, it results in an increase in the inflation rate of 22.107%, while a decrease results in a decrease. Conversely, if the money supply increases by 1%, it causes an increase in the inflation rate of 0.262%, and vice versa. This indicates that the exchange rate is the most significant factor affecting the inflation rate in Lao PDR. However, the constant value is negative and the statistical significance level is 0.01, suggesting that other factors may also reduce the inflation rate. Therefore, these factors should be considered for further researchers.</jats:p>"

In this study, we examine two types of IT supply chain (ITSC), namely, “Agenting Domestic Software” (Mode 1) and “Agenting Foreign Software” (Mode 2), each with a domestic developer/a foreign developer, a service provider, and client enterprises. In both modes, clients can either pay a high price to purchase software with accessorial pre‐sale service from the provider, or firsthand acquire it from the domestic developer at a low price but without pre‐sale service. We observe that in Mode 1, the domestic developer's market scale and the competition intensity of software have no effect on the domestic developer's decisions and profit; however, they have influences on the provider's decisions and profit. In Mode 2, the profits of ITSC members may increase with the intensity of software competition. When the domestic developer's market scale is small (large), and the domestic developer has (loses) the advantage of low extended‐warranty‐service (EWS) cost, Mode 1 (2) is more beneficial to the domestic developer than Mode 2 (1); however, the provider is more willing to choose Mode 2 (Mode 1).

However, the understanding of the flow process of ESs at the 1 km grid scale is still limited, especially in areas dominated by mineral resource development. The landscape in these areas has undergone significant changes due to mining activities. It is urgent to construct a regional management model that integrates the flow of ecosystem services and mine restoration. This study developed a framework that links ecosystem service flows (ESFs) and ecological security patterns (ESP) based on multi-source ecological monitoring data, constructed an ES supply-demand flow network through the flow properties, and determined the sequence and optimization strategies for mine rehabilitation to achieve integrated regional management. The results show that, except for food production (FP), other services were in surplus overall, mostly in synergistic relationships, but the spatial distribution of their supply and demand was not coordinated. Surplus areas were located mainly in the eastern woodlands, and deficit areas were located in the northwestern production agglomeration centers, suggesting that areas of supply-demand imbalance can be mitigated through ecological integration. Among these, water yield (WY) had a small number of sources and sinks and is limited in area range. Habitat quality (HQ) sources and sinks had the largest area coverage and the highest number. The distribution of ESF corridors, influenced by factors such as the number of sources and sinks, flow characteristics, and spatial resistance, varied significantly. HQ exhibited a more uniform distribution range, while WY had a longer average length of flow path. Overlaying ecological and mining factors, we identified ecological strategic spots, important supply areas, beneficiary areas, and mine priority restoration areas to further optimize the overall layout and rationally allocate the intrinsic structure of the patches based on ES supply and demand.</jats:p>"

This review explores the concept of marketing-driven supply chain innovation as a strategic framework for enhancing SME sustainability. By integrating consumer-centric marketing strategies with supply chain operations, SMEs can align their product offerings, sourcing practices, and logistics with growing consumer demand for environmentally and socially responsible products. The framework outlined in this study includes key components such as sustainable product design, green logistics, ethical sourcing, and the incorporation of circular economy principles. Additionally, technology-driven innovation, such as data analytics and digital platforms, is emphasized as a tool to improve supply chain transparency, reduce waste, and optimize resource utilization. Through these collaborative efforts, SMEs can foster stronger consumer trust, enhance brand loyalty, and build a competitive edge in the market. Despite the potential benefits, the review also discusses the challenges SMEs may face, including limited financial resources, resistance to organizational change, and balancing profitability with sustainability goals. However, by leveraging green financing options, cross-sector partnerships, and phased implementation strategies, SMEs can overcome these barriers. Ultimately, the integration of marketing-driven supply chain innovation is positioned as a critical path for FMCG SMEs to achieve long-term sustainability, profitability, and market competitiveness in an evolving global economy.\r\nKeywords: Marketing-Driven, Supply Chain, FMCG SME, Review.</jats:p>"

In order to further observe the influence of synchronicity of AA supply on the synthesis of protein in cell level, a cell culture experiment <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> was conducted with C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 myotubes were cultured for 24 h, meanwhile the culture medium was replaced for each 8 h. Those myotubes were subjected to 3 treatments (1 for controlled and 2 for tested), control myotubes were cultured with same normal complete medium within the whole 24 h, and the 2 tested myotubes were cultured with asynchronous amino acid supply medium in which the levels of different AAs (Lysine, threonine, methionine, leucine, valine and glutamic acid) either increased and then decreased or decreased and then increased, at different replaced medium time point (at 0, 8, and 16 h). However, during the whole experiment period all the 3 treated myotubes received same amount of each AA. The sample of the myotubes were used for myotube morphology, protein, AA, and proteomic analysis. The results showed that asynchronous AA nutrition affect the synthesis and degradation of myotube proteins, and the AAAS in the medium increase, thus decreasing the synthesis rate of myotube proteins (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05) and decreasing the diameter of myotubes (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &amp;lt; 0.05). The process of reduced protein synthesis affects the PI3K-AKT and FoxO signaling pathway by downregulating the levels of IRS1 and EGFR, and the degradation amplitude is greater than the synthesis amplitude. Therefore, this study further revealed the effect of the asynchronous supply of amino acids on myotube protein synthesis and the underlying mechanism and provided a theoretical reference for the precision of nutrition to animals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>We delve into the incorporation of demand information forecasting and the subsequent information sharing in a closed‐loop supply chain (CLSC). We consider the competition between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and an independent remanufacturer (IR). The OEM autonomously determines whether to forecast demand information and further considers whether to disseminate the realized demand signal to the IR. We find that the IR adopts either a partial‐ or a full‐remanufacturing strategy to compete with the OEM. The OEM shares negative demand signals with the IR, as such signals decrease the retail prices and increase the production quantity of all‐new products. Additionally, the sharing of negative demand signals helps alleviate the cannibalization effect caused by the introduction of remanufactured products. When examining the optimal sharing strategy in equilibrium, the OEM only invests in forecasting demand if the forecasting cost is relatively low. Furthermore, the numerical studies reveal that, in equilibrium, the OEM does not necessarily benefit from possessing more precise demand information. Additionally, we assess the influence of consumers' environmental awareness on the production decisions of both companies. The findings indicate that heightened environmental awareness prompts the IR to adopt a full‐remanufacturing strategy, and the information management strategies remain robust.</jats:p>",

This study assesses the current situation and outlook of the local industrial potato processing sector and the alignment of the industry’s variety requirements with the priorities set by breeders. Currently, potato processing companies in the three countries use both varieties selected locally from public international germplasm and varieties introduced by Dutch seed companies, and their suitability for processing is discussed as well. Overall, the processing industry pays high attention to traits affecting processing efficiency and consumers’ acceptance while breeders, in spite of being aware of the characteristics required for processing varieties, are more focused on traits related to production and disease resistance. As the processing sector develops further, breeders will have to pay increased attention to the progressively stricter requirements of the industry, striking the right balance between farmers’ and processors’ variety requirements. While their opinions on the farmers’ acceptability of processing varieties diverge, breeders and industry agree about the challenges represented by the limited access to quality seed and poor business linkages between value chain actors in securing the supply of varieties suitable for processing. Based on these findings, it is recommended to pay more attention to both the development of dual-purpose varieties and the strengthening of the potato value chain through the improvement of business linkages between seed producers, farmers, and processing companies.</jats:p>"

Fuzzy logic is the proper method to plan an input space into an output space using MATLAB's mathematical theory of fuzzy sets. The reason for using fuzzy logic is because it is related to uncertainty. The unstable demand for blood bags in hospitals makes the supply of blood bags excessive or lacking from demand. The lack of blood supply results in the unfulfilled demand for blood needed by the hospital, while the excess blood supply worsens the quality of blood. In this study, we will predict the number of bags produced using the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) method based on the minimum demand and maximum demand values and the minimum supply and maximum supply that produce output from the defuzzification process. Applying the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) method based on demand and supply data obtains optimal output with MATLAB in predicting the number of blood bags produced. The results of the study showed that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) fuzzy logic Mamdani error value was 24%, the accuracy value of the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) Mamdani in determining the number of blood bag production was 76%, and the production output generated through the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) Mamdani was 4,774 blood bags. The number of blood requests at the hospital is 4,443 blood bags, so the amount of blood that must be produced to meet the hospital's demand is 4,774 bags.</jats:p>"

To support managers making such decisions, we propose four mathematical formulations that, considering the uncertainty on the demand to satisfy, seek to optimize aid prepositioning (before the event) and further distribution (after the event) in order to minimize unmet demand (MUD). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare the performance of these formulations on a real case to discuss when and why should each approach be applied.Design/methodology/approach: The two first formulations adopt the cardinality-constrained (CC) approach to handle uncertainty. These formulations differ in their objective functions, the first formulation’s objective seeks to MUD, whilst the second incorporates equity in the way that demand is satisfied. The two remaining formulations are scenario-based (SB) and as in the previous two formulations, seek to MUD with and without equity considerations, respectively.Findings: Applying our formulations to a case study, we compare the differences between the solutions produced by the proposed formulations and the solutions that would have been produced without uncertainty (perfect information) to have a better understanding of their performance and their behavior. A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each model is provided to help managers choose the model that best suits their needs.Originality/value: The formulations are applied to a case study where a food bank is faced with the arrival of a hurricane in Mexico. As far as our knowledge, it is the first work in literature to deal with humanitarian logistics under a cardinality-constrained approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the dawn of the 21st century, supply chains (SCs) have faced an array of unprecedented challenges, encompassing economic volatility, escalating geopolitical conflicts, intensified trade disputes, and persistent environmental degradation. These challenges have imposed immense pressures on SCs, amplifying both the risks and occurrences of disruptions. In response to these critical demands, there has been a substantial increase in academic, industrial, and governmental focus on the resilience and recovery capabilities of SCs. In this context, the supply chain (SC) for sewage treatment equipment has been significantly affected. This study aims to systematically investigate collaborative strategies and mechanisms for bolstering the resilience of manufacturing SCs within the sewage treatment sector, with particular attention to collaborative decision-making, information sharing, and risk mitigation throughout the SC lifecycle. Following a comparative analysis of various methodologies, this paper employed the structural equation model (SEM) and subsequently conducted a comprehensive survey of manufacturers specializing in glass fiber sewage treatment systems, yielding 385 valid responses. Through this data, a structural equation model was developed to analyze pathways for resilience enhancement. A thorough analysis of the results indicates that Supply Chain Collaboration (SCC) and collaborative decision-making are instrumental in strengthening Glass Fiber Sewage Treatment Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) through the implementation of effective information sharing and risk management practices. These findings contribute to the theoretical framework of SCC and SCR by clarifying the influence of collaborative practices while also providing practical guidance for the governance and strategic management of sewage treatment equipment enterprises and their associated SCs. The conclusions drawn from this study can guide us in establishing a more resilient and sustainable SC ecosystem, making it more directive and capable of mitigating complex disruptions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>The emergence of the circular economy (CE) paradigm is a key driver in steering industrial sectors towards sustainability. The formulation of a robust circularity strategy depends on a comprehensive assessment, which is closely related to the overarching goal of managing the transition to circularity. The initial phase of transition within the healthcare sector reinforces the need to seamlessly integrate CE principles. It is therefore imperative to define and carefully monitor indicators that will help assess and improve sustainability, operational efficiency, supply chain resilience and stakeholder satisfaction, including both consumers and patients. The primary objective of this research is to prioritize relevant performance indicators that will be critical in measuring the effectiveness of the transition to a circular economy within the healthcare supply chain. To achieve this objective, the study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established methodology known for its effectiveness in solving complex multi-criteria challenges. The AHP is used to prioritize performance indicators that facilitate the management of the circular economy transition in the healthcare supply chain. The focus is on improving the quality of care, optimizing delivery efficiency, and emphasizing environmental sustainability within the healthcare paradigm. The methodological framework includes the identification of key main criteria covering environmental, social, economic, and logistical dimensions. These criteria are further refined with the inclusion of 14 sub-criteria, resulting in a list of 16 key performance indicators (KPIs). Additionally, the study proposes an alternative business model advocating for the implementation of the Circular Supply Chain Operation Reference Model (circular SCOR). This model offers a perspective for rapid change in supply chain processes towards circular transition within the healthcare system. The final stage of the research involves verifying the results through sensitivity analysis and correlation mapping of the indicator results with the Circular SCOR model. This process helps organizations refine their performance measurement protocols, enhancing their capacity for effective evaluation and strategic decision-making within the circular economy framework. This comprehensive approach enables healthcare organizations to proactively contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future while maintaining a focus on quality care for patient well-being.</jats:p>",

Most of residential buildings in Germany are heated with natural gas (50 %), 25 % with an oil. Around 45 % of the heating systems are older than 15 years, 20,5 % are even older than 25 years. Therefore, a high replacement rate is to be expected in the next few years. In the context of circular economy, the accumulating materials should remain in the material cycle. Some materials, such as metals, can be recycled easily. However, building services engineering, in particular heat supply, has become increasingly complex. This paper focuses on the state of the circular economy of heat supply systems for buildings. Firstly, a detailed examination of products utilized in heat supply systems is undertaken. Secondly, an assessment of the end-of-life scenarios for these components was conducted, considering disposal routes and recycling rates. Lastly, an evaluation of assessment systems fostering a circular economy regarding heat supply systems is performed. The aim of the work is to provide an overview of the state of the art with regard to circular economy in heat supply and thereby draw conclusions as to where potentials and obstacles exist.</jats:p>",

Consequently, organisations have been facing many troubles in different echelons of their supply chains, such as high inventory stockouts or unplanned supply and recovery costs, significantly affecting their performance and stability. Accordingly, strategists must acknowledge enterprise and supply chain resilience as a vital competence in organisational strategies and ploys to guide decision-makers when dealing with disruptive events. This work aims to help organisations develop a powerful approach for testing and improving a decision-making process to minimise stockouts, through a simulation game that considers essential supply chain components, such as suppliers, products, and disruptive events, coexisting in a dynamic system. Upon implementing the proposed game within an organisation, the main expected outcomes include: (i) enhanced decision-making capabilities; (ii) increased awareness and preparedness to address disruptive events; (iii) improved practical understanding of resilient supply chain management practices; (iv) cost-effective training and awareness-building; and (v) repetitive learning opportunities, thereby enhancing supply chain management and resilience. The game’s simplicity is crucial to ensure that this tool remains accessible and practical for its intended audience, as excessive complexity may potentially discourage its use.</jats:p>"

The results indicated that SSCM and eco‐innovation positively impact environmental performance, but dynamic capabilities have negatively influenced environmental performance. Additionally, dynamic capabilities and eco‐innovation mediate the relationship between SSCM and eco‐innovation, and institutional support moderates the relationships positively. These results will enhance the theoretical base in supply chain management literature by exploring the role of SSCM in environmental performance.

Governments are enacting increasingly stringent environmental regulations; consequently, industries must reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains. Our research investigates the barriers to implementing a GSC in the agriculture equipment manufacturing industries (AEMI). This research aims to discover and prioritize the barriers that impede the implementation of sustainable supply chain strategies in the AEMI. Through an in-depth literature review, contributions from experts, and empirical analysis, seventy-one barriers are identified across ten categories. The top barrier in each category is determined using the Delphi approach. The Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS) method creates an exhaustive framework that evaluates and ranks these barriers. The top five barriers are the lack of an environmental partnership with buyers and suppliers, the design complexity when reusing or recycling old goods or products, carbon emissions, paint shop emissions, lack of environmental education and training professionals that lack the necessary skills and less manpower available for the greening supply chain. This framework facilitates decision-makers to organize resources and create effective strategies for overcoming identified barriers. In addition, we proposed a blockchain IoT integrated architecture and strategies. This integrated architecture and strategies will help to mitigate all GSC barriers. It also increases the supply chain's transparency, traceability and effectiveness, fostering sustainability practices and reducing environmental impacts. Blockchain and IoT facilitate real-time data collaboration, computerized transactions and the implementation of smart contracts, thereby enhancing cooperation, trust and collaboration among stakeholders. Implementing GSC practices enables manufacturers to reduce waste and increase productivity, thereby saving funds. In addition, adopting sustainable practices improves these industries' reputation and brand image among environmentally conscious customers, investors and other stakeholders.</jats:p>"

To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there is a deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system is still existing due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health Engineering department.</ns3:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasingly restrictive environmental regulations for the maritime sector have led shipping companies to look for technological alternatives to reduce emissions. This article introduces a methodology to analyse emission reductions of ships in port by incorporating batteries into the ships or using an onshore power supply system. These have not yet been considered together for comparison or with a focus on ship operation. The aim is to avoid the use of auxiliary engines in ports. First, the cost calculation method to be used is specified; then, the engine’s behaviour and the established basic navigation criteria are analysed; and finally, different alternatives are considered. A methodology is afterwards defined for selecting alternatives, comparing their costs with those of using auxiliary engines in port. As an example, it is applied to a Ro-Ro route between the ports of Montoir (France) and Vigo (Spain). The results indicate that incorporating batteries into the ship produces greater savings in annual costs than onshore power supply. The cost savings from onshore power supply depend on the range of prices in each port. However, the greatest emission savings are obtained by using the onshore power supply. This methodology can be extrapolated to other routes and vessels by incorporating real operating data.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the FDA lacks a formal approach for reviewing food additives and GRAS substances already found in the food supply. Substances in the food supply thus include innocuous ingredients (e.g., black pepper), those that are harmful at high levels (e.g., salt), those that are of questionable safety (e.g., potassium bromate), and those that are unknown to the FDA and the public. </jats:p><jats:p> A recent court decision codified these gaps in the FDA’s current approach, leaving states to try to fill the regulatory void.

While Malaysia has advanced in sustainability overall, incorporating OSH into broader social responsibility strategies remains underdeveloped. This paper argues that protecting worker well-being is essential for sustainable supply chains, directly contributing to social sustainability and economic performance. The study examines the ethical, legal, and business justifications for prioritizing OSH in supply chain management. It draws upon international human rights declarations, treaties, and conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the ILO's Occupational Safety and Health Convention, to underscore the fundamental right to a safe and healthy work environment. This model developed through analysis of existing literature and policy frameworks, aims to guide a more comprehensive approach to OSH management within Malaysian supply chains. By analyzing these frameworks, the paper highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that aligns OSH with international standards and sustainable development goals. Ultimately, it advocates for a more resilient and equitable supply chain framework in Malaysia, where worker well-being is central to sustainable business practices.</jats:p>"

One of the biggest practical challenges has been to achieve greater data sharing throughout the agrifood system and the supply chain, both to inform other stakeholders about a product and equally to incentivise greater environmental sustainability. In this paper, a data sharing architecture is described built on three principles (a) reuse of existing semantic standards; (b) integration with legacy systems; and (c) a distributed architecture where stakeholders control access to their own data. The system has been developed based on the requirements of commercial users and is designed to allow queries across a federated network of agrifood stakeholders. The Ploutos semantic model is built on an integration of existing ontologies. The Ploutos architecture is built on a discovery directory and interoperability enablers, which use graph query patterns to traverse the network and collect the requisite data to be shared. The system is exemplified in the context of a pilot involving commercial stakeholders in the processed fruit sector. The data sharing approach is highly extensible with considerable potential for capturing sustainability related data.</jats:p>",

Second, this study investigates the moderating influence of reverse supply chain management (RSCM) to sense how these forces may impact the association between CSR and SD. After evaluation and by implementing a structural approach, the results affirmed the positive linkages between CSR and SD along with each CSR's dimension toward sustainable development. Finally, the study confirmed a positive connection of RSCM as a moderator between CSR and SD.

Given the fact that most small island developing states (SIDS) are isolated and surrounded by large bodies of water, the medium of seawater becomes an infinite supply. However, SIDS are also low lying and therefore only low heads will be available at high flows to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, ANSYS Fluent, was used to simulate this SPHS pump turbine impeller at low heads and high flows. This pump turbine impeller was simulated to function as both a pump and as a turbine at various revolutions per minute (rpm). The performance of the system was evaluated based on the pressure and velocity distributions of the pump turbine impeller at varying rpm. It was found that there were less energy losses within the turbine mode compared to the pump mode. Furthermore, this study showcases that the CFD model ANSYS Fluent is an economical, efficient, and easily diagnosable technique for analysing an impeller in both pump and turbine modes.</jats:p>",

Particularly, BI technology can increase the SCM of enterprises in the consumer products sector by providing value-added and financial gains, enabling speedy industry adoption and rapid industry growth. The study employed a quantitative methodology for gathering data, and a simple random sampling method was employed to prevent sample bias. The study considered linear curve estimation (LCE) as a method of data analysis. The results of the model estimations showed that BI recorded positive and significant influence on SC visibility, flexibility, and resilience in the Nigerian consumer goods sector. The study concludes that BI increased the effectiveness of supply chain management (SCM) by improving visibility, anticipating demand, increasing resilience, optimising processes, and boosting productivity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimizing food and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) supply chains is crucial for enhancing efficiency and responsiveness in today’s dynamic market. This paper presents a dual approach integrating behavioral finance insights with big data analytics to refine strategic decision-making processes. Behavioral finance provides valuable understanding of how psychological factors and biases influence decision-making among supply chain stakeholders. By analyzing patterns such as overreaction to market trends or herd behavior, companies can anticipate and mitigate irrational decision-making that may lead to inefficiencies and supply chain disruptions. Big data analytics, on the other hand, enables organizations to process and analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, including sales figures, inventory levels, and consumer behavior. Advanced analytics techniques, such as predictive modeling and machine learning, offer actionable insights into demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization. Integrating these insights with behavioral finance principles allows for a more comprehensive approach to managing supply chain risks and opportunities. This dual approach supports strategic decision-making by addressing both the human and data-driven aspects of supply chain management. For instance, understanding cognitive biases can help in designing better forecasting models and inventory policies, while big data analytics can provide real-time insights to correct course deviations and align supply with actual demand patterns. The synergy between these methodologies enhances overall supply chain resilience, reduces costs, and improves service levels. The paper discusses practical applications of this integrated approach, including case studies where companies have successfully employed behavioral finance principles alongside big data analytics to optimize their supply chains. It also highlights the challenges and considerations in implementing this dual strategy, offering recommendations for best practices and future research directions.</jats:p>"

Zied Babai</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper examines a supply chain network focusing on the distribution of fresh agricultural products, incorporating outsourcing and stochastic demands considerations. Initially, we establish a generalized Nash equilibrium model with stochastic demands among fresh produce firms. Subsequently, we transform this model into a mixed complementarity system using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Utilizing the Fischer–Burmeister function, we further convert the mixed complementarity system into a set of nonlinear equations, amenable to solution via GAMS software. We conduct numerical experiments and perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters. Our findings suggest that higher subsidy rates incentivize firms towards production outsourcing, particularly benefiting low-income farmers, thereby potentially increasing profits. Moreover, market fluctuations play a pivotal role in ensuring the stability and profitability of firms, with moderate fluctuations presenting opportunities for fresh enterprises to adapt, innovate and capitalize on evolving market conditions. These results offer valuable insights for effective management of fresh produce supply chains.</jats:p>"

The integration of climate data into the simulation model reveals significant insights into the resilience of different sweet potato varieties, particularly highlighting the suitability of yellow-skinned sweet potatoes for harsh climates due to their high resilience and drought resistance. However, market preferences still favor white-skinned varieties despite their vulnerability to climate extremes. The DES model identifies key bottlenecks, particularly in cultivation and transportation, that hinder supply chain efficiency. To address these challenges, the study emphasizes the importance of targeted interventions, such as improving access to irrigation, strengthening pest management, and adopting community-based resource-sharing approaches. These strategies are critical for enhancing both the resilience and efficiency of the supply chain. Additionally, the study highlights the urgent need for adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of drought on agricultural productivity, especially in regions that heavily rely on crops like sweet potatoes.

The study proposes a methodological approach to defining a UGI, conceived as a network of areas connected by urban ecological corridors and suitable for providing climate regulation, flood risk mitigation, outdoor recreation, and biodiversity and habitat quality enhancement. The methodology is applied to the functional urban area (FUA) of the City of Cagliari, Italy. The analysis results show that areas with high values of climate regulation, carbon storage and sequestration, and habitat quality enhancement are particularly suitable to be part of a UGI. Although values for outdoor recreation appear to be less significant, the provision of this service is particularly relevant within the Cagliari FUA. However, areas characterized by high values of flood risk mitigation show a different behavior, which highlights how the presence of impermeable surface within urban areas is associated with a loss of patch connectivity.</jats:p>"

The PES encounters switching transients that require a dependable external power source. Usually, a power supply system utilizes an isolation transformer and many magnetic rings. However, the existence of inconsistent parameters might easily cause an imbalance in load power, which could potentially result in power supply failure for the loads. Therefore, to enhance the reliability of power supply, this study proposes a load constant voltage self‐balancing design approach that utilizes feedback circuits to achieve stability and balance in load voltage. At first, two feedback circuits are shown, and the analytical formulas for load active power and load voltage are derived. Moreover, a parameter design methodology is shown for the equivalent circuit of the magnetic rings in the power supply. Additionally, a power supply system is built with 24 V outputs. In conclusion, this study utilizes simulations and tests to assess the effectiveness of the proposed power supply system by analysing its performance during start‐up, load power‐off, and steady‐state operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nutrition is a cornerstone of early childhood development, influencing cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional growth, and shaping long-term educational outcomes. This systematic review, based on 45 peer-reviewed studies, follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to examine the impact of nutritional interventions on educational metrics in children aged 0–8 years. The findings reveal that micronutrient supplementation, particularly iron, iodine, and zinc, significantly enhances cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving. School meal programs demonstrate dual benefits by improving nutritional intake and academic performance, particularly in marginalized communities. Longitudinal studies highlight the enduring effects of early nutritional interventions, showing improvements in educational attainment and socio-economic mobility. However, socio-economic determinants, such as household income, parental education, and food security, continue to perpetuate disparities in nutritional access and educational opportunities. The review also identifies significant challenges in implementing and sustaining nutritional policies, including logistical barriers and funding constraints, while highlighting innovative solutions such as technology-driven interventions and community-based approaches. This study underscores the necessity of integrating nutrition-focused programs with educational and socio-economic policies to address systemic inequalities and improve outcomes for children globally. Future research should explore the intergenerational impacts of nutritional interventions and leverage technological advancements for scalable and sustainable solutions.</jats:p>"

This study integrates the HCPP, residents’ health, and labor supply time into a unified analytical framework. Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) spanning the period 2011–2020 and leveraging the quasi-natural experiment provided by China’s 2016 HCPP, we empirically investigate its effects on labor supply time among middle-aged and elderly workers. Our findings indicate: (1) HCPP increases average weekly working hours by 2.834 h in pilot cities. (2) HCPP significantly enhances residents’ health status in pilot cities, extending their healthy time. (3) Middle-aged and elderly workers allocate more of their extended healthy time to labor rather than leisure, potentially influenced by traditional Chinese perceptions of “ceaseless toil”. (4) The impact of HCPP on labor supply time exhibits group heterogeneity, with stronger promotion effects observed among vulnerable middle-aged and elderly groups characterized by older age, rural household registration, lower educational attainment, and lower income levels. This research offers insights for policymakers aiming to optimize health policies and promote sustainable development within Chinese society.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The performance of food and beverage manufacturing companies has become a pressing concern due to the rising incidence of supply chain disruptions, which pose significant threats to achieving operational goals. This study investigates the influence of supply chain diversification on the performance of large food and beverage processing companies in Nairobi City County. Supply chain disruptions have been linked to severe financial repercussions, including lower stock returns and increased failure rates, necessitating innovative management strategies. Utilizing a quantitative correlational research design, the study surveyed all 46 major food and beverage companies in the region, targeting procurement, financial, operations, and supply chain managers. Data collection was conducted via questionnaires, achieving an impressive response rate of 81%, underscoring the representativeness of the findings. Statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between supply chain diversification and organizational performance, with an R-squared value of 0.650, indicating that approximately 65% of performance variability could be attributed to diversification practices. Regression analysis confirmed that each unit increase in diversification significantly enhanced performance metrics. These results align with existing literature, emphasizing the need for proactive diversification strategies to mitigate risks and enhance operational efficiency. Recommendations include continuous investment in diversifying supplier bases, adopting advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, and implementing regular training programs for staff. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with suppliers and routine assessments of risk management policies are vital for maintaining competitive advantages. This research highlights the critical role of supply chain diversification in enhancing performance in the food and beverage sector, providing insights that are essential for navigating the complexities of modern supply chains. Future research should explore comparative studies across different sectors, longitudinal impacts of diversification, and qualitative insights from industry leaders to further enrich understanding in this area.

This review explores the intersection of these two critical areas, demonstrating how their integration can drive both business growth and environmental responsibility. Green marketing, which focuses on promoting eco-friendly products and sustainable business practices, has become a key tool for FMCG SMEs to differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace. By adopting strategies such as eco-friendly packaging, ethical sourcing, and transparency in communicating sustainability efforts, SMEs can build stronger consumer trust, foster brand loyalty, and meet the growing demand for environmentally conscious products. Simultaneously, sustainable supply chain practices ensure that the production, distribution, and logistics processes align with environmental and social goals. These practices include reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, and working closely with suppliers to ensure ethical sourcing of materials. The synergy between green marketing and sustainable supply chains creates a feedback loop where operational sustainability supports marketing efforts, and consumer demand for green products encourages further sustainability improvements. This review also examines the challenges FMCG SMEs face in aligning these strategies, such as cost barriers, regulatory compliance, and supply chain complexity. Through case studies and industry examples, it highlights how innovative technology and stakeholder collaboration can help overcome these challenges. Ultimately, this study underscores that integrating green marketing and sustainable supply chain practices is not only essential for addressing environmental concerns but also for enhancing competitive positioning, customer satisfaction, and long-term market success in the FMCG sector. Recommendations for SMEs on how to effectively align their marketing and supply chain sustainability efforts are also provided.\r\nKeywords:  Green Marketing, Supply Chain, FMCG SMEs, Review.</jats:p>"

This is also very strategic amid the enactment of the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation, which prohibits products from deforestation from entering the European market. As part of a Palm Oil Mill (POM) supply chain, it is crucial to trace the origin/history of oil palm plantations that sourced Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB), one of which is in West Kalimantan. Literature studies and interpretations of Landsat images per year were conducted to obtain information on the origin of land status, land use history, and land cover development of the plantations sourcing the FFB. We found that the land status of POM and all its FFB suppliers is 100% classified as Other Land Uses. The previous land uses of the plantations were 100% community plantations with land covers dominated by tall shrubs. This is consistent with the interpretation of the Landsat imagery. Traceability of the land use history of the large private holdings supplying FFB to POM indicated that 100% of the area was formerly community plantations and were no longer primary forests. These findings provide evidence for the sustainable certification of palm oil by showing that the land utilized for oil palm plants did not contribute to deforestation.</jats:p>",

Methods This study was conducted in Pakistan’s food processing sector. The respondents included 495 managers working in the food processing industry. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach is used to examine direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The originality of this study lies in integration of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and dynamic capability theory (DCT) to understand sustainable practices in the context of the provided model. Results This study highlights that GSCM, GTI, WM, and BDAC-AI have positive, strong, and direct impacts on SP. Furthermore, GTI and WM only partially mediate the link between GSCM and SP, whereas the two moderate the link. In addition, BDAC-AI had a moderating effect on the relationship between GTI and SP. This study has managerial implications, including strategies that involve the use of theoretical frameworks for technological acceptance and dynamic capabilities to support sustainable initiatives. However, it is worth noting that the findings provide a practical contingency for managers and businesses interested in implementing green studies effectively, improving technologies, and strengthening sustainable performance capabilities. Conclusions The study extends the literature by establishing a model for operationalizing GSCM in the food processing sector. Furthermore, it adds value in that it first integrates TAM and DCT to explain sustainable operations and their impact on organizations. Furthermore, it extends the existing literature by establishing a relationship between GSCM and SC. It offers a model through which GSCM can be operationalized in the context of the FS sector.</ns4:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The glutamate-glutamine cycle is thought to be the principle metabolic pathway that recycles glutamate at excitatory synapses. In this cycle, synaptically released glutamate is sequestered by astrocytes and converted to glutamine before being returned to the presynaptic terminal for conversion back into glutamate to replenish the neurotransmitter pool. While many aspects of this cycle have been extensively studied, a key component remains unknown: the nature of the transporter responsible for the presynaptic uptake of glutamine. We hypothesise that neurotransmitter transporter 4 (NTT4/<jats:italic>SLC6A17</jats:italic>) plays this role. Accordingly, we generated NTT4 knockout mice to assess its contribution to presynaptic glutamine transport and synaptic glutamate supply. Using biochemical tracing of [1-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C] glucose and [1,2-<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C] acetate in awake mice, we observe a reduction of neuronal glutamate supply when NTT4 is absent. In addition, direct electrical recording of hippocampal mossy fibre boutons reveals a presynaptic glutamine transport current that is entirely inhibited by genetic or pharmacological elimination of NTT4. The role of NTT4 in neurotransmission was demonstrated by electrophysiological recordings in acute hippocampal slices, which reveal that NTT4 is required to maintain vesicular glutamate content and to sustain adequate levels of glutamate supply during periods of high-frequency neuronal activity. Finally, behavioural studies in mice demonstrate a deficit in trace fear conditioning; a hippocampus-dependent memory paradigm, and abnormalities in nest building, anxiety behaviour, and social preference. These results demonstrate that NTT4 is a presynaptic glutamine transporter which is a central component of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. NTT4 and hence the glutamate-glutamine cycle maintain neuronal glutamate supply for excitatory neurotransmission during high-frequency synaptic activity, and are key regulators of memory retention and normal behaviour.</jats:p>"

Ответом на динамичные экономические условия и ужесточающиеся экологические стандарты является совершенствование подходов к ценообразованию. Настоящая статья посвящена анализу соответствующих тенденций и методических принципов, направленных на повышение не только финансовой результативности, но и функциональной эффективности предприятий коммунального комплекса. Аргументируются преимущества использования разнообразных стратегий тарифной политики, включая экономически рациональные методы, стимулирующие практики и метод RAB (метод регулируемой базы инвестируемого капитала). Особый акцент сделан на рассмотрении передовых технологий и децентрализации управления как инструментов для повышения эффективности в данном секторе. Исследование показывает, что многогранная политика, объединяющая обоснованные тарифы, активное регулирование и новейшие технологии, становится основой для устойчивого роста и улучшения сервиса в области водоснабжения и водоотведения. Эти меры способны поддерживать эффективную и долгосрочную работу коммунальной инфраструктуры. Будущие исследования могли бы сфокусироваться на создании объединенных моделей тарификации, которые бы принимали во внимание региональные условия и конкретные потребности разнообразных потребительских групп. В дополнение к этому особое внимание следует направить на интеграцию цифровых инноваций в практику тарифного регулирования, что увеличит его прозрачность и результативность. Данная статья будет интересна специалистам в области коммунального хозяйства, экономистам, управляющим компаниями водоснабжения и водоотведения, а также представителям органов государственной власти, занимающимся вопросами тарифного регулирования и стратегического планирования в секторе жилищно-коммунального хозяйства.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Cost management of services in the housing and utilities sector, especially in the field of water supply and wastewater disposal, plays a crucial role in ensuring their reliability and high quality. The answer to dynamic economic conditions and tightening environmental standards is to improve approaches to pricing. This article is devoted to the analysis of relevant trends and methodological principles aimed at improving not only the financial performance but also the functional efficiency of utility companies. The advantages of using a variety of tariff policy strategies are argued, including economically rational methods, incentive-based practices and the RAB method. Particular emphasis is placed on the consideration of advanced technologies and decentralized management as tools for improving efficiency in the sector. The study shows that multifaceted policies combining reasonable tariffs, active regulation and the latest technologies are becoming the basis for sustainable growth and improved service in the water and wastewater sector. Future research could focus on the development of unified tariff models that take into account regional conditions and the specific needs of diverse consumer groups. In addition, special attention should be paid to integrating digital innovations into tariff regulation practices to increase transparency and efficiency. This article will be of interest to utility specialists, economists, water supply and wastewater management companies, as well as representatives of public authorities dealing with tariff regulation and strategic planning in the housing and utilities sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>City manufacturing has once again become one of the priority areas for the sustainable development of smart cities thanks to the use of a wide range of green technologies and, first of all, additive technologies. Shortening the supply chain between producers and consumers has significant effects on economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Zoning of city multifloor manufacturing (CMFM) in areas with a compact population in large cities in the form of clusters with their own city logistics nodes (CLNs) creates favorable conditions for promptly meeting the needs of citizens for goods of everyday demand and for passenger and freight transportation. City multifloor manufacturing clusters (CMFMCs) have been already studied quite a lot for their possible uses; nevertheless, an identified research gap is related to supply chain design efficiency concerning CMFMCs. Thus, the main objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of lean supply chain management (LSCM) as the integrated application of lean manufacturing (LM) approaches and I4.0 technologies for customer-centric value stream management based on eliminating all types of waste, reducing the use of natural and energy resources, and continuous improvement of processes related to logistics activities. This paper presents a decision support model for LSCM in CMFMCs, which is a mathematical deterministic model. This model justifies the minimization of the number of road transport transfers within the urban area and the amount of stock that is stored in CMFMC buildings and in CLNs, and also regulating supplier lead time. The model was verified and validated using appropriately selected test data based on the case study, which was designed as a typical CMFM manufacturing system with various parameters of CMFMCs and urban freight transport frameworks. The feasibility of using the proposed model for value stream mapping (VSM) and managing logistics processes and inventories in clusters is discussed. The findings can help decisionmakers and researchers improve the planning and management of logistics processes and inventory in clusters, even in the face of unexpected disruptions.</jats:p>"

This review explores the influence of supply chain agility on marketing flexibility and customer satisfaction in FMCG SMEs. Supply chain agility, characterized by responsiveness, adaptability, and real-time decision-making, enables SMEs to respond quickly to market shifts, optimize operations, and deliver products efficiently. As a result, agile supply chains directly impact the marketing flexibility of SMEs by enabling faster product launches, customization, and rapid adjustments to promotional strategies based on market feedback. This also highlights how marketing flexibility, supported by agile supply chains, enhances customer satisfaction by meeting expectations related to product availability, quality, and service delivery. Agile supply chains allow FMCG SMEs to reduce stockouts, improve order fulfillment times, and adapt to customer preferences, creating a seamless experience that fosters brand loyalty. Furthermore, this review presents case studies of FMCG SMEs that have successfully implemented agile supply chains to boost marketing responsiveness and customer satisfaction, demonstrating real-world applications of these strategies. By examining the interrelationship between supply chain agility, marketing flexibility, and customer satisfaction, this review emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach to operations and marketing in FMCG SMEs. The findings suggest that investing in supply chain agility is critical for SMEs seeking to enhance their market adaptability and customer-centricity. The study concludes by offering recommendations for FMCG SMEs to develop agile supply chains that enable them to thrive in a competitive and ever-evolving marketplace, where customer satisfaction and rapid market response are key drivers of success.\r\nKeywords: Supply Chain, FMCG SME, Marketing Flexibility, Review.</jats:p>"

At the same time, buildings cause 30% of final energy use, 18% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), and about 65% of material accumulation globally. With electrification and higher energy efficiency of buildings, material‐related emissions gain relevance. The circular economy (CE) strategies, <jats:italic>narrow, slow, and close</jats:italic>, together with wooden buildings, can reduce material‐related emissions. We provide a comprehensive set of building stock transformation scenarios for 10 world regions until 2060, using the resource efficiency climate change model of the stock–flow–service nexus and including the full CE spectrum plus wood‐intensive buildings. The 2020–2050 global cumulative new construction ranges from 150 to 280 billion m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for residential and 70‐120 billion m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> for non‐residential buildings. Ambitious CE reduces cumulative 2020–2050 primary material demand from 80 to 30 gigatons (Gt) for cement and from 35 to 15 Gt for steel. Lowering floor space demand by 1 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> per capita leads to global savings of 800‐2500 megatons (Mt) of cement, 300‐1000 Mt of steel, and 3‐10 Gt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq, depending on industry decarbonization and CE roll‐out. Each additional Mt of structural timber leads to savings of 0.4‐0.55 Mt of cement, 0.6‐0.85 Mt of steel, and 0.8‐1.8 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq of system‐wide GHGE. CE reduces 2020–2050 cumulative GHGE by up to 44%, where the highest contribution comes from the <jats:italic>narrow</jats:italic> CE strategies, that is, lower floorspace and lightweight buildings.

The role of these audits in propelling sustainability efforts within corporations is the subject of this study. To make sure a business is in line with regulations and finds ways to improve, it can get an impartial opinion by having a third party conduct an environmental audit. The impact of these audits on business practices and sustainability is investigated in this paper through an analysis of case studies and empirical data. Based on the results, it seems that third-party audits help improve environmental performance by encouraging responsibility and constant development. Better resource efficiency, less waste, and reduced emissions are common outcomes of audited companies' adoption of more stringent environmental management systems. In addition, third-party audits boost stakeholder trust—an essential quality for a company's public image and the faith of its investors—due to the audits' impartiality and reliability. The thoroughness of the audit, the auditors' knowledge and experience, and the firm's resolve to follow audit recommendations are the three most important variables that determine how useful these audits will be. Concerns raised by the research include the possibility of superficial compliance and the necessity for uniform audit frameworks to permit comparison and uniformity throughout businesses.  Because they offer an impartial assessment of environmental performance and advocate for best practices, third-party environmental audits are crucial in propelling corporate sustainability efforts. It is critical to resolve the highlighted issues and continually improve audit procedures to enhance their efficacy. Policymakers, corporations, and stakeholders can use this research to better understand the value of third-party audits in reaching sustainable development goals and how to improve corporate sustainability initiatives. </jats:p>"

This study’s objective is to develop an alternative business model with the goal of strengthening the interaction that already exists between independent farmers and cooperatives in ensuring the existence of a supply chain for raw materials and having access to financial resources, knowledge, and technology. The selection of the research location considered several factors, including the size of the area’s oil palm plantations, the number of oil palm farmers who are self-sufficient, and the possibility of locating CPO plant. Study findings that, the new model by business canvas analysis as the upgraded model of existing model business recommended that it should be built based on the cooperative palm oil family which provides farmers with access to financial, replanting, intensification, and extensification and infrastructure by APKASINDO, BPDPKS, Bank, and other stakeholders to sustain the FFB supply chain in cooperation through a partnership program in a long-term scheme. This whole system was developed by corporate farming system based on the cooperative as the off taker of FFB farmers and develop mini plant CPO to produce cooking oil and biofuels and by product as the waste management system as the value added for farmers.</jats:p>"

This is exacerbated by high energy costs for pumping, water losses due to aging infrastructures, and increasing demand driven by population growth. Therefore, optimizing the available resources using a water–energy nexus approach can increase the reliability of the water distribution network by saving energy for distributing the same water. This study proposes a methodology that optimizes the Water Distribution Network (WDN) and its management that can be replicated elsewhere, as it is developed in a data-scarce area. Indeed, this approach shows the gathering of WDN information and a model to save energy by optimizing pump schedules, which guarantee water distribution at minimal operational costs. The approach integrates a genetic algorithm to create pumping patterns and the EPANET hydraulic simulator to test their reliability. The methodology is applied for a water utility in the dryland urban setting of Lodwar, Turkana County, Kenya. The results indicate a potential reduction in energy costs by 50% to 57% without compromising the supply reliability. The findings highlight the potential of WEN-based solutions in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of data-scarce water utilities in dryland ecosystems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The pharmaceutical industry is key to the survival of the human race, but equally becoming increasingly susceptible to global disruptions. In Nigeria, records have shown that the industry is plagued with several problems, inclusive of low employee productivity, poor market share, low innovation performance, poor and marginal sales growth and low profitability, which are likely a result of a lack of strategic flexibility in the face of increasing environment turbulence and intense competition. Despite efforts from researchers, the moderating role of supply chain agility has been largely overlooked in the literature. Therefore, this study examines the moderating role of supply chain agility on the relationship between strategic flexibility (resource flexibility, coordination flexibility, proactive flexibility, reactive flexibility and futurity) and organisational performance. A survey research design was used to collect data from 642 management and senior staff employees of six pharmaceutical companies listed on the Nigerian Exchange Group. A total enumeration method was adopted for the study, with a well-structured adapted questionnaire, having Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients ranging from 0.725 to 0.945. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was chosen to achieve the research goal. The PLS-SEM analysis revealed that strategic flexibility positively affects organizational performance (β = -0.093, p&gt; 0.050, Q2 = 0.644). However, supply chain agility negatively moderates this effect, indicating that while agility is beneficial independently, it can counteract the positive impact of strategic flexibility when combined. The study recommended that the management of pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria should pay serious attention to strategic flexibility as an organizational capability that can enhance performance in the face of increasing uncertainties in and unpredictability nature of the business environment.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the citrus supply chain in these regions, identifying the key research topics, methodologies, and supply chain echelons addressed in the literature. The study employed a systematic review, real-world case studies, and supply chain stakeholders’ interviews. This multi-faceted approach allows researchers to highlight research gaps, map a complete citrus supply chain, and provide a detailed material flow and sustainability-oriented overview of potential inputs and outputs at different stages. By incorporating real-world case studies and stakeholder interviews, this paper offers a nuanced and practical perspective on the operational and sustainability challenges unique to the citrus supply chain.

As minimum parking requirements can have various negative impacts, they are controversially discussed and increasingly complemented or replaced by maximum requirements in several cities around the world. This paper evaluates the adequacy of residential minimum and maximum parking requirements in 12 mid-sized cities in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. By calculating the number of required parking spaces and by comparing this required supply to the estimated parking demand, we evaluate the impacts and possible steering effects of parking standards. We base our estimations on a hypothetical scenario, in which all existing residential buildings comply with the requirements and use the number of registered cars as a proxy for residential parking demand.</jats:p><jats:p>Our results reveal great differences between the cities’ parking standards. Some cities have minimum requirements, which would lead to a parking supply exceeding the current parking demand in large, mainly densely-populated and centrally located areas. These requirements would result in an oversupply of off-street parking at the place of residence of more than 50% of all residents, which in some areas would even exceed the parking demand by a factor of 2. In contrast to that, other cities have quite stringent requirements, which fall well below the current parking demand at the place of residence of 64 to 81% of all residents. Some of these restrictive cities complement their minimum parking requirements with additional measures by enforcing maximum requirements, limiting access to parking permits or reducing the overall parking capacity. Based on these findings, we discuss the adequacy of the parking requirements, their likely underlying objectives and their possible impacts on future urban development.</jats:p>"

The study of the supply of ecosystem services and the demand and consumption of ecosystem services by human society, and the analysis of the supply and demand characteristics and flow relationships of ecosystem service flows are of great significance for the management of regional ecosystems and the development of ecological compensation. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt as an example, this paper calculates the supply and demand indices of ecosystem services in 2015 and 2020, and determines the ecosystem spatial flow paths and flow volumes from the ecosystem supply area to the demand area based on various methods and models such as the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and distance decay model. The results indicate that 1). In 2015 and 2020, the supply and demand of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Zone show an increasing trend numerically, and there is spatial heterogeneity in the spatial distribution. In terms of ecosystem service supply per unit area, the midstream region is higher than the upstream and downstream regions. In terms of the demand for ecosystem services per unit area, the downstream is higher than the midstream and upstream. 2). From the supply-demand balance of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Zone, the midstream region is mainly the area of surplus supply of ecosystem services, and the downstream region is mainly the area of deficit supply. From 2015 to 2020, the number of areas with balanced supply and demand of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Belt decreases and the number of areas with unbalanced supply and demand increases, which is related to the changes in the level of economic development and land use patterns. 3). The flow of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Belt shows an increasing trend, from 726.59 billion yuan in 2015 to 1,450.54 billion yuan in 2020, with Jiangxi Province being the main ecosystem service supply area and Zhejiang Province being the main ecosystem service demand area in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of environmental deterioration and people’s growing environmental protection awareness, governments or regions have put forward corresponding carbon emission reduction policies. Among them, the carbon trading mechanism, as an effective means to promote enterprises to implement emission reduction measures, plays a crucial role in regulating enterprise behavior and promoting social sustainable development. Since various industries and sectors support each other in social and economic development, it is more reasonable to study the carbon emission reduction optimization decisions of society and enterprises from the perspective of the supply chain. To achieve the carbon reduction target of the supply chain system, manufacturing enterprises usually need to incur additional costs to invest in emission reduction technologies, and retail enterprises also need to conduct low-carbon publicity to increase product market share. On one hand, considering the impact of the government’s emission reduction constraints and consumers’ low-carbon preferences, manufacturers will take corporate social responsibility (CSR) into consideration to enhance product competitiveness. On the other hand, smaller retailers are more concerned about being treated fairly than about their own profits due to the extra cost of low-carbon advertising. In this paper, considering the background of carbon trading, the manufacturer’s CSR and retailer’s fairness concern behavior are introduced into the decision-making process of the low-carbon supply chain (LCSC), and the relevant emission reduction decision-making model is constructed by using Stackelberg game theory and backward derivation method. Through comparative analysis of relevant parameters, members’ profits and utilities, this paper focuses on the influence of CSR and fairness concerns on system decision-making. The results show that the optimal way for LCSC decision-making is to cooperate with fair-concerned retailers and manufacturers with CSR. When manufacturers consider social responsibility within a certain range and retailers bear part of the cost of social responsibility as followers, it can not only effectively improve the emission reduction level of the supply chain and the profits of each entity, but also help to increase the enthusiasm of each entity for carbon emission reduction and the overall social welfare.</jats:p>"

The objective is to explore how blockchain can address critical challenges such as transparency, traceability, and accountability, thereby contributing to more sustainable and ethical supply chain practices. Through an extensive literature review, this study examines various blockchain applications and their potential to enhance sustainability by reducing inefficiencies, ensuring compliance with environmental standards, and mitigating risks related to unethical practices. The research methodology involved a comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and industry reports to identify the benefits and barriers of blockchain adoption in supply chains. Key findings suggest that while blockchain can significantly enhance transparency and sustainability, SMEs face unique challenges in terms of technological adoption, cost implications, and scalability. Additionally, the paper proposes a framework tailored to SME needs, outlining practical steps for blockchain implementation, including initial investment strategies, stakeholder collaboration, and integration with existing technologies. The study concludes that blockchain holds great potential for advancing sustainable supply chains, but its adoption by SMEs requires a strategic approach that addresses financial, technical, and operational barriers. This framework provides a roadmap for SMEs aiming to leverage blockchain technology to achieve sustainability goals, thus contributing to long-term business competitiveness and compliance with global sustainability standards.</jats:p>"

This situation started to change in the 1990s, because of several converging factors, and currently, publicly owned/subsidized, not‐for‐profit fractionation activity has shrunk to a handful of players. However, the collection of plasma from publicly owned blood services has continued and recent developments have increased the interest of state authorities globally to increase the volume of plasma collected to increase the level of strategic independence in the supply of crucial plasma‐derived medicines from commercial market pressures, particularly the global for‐profit fractionation sector with its dominance of source plasma from paid donors in the United States.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a method for assessing the share of electricity consumption of a particular consumer that is provided by renewable sources of energy (RES). In particular, we are talking about estimating the share of electricity of a particular consumer that it receives from low-carbon energy sources (LCES). Confirmation of the origin of the consumed electricity allows manufacturers to produce products with green labeling and/or improve the company's image among customers, investors, and partners. The method is based on methods and algorithms for calculating the steady-state modes of power grids. The method is based on a mathematical model for determining the components of electricity flows in the branches of the power grid circuit, which uses the coefficients of current distribution in the branches of the circuit from nodes with generation sources and nodal voltages. As a result, a matrix of power distribution coefficients in the branches of the power grid is formed. Since renewable energy sources, including renewable sources of energy (RSE) and nuclear power plants in electric power systems (EPS), use general-purpose power grids to transmit the electricity they generate, determining their share of power in the flows allows us to take into account the influence of different generation sources on the parameters of the EPS mode. In this paper, we calculated the steady-state mode of a 14-node circuit with different voltage classes (110 kV and 220 kV) and different energy sources, including renewable energy sources. In particular, by calculations using the method of guaranteed power origin, power flows in the branches of the electrical circuit and power losses in them were determined. The results of computer modeling in the Power Factory software package are commensurate with the results of calculations, which confirms the adequacy of the method.</jats:p>"

The paper investigates, within a systematic literature review, the role of AI in developing customer behavior analysis and market trust through Supply Chain Visibility (SCV) in terms of transparency and traceability. The findings here are that AI considerably improves product verification, personalization, and trend prediction for fraud detection, marketing, and brand integrity. These technologies also support regulatory compliance while providing the consumer with more informed purchasing decisions, hence advancing knowledge of the role AI plays in guarding luxury markets and building trust.</jats:p>",

Building on the mathematical model of Waterson and Hunt (2024), we investigate the emerging field of hybrid ventilation – specifically the rates of airflow achieved by the simultaneous combination of ‘stack-driven’ natural displacement ventilation and a mechanical supply. Whilst the focus of Waterson and Hunt (2024) was specifically on predicting the time taken to complete a purge, herein we focus on airflow rates and in doing so elucidate the somewhat counter intuitive role that the mechanical supply has on the natural ventilation flow rates. Our results challenge the perception that a hybrid approach must be superior to both solely natural and mechanical strategies. Focusing on the variation in airflow rates during a hybrid purge, our model reveals: (i) a hybrid purge offers an improvement over a solely mechanical purge only during one of the two distinct flow regimes identified; and (ii) the manner in which the stack-driven and mechanical components combine is highly nuanced and cannot be predicted by the linear superposition of the constituent stack-driven and mechanical contributions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The smoldering of pine needle fuel beds (PNBs) has been a common subject of research because of its importance in initiating the rekindling of forest floor fires. Experimental studies of the coupling effects of the bulk density and external heat supply on smoldering in PNBs have been scarce up to now. In this study, laboratory smoldering experiments were conducted to study the coupling effects of bulk density (30–55 kg m−3) and heat supply (ignition-off temperature Toff = 190 °C and 230 °C). Different ignition modes were observed under the same conditions, including non- ignition (NI), flaming ignition (FI), and the smoldering-to-flaming (StF) transition. The results in this study showed that the bulk density had distinct effects on different ignition modes: the increase in the bulk density facilitated the StF transition but impeded the FI. The coupling effects between the bulk density and heat supply became more intricate, especially at lower bulk densities and at a reduced heat supply. Additionally, a simple energy balance equation was established to explain the coupling effects of bulk density and heat supply on ignition behavior. The critical mass loss rate (MLR) for the StF transition ranged from 0.01 g s−1 to 0.03 g s−1, while the critical MLR for FI was 0.035 g s−1. The modified combustion efficiency (MCE) index for the StF transition decreased from approximately 79.6% to 70.1% as the density increased from 30 kg m−3 to 55 kg m−3. In contrast, the MCE for FI was approximately 90% across all the bulk densities. The StF transition delay time increased from 50 s at 30 kg m−3 to 1296 s at 55 kg m−3 when Toff = 230 °C. Further reduction in heat supply led to an increase in the delay time for the StF transition by diminishing the intensity of smoldering combustion. This work advances the fundamental understanding of how heat supply and bulk density impact smoldering ignition modes, ultimately aiding in the development of wildfire prevention strategies.</jats:p>"

These policies provided incentives both for industry to change the products they sell and for people to change their food and beverage choices through a ‘signalling’ effect that has raised awareness of excess sugar intakes in the population. In this study, we aimed to identify the relative contributions of the supply- and demand-side drivers of changes in the sugar density of food and beverages purchased in Great Britain. While we found that both supply- and demand-side drivers contributed to decreasing the sugar density of beverage purchases (reformulation led to a 19 % reduction, product renewal 14 %, and consumer switching between products 8 %), for food products it was mostly supply-side drivers (reformulation and product renewal). Reformulation contributed consistently to a decrease in the sugar density of purchases across households, whereas changes in consumer choices were generally in the opposite direction, offsetting benefits of reformulation. We studied the social gradient of sugar density reduction for breakfast cereals, achieved mostly by reformulation, and found increased reductions in sugar purchased by households of lower socio-economic status. Conversely, there was no social gradient for soft drinks. We conclude that taxes and reformulation incentives are complementary and combining them in a programme to improve the nutritional quality of foods increases the probability of improvements in diet quality.</jats:p>"

In this context, the water–energy–food nexus framework has emerged, recognizing the interdependencies and interactions among water, energy, and food systems, with the aim of optimizing resource management through cross-sectoral collaboration to promote sustainable development. Understanding the spatio-temporal differentiation patterns of the WEF nexus and elucidating the driving mechanisms behind changes in their coupling relationships is essential. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring the security of each subsystem and enhancing the overall sustainability of interconnected systems through coordinated efforts. To address these challenges, this study first established evaluation indicators for water, energy, and food security to quantify their levels and spatio-temporal dynamics. Subsequently, the degrees of coupling coordination within the WEF nexus were calculated. Finally, the WEF nexus’s spatial correlations were analyzed by using a spatial autocorrelation model. Spatial econometric models then identified key factors affecting its coordination. The results revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in water, energy, and food security across mainland China’s provinces. From 2002 to 2022, water security improved substantially in 87% of the provinces, while energy security began to improve in the eastern regions following a phase of high consumption. Food security saw significant enhancements, particularly in Inner Mongolia and the northeastern provinces. The overall coupling coordination of the WEF nexus improved across 30 provinces, progressing toward primary coordination. However, Henan and Anhui provinces experienced fluctuations in WEF nexus coordination. Spatial correlation analysis showed upward trends and increased clustering in WEF nexus coordination. Factors such as economic development and population positively influenced coordination, while economic agglomeration, education, and effective irrigation area had negative effects. This study elucidates the complex interconnections and key influencing factors within the WEF nexus, providing a reference framework and practical recommendations for equitable resource management.</jats:p>"

The article proposes a solution for the layout of district heating systems based on a combination of boiler houses operating on the basis of traditional sources of thermal energy generation and electric boiler houses purchasing electricity in energy markets based on the use of price-dependent mechanisms for managing their own demand for electricity, allowing to reduce the cost of providing thermal energy to consumers united in large industrial energy districts. The article provides a comparative study of outdoor temperature indicators in Russia and various countries of the world, as well as a study of the cost of fuel and energy resources for heating needs. As a result of the study, it is emphasized that Russia is the country that ranks first in the world in terms of fuel and energy resources spent on heat generation, and consumes 38% of the world's energy costs for heat supply, which emphasizes the need to find solutions to reduce the cost of heat generation and increase the energy efficiency of the national economy. As a solution to improve the energy efficiency of district heating, a scheme is proposed for the implementation of combined district heating in large energy districts using simultaneous use of liquid/gaseous fuel boilers and electric boilers, which reduces the total cost of consuming energy resources of the entire thermal energy generation system. Due to price-dependent power consumption management, an electric boiler house can generate thermal energy at the lowest prices for the purchase of electric energy. The remaining part of the required thermal energy is produced by a boiler house running on traditional fuels. The proposed solution makes it possible to reduce the cost of heat supply, reduce the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere, increase the reliability and quality of heat supply and reduce the cost of electricity generation for consumers belonging to Unified Power System of Russia.</jats:p>",

This makes it vulnerable and creates difficulties in imposing and maintaining a quality product. One of the time-honoured global solutions is the import of highly skilled and seasonal workers from third countries. In recent years, the labour supply chain has faced many challenges related to the dynamic change of multiple geopolitical factors, our accession to the Schengen area, changes in regulations and the increase of legal and illegal competition in this sector. Unpredictable changes in market conditions often lead to the emergence of bottlenecks and critical areas that hinder the processes involved in importing employees.\n The topic is of particular relevance to the tourism sector, but we can also relate these difficulties to other sectors of the economy that are highly dependent on adequate human capital management to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of the serives offered.</jats:p>",

However, there are few studies on the interrelationships and their drivers between land use conflicts (LUCs) and ESDB from a coupling perspective, especially in different main functional areas. Therefore, this study focused on Southwest China. Firstly, the coupling coordination degree model was employed to measure the ESDB‐LUCs relationship and analyze its dynamic changes from 1990 to 2020. Then, the RDA method was used to explore the driving factors of the ESDB‐LUCs relationship in different functional areas (i.e., urban development area (UDA), agricultural development area (APA), and ecological protection area (EPA)). The results show that the LUCs index displayed a downward trend in the SW during 1990–2020, with a decreasing distribution pattern from the northeast to the southwest. The ESDB index exhibited a downward and then upward trend, with an increasing distribution mode from the northeast to the southwest. There was a spatial dependence between LUCs and ESDB. The type of coupling coordination between LUCs and ESDB was dominated by moderate coordination, with the index showing a spatial pattern of UDA &gt; APA &gt; EPA. Among these, the proportion of cropland and the proportion of urban land were the main factors influencing the degree of coordination of the UDA (explanation rate &gt; 80%), showing positive and negative effects, respectively. The proportion of forestland and the proportion of cropland were the main factors influencing the APA and EPA (explanation rate &gt; 70%), with negative and positive effects, respectively. Therefore, mitigating the conflict between cropland and urban land, cropland and forest land is essential to achieve ecosystem balance in the SW.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid urbanization and population growth in mega-cities have led to a significant increase in the demand for medical services, highlighting the critical need for a more efficient alignment between the supply and demand of medical resources. Previous research often focuses on singular factors, such as accessibility or quantity, as the primary criteria for matching medical services, without comprehensively considering the location, scale, and quality factors of medical facilities. Addressing this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework that integrates these three critical factors to assess the supply–demand matching (SDM) of medical care facilities (MCFs) with population needs. This assessment is conducted using geospatial analysis techniques with ArcGIS and Python. The study includes an empirical analysis of 134 streets within the Chongqing municipality. The empirical results reveal significant disparities in the performance of integrated medical care facilities (MCFs), as well as variations across the dimensions of location, scale, and quality. Central districts like Yuzhong demonstrate high levels of accessibility, appropriate scale matching, and satisfactory service quality, whereas rapidly urbanizing peripheral districts such as Yubei suffer from significant mismatches in resource availability and service quality. The theoretical framework contributes to the field of medical care research, and the corresponding empirical findings provide valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers to optimize the allocation of medical resources, improve healthcare accessibility, and enhance service quality across different urban areas.</jats:p>"

A legal assessment is also given to such a concept as the \"marginal price of a product\" (\"price cap\") and responsibility for its compliance. The author analyzes and parallels with similar legislative acts of other foreign countries. A separate emphasis is placed on the correlation of sanctions/anti-sanctions clauses with the principle of freedom of contract in Russian civil law as a whole. It is assumed not only the \"protective\" role of reservations, but also the possibility through them to implement a variable (spare in relation to the main scenario) list of obligations of the parties to the contract in the performance of a transaction modified by the circumstances. At the same time, the key point is to respect the initial interests of both parties, as well as their desire to fully fulfill the contract. Summarizing author’s own practical experience, possible formulations of contractual clauses are proposed, as well as their impact on the business opportunities and risks of the parties to the contract. In this regard, the work is of scientific and practical interest, but certainly acts only as the first attempt in the study of this multifaceted and complex subject.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The GPHF-Minilab™ is a portable toolkit for performing qualitative methods such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on common pharmaceuticals. It is particularly useful in resource-limited locations where it is more challenging to monitor for substandard and falsified (SF) medicines. However, the GPHF-Minilab™ TLC methods are only semi-quantitative at best and thus have issues monitoring product quality effectively. We have improved on the GPHF-Minilab™ TLC method for metronidazole, a common antibiotic, by making it fully quantitative. Sample solutions were spotted on TLC plates alongside three metronidazole standards at different concentrations. After development, plates were imaged in a lightbox with two different smartphone cameras. Images were processed through the open-source program ImageJ and resulting pixel data from the standard spots were used to create a calibration curve, enabling quantitation of the sample. The USP Metronidazole Tablet high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was used as the reference method. We validated this TLC method using 250 and 500 mg metronidazole tablets from different manufacturers and assessed linearity, range, accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity, and robustness. These improvements should enhance the GPHF-Minilab™ TLC methods for metronidazole product screening. Additionally, the procedure is extensible to other analytes, although further validation would be required for each Minilab method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bike sharing facilitates the public’s daily lives and possesses substantial market demand, yet its overwhelming presence has triggered some environmental problems. To enhance resource utilization efficiency, we examine the decision-making strategies within a reverse supply chain considering the private information of the bike-sharing platform. Using Stackelberg games, two models are formulated in order to investigate whether the platform should share its own private information when the used shared bikes are recycled. A supply chain without private information is provided as a benchmark for comparison, and we obtain the optimal equilibrium strategies of the benchmark and the proposed model. Furthermore, how the optimal strategies change with the variation in parameters and the impacts of the private information on the optimal strategies are discussed. The results show that information asymmetry could lead to a reduction in supply chain efficiency. Thus, a two-part pricing contract is introduced to incentivize the platform to share information and coordinate the supply chain, which can effectively improve the performance of the integral supply chain and implement a “win-win” strategy for the third-party remanufacturer and the platform.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ecological conservation of nature reserves has garnered considerable attention and is subject to stringent management in China. However, the majority of these areas have a history of underdeveloped economies and require urgent improvements in the well-being of local communities. Effectively coupling and harmonizing the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and socio-economic development has emerged as a crucial concern for nature reserves. Therefore, further exploration is needed to achieve a spatio-temporal balance and alignment between the supply and demand of ESs in nature reserves in China. Utilizing multiple datasets, RULSE, and bivariate autocorrelation methods, this study investigated the spatio-temporal evolution of the ecosystem services supply–demand ratio (ESDR) and supply–demand spatial matches for soil conservation services (SCSs) in the Qinling Mountains (QMs) from 2000 to 2020. The results indicated the following: (1) Over the years, the supply of SCSs exhibited a consistently high level, with an upward trend observed in 63.10% of the QMs, while the demand for SCSs is generally low, with a decreasing trend observed in 82.68% of the QMs. (2) The supply and demand of SCSs remained favorable, with a positive ESDR reaching 82.19% of the QMs. From 2000 to 2010, there was a significant decline in ESDR; however, a substantial rebound was observed in the ESDR across the region from 2010 to 2020. (3) Over years, the majority of counties and districts exhibited positive values in ESDR. When examining cities, Weinan, Xi’an, and Ankang demonstrated relatively consistent patterns with higher ESDR values over time. In 2000, the ESDR on the northern slope exhibited lower values than that on the southern slope; however, this situation subsequently underwent a reversal. (4) The spatial distribution of SCS supply and demand was predominantly characterized by matching regions exhibiting either High Supply–High Demand or Low Supply–Low Demand for years. This study suggests that the supply and demand dynamics of SCSs in the Qinling Mountains have been favorable in recent years, with consistent spatial supply–demand matches. These findings can provide valuable insights for similar nature reserves aiming to implement ecological environmental protection and achieve sustainable development. The future research endeavors, however, should strive to expand upon these findings by exploring the supply and demand patterns associated with other ESs across diverse nature reserves, while considering their unique geographical characteristics, in order to promote more rational ecological management strategies.</jats:p>"

It has been found that the maximum accumulation of both raw and dry aboveground biomass, crude protein and fodder units in soybean agrocenosis is observed at the stage of full seed (R6). The average values for maximum yields in the experiment were the following: of aboveground raw biomass – 24.8 t/ha, aboveground dry biomass – 6.82 t/ha, protein yield in aboveground dry biomass – 1 278 kg/ha, yield in fodder units – 3.68 t/ha, the contribution of leaves to the yield of aboveground dry biomass being 23.0%, leaves accumulated 20.0% of protein where its content being 20.9%; the contribution of stems to the yield of aboveground dry biomass was 36.0%, stems provided 11.0% of protein accumulated where its content being 5.8%; the contribution of beans reached 41.0%, beans ensured 69.0% of crude protein where its content being 30.1%. Increased moisture availability contributed to a significant growth of the yield of aboveground raw biomass – 1.09-1.19-fold, aboveground dry biomass – 1.08-1.15-fold, protein yield in aboveground dry biomass – 1.10-1.21-fold, yield in fodder units in aboveground dry biomass – 1.07-1.14-fold. On average in the experiment seed yield reached 2.54 t/ha, yield of protein accumulated in seeds was 1 008 kg/ha, of fodder units – 3.40 t/ha. Increased level of available moisture contributed to increase in seed yield – by 1.14-1.21 times, collection of crude protein per unit area – by 1.19-1.31 times, yield of fodder units – by 1.13-1.21 times. It was found that the yield of aboveground biomass harvested at the stage of full seed (R6) significantly exceeded the seed yield: in terms of dry matter yield – by 2.69 times, protein yield – by 1.27 times, fodder units yield – by 1.08 times.</jats:p>",

This deficiency can lead to frequency instability and cascading failures within the power system. A cooperative optimization model for the start‐up of multiple power supplies, designed to enhance the integration of new energy sources while maintaining system stability is proposed. The model incorporates primary frequency modulation and the intrinsic inertia support capabilities of self‐synchronous voltage source field stations, considering dynamic frequency constraints. Additionally, it employs new energy units with primary frequency modulation to provide inertia support during curtailment, particularly when conventional units cannot meet frequency standards due to existing constraints. Extensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed model improves new energy utilization by up to 37.5% and reduces operational costs by approximately 16%, enhancing overall operational efficiency in high energy consumption scenarios.</jats:p>",

We find that exports with higher import ban exposure experience lower export growth after the import ban policy is implemented. Our results suggest that a 1% increase in exposure to the import ban of a product would lead to a reduction of its export growth by almost 2%. The effects are more prominent when export products have the closest characteristics to the banned solid waste. We also find that importing prices of solid wastes surge after the implementation of the policy, which leads to a higher price for exports that undermines the competitiveness of Chinese exports and results in lower export growth.</jats:p>",

Reproducible build, in particular, enables our scheme, as our scheme requires the software materials/artifacts to be consistent across machines with the same operating system/specifications. Furthermore, we use blockchain to deliver the proof reference, which enables our scheme to be distributed so that the assurance beneficiary and verifier are the same, i.e., the node downloading the software verifies its own materials, artifacts, and outputs. Blockchain also significantly improves the assurance efficiency. We first describe and explain our scheme using abstraction and then implement our scheme to assure Ethereum as the target software to provide concrete proof-of-concept implementation, validation, and experimental analyses. Our scheme enables more significant performance gains than relying on a centralized server thanks to the use of blockchain (e.g., two to three orders of magnitude quicker in verification) and adds small overheads (e.g., generating and verifying proof have an overhead of approximately one second, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the software download or build processes).</jats:p>"

In a context where the importance of supply chain stability is increasing, the study seeks to identify changes in efficiency across industries and propose strategies for improvement.\r\nThe analysis shows that the overall efficiency of the domestic logistics industry has improved; however, volatility increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2019-2021) across all sectors. In particular, the maritime and aviation industries, which are highly influenced by the global economy, experienced a decline in the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) due to events such as Brexit (2016-2017), the U.S.-China trade war (2017-2018), the Suez Canal blockage (2021), and the Russia-Ukraine war (2022). In contrast, the land transportation and rail industries, which focus on the domestic market, showed relatively lower volatility.\r\nThese findings highlight the need to identify external risks and develop strategies to enhance the competitiveness of the domestic logistics industry. Moreover, adopting digital transformation and automation can maximize technical efficiency, while building environmentally friendly logistics systems is essential for sustainable development. Tailored strategies for each industry are crucial to mitigate risks across both domestic and international markets.

The non-uniform indoor air environment poses a significant challenge in achieving humidity regulation that meets the distinct requirements of various locations. Traditional feedback control mechanisms may lead to instability, overshooting, and oscillation in indoor parameters. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to address humidity assurance issues in high-precision indoor environments by establishing analytical expressions that link the demand parameters at different locations with air supply parameters. Using a case study, this paper examines several typical operational scenarios with diverse control objectives, including minimizing dehumidification energy consumption, minimizing air supply humidity adjustment values, and constraints on adjustable air supply inlets. This method enables rapid calculation of air supply humidity and regulation of humidity parameters at multiple locations within the indoor environment. It considers various locations, requirements, optimization targets, and precision, demonstrating that it can quickly determine the optimal air supply parameters based on the objective function. This method facilitates rapid adjustment and high-precision assurance of different humidity requirements at multiple locations, making it suitable for high-precision design and control of indoor humidity environments.</jats:p>"

This study introduces the Holistic Multi-Indicator Decision Support System (HMI_DSS), an innovative tool grounded in life cycle thinking and advanced multi-criteria decision-making methodologies, including Entropy and PROMETHEE II. The HMI_DSS quantifies and assesses sustainability and circularity in energy systems by employing 49 indicators, with a focus on energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. A case study on the rice straw energy supply chain for biogas production illustrates the tool’s effectiveness, comparing a baseline scenario to an alternative. The results show that the global warming potential (GWP) of the baseline is 122 gCO2eq/kWh, while the alternative is 116 gCO2eq/kWh. However, the baseline scenario has lower energy consumption (1.72 × 107 MJ annually) than the alternative (1.98 × 107 MJ). Overall, the alternative outperforms the baseline in terms of sustainability and circularity. The HMI_DSS offers a flexible and robust framework for evaluating trade-offs in energy systems, providing valuable insights for energy companies and researchers in adopting circular economy principles to achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Leak detection and prediction is urgent to secure the safety of the water supply system. Relaying on deep learning artificial neural networks and a specific optimization algorithm, an intelligential detection approach in identifying the pipeline leaks is proposed. A hydraulic model is initially constructed on the simplified Net2 benchmark pipe network. The District Metering Area (DMA) algorithm and the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm are integrated as the DMA-CS algorithm, which is employed for the hydraulic model optimization. Attributing to the suspected leak area identification and the exact leak location, the DMA-CS algorithm possess higher accuracy for pipeline leakage (97.43%) than that of the DMA algorithm (92.67%). The identification pattern of leakage nodes is correlated to the maximum number of leakage points set with the participation of the DMA-CS algorithm, which provide a more accurate pathway for identifying and predicting the specific pipeline leaks.</jats:p>"

Porous polyimide (PI) material with a certain micropore structure can be used as a lubricant storage and migration channel to realize the lubricant circulation supply in the bearing system. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are adopted to model the lubricant outflow process from the pore of the PI material. Coarse-grained models are constructed to investigate the lubricant migration behaviors with different rotation speeds, rotation radii, and pore sizes. The results show that a lubricant within the pore fails to outflow due to the capillary effect in a static state. However, for the rotating pores, if the centrifugal forces resulting from rotation exceed the capillary forces, the lubricants will begin to flow out. Furthermore, the lubricant in the large pore is easier to outflow due to the smaller capillary force, which is the main mechanism of lubricant outflow from the pores.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the trade environment of a globalized economy, tariffs play a crucial role in transnational supply chains. At the same time, the power structure of the supply chain also plays an important role in the decision making and income distribution of a transnational supply chain. Therefore, we construct game-theoretic models to analyze the impacts of tariffs and power structures on the decision making and revenue distribution of transnational supply chains. First, we consider a bilateral monopoly model consisting of a Chinese manufacturer and a U.S. retailer and analyze the effects of tariffs and power structures on decision making and revenue distributions in this supply chain. Then, we extend the model to a duopoly competition model consisting of two Chinese manufacturers and one American retailer, further analyzing the roles of tariffs and power structures. The results indicate that in the bilateral monopoly model, the impact of tariffs on the manufacturer’s profits is always greater than on the retailer’s profits under a manufacturer-led circumstance. However, in a competitive model, when the market size is large, the impact of tariffs on the manufacturer’s profits exceeds that of the retailer’s profits; conversely, when the market size is smaller, the impact of tariffs on the retailer’s profits is greater than on the manufacturer’s profits. Furthermore, we find that in the duopoly competition model, under the manufacturer-led circumstance, both the manufacturer and the retailer earn the highest profits.</jats:p>"

In this study, a new method was developed for tracking the mitochondrial energy metabolism at the single mitochondria level by real‐time imaging of mitochondrial superoxide production (i.e., mitoflash). Using this method, we observed the increased mitoflash frequencies in the receptacles of <jats:italic>Nelumbo nucifera</jats:italic> Gaertn. at the thermogenic stages. This increase, combined with the higher expression of antioxidant response‐related genes identified through time‐series transcriptomics at the same stages, shows us a new regulatory mechanism for plant redox balance. Furthermore, we found that the upregulation of respiratory metabolism‐related genes during the thermogenic stages not only correlates with changes in mitoflash frequency but also underscores the critical roles of these pathways in ensuring adequate substrate supply for thermogenesis. Metabolite analysis revealed that sugars are likely one of the substrates for thermogenesis and may be transported over long distances by sugar transporters. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that mitoflash is a reliable tool for tracking energy metabolism in thermogenic plants and contributes to our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying floral thermogenesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several recent high intensity ENSO events have caused strong negative impacts on the adult phases of foundational species in coral reef ecosystems, but comparatively little is known about how climatic variables related to recent ENSOs are impacting the supply of larvae to benthic populations. In marine fishes and invertebrates, reproductive adults and planktonic larvae are generally more sensitive to environmental variability than older, non-reproductive adults. Further, the transport of larvae in ocean currents may also be strongly ENSO dependent. The interactions between the dynamics of larval survivorship and larval transport could lead to population bottlenecks as stronger ENSO events become more common. We tested the predictions of this hypothesis around the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) by constructing a correlation matrix of physical and biological time series variables that spanned 11 years (2007–2017) and multiple ENSO events. Our correlation matrix included four types of variables: i. published ENSO indices, ii. satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll variables, iii. abundance and diversity of larval fishes sampled during the late winter spawning season off Oahu, and iv. abundance and diversity of coral reef fish recruits sampled on the western shore of the Big Island of Hawaii. We found that the abundance and diversity of larval fishes was negatively correlated with the Multivariate El Niño Index (MEI), and that larval variables were positively correlated with measures of fall recruitment (September &amp; November), but not correlated with spring-summer recruitment (May &amp; July). In the MHI, SST variables were not correlated with the MEI, but two successive El Niño events of 2014–15 and 2015–2016 were characterized by SST maxima approaching 30°C. Two large pulses of benthic recruitment occurred in the 2009 and 2014 recruitment seasons, with &gt; 8000 recruits observed by divers over the summer and fall months. Both events were characterized by either neutral or negative MEI indices measured during the preceding winter months. These patterns suggest that La Niña and the neutral phases of the ENSO cycle are generally favorable for adult reproduction and larval development in the spring and summer, while El Niño phases may limit recruitment in the late summer and fall. We hypothesize that episodic recruitment during non-El Niño phases is related to favorable survivorship and transport dynamics that are associated with the formation of pairs of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies on the leeward sides (western shores) of the Main Hawaiian Islands.</jats:p>"

The analysis focuses on the interactions between upstream suppliers and downstream manufacturers, taking into account how manufacturers’ carbon emissions influence market demand, as well as how sustainability levels and price affect this demand. The results show that a centralized system has a lesser potential for total profit development in the supply chain than a decentralized system. To encourage investment in green technologies throughout the supply chain, this paper proposes two coordination mechanisms: a green subsidy and a two-part tariff contract. Numerical study reveals that a win–win scenario for the supply chain requires suppliers to share part of the costs. Furthermore, under a two-part tariff contract, successfully managing fixed costs can result in total profit levels comparable to those in a centralized system. The research also makes strategy recommendations, such as differentiating carbon levies, improving supply chain coordination, and assessing fixed costs. These aim to provide theoretical and practical implications for supply chain management in order to assist businesses and policymakers in effectively responding to the problems of climate change. </jats:p>"

This issue has hardly been studied in multiple pregnancies, the prevalence of which has been steadily increasing. Therefore, our study investigated the relationship between newborns’ anthropometric parameters and the concentration of 25(OH)D in maternal blood of women with twin pregnancies and umbilical cord blood. Methods: The study included 50 women who gave birth after the 36th week of twin gestation. The concentration of 25(OH)D was determined in maternal blood collected during the antenatal period and in the umbilical cord blood of 100 newborns. Anthropometric parameters of the newborns (birth weight, length and head and chest circumference) were obtained from hospital records. Data on nutrition and lifestyle during pregnancy were collected from the patients during an interview conducted by a dietitian. Results: No relationship between maternal and neonatal cord blood vitamin D concentrations and any of the anthropometric parameters of the newborns was found. However, only 6% of the mothers and 13% of the newborns had vitamin D deficiency (≤20 ng/mL). The type of pregnancy and maternal height were the main factors associated with neonatal size. Newborns from dichorionic pregnancies were on average 202 g heavier (p &lt; 0.001) and 1 cm longer (p = 0.006) than newborns from monochorionic pregnancies. Newborns of mothers ≤160 cm in height had on average 206 g lower birth weight (p = 0.006) and were 3.5 cm shorter (p = 0.003) compared to newborns of taller mothers. Conclusions: Therefore, in our study, the neonatal size of twins was not related to the vitamin D status but to other factors such as the type of pregnancy and maternal height.</jats:p>"

Brazil, a top ethanol producer, can boost competitiveness and cut emissions by integrating ammonia and ethanol production. However, optimal location and production strategy identification is challenging due to existing possibilities and uncertainties. For that, a new MILP superstructure with robust optimisation was developed and used to analyse low-carbon ammonia production integration in the ethanol industry in São Paulo state by ethanol and biomethane routes, in two different scenarios. As for the results, in scenario 1, biomethane and ethanol investments were USD 3.846 M and USD 314 M. In scenario 2, the investments were USD 316 M for biomethane and USD 259 M for ethanol. Despite the higher investment, the biomethane route results in lower hydrogen production cost (USD 1880/tonne) due to raw material prices; however, ethanol displays a higher hydrogen potential, consuming just 8% of total production against 54% of vinasse availability, which is used for biodigestion and biomethane production. In conclusion, the results suggest that the northern region of São Paulo has greater potential for ammonia facilities due to resource availability. These findings can inform and support more comprehensive studies and public incentive policies.</jats:p>"

The radioactivity levels of gross alpha and gross beta in the groundwater were found to exceed the established drinking water limits. In the pilot WTP, two methods were applied for water treatment, namely, ceramic ultra-filtration (CUF) and reverse osmosis (RO), both of which produced treated water that met drinking water quality standards. The annual effective dose from external radiation exposure to the WTP workers was found to be less than 0.007 mSv y−1 (during the filters backwash operation). However, the average annual dose from internal radiation due to inhalation of radon released from groundwater reached 3.2 mSv y−1, exceeding the 1 mSv y−1 limit. Therefore, monitoring radon levels in workplaces is recommended. Radioisotope concentrations in the waste (sludge) stockpiles exceeded clearance levels, requiring them to be treated as radioactive waste. Overall, the WTP successfully produced drinking water that met quality standards, and the methods used could be replicated in other locations.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous N supply on leaf color-changing, N accumulation, N transportation, and N loss of indica-japonica hybrid rice during the grain-filling stage. Two indica-japonica hybrid rice cultivars, Chunyou 167 (CY167) and Chunyou 927 (CY927), which exhibited significant differences in leaf color-changing during the grain-filling stage, were selected as materials for field experiment and hydroponic experiment with low, medium, and high N treatments (LN, MN, and HN). The dynamic changes in SPAD value from heading to maturity were measured and fitted with quadratic function to extract leaf color-changing parameters; labeled 15N was used as N source after heading to trace the source of N in the panicle and the remobilization of vegetative organ N. The results showed that 67.37–72.38% of the panicle N was transported from vegetative organs, the N transport efficiency was the upper three leaves &gt; lower leaves &gt; stem, and about 3.1–35.0% of the transported N was lost via volatilization. The effects of exogenous N concentration on N harvest index, N dry matter/grain production efficiency, N reuse efficiency, and N loss were closely related to leaf color-changing parameters. In MN and HN treatment, the N loss was negatively correlated with the onset time of leaf color-changing (T0) and the final leaf color index (CIf), but positively correlated with the leaf color-changing rate (Rmean). Increasing the supply of exogenous N increased T0 and CIf, but decreased Rmean, N transport/reuse efficiency, N harvest index, and N dry matter/grain production efficiency. Compared to the cultivar CY167 with normal leaf color-changing, the “stay-green” cultivar CY927 had higher T0, CIf, and lower Rmean, resulting in less N volatilization loss, lower N harvest index and N transport efficiency, while higher N reuse efficiency. In conclusion, the exogenous N supply affects leaf color by influencing the transportation and reuse of leaf N during the grain-filling stage.</jats:p>"

Although the growth rate of phytoplankton is determined by the concentration of limiting nutrient, the supply ratio of iron to nitrogen is suggested to be essential to this biogeographic pattern. However, the underlying dynamics determining the ratio remain largely unknown. We investigated mechanisms of dissolved iron (dFe) and nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) transport to the euphotic zone of the North Pacific using an eddy‐resolvable biogeochemical model. We show that lateral advection and atmospheric deposition are dominant drivers for dFe transport, resulting in high Fe:N supply ratio in both subarctic and subtropical regions. Conversely, significant vertical supplies of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> through upwelling and diffusion processes markedly reduce the supply ratio in the subarctic region. These dynamics combined lead to high Fe:N supply ratio in the gyre and low ratio in the subarctic, ultimately driving high nitrogen fixation condition in the gyre and the iron‐limited phytoplankton growth condition in the subarctic region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Circular Economy of the Automotive Industry’s Sustainable Supply Chain in the Case of Lithium-Ion Batteries is pioneering in environmental protection and ecological resource utilization. In addition to solving environmental problems, this method provides economic benefits by reducing the need for raw materials and lowering manufacturing costs. However, introducing a circular economy approach in the lithium-ion battery supply chain has numerous risks and challenges. This study addresses these challenges by crafting a framework that encapsulates the risks involved. It identifies the risks that evolving circular economy strategies might bring to the lithium-ion battery supply chain through an integrated Gray Delphi–DEMATEL–ANP method. Furthermore, this work introduces the Gray Degree of Possibility to unveil worst-case scenarios in risk analysis and extends it into zero-sum Game Theory. The study then formulates an improved zero-sum game model to determine optimal strategies for mitigating these risks. The numerical analysis reveals that, according to the proposed methodology, Environmental Pollution Risk emerges as the most critical, with a definite weight of 0.1525. This is followed by the Support Program Deficiency Risk at 0.1452 and the Improper Waste Management Risk at 0.1372.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results of production tests of the PS-20K-4 seed dresser with a modified electrical control circuit in order to synchronize the supply of seeds and working fluid to the mixing chamber of the treater when it is put into operation are presented. At each start-up of the dressers, the supply of seeds to the chamber is ahead of the supply of working fluid to it due to the inertia of the working bodies of the hydraulic system, especially this is manifested on dressing machines equipped with centrifugal pumps for supplying working fluid (PS-20K-4, PS-22, etc.). To ensure the synchronization of the supply of seeds and working fluid to the mixing chamber, a device is proposed, the main part of which is the PVI-11 time delay relay for switching on the seed disc drive. Before starting the dresser, the time of movement of the liquid from the pump to the sprayer is determined. For the time obtained in this way, a delay is set on the PVI-11 attachment. Production tests have shown the advantage of the treater with changes made to the electrical control circuit. With the factory control scheme of the treater, the total weight of untreated seeds and seeds with reduced completeness of treatment, which are defective, increases with the increase in the installed capacity of the unit from 5 to 20 t/h, respectively from 26.4 to 48 kg at the beginning of each machine start-up. With the established synchronization of the supply of seeds and working fluid to the mixing chamber when starting the dressing machine, there were no defective seeds. Operational, technological, technical and economic evaluations of the unit showed that the shift time utilization factor was τ_c = 0.83, Shift productivity increased by 25 % due to a reduction in the time for additional treatment of untreated and insufficiently treated seeds. The indicators of technical and operational reliability were Ktn = 0.98 and Ken = 0.94, respectively. Reduced costs by 35%, reducing labor costs by 25%. The annual economic effect with 140 hours of operating amounted to 29915.6 thousand rubles.</jats:p>",

This aims to achieve a win-win situation by minimizing the negative impact on the ecological environment while harnessing the economic benefits of the cascaded hydropower reservoirs. First, to address the slow convergence and susceptibility to local optima issues of the differential evolution algorithm, a new methodology was developed: a differential evolution algorithm with chaotic opposition-based initialization (COI) and average mutation update-based strategy (AMU). Second, an optimization model for the cascaded hydropower reservoir's ecological scheduling was constructed, dividing it into two modes: the daily average control mode and the instantaneous control mode. The Wujiang River cascaded hydropower reservoir's ecological scheduling optimization model was solved using the proposed differential evolution algorithm with COI and AMU. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior optimization capabilities and is more suitable for solving the cascaded hydropower reservoir's ecological scheduling optimization model. Studies demonstrate that adopting different ecological scheduling control modes for the Wujiang River cascaded hydropower reservoirs not only ensures power generation benefits but also enhances the ecological benefits of the Wujiang River cascade hydropower reservoirs.</jats:p>",

Concurrently, the research delves into the intricacies of battery supply chain optimization, examining the processes involved in sourcing high-energy-density batteries, ensuring quality control, and adhering to regulatory standards. Advanced supply chain management techniques, including predictive analytics and real-time monitoring, are analyzed for their role in streamlining procurement and manufacturing processes. The integration of these strategies within digital marketing campaigns demonstrates how each company positions itself as a leader in the industry, emphasizing technological innovation and reliability. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how digital marketing and supply chain optimization are not only critical for promoting the adoption of electric aircraft but also for overcoming market skepticism and ensuring operational efficiency. By presenting case studies of two pioneering projects, ACCEL and E-Fan X, the research highlights best practices and strategic approaches that can guide other companies in the industry. The findings underscore the importance of a synergistic approach where digital marketing is informed by supply chain realities, creating a transparent and trustworthy narrative for consumers and stakeholders. Ultimately, this paper contributes to the discourse on how emerging technologies in aviation can be successfully marketed and operationalized, offering insights into the effective use of digital marketing and supply chain management in the rapidly evolving electric aircraft sector.</jats:p>"

The research takes a dual approach: assessing spatial distribution through field samples from canals now distributing treated, chlorinated wastewater and analysing vertical percolation of wastewater through soil previously irrigated with untreated, non-chlorinated wastewater for over 100 years. Spatial analysis reveals that THMs are present in wastewater before treatment, with concentrations increasing post-treatment. Although DOC levels decrease after treatment, their aromaticity remains unchanged, suggesting the persistence of labile DOC. The presence of THMs in treated wastewater from irrigation canals may result from shorter travel distances or increased chlorine use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vertical soil column experiments indicate a correlation between THM generation, water source, and soil type. Results show that THMs are retained in the soil, where labile DOC is trapped, reducing its concentration while potentially releasing DOC from humic substances. Despite this, THM concentrations do not pose a risk to aquifers, though ongoing monitoring is important should soil and/or treatment methods be altered.</jats:p>",

Sediment can be supplied to salt marshes via two routes: through marsh creeks and over marsh edges. However, the conditions of tides and waves that facilitate sediment import through these two routes remain unclear. To understand when and how sediment is imported into salt marshes, 2‐month measurements were conducted to monitor tides, waves, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in Paulina Saltmarsh, a meso‐macrotidal system. The results show that the marsh creek tends to import sediment during neap tides with waves. A tidal cycle with a small tidal range result in weaker flow in the marsh creek during ebb tides, reducing the export of sediment. Waves enhance sediment supply to the marsh creek by eroding mudflats. However, strong waves can directly resuspend sediment in marsh creeks during spring tides when the water level is above the marsh canopy, enhancing sediment export through creeks. Net sediment import over marsh edges requires the opposite tidal and wave conditions: spring tides with weak waves. Spring tides provide stronger hydrodynamics, facilitating sediment import over the marsh edge. Increased SSC during the ebb phase can occur with strong waves over the marsh edge, resulting in net sediment export. Therefore, the net import or export of sediment, through the creek and over the marsh edge, depends on the combination of tidal and wave conditions. These conditions can vary between estuaries and even individual marshes. Understanding these conditions is crucial for better management of salt marshes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban agglomerations (UAs), which play a significant role in socioeconomic development and urbanization, are confronted with mounting ecological stress and a profound global imbalance in ecosystem services (ES). Understanding the conflict and coordination of knowledge about ES supply and demand (ESSD) can facilitate more efficacious guidance on the ecological sustainable development of UAs. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the conflict and coordination relationship between ESSD in Chinese UAs remain unclear, and further investigation into the interactive coercive relationship between ESSD is warranted. Consequently, we employed spatial regression and coupled coordination models to elucidate the conflict and coordination relationship between ESSD, utilizing multi-source data on Chinese UAs from 2000 to 2020. We found that ES supply in the UAs decreased, while ES demand increased. Furthermore, the coupling coordination degree between ESSD demonstrated an increase trend. The overall coupling coordination degrees between ESSD in UAs were 0.260, 0.285, and 0.311 in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. The central UAs were identified as stress areas, whereas the peripheral areas were classified as non-stress areas.

However, the selection of investigation methods and simulation model remains a persistent challenge. This study selected the Yellow River Delta High-Efficiency Eco-Economic Zone in China as the case study area and assessed the habitat quality and carbon sequestration services for 2000, 2010, and 2020. The quantile regression method was employed to quantify the impacts of land use structure on balancing the supply and demand of ESs. The minimum cumulative resistance model, circuit corridor model, and wind direction model were utilized to analyze changes in flux and flow direction of ESs’ supply and demand. The results demonstrated that the following: (1) the supply of ESs generally increased, with a significant rise in demand for carbon sequestration service and a declining trend in habitat quality service demand. (2) A clear spatial mismatch existed between the supply and demand of ESs. (3) The impact of land use structure on the balance of ES supply and demand is complex. (4) Habitat quality and carbon sequestration services exhibited distinct spatial clustering patterns. (5) The flow patterns of habitat quality service were characterized by specific supply and demand areas, with corridors and pinch points indicating the flow paths and potential barriers; not all demand areas for carbon sequestration service can be satisfied due to variations in service levels and geographical distance. The innovation of this study lies in the following aspects: (1) it acknowledges the uniqueness of ecosystem services, with a focus on assessing habitat quality and carbon sequestration services; (2) it precisely quantifies the flow of ecosystem services, analyzes the spatial dynamics of service flows, and investigates the impact of changes in land-use structure on these flows; (3) it strengthens the correlation between the supply and demand of ecosystem services and socio-economic activities, uncovers the contradictions between supply and demand along with their underlying causes, and proposes effective strategies for resolution. The findings can provide theoretical and methodological references for the optimization of ES.</jats:p>"

Currently, upstream and downstream enterprises in the fresh food supply chain tend to delegate the cold chain transportation of fresh food to third–party cold chain logistics (CCL) service providers who offer more professional integrated preservation services. This study adopts coordination theory to research the delegation, coordination, and incentive strategies between a Fresh Food Producer, Distributor, and CCL Service Provider. The aim is to promote the efforts of the CCL Service Provider in improving freshness and achieving the overall optimal interests of the fresh food supply chain. First, the basic models of the Fresh Food Producer and Distributor individually entrusting the CCL Service Provider are established under different information conditions. Second, a collaborative delegation agency model between the Fresh Food Producer and Distributor is established on top of the basic models. Finally, through the optimal decision solutions under different information conditions and numerical calculations of preservation benefit levels, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) The more transparent and open the information environment, the more it can encourage the CCL Service Provider to improve the quality of their preservation services, allowing the Fresh Food Producer and Distributor to obtain more significant preservation benefits. However, when information is completely transparent, the incentive mechanisms formulated by the Fresh Food Producer and Distributor become ineffective. (2) Collaborative cooperation strategies can encourage the CCL Service Provider to enhance their preservation efforts while strengthening the effectiveness of relevant incentive strategies for the Fresh Food Producer and Distributor.</jats:p>"

However, the appropriate propagation techniques should be adopted to solve the rooting issues of cuttings. Therefore, the present research was designed to specify the optimal indole − 3−butyric acid (IBA) concentration and rooting medium type for obtaining good rooting and healthy plants. Three IBA levels (0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>) and five growing mediums (sand, sand: clay, sand: peat moss, sand: perlite, and sand: vermiculite as 1:1, v/v) were used. The experiment was performed in a randomized complete block design in three replications. The obtained data illustrated that roots number per cutting and rooting percentage reached the maximum values by treating <jats:italic>P. tithymaloids</jats:italic> cuttings with 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> IBA x sand: perlite or sand: vermiculite medium. Cultivating the treated-IBA 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> cuttings of <jats:italic>P. tithymaloids</jats:italic> in sand: perlite showed the most enhancements in plant height, branches number and leaves number, leaf area and herb dry weight. However, the heaviest root dry weight was noticed with IBA 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> x sand: peat moss medium. Except sand medium, all other tested media in combination with IBA at 1.0, 2.0–3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> showed remarkable stimulation effect on chlorophyll content. Sand: vermiculite mixture x IBA at 2.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> was the effective practice for improving carbohydrates percentage. By studying the anatomical changes of the adventitious root of <jats:italic>P. tithymaloids</jats:italic> plant, it was found that there was an increase in the root diameter, phloem and xylem tissues and xylem vessels diameter due to growing in sand: perlite x 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> IBA. In conclusion, dipping the cuttings bases of <jats:italic>P. tithymaloids</jats:italic> in 3.0 g L<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup> IBA and cultivation in sand: perlite considered the most effective combination practice for better rooting ability and growth and could be advisable for commercial production.</jats:p>",

The objective of this review was to prioritize chemical hazards for monitoring in the European animal feed supply chain. A step‐wise approach was designed for the prioritization, based on: historical occurrence of the chemicals in animal feed ingredients and animal feeds (in relation to European guidance values or maximum limits in feed); information on transfer of the chemical to edible animal products, and; the extent of human dietary intake of the products and possible adverse human health effects of the chemical. Possible prioritization outcomes were: high (H), medium (M), or low (L) priority for monitoring, or classification not possible (NC) because of limited available data on the transfer of the chemical to edible animal tissues. The selection of chemicals included (with results in parentheses): dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (H); brominated flame retardants (H); per‐ and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (H); the heavy metals arsenic (H) and cadmium (H) as well as lead (M) and mercury (M); aflatoxins (H), ochratoxin A (NC), and other mycotoxins (L); pyrrolizidine alkaloids (H) and other plant toxins (NC); organochlorine pesticides (H) and other pesticides (L); pharmaceutically active substances (M); hormones (NC); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (L), heat‐induced processing contaminants (NC), and mineral oils (NC).

Utilizing the widely distributed tidal current energy in island regions can enhance local energy and water supply security. To achieve economic and operational efficiency, it is crucial to fully account for the unique periodicity and intermittency of tidal current energy. In this study, a tidal current-powered freshwater and energy supply system is proposed. The marine current turbine adopts a direct-drive configuration and will be able to directly transfer the power of the turbine rotation to the seawater pump to improve the energy efficiency. Additionally, the system incorporates batteries for short-term energy storage, aimed at increasing the capacity factor of the electrolyzer. A simulation is conducted using measured inflow velocity data from a full 12 h tidal cycle. The results show that the turbine’s average power coefficient reaches 0.434, the electrolyzer’s average energy efficiency is 60.9%, the capacity factor is 70.1%, and the desalination system’s average specific energy consumption is 6.175 kWh/m3.

The task is to form a graph of the state of charge of the main battery with a limitation of the depth of discharge with the maximum use of renewable sources energy. The calculation method of the state of charge of a battery and power consumption graph when working with the grid and in autonomous mode has been improved, with the definition of recommendations for charging electric transport. A mechanism has been developed for correcting the power consumption based on the deviation of the battery charge state relative to the specified value, with the correction disabled to implement the function of eliminating the export of excess energy to the grid or gas generator. This ensures the limitation of the gas generator power within certain limits and helps to limit the influence of generation and load deviations relative to the forecast on the battery discharge depth. The structure of the energy processes model in the system for the daily operation cycle has been developed. In the process of modeling, the deviation of renewable energy generation up to 20% and 10% was studied simultane-ously with a 10% increase in load.</jats:p>",

Safely managed water services are also central to global cholera and diarrhoeal diseases prevention strategies. However, evidence remains scarce on how to efficiently improve piped water services in complex settings where infrastructure investments are most needed. We conducted a process evaluation of a large-scale water supply infrastructure improvement programme in Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in parallel to a pragmatic trial. Considering three evaluation domains–context, implementation, and population response–, we assessed the validity of the programme’s theory of change and underlying assumptions. Information sources included construction works documentation, operational and billing records from the water utility, and household surveys. The evaluation covers the period 2014–2021. Trial results are not within the scope of this manuscript. The programme did not achieve expected improvements in the water supply service during the evaluation period. Out of 16 assumptions underlying the theory of change, six remained valid, seven partially valid, and three turned out to be invalid. Contextual challenges included extreme flooding in 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted construction works. Issues related to electricity supply and the rise of Lake Tanganyika emphasise the need for cross-sectoral approaches and consideration of climate change in the planning of water supply infrastructure. Implementation challenges underlined the importance of capacity strengthening alongside infrastructure improvements. Population response elements suggest that affordability and informal practices such as tap sharing should be taken into account. The programme was a good example of early engagement with researchers and provides unique insights into the implementation of large-scale infrastructure improvements in a complex, low-income setting. Pragmatic evaluation approaches should be adopted for the generation of scientific evidence from complex programmes in order to optimise future infrastructure investments contributing to progress towards SDG6.</jats:p>"

The concentrations of crude protein, SID Lys, Met, Met + Cys Arg, Val, Thr, Leu, Ile, and Trp of the SF morning diet were the same as in the C diet. The crude protein content of the SF afternoon diet was lower (92%), while the SID values of Lys, Met, Met + Cys were identical compared to the C diet (100%). The SF treatment resulted in a reduced protein/N intake, better feed conversion ratio, higher eggshell thickness and apparent ileal digestibility of Asp, Leu, Lys, Gly, and Ser, and lower concentration of N forms (total, fecal, NH4+, uric acid, urinary) in the excreta compared to the C treatment. In Experiment 2, a control and a low protein (−2% crude protein but the same SID values of Lys, Met, Met + Cys, Thr, Val) SF treatment were compared for 6 weeks. The low protein SF treatment led to a decreased protein/N intake, higher laying rate, lower egg weight, higher ileal digestibility of Ala, Asp, Leu, and Ile, and similar N emission compared to the control SF treatment.</jats:p>"

This study develops a simulation model to explore the integration of heat pumps within active building systems for community heating decarbonisation. The model optimises heat pump operations in conjunction with thermal energy storage units to reduce peak demand on low-voltage networks by using real-time measured electricity demand data and modelled heat demand data for 76 houses. The study employs an algorithm that adjusts thermal storage charging and discharging cycles to align with off-peak periods. Three scenarios were simulated: a baseline with unoptimised heat pumps, a fixed threshold model, and an active building model with daily optimised thresholds. The results demonstrate that the active building model achieves a 21% reduction in peak demand on the low-voltage substation compared to the baseline scenario; it also reduces the total electrical energy consumption by 12% and carbon emissions by 17%. The fixed threshold scenario shows a 16% improvement in peak demand reduction, but it also shows an increase in energy consumption and emissions. These findings highlight the potential of active buildings to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of residential energy systems, marking a significant step toward decarbonising residential heating while maintaining grid stability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Uncontrolled dispersal of species in aquatic ecosystems has become one of the most important environmental problems. The main reason for the acceleration of this process is human economic activity. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to attacks by alien species, and the main vector is the discharge of ballast water. Despite the fact that most alien species do not take root, there are species that successfully naturalize in recipient reservoirs. The impact of alien species on aboriginal communities is usually characterized by ambivalence. The Kaliningrad (Vistula) Lagoon, which has 5 ports in its water area, has also been attacked by alien species. The most powerful invasions occurred in 1988 (polychaetes of the genus Marenzelleria), in 1999 (predatory branchial crustaceans Cercopagis pengoi) and in 2010 (bivalves Rangia cuneata).These alien species had a multidirectional impact on food supply of commercial fish species. The first large-scale introduction of Marenzelleria spp. the structure of the bottom community has changed, the role of Chironomidae in the food supply has sharply decreased. The result was a decrease in the catch of Abramis brama, whose favorite food is of Chironomidae. The second large-scale invasion, of predatory Ponto-Caspian cladoceran C. pengoi, changed the structure of the planktonic community of the lagoon. There was a decrease in zooplankton biomass, as a result of which competition for feed resources turned out to be not in favor of the juvenile of Clupea harengus, the main planktophage. The third large-scale invasion of North American bivalve R. cuneata, the most powerful filter, affected the planktonic and bottom communities of the lagoon. The biomass of zooplankton decreased sharply, which created increased trophic conditions among planktophages fish and led to a decrease in catch. At the same time, the phenomenon of Atlantic rangia had a positive effect on other groups of the bottom community, which contributed to an increase in the catch of mollusk-eating fish, the main of which is of Rutilus rutilus.</jats:p>",

This foundation is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of “social–ecological” systems in achieving sustainable development. Jilin Province, serving as a national ecological security buffer and experiencing rapid economic growth, exhibits a significant spatial imbalance between social and economic progress and ecological conservation. The balance of ecosystem service demand and supply is pivotal in this context, making Jilin Province an ideal study area. We employed a multifaceted approach, including MSPA, the InVEST model, landscape connectivity assessment, circuit theory, and ecological network integrity evaluation, to elucidate the spatial disparities between the demand and supply of ecosystem services. We then developed and optimized social and landscape ecological security patterns to meet human demands and safeguard ecological integrity, thereby promoting the sustainable development of “social–ecological” systems. The key findings are as follows: (1) The supply of ecosystem services shows a clear spatial gradient, with lower values in the west and higher in the east, while demand is concentrated in the central region with lower values in the east and west, indicating a pronounced spatial mismatch in Jilin Province. (2) The landscape ecological security pattern includes 18 barrier points, 33 pinch points, 166 ecological corridors, and 101 ecological sources. (3) The social–ecological security pattern comprises 119 demand sources and 150 supply–demand corridors. (4) The study introduces 14 supply–demand nodes and 47 optimization corridors, proposing zoning schemes for the eastern core protection area, the central ecological demand area, and the western core restoration area. Additionally, recommendations are concerning the optimization of the “social–ecological” system pattern. This research advances the theoretical understanding of “social–ecological” system development in Jilin Province and offers insights for more harmonized development strategies.</jats:p>"

Both straw return and tillage are essential practices for modifying saline‐alkali soils, however, their combined effects on soil properties, nitrogen(N) transformation and absorption, as well the crop yield remain inadequately understood. A field experiment was conducted to assess the cumulative impacts of straw return and tillage (rotary tillage, deep tillage and subsoiling) on soil salinity, nitrogen transformation and maize yield. The results revealed that the soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) significantly decreased from the 0–20 cm layer to the 20–40 cm layer, indicating that deep tillage was less effective on salt accumulation in the surface soil. The return of straw return and tillage practices significantly influenced the fractions of soil organic nitrogen (SON) and the distribution percentage in total nitrogen. Additionally, these practices notably interacted to increase soil acid insoluble‐N, active SON and stable SON. The combination of straw return and rotary tillage resulted in a higher content of stable SON in the 0–20 cm soil layer. Conversely, the combination of straw return and subsoiling proved to be more effective on soil available N and active SON supplying, as well as maintaining stable nitrogen levels. Furthermore, straw return combined with subsoiling achieved the highest plant nitrogen uptake and yield, with increases of 21.7% and 38.2%, respectively, compared to the rotary without straw. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that stable SON was the primary contributor influencing maize yield, while inorganic N in the 0–20 cm layer and hydrolysable ammonium nitrogen (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>‐N) in the 20–40 cm were also the closely related factors. These results provide a new insight for implementing straw return measures to enhance soil quality and increase crop production in saline‐alkali farmland.</jats:p>",

Hence, this article proposes a novel remote sensing detection framework for multi-scale objects with a rotating status and mutual occlusion, defined as EYMR-Net. This proposed approach is established on the YOLO-v7 architecture with a Swin Transformer backbone, which offers multi-scale receptive fields to mine massive features. Then, an enhanced attention module is added to exploit the spatial and dimensional interrelationships among different local characteristics. Subsequently, the effective rotating frame regression mechanism via circular smoothing labels is introduced to the EYMR-Net structure, addressing the problem of horizontal YOLO (You Only Look Once) frames ignoring direction changes. Extensive experiments on DOTA datasets demonstrated the outstanding performance of EYMR-Net, which achieved an impressive mAP0.5 of up to 74.3%. Further ablation experiments verified that our proposed approach obtains a balance between performance and efficiency, which is beneficial for practical remote sensing applications in transportation monitoring and supply chain management.</jats:p>"

However, the intermittent nature of RES, such as solar and wind, presents challenges for maintaining a stable energy supply. To address this issue, energy storage systems are essential. One promising technology is micro-compressed air energy storage (micro-CAES), which stores excess energy as compressed air and releases it when needed to balance supply and demand. This study investigates the integration of micro-CAES with RES in a 19-home microgrid in northern Portugal. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a microgrid configuration that includes 100 kW of solar PV, 70 kW of wind power, and a 50 kWh micro-CAES system. Using real-world data on electricity consumption and local renewable potential, a simulation is conducted to assess the performance of this system. The findings reveal that this configuration can supply up to 68.8% of the annual energy demand, significantly reducing reliance on the external grid and enhancing the system’s resilience. These results highlight the potential of micro-CAES to improve the efficiency and sustainability of small-scale renewable energy systems, demonstrating its value as a key component in future energy solutions.</jats:p>"

Through a field column experiment, the impact of micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation on maize plant height, stem diameter, leaf SPAD values, biomass, and yield was evaluated. The results showed that (1) irrigation methods significantly affected maize growth indicators such as plant height, stem diameter, and root dry weight. Micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation consistently promoted growth during all growth stages, especially under higher P application. (2) P application significantly increased the dry weight and P concentration in maize roots, stems, leaves, ears, and grains. Under micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation, the P concentrations in roots and grains increased by 59.28% to 92.59%. (3) Micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation significantly enhanced P uptake efficiency, partial factor productivity of P, and agronomic P use efficiency. Particularly under P1 and P2 treatments, the increases were 134.91% and 45.42%, respectively. Although the effect on apparent P recovery efficiency was relatively small, micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation still improved P utilization under moderate P levels. (4) Structural equation modeling indicated that P supply under micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation primarily regulated alkaline protease and alkaline phosphatase, enhancing soil P availability, which in turn promoted maize P accumulation and increased yield. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the combination of micro-nano bubble water drip irrigation and appropriate P application can effectively promote maize growth and nutrient utilization, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing irrigation and fertilization strategies in maize production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Developing countries face challenges in ensuring equitable, timely, and efficient vaccine availability at health facilities. In Uganda, the distribution of vaccines from district stores to the last-mile health facilities is hindered by an unpredictable and unreliable mixed push-pull delivery system. This system often results in poor vaccine management, stock-outs, and missed vaccination opportunities. This pilot study aimed to enhance the efficiency of last-mile vaccine delivery by implementing an informed push model. The specific goals were to improve vaccine lead time, standardize cold chain management during transportation, and evaluate the costs of implementing the informed push model. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the impact of the informed push model in Gomba district, Uganda. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected at baseline and endline. Quantitative data included mode, frequency, lead-time, and costs of vaccine delivery, vaccine stock status, and cold chain maintenance during transportation, gathered through semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data on experiences and challenges were collected using a guide. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis, while an ingredients approach was used for costing data. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data. The informed push system significantly improved vaccine delivery efficiency and quality in Gomba district. The average lead-time for vaccine delivery reduced from 14 days at baseline to 5 days at endline. Timely vaccine receipt at health facilities increased from 36.8% to 100%. Temperature monitoring during transit improved from 26.3% to 100%. The proportion of facilities experiencing stock-outs dropped from 79.0% to 36.8%. Monthly distribution costs decreased from $494.8 ($0.07 per child) to $445.9 ($0.06 per child). The informed push model is a cost-effective strategy for improving last-mile vaccine delivery by reducing lead times, enhancing cold chain management, and decreasing stock-outs. Integration into the national immunization program is recommended for broader adoption in Uganda.</jats:p>"

This is largely because higher spatial resolution studies on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in China have focused mainly on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This study uses a spatially detailed integrated energy-economy-climate model to evaluate DACCS for 31 provinces in China as the country pursues its goal of climate neutrality by 2060. We find that DACCS could expand China’s negative emissions capacity, particularly under sustainability-minded limits on bioenergy supply that are informed by bottom-up studies. But providing low-carbon electricity for multiple GtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DACCS may require over 600 GW of additional wind and solar capacity nationwide and comprise up to 30% of electricity demand in China’s northern provinces. Investment requirements for DACCS range from $330 to $530 billion by 2060 but could be repaid manyfold in the form of avoided mitigation costs, which DACCS deployment could reduce by up to $6 trillion over the same period. Enhanced efforts to lower residual CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions that must be offset with CDR under a net-zero paradigm reduce but do not eliminate the use of DACCS for mitigation. For decision-makers and the energy-economy models guiding them, our results highlight the value of expanding beyond the current reliance on biomass for negative emissions in China.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, we investigated how factors such as demand variability, forecast biases from the manufacturer and the retailer, and the forecast correlation coefficient affect the performance of the supply chain and the benefits of sharing information. Our findings indicate that the strategies of supply chain members remain unaffected by the chosen production models and that information sharing proves advantageous for the manufacturer and the retailer. Especially for manufacturers, profits in a “make-to-order” scenario surpass those in a “make-to-stock” scenario.

The findings highlight that the optimal willingness to improve service quality in a service supply chain is not necessarily infinitely close to 100%, and is influenced by factors such as revenue share, cost, effect, and dominant position. In cases where the collaborative improvement effect is weak, even the dominant member may display a limited willingness, rendering centralized decision-making meaningless. If the collaborative improvement effect surpasses the combined independent improvement effects, the dominant position can help strengthen willingness, although it may not always result in higher profits. Conversely, a power-balanced scenario can be advantageous in achieving the highest profit for the entire supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, traditional natural language processing methods often struggle with specialized terminology and context, and they lack the adaptability to handle complex text classifications. The diversity and evolving nature of agricultural texts make deep semantic understanding and integration of contextual knowledge especially challenging. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a Bidirectional Encoder Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (AES-BERCNN) tailored for short-text classification in agricultural expert systems. We designed an Agricultural Text Encoder (ATE) with a six-layer transformer architecture to capture both preceding and following word information. A recursive convolutional neural network based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) was also developed to merge contextual information and learn complex semantic features, which are then combined with the ATE output and refined through max-pooling to form the final feature representation. The AES-BERCNN model was tested on a self-constructed agricultural dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.63% in text classification. Its generalization ability was further verified on the Tsinghua News dataset. Compared to other models such as TextCNN, DPCNN, BiLSTM, and BERT-based models, the AES-BERCNN shows clear advantages in agricultural text classification. This work provides precise and timely technical support for intelligent agricultural expert systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of complex high-rise buildings has made building management increasingly challenging, especially the nighttime supervision of university laboratories. Idle occupation increases the risk of accidents and undermines campus sustainability. Effective occupancy detection is essential for optimizing campus building safety and energy efficiency. Environmental sensors for occupancy detection offer limited coverage and are costly, making them unsuitable for campuses. Surveillance cameras, as part of campus infrastructure, provide wide coverage. On this basis, we designed a detection algorithm that uses light brightness to assess nighttime building use. Experimental results showed that the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 98.67%, enabling large-scale nighttime occupancy detection without the need for installing additional sensors, significantly improving the efficiency of campus building management. In addition, to address the limitations of indoor space representation in geographic information system (GIS) management models, this paper developed a comprehensive 3D GIS model based on a “building–floor–room” hierarchical structure, utilizing oblique photogrammetry and laser scanning technology. This study combined the detection results with real-world 3D data for visualization, providing a new perspective for the 3D spatiotemporal refinement of complex high-rise buildings, and providing a reference framework for the detection and analysis of other types of building environments.</jats:p>"
