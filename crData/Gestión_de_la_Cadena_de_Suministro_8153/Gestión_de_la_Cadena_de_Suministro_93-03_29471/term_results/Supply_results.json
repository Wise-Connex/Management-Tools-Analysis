The definition of the gas \"bubble\" can be different and confusing to most producer and consumer groups. Major oil companies, independent producers, pipelines, gas marketers, industrial users, electric utilities and local distribution companies (LDCS) must collectively understand the present supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas industry. While certain industry. groups proclaim a gas supply \"bubble\", others are concerned about the end of the deliverability \"bubble\". Even though the domestic resource base of natural gas is enormous, the proved reserves represent only a very small fraction of the resource base. Moreover, the proved reserves of natural gas have been declining since 1970. In 1970, the proved natural gas reserves were 290.7 trillion cubic feet and at year end 1991 they had declined to 167.1 trillion cubic feet. Natural gas consumption peaked in 1973 at 21.7 trillion cubic feet and declined to 163 trillion cubic feet by 1986. The decline in gas consumption was a response to various regulatory actions and economic events. This decline in consumption was the primary cause of the deliverability \"bubble\". Since 1986, natural gas consumption has shown a steady increase. There exists a considerable body of evidence which can be interpreted to show that a deliverability shortfall in natural gas supply is imminent and the \"bubble\" will soon burst.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>A considerable amount of publicity has been generated by supply studies, including a soon to be published report from the National Petroleum Council which concludes that the United States has a resource base of 1300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The general public, including government policy makers, might interpret this conclusion as representing a nearly limitless supply of natural gas. Nothing could be further from the truth. This volume of resource gas includes both proved reserves and unproved quantities of gas. The unproved category includes quantities of gas that are undiscovered, unidentified, except in the broadest of terms, and currently uneconomic to produce. Proved reserves, on the other hand, are quantities of gas that have been discovered, identified and can be produced and marketed at current prices and costs. With this background, is it any wonder there is so much confusion surrounding the much-publicized and long- lasting \"bubble\"?</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The term \"bubble\" has been used to describe the oversupply of natural gas reserves and excess production capacity. The analysis of statistical data in conjunction with regulatory reaction to structural changes can help identify the causes of this \"bubble\" and forecast its demise.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Regulatory changes over the past twenty years have had a profound effect on gas reserves, gas production and gas demand. Before the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) was passed by Congress in 1978, regulators encouraged the industry to create excess deliverability and long-term supplies. Passage of the NGPA spurred a drilling frenzy focused mostly on deep, high cost gas which commanded a higher price.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In 1978 Congress passed the Fuel Use Act which prohibited the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel in newly constructed facilities. These events coupled with an economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for natural gas creating an oversupply of gas reserves with excess delivery capacity.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 63^</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Its inherent protectionism is increasingly labelled anachronistic in the contemporary, globally competitive economy. This article probes the origins and political economy of the crisis in supply management. It argues that the pragmatism that led to the creation of private interest governments in the dairy and poultry sectors was not accompanied by the necessary degree of broader support in the Canadian political community for the goals and instruments of supply management. Canada's predominantly “business liberalism” norms have never been fully hospitable to the instruments and structures of supply management. Moreover, the legitimacy of poultry marketing agencies, in particular, has been further eroded by two features of their institutional design which have impeded their effective functioning: the inordinate influence they give producers viz‐a‐viz state and other interests within the sector; and their decision‐making rules and procedures, which undermine the incentives for producers to compromise and which encourage parochialism at the expense of the interest of the sector as a whole. As the latter causes national marketing agencies to haemorrhage internally, they are simultaneously faced by an altered domestic and international political economy which gives the advantage to antagonistic interests and ideas. While reform of supply management and the private interest governments within which it is embedded appears inevitable, and is certainly defensible, it will be important for decision‐makers to bear in mind that the public will not be well served by reforms that tip the balance of power unevenly in favour of processor and trade liberalization interests.</jats:p><jats:p>Sommaire: La gestion de l'offre nationale dans les secteurs laitier et de la volaille au Canada est assaillie de toute part. Dans le cadre de l'économie actuelle, concurrentielle au niveaub mondial, on considère de plus en plus que son protectionnisme inhérent est anachronique. Le présent article examine les origines et l'économie politique de la crise qui frappe la gestion de l'offre. En outre, il soutient que le pragmatisme qui a menéà l'établissement de gouvernements d'intérět privé dans les secteurs du lait et de la volaille, n'avait pas un appui suffisant de la part de la communauté politique canadienne en ce qui concerne les objectifs et instruments de la gestion de l'offre. Lespréceptes canadiens dominés par le «libéralisme d'affaires» n'ont jamais ététout à fait favorables aux outils et aux structures de la gestion de l'offre. De plus, le caractère légitime des organismes de commercialisation de la volaille, en particulier, a été sapé davantage par deux caractéristiques de sa conception měme, qui en ont empěché le fonctionnement efficace. La première de ces caractéristiques est l'influence excessive que ces organismes procurent aux producteurs relativement aux intérěts étatiques ou autres dans le secteur; deuxièmement, leurs règles et procédures décisionnelles font que les producteurs sont peu enclins au compromis et qu'ils favorisent leurs intérěts les plus étroits aum dépens des intérěts du secteur dans son ensemble. Pendant que ce dernier effet entrai&amp;#x030c;ne une hémorragie interne au sein des organismes nationaux de commercialisation, ces derniers doivent simultanément faire face à une économie politique nationale et internartionale modifiée, qui favorise des intérěts et idées s'opposant à la gestion de l'offre. Bien qu'une réforme de la gestion de l'offre et des gouvernements d'intérět privé au sein desquels elle est ancrée semble inévitable (et elle est certainment justifiable), il importe que les décideurs sachent bien que le public sera mal servi par des réformes qui feraient pencher la balance des pouvoirs public sera mal servi par des réformes qui feraient pencher la balance des pouvoirs de manière inégale en faveur des intéréts des processeurs ou de la libéralisation du commerce.</jats:p>",

Corona). The assimilate supply was varied by maintaining different numbers of fruits per plant or maintaining different irradiances. The growth rate of a cucumber fruit strongly increased with increasing assimilate supply, but its growing period was not noticeably affected. At a low assimilate supply both cell number and cell size were reduced. Increasing the assimilate supply at different stages of fruit development showed that the early development of a cucumber fruit was not crucial for setting its growth potential. A small number of cells, due to a low assimilate supply, during early fruit development, was to a great extent compensated by an increased expansion rate of individual cells. It is concluded that cell number is not an important determinant of fruit size in cucumber, although fruit size is often positively correlated with cell number. In the early stages of fruit development the effect of irradiance on the fruit growth rate depends on the presence of an earlier developed fruit because of dom‐inance between fruits. In later stages of fruit development, a decrease in irradiance reduced the growth rate of all fruits relatively to the same extent independent of age or presence of other fruits.</jats:p>",

This case report adds to the growing body of evidence that control of milk production shifts from endocrine to autocrine control shortly after delivery. Autocrine control allows efficient regulation of milk supply to match the needs of the infant. A recently discovered factor in human milk that inhibits lactose and casein synthesis in vitro is believed to be responsible for local, short term control of milk production. This study suggests that practices which result in infrequent or incomplete removal of milk from the breast lead to decreased milk production and should be abandoned. </jats:p>",

The quantity of capital deployed depends primarily on the rotation length and the output price for timber. In a long‐run timber supply model this gives rise to a “backward bending” supply curve. This paper summarizes a long‐run model of timber supply, and computes the associated price and inventory elasticities. The role of capital in timber production is explored through a continuous‐time formulation of the usual Faustmann point‐input/point‐output model.

Our objective was to determine the influence of endophyte on drought stress tolerance, persistence, and yield components of field‐grown tall fescue on a Typic Hapludalfs soil. A water supply gradient was established during 1988 and 1989 with line‐source irrigation on established populations of 0 and 80% endophyte‐infected tall fescue. Whole plots consisted of endophyte infection status, across which a gradient of water was applied in a strip‐split fashion with eight replicates. Tiller population density and herbage yield were determined every 28 d and yield components were measured on selected dates. Relative to populations receiving high irrigation (375‐650 mm applied), tiller density in nonirrigated stands (0‐50 mm applied) from July to October 1988 was reduced an average of 42% in infected tall fescue and 55% in noninfected tall fescue. Tiller density of nonirrigated, infected populations recovered fully to that of high irrigation treatments by 17 November, whereas that of nonirrigated, endophyte‐free populations recovered to only 62% of irrigated treatments. The advantage in population density due to endophyte infection continued throughout 1989, a relatively wet year. A benefit in total forage yield due to endophyte infection was not consistently evident because of greater yield per tiller in endophyte‐free stands in 1989. Enhanced tiller density and survival were associated with endophyte infection during severe water deficit, and this advantage continued throughout the subsequent year. Endophyte infection confers population stability in tall fescue during drought stress through improved tiller and whole plant survival.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In ruminants, daily urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD) reflects the absorption of microbial purines and can be used as an index of microbial protein supply (Chen, Ørskov and Hovell, 1991). The application could be extended to farm conditions if measurements based on spot urine samples or plasma could serve as an alternative index. The objective of this study was to examine whether PD concentrations in spot urine or plasma samples vary diurnally during a given feeding regime and if they reflect differences in daily PD excretion induced by varying feed intake.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A method of analysis of steadily loaded hydrodynamic journal bearings with a single axial groove (either on the load line or at 90° to the load line) or two diametrically opposed axial grooves is described. The method is based on Elrod's cavitation algorithm (which ensures conservation of mass flow in both the full film and the cavitated regions) and is able to accommodate specified lubricant supply conditions, namely groove size and location and supply pressure. Special attention has been given to the determination of flowrate. </jats:p><jats:p> The equation governing the distribution of pressure around the bearing has been solved numerically using a finite differences approximation and multi-grid techniques to accelerate the convergence of the solution. Performance predictions of the analysis are compared with published experimental data and with experimental measurements obtained in laboratory tests carried out by the authors. The data used cover all grooving arrangements studied. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The recently introduced metabolisable protein system for ruminants (Webster 1992) relates microbial nitrogen production to daily supply of fermentable metabolisable energy and effective rumen degradable protein but does not consider the effect of the pattern of supply of nutrients to rumen microbes on their efficiency and growth. However, synchronising the hourly supply of nitrogen and energy yielding substrates to rumen micro-organisms has been shown to increase the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (Sinclair <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> 1993). The objective of the current experiment was to examine the effects of synchronising the hourly supply of energy and nitrogen in diets with a similar carbohydrate composition but differing in the rate of protein degradation, on rumen fermentation and microbial protein synthesis in sheep.</jats:p>",
