      "abstract": "<jats:p>The question of whether or not we are witnessing a profound transformation in the nature of relations between industrial buyers and their suppliers towards more collaborative ways of working lies at the heart of more general debates about the nature and direction of organisational change in late twentieth century capitalism. The emergence of, and growing interest in, new network forms of organisation ‐ as distinct from internal bureaucratic and external market‐based forms of transaction governance (e.g. Powell, 1990) ‐ appears to suggest that, in some sectors at least, new forms of relationship are developing between capitalist producers and their suppliers which, moreover, have implications for long term business success. Japanese just‐in‐time production systems, in particular, have had an important influence upon contemporary manufacturing thinking and practice and in many respects are said to provide key elements of a model of ‘best practice’ in the organisation and management of buyer‐supplier relations. The theme of close inter‐organisational collaboration is also apparent in the analysis of, and debates surrounding, new or emergent modes of organisation ‐ for example, the networks of local small firms identified in the ‘flexible specialisation’ literature.</jats:p>",

Such a function provides the foundation for deriving a theoretically consistent supply equation. Some recent studies have attempted to obtain a timber supply equation by manipulating the stand-level Faustmann model. As a result of inappropriate approaches and assumptions, their conclusions may be false. In this article, we build on the Faustmann-Smith-Samuelson model first developed by Comolli (1981) to examine aggregate timber production. We show this model to have the desired properties of a profit function that allows us to test various issues. It is then found that the general beliefs of negatively sloped per-land-unit supply curves and positively sloped aggregate supply curve are robust. Finally, we present several applications and implications of our modeling approach. For. Sci 43(1):113-120.</jats:p>",

We explore the joint optimization of contract parameters and inventory control policy in such environments. We first model and derive the optimal periodic review inventory policy corresponding to a given supply contract, which generates piecewise-linear convex ordering costs. The optimal policy has two critical levels, and there is a range of stock levels for which the quantity ordered equals the contract volume. To numerically compute the critical levels, we model consecutive inventory levels as a Markov Chain, whose steady-state distribution is used to compute the holding, shortage and transportation costs. We then use the resulting total costs to derive the optimal contract volume. Various examples are provided. The optimal contracted delivery frequency can also be computed. </jats:p>",

Here, long-run supply and demand elasticities were derived with a nonparametric method exploiting the consequences of the weak axiom of profit maximization (WAPM). No assumption was required regarding the form of the profit function, and all own-price elasticities necessarily had the expected theoretical signs. But, an infinite number of quantity responses being consistent with the theory and data, finding a unique response required a new assumption: that quantities adjusted just enough to satisfy the WAPM. The data pertained to the pulp and paper industries of the United States and Canada from 1959 to 1987. They recognized four outputs and nine inputs. A price shock of 20% led to elasticities that closely satisfied local homogeneity of the supply/demand functions, and symmetry of their price derivatives. Output supplies were all elastic, or nearly so, with respect to their own prices. The own-price elasticities of input demand ranged from -0.4 to -2.2, demand for capital being one of the most elastic. Cross-price elasticities tended to be small. The method was also applied to make out-of-sample forecast of inputs and outputs conditional on observed prices, under nonregressive technical change. Forecasts for 1983 to 1987 were generally unbiased. A synthesis of parametric and nonparametric methods is still needed to improve forecasts. For. Sci. 43(1):35-45.</jats:p>",

Thus posterior transposition of anterior rhombomeres to the r7/8 level results in the activation of Hox genes of the four first paralog groups and in homeotic transformations of the neuroepithelial fate according to its position along the anteroposterior axis. We demonstrate here that although the anteroposterior levels of r2 to r6 express Hox genes they do not have inducing activity on more anterior territories. If transposed at the posterior rhombencephalon and trunk level, however, the same anterior regions are able to express Hox gene such as Hoxa-2, a-3 or b-4. We also provide evidence that these signals are transferred by two paths: one vertical, arising from the paraxial mesoderm, and one planar, travelling in the neural epithelium. The competence to express Hox genes extends up to the forebrain and midbrain but expression of Hox genes does not preclude Otx2 expression in these territories and results only in slight changes in their phenotypes. Similarly, rhombomeres transplanted to posterior truncal levels turned out to be able to express posterior genes of the first eight paralog groups to the exclusion of others located downstream in the Hox genes genomic clusters. This suggests that the neural tube is divided into large territories characterized by different Hox gene regulatory features.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> ▪ Abstract  Safe and efficient treatment of drinking water has been one of the major public health advances of the twentieth century. People in developed countries generally take for granted that their water is safe to drink, a luxury the majority of the world's population does not have. The leading cause of infant mortality in the developing world is infectious diarrhea, and the prevalence of diarrheal pathogens is largely influenced by the quality and quantity of clean water available for drinking and washing. Until recently, modern water treatment had all but eliminated these concerns in developed nations. Over the past two decades, however, the safety of our water supply has been threatened by the emergence of Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoal pathogen. The hearty oocysts of this organism survive chlorination and filtration to cause a diarrheal illness that, while unpleasant enough in healthy people, is devastating in immunocompromised individuals. The 1993 Milwaukee outbreak, in which 403,000 people developed diarrhea from drinking water that met all the updated federal safety standards, demonstrated the tremendous public health importance of this organism. While earlier attention had focused on Giardia and amebic infections, the other \"emerging\" protozoan besides Cryptosporidium is Cyclospora. This review discusses the protozoal pathogens, including Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cyclospora cayetanensis, that cause waterborne diarrheal outbreaks and the threats they pose to the public. </jats:p>",

To scrutinize further how citrate addition may alter metabolic flux regulation and the degree that the observed carbon yield corresponds to the maximal value, experimental (by least-squares analysis) and optimal (by linear programming) fluxes and yields were contrasted. Networks with differing reaction routes, directionality constraints, and transhydrogenase activities were examined. To attain an elevated carbon yield, citrate-glucose utilization need not alleviate any stoichiometric constraints that can sometimes interfere with the attainment of network objectives. Rather, the high carbon yield and nil acid formation attained may be linked to restriction of glycolytic capacity, particularly at the level of pyruvate kinase, which is consistent with a hypothesized effect of coupled metal-citrate uptake. Allowing for malic enzyme activity, hexose monophosphate pathway cycling, and transhydrogenase activity may also lead to the flux distributions underlying the high carbon yield observed. Finally, the observed carbon yield corresponded well to the maximum yield provided by all the network alternatives examined. Collectively, these results suggest that (i) the observed carbon yield is essentially equal to the maximal values associated with plausible networks and (ii), as suggested by others, nonoptimal flux regulation may contribute significantly to apparent cellular maintenance requirements.</jats:p>",

Thirty men with PAOD were treated with a single dose of 5 mg felodipine or placebo. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), Doppler ankle pressure (DAP), calf blood flow (CBF) by venous occlusion plethysmography and calf transcutaneous oxygen tension (tc pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) were measured during a cycle ergometry. Felodipine reduced SBP significantly (from 149 to 136 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05), while placebo did not. DAP increased slightly but not significantly in both groups. The pressure gradient between SBP and DAP fell significantly in the felodipine group (60 vs 39 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01) but not in the placebo group (59 vs 56 mmHg). There was a trend for lower velocity in tc pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decrease during the stress test and higher velocity of tc pO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increase during recovery from exercise in the felodipine group although the differences between both groups were not significant.

In conclusion, while lowering SBP, felodipine increased slightly, or at least maintained, the blood supply to the calves in PAOD patients, which probably results from reducing collateral vascular resistance. </jats:p>",
