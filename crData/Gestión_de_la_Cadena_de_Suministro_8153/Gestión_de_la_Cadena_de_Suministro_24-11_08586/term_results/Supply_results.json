      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Internal controls in the supply chain management (SCM) are very important as they are the checks and balances that ensure compliance with rules and regulations. Internal controls further promote compliance, increase transparency and accountability and reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions.Objectives: The study examined the factors influencing internal controls within the SCM function in the Department of Social Development (DSD), South Africa.Method: Using a qualitative research approach and a case study design, data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analyses were used to interpret the findings.Results: The study’s findings established that there are challenges affecting the effectiveness of internal controls in the SCM function, namely, poor policy implementation, outdated SCM policy, a lack of training on policies and procedures, inadequate monitoring and evaluation of SCM, non-compliance with SCM rules and regulations, capacity constraints in the SCM directorate and a lack of consequence management.Conclusion: Effective internal controls are crucial for organisations to compete successfully in the supply chain environment. In this regard, there must be adherence to financial management processes and procedures that guide and serve as internal controls.Contribution: The study contributes towards the strengthening of internal controls in the DSD by paying particular attention to the five essential components of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework.</jats:p>"

This document explores the cumulative published literature from 2014 and 2024, so as to ascertain the impact of big data analytics on supply chain optimization. 64 articles were selected from diverse academic journals, and from these articles, information was gathered, analyzed, and organized. The results shows that Big data is often used for making predictions in SCO; big data analytics has a lot of difficulties dealing with large amounts of data related to managing the supply chain, which include too much data, problems with data quality, keeping data safe and private, difficulty in analyzing data, ability to grow as needed, and complicated supply chains. The study recommends that big data projects should begin with specific goals instead of just hoping people will use them. Starting with small test projects can help show the benefits of big data analytics.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the results may not be representative of different circumstances or periods. This study uncovered several noteworthy findings. The authors found that SCCs fully mediate the relationship between Supply Chain Management IT Integration (SCMITI) and SCR. In addition, the authors found that SCRM positively moderates the relationship between SCMITI and SCCs.

Businesses must invest in SCMITI and SCRM to boost their SCR through developing IT-driven SCCs to ensure consistent business continuity. SCMITI does not necessarily increase SCR resilience when it is done poorly and does not lead to SCCs effectively. In this regard, managers must rely on collective wisdom to determine which technologies and IT applications will best meet their business needs and their peers’ requirements in the supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study sheds light on the mechanisms through which IT enhances SCR.

It aims to identify effective strategies, such as supplier diversification and digitalization, that help Malaysian companies mitigate disruptions. The findings offer insights to enhance operational continuity and adaptability within Malaysia's unique risk environment.\r\nMethodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.\r\nFindings: The study found that effective risk management strategies, like supplier diversification and real-time monitoring, significantly enhance supply chain resilience in Malaysia. Companies adopting these strategies experienced fewer disruptions and quicker recovery times. However, challenges such as high costs and limited technology access still hinder broader adoption among smaller firms.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Resource-based view (RBV), contingency theory &amp; high reliability theory (HRT) may be used to anchor future studies on the relationship between risk management strategies and supply chain resilience in Malaysia. Practically, companies should implement risk management strategies that are tailored to their specific supply chain contexts and risks. At the policy level, governments and industry bodies should support the adoption of resilience-enhancing technologies by offering financial incentives or subsidies, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises.</jats:p>"

In order to remain a float, amidst cutthroat competition and ever increasing customer expectations, enterprises are depending on capability and excellence of their supply chain. With an aim of gaining competitive advantage;most enterprises have embraced supply chain integration (SCI).As part of supply chain ambidexterity (SCX) practices;SCI aims at establishing cohesion, enhancing linkages and collaboration between an enterprise and its trading partners; such that, rather than letting each individual function or unit exist in its own silo, disconnect in supply chain is decreased;and linkages between trading partners is established.There partners include: suppliers, customers, logistics service providers and internal user departments.\r\nMethodology: This thesis was anchored on relevant theories; and employed a mixed research design in conducting stratified sampling targeting a population of 594 respondents made up of supply chain managers, finance managers and food and beverage managers; in each and every classified tourism enterprise in Kenya. Both primary and secondary data were collected. Structured research instrument was used to collect primary data. Construct validity method was applied in testing the adequacy of the research instrument. Further, pilot testing was conducted on data collection instruments upon which it was established that the instruments were reliable and valid. Data collected was analyzed with the help of statistical packages for social sciences version 24.\r\nFindings: By employing supplier integration, internal integration and customer integration as predictors; with supply chain maturity level as a moderating variable; this thesis established the influence of SCI on performance of classified tourism enterprises in Kenya. The results found that SCI have a significant influence on performance of classified tourism enterprises in Kenya. Besides, supply chain maturity level was found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between predictor variables and response variables.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The thesis underscores the need for enterprises to enhance the uptake of SCI and other SCX practices to enhance their performance; and additionally, recommends further reasearches to be conducted on SCI targeting other industries anchoring Kenyan economy with an aim of providing policy guideline to decision makers.</jats:p>"

This paper examines the battery supply strategy of an entrant manufacturer(m2), in a two-tier supply chain that includes a battery supplier (s), an incumbent manufacturer (m1), and the aforementioned entrant. It investigates these strategies under the influence of the brand spillover effect. It reveals that when m1 opts for direct battery procurement, if m2 boasts higher after-sales service standards, adopting a technology cooperation strategy becomes more advantageous. A sweet spot exists wherein, given m2's brand power and after-sales service level fall within a certain range, all supply chain participants can achieve mutual benefits. In scenarios where m1 depends on technology cooperation for its battery supply, it is advisable for m2 to mirror this approach by also engaging in technology cooperation.</p>",

Indeed, Industry 4.0 is increasingly presented as a must for improving productivity and ensuring economic growth in manufacturing companies. On the other hand, many companies have already partially or fully implemented Lean principles and tools. A number of aspects remain to be clarified regarding the existing links between Industry 4.0 and the Lean approach: is there a hierarchy, improvement or complementarity between the two approaches? What are the links between the two approaches? This chapter seeks to highlight the links that exist between the two approaches in terms of continuous improvement and operational performance. To this end, we have highlighted the principles and technologies proposed by lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0 respectively.

To better understand the influence of socioeconomic and climate change on water supply, this study employed an integrated methodological approach that included the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrology and the water evaluation and planning (WEAP) models. Water development scenarios were created for two time periods: near future (2021–2040) and full development (2041–2060). During the current account period, water for irrigation delivery was balanced, and existing hydropower facilities generated energy at full capacity (3,159 GWh). However, irrigation water supply in the near future and full development scenarios shows a shortfall (267 Mm3 and 594 Mm3 under RCP4.5, and 213 Mm3 and 611 Mm3 under RCP8.5, respectively). Despite the basin's energy production will increase during the scenario periods, under-construction and planned hydropower plants are predicted to operate at less than full capacity (44,921 GWh under RCP4.5 and 44,539 GWh under RCP8.5). The study concluded that climate change-induced water availability and irrigation expansion would contribute to the water supply-demand mismatch. As a result, water resource management is required to increase water availability, minimize water demand, and reduce unmet demand.</jats:p>",

In this work, we make the very first attempt to optimize the interaction between blood centers and hospitals. To that end, this paper investigates collection, production, replenishment, issuing, inventory, and wastage decisions under three different blood supply chain channel structures, that is, the decentralized, centralized, and coordinated structures. We propose a bi‐level optimization program to model the decentralized system and use the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions to solve that. In such a system, hospitals tend to order more than their actual need, resulting in overcollection, overproduction, and high wastage rates. On the other hand, in a centralized system decisions are made by a central decision‐maker, which results in higher performance. Recognizing the challenges of implementing a centralized system, we design a novel coordination mechanism to motivate hospitals to operate in a centralized system. Analysis of a case study in Canada indicates that integration can significantly improve the performance of system; allowing substitution between blood products can decrease the total cost of the blood supply chain by 14.41%; an increase in supply or decrease in demand can be detrimental under inappropriate structure, facilitating coordination mechanism; offering subsidy beyond a threshold is not beneficial to the blood centers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains operate under the changing influences of multiple external and internal factors. Sustainable supply chain development requires an assessment of these factors, as well as drivers and barriers. The authors' analysis of supply chain research has not found a universally accepted methodology for selecting harmonized implementation of methods and instruments for designing sustainable supply chains, as well as assessing sustainability. Various sustainability assessment criteria, methods, and models based on the consideration of the influence of different factors are used depending on the type and structure of the supply chain. This study proposes a system of drivers for sustainable supply chain development. The peculiarity of the used supply chain model is the universality of its structure, which ensures the realization by the structural elements of the chain of all known functional areas of logistics. A framework for sustainable supply chain drivers' multi-criteria assessment based on the use of the original two-level system of drivers' assessment criteria is developed. The combination of DEMATEL and CRADIS multi-criteria methods is applied to rank the efficiency of drivers for achieving sustainable development goals, both for the supply chain as a whole and for each of its structural elements. The results of the supply chain sustainability drivers' ranking and the framework developed by the authors are intended to justify decisions on the green logistics methods and instruments selection.</jats:p>"

The results show the following: (1) A manufacturer in a high-capacity state has lots of excess capacity, so no strategic inventory co-ordination is required. (2) When a manufacturer is in a medium-capacity state, it can co-ordinate the production capacity in the nonbusy season through capacity allocation, achieve balanced production scheduling, and improve the sustainability of the manufacturer’s operation; the lower the manufacturer’s capacity, the higher the manufacturer’s strategic inventory quantity. (3) When the manufacturer is in a state of low capacity, the manufacturer uses all production capacity but still cannot satisfy off-season and busy season demand at the same time; the manufacturer will reduce product demand by increasing product prices and according to the unit product marginal income of the decision-making capacity allocation in the nonbusy season, the distribution ratio is related to the manufacturer’s capacity and product parameters. (4) Three optimal production capacity decision schemes for manufacturers under different production costs and inventory costs are obtained.</jats:p>"

The empirical result demonstrates that enterprise digital capability does not directly have a significant impact on supply chain digitalization, and the supply chain cooperation capabilities play a mediating role between an enterprise’s digital capability and supply chain digitalization. The results are robust as we thoroughly consider the direction of enterprise capabilities and verify the systematic requirements of supply chain digitalization and the high order of enterprise digital capability.

With the increasingawareness of climate change, social inequalities, and governance issues, companies worldwide areturning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain, and theInternet of Things (IoT) to embed ESG principles into their logistics operations. This article exploresthe role of smart logistics in promoting sustainability and aligning supply chains with ESG goals. Ithighlights the environmental aspect by showcasing how AI and big data-driven route optimizationcan reduce fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions. The use of electric vehicles (EVs) andhybrid trucks is also discussed, particularly for last-mile deliveries, as part of efforts to minimize thecarbon footprint of logistics operations. Additionally, smart warehouses equipped with IoT devices,automation, and AI-driven systems significantly contribute to improving energy efficiency andreducing waste, further advancing the sustainability agenda. Social responsibility in the context ofESG is equally emphasized, particularly regarding labor practices in global supply chains.Technologies such as blockchain enhance transparency by allowing companies to trace the origin ofproducts and verify adherence to fair labor standards. AI and data analytics are also crucial formonitoring supplier compliance with social standards, reducing risks associated with unethicalpractices. Governance, the third pillar of ESG, plays a critical role in promoting transparency andaccountability across supply chains. Smart technologies help improve oversight, ensure compliancewith regulatory requirements, and mitigate risks related to corruption and fraud. In conclusion, thearticle underscores the importance of integrating ESG principles into smart logistics as a strategicimperative for companies looking to enhance their competitiveness, resilience, and long-term successin the global marketplace.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sulphur is an essential nutrient that fulfils various important functions in plants, including the formation of amino acids, proteins, chlorophyll and the support of nitrogen uptake, e.g. in legumes. A lack of sulphur not only impairs plant growth, but also quality and resistance to disease. In addition, the S supply is strongly influenced by soil and hydrological factors. The sulphur content of the atmosphere due to industrial combustion has fallen sharply in recent decades, which has ultimately led to a drop in S levels in the soil and also in certain plant species, initially in conventional farming and later particularly in organic farming. As a result, there has been a great increase in research into the causes and ways and means of improving yield and quality deficiencies on farms. \nIn this summarised study, data from 98 sites in Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Great Britain) were recorded from 1998 to 2023. The sulphur fertiliser trials were conducted on farms and experimental stations under organic farming conditions. 1169 treatment variants and 598 standard variants without or with reduced S-fertilisation were analysed. Fertilisation was carried out with various sources of sulphur, including kieserite, gypsum, elemental sulphur, epsom salt and other types, in different quantities and forms, usually directly before or during crop cultivation. Soil analyses were done according to VDLUFA specifications in Germany or comparable standards in Central Europe. The amounts of plant-available S in the soil were determined at depths of 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm and 60–90 cm. Site characteristics such as Smin, Nmin, soil type, pH value, precipitation and the extent of livestock farming were recorded.\nA sufficient amount of data was available for each experimental aspect to quantitatively describe the influence of increasing S supply to the soil or plant species groups (permanent grassland, lucerne-clover-grass, grain legumes, cereals) from severe deficiency to oversupply. The analyses therefore focused on establishing relationships between yield responses, correlations with the nitrogen uptake of crop species and N2 fixation in legumes and the nutrient supply with plant-available sulphur. The aim of these investigations was to develop assessment methods for the soil supply with available sulphur to achieve optimum DM yields. The results were also used to develop practical methods for determining fertiliser requirements for different crop species in organic farming.</jats:p>"

This paper introduces a novel demand-supply matchmaking (DSM) model within an integrated platform designed to improve fairness and sustainability in auction environments, aligning with the principles of the circular economy. The platform encompasses the DSM model, which addresses key challenges in supply chain management, such as equitable resource distribution and the reduction of environmental footprints. The DSM model operates within a broad framework that integrates environmental impact assessments, fairness assessments, and behavioral analytics. These mechanisms are implemented through specific tools and components within the platform, allowing for the simulation of bidder behavior and the assessment of auction scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the platform effectively promotes sustainable, fair, and informed auction practices. By comparing our approach with existing tools, we highlight the advantages of using this integrated framework to improve sustainability and fairness in digital marketplaces. This paper emphasizes the importance of developing platforms that integrate economic efficiency with environmental responsibility and social equity.</jats:p>"

Retailer losses are evaluated using spoilage conversion rates and fresh product stockouts, shedding light on the relationship between system stability and retailer losses. The research aims to explore the optimal ordering strategy under demand fluctuations. The findings indicate that inappropriate inventory strategies, coupled with decision-makers’ risk attitudes, can lead to system oscillations and substantial losses.

The model emphasises the integration of third-party logistics (3PL) providers to streamline supply-processing-distribution (SPD) functions. By outsourcing non-core activities like SPD to 3PL providers, hospitals can enhance their operational efficiency, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on core tasks and ultimately improving service delivery. Methods: This research employed a dual methodology, combining an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with a Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS). These approaches evaluated various SCM models based on multiple hospital logistics performance attributes. Results: The AHP results highlighted on-time delivery, patient safety, utilisation rate, and emergency procurement as critical criteria for selecting the optimal model. Fuzzy TOPSIS analysis identified the SCIII: W-G-H model as the most suitable for implementation in Thai hospitals. This model incorporates a centralised warehouse for negotiation leverage, a Group Purchasing Organisation (GPO) for cost efficiency, and regional SPD hubs for effective inventory management and rapid responses to demand fluctuations or emergencies. Conclusions: Adopting this SCM model is expected to significantly enhance supply chain performance, reduce operational costs, and improve the quality and safety of patient care in Thai hospitals.</jats:p>"

However, domestic water insecurity can occur even in regions where water is naturally abundant. Despite Colombia’s plentiful surface water resources, rural and peri-urban communities often experience limited access to water. Existing water supply systems are frequently susceptible to poor maintenance, particularly in remote areas where much of the infrastructure remains outdated. Consequently, water is often lost through leaks or unintentional non-domestic use. Although a regulatory framework for water usage exists, it does not consistently translate into effective implementation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methodology</jats:title><jats:p>Based on an extensive survey of approximately 1000 households in four rural and four peri-urban communities in the Valle del Cauca Department, Colombia, we identified the factors underlying inefficient water supply and use.

This not only elucidates why water is supplied and used inefficiently in rural systems (e.g., due to non-domestic use), but also accounts for the variability of perceived water use within peri-urban systems. The water use perceived by households in the rural systems was statistically similar across the rural systems studied and was significantly lower than that in the peri-urban systems. Most rural systems exhibited very low ratios of perceived water use to water supplied, indicating that either water is lost in conveyance or that water is used for non-domestic purposes. Peri-urban users, who perceived to use more water than users in rural areas, were associated with younger and more educated households. Higher education levels were also associated with better financial capacity and technical ability to manage water systems; therefore, peri-urban systems were better managed.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Human schistosomiasis affects 229 million people; at least 90% are in sub-Saharan Africa, and 54% are school-aged children. Schistosoma haematobium infects 112 million people, Schistosoma japonicum infects 3.1 million people, and Schistosoma mansoni infects 54 million people. Schistosomiasis can occur in endemic and non-endemic areas. A high risk of schistosomiasis can occur in, for example, preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and workers in endemic schistosomiasis areas. These people make contact with infested freshwater day by day. In addition, environmental factors and socioeconomic factors can affect the transmission of schistosomiasis. Various factors can cause the transmission of schistosomiasis, for example, climate changes and proximity to infested freshwater bodies. People with high risks for schistosomiasis need great attention for treatment and/or prevention programs. Risk factors for schistosomiasis, for example, human behavior and socioeconomic status, can affect the transmission of schistosomiasis. Many developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America are at risk of this disease. High-risk people need special attention in programs for schistosomiasis elimination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Forests currently store more carbon in their vegetation and soil than all of the carbon in earth’s atmosphere. But how much CO₂ can be removed and sequestered by forests in the future, and at what cost? This study examines the potential for forests to sequester CO₂ and the associated costs, utilizing a dynamic economic model, FAO data, and new remote sensing-based estimates of forest regeneration. It finds that up to 12 GtCO₂ could be sequestered by 2050 through forest mitigation activities, with 44% from afforestation/reforestation, 30% from avoided deforestation emissions, and 26% from changes in forest management. The majority of mitigation (64%) is expected to come from tropical regions, although this share decreases with higher monetary incentives. A constrained scenario, which limits land conversion to historical rates, reduces global sequestration potential by 41% in 2050, particularly impacting temperate forests. These findings provide valuable insights for assessing the cost of national forest sequestration targets and guiding policymakers in the development of evidence-informed forest-based mitigation actions.</p>"

This study employs signaling theory to explore how supplier CM affects firm idiosyncratic risk (IR), alongside the moderating roles of the supply chain information environment and the criticality of firm–supplier relationships. The findings of this study demonstrate that supplier CM can reduce firm IR. The risk reduction effect is strong when the information environment between a firm and its suppliers is rich and when the dependency between the firm and its supplier is strong. Path analysis reveals that supplier CM primarily reduces firm IR by alleviating information asymmetry. Moreover, the risk reduction effect increases for firms with small sizes. This research extends the application of signaling theory to supply chain research and bridges the gap between the CM and firm IR literature within the context of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

Based on the data of A-share listed enterprises in China from 2019 to 2022, this paper explores the impact of digital transformation on supply chain efficiency and its transmission mechanism. It is found that the digitalization for enterprises can effectively improve their supply chain efficiency. To be more specific, the transmission mechanism indicates that the digital progress improves the efficiency of supply chain by enhancing enterprises’ management level. Moreover, Customer concentration plays a negative during this process, and heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the impact of digital progress on supply chain efficiency is more significant in supply chain sensitive industries and large enterprises. This paper not only enriches the research on digital transformation and supply chain efficiency, but also provides empirical evidence for enterprises to promote digital transformation, improve supply chain efficiency and further achieve sustainable development.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract \nBackground\nUnfit medical products, especially poor quality / damaged / expired / and phased out (no longer accepted for use) are among health challenges that need careful attention and adequate management in developing countries health supply chains, including Rwanda. Not only does medical wastage affect the public health in general, but also it affects financial capabilities. Actually, according to the Management Science for Health, countries on average spend about 25% of their total health expenditure on medicines, and a significant part of the funds expended on critical drugs is wasted.\nObjectives\nThe main objective of this study is to identify the factors leading to unfit medical products and related perceived consequences to the supply chain management in Rwanda.\nSpecific Objectives\nI.\tTo identify the most commonly found unfit medical products in RMS and MEDIASOL.\nII.\tExplore factors contributing to unfit medico-pharmaceuticals in RMS and MEDIASOL.\nIII.\tTo explore perceived consequences of unfit medical products to the supply chain management in RMS and MEDIASOL. \nIV.\tTo explore the disposal methods of unfit pharmaceuticals management in RMS and MEDIASOL\nMethods\nThe mixed method research design used, data were collected from 20 key informant by doing interview, A questionnaire containing open questions was used and cross-sectional study were used both focusing on identify the most commonly found unfit medical products in RMS and their management, then the shared data were transcribed and translated by the researchers. Main ideas from each Key informant were merged under each theme and sub themes by reading and then rereading to identify common words, phrases and perceptions that were coded. Quantitative data were coded and analyzed using SPSS and EXCEL software.\nResults\nThe study found that the most common unfit medico-pharmaceuticals are the laboratory commodities, malaria commodities and program products including quinine, and Haloperidol retard 50mg/ml injection and Insulin combinations, the study indicated that the Lack of local manufacturers of pharmaceutical products according to market needs; Change of medical products protocols; Minimum shelf life not specified while ordering the products; and Lack of accurate data to facilitate quantification were highlighted by the respondents as the  main factors leading to unfit medicinal products. And the study found that the total unfit products were 3% of the average annual loss in unfit medicinal products compared to the total stock.\n \nThe study recommended that further research should be done on this topic especially by exploring effective mechanisms and strategies to mitigate the wastage of medical products and other health commodities in Rwanda. \n Conclusions\nMedical products are critical for preserving lives in morbid diseases, yet they can get unfit from their intended use for different identified reasons in this study as presented in the summary of factors leading to unfit medical products. Those factors are for example the: Low consumption rate of some products; Sudden change of medical treatment protocols; Procurements without specific minimum required shelf life of products at arrival; etc. Then, were identified twenty-three (23) common unfit products also presented in the results, as well as the perceived consequences of unfit medical products to the supply chain; and three main applied disposal methods are incineration, plastic materials recycling and reuse of unfit products for other purposes. Future studies are needed to explore this important topic more broadly and come up with sustainable strategies to properly manage the medical products throughout the entire supply chain</jats:p>"

We use information from the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to create a new classification of clean and dirty products based on whether they are subject to a domestic or a border carbon tax. We then combine this dataset with French firms’ product-level import data over 2000–2019 and estimate that firms’ propensity to import dirty inputs from non-EU countries increased in the 2010s, reflecting carbon leakage. A heterogeneous firm model is then used to quantify the impact of changes in firms’ sourcing of clean and dirty inputs given the implementation of a carbon tax and a carbon tariff. The simulated ETS carbon tax scenario is able to match leakage observed in the data and leads to a higher price level and a modest decline in emissions. The scenario that further includes the CBAM carbon tariff reverses carbon leakage at the cost of an additional rise in prices. Overall, household welfare declines because the higher costs associated with the carbon policies outweigh the benefits of reduced emissions.</jats:p>"

Although supply chain integration is recognized as a critical factor, there is limited understanding of how it specifically impacts procurement procedures in this context. This study examines 45 projects from the top ten Chinese international contractors, addressing this gap in the literature. Through Pearson correlation analysis, the study finds strong relationships between key internal components of supply chain integration, procurement management procedures, and procurement performance. Operational performance, procurement contract management, and stakeholder participation are identified as crucial elements that drive project success. The findings support a theoretical model showing that supply chain integration enhances procurement performance, thus improving overall project outcomes. This research contributes valuable empirical data and insights for both academic study and business practice, providing a robust framework for optimizing procurement management in international EPC projects. Moreover, by emphasizing the efficiency and sustainability of procurement processes, this study aligns with broader sustainability goals, highlighting how optimized supply chain integration can reduce waste, improve resource use, and foster more environmentally and socially responsible procurement practices in global engineering projects.</jats:p>"

This work presents a study of techno economic assessment of hydrogen production via natural gas reforming and photo-electrolysis by estimating the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of various hydrogen production processes. Carbon sequestration is employed to realize low carbon dioxide emissions and prevents the affluence of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as such, mitigating climate change. Our work establishes that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology increases capital expenditure, which surges the LCOH. Comparison between the PEC system and PV systems is explored. Our work uses the H2A model with different methodologies to find the various results regarding LCOH. Furthermore, the work reviews recent research in solar hydrogen generation. Based on the current literature, contemporary technologies can achieve $2/kg of carbon-free hydrogen production with CCS. From our findings, a 2000 kg/day of hydrogen production plant can achieve an estimated LCOH of $2.20/kg. However, considering the surge in the cost of raw materials over time, this figure is bound to slightly increase to $2.70/kg by 2040.</jats:p>",

Through a systematic literature search and analysis, this paper examines relevant papers from databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, EI, and Scopus, discussing the specific applications of machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary algorithms in supply chain risk management. The study finds that these AI technologies demonstrate significant advantages in risk prediction, anomaly detection, image recognition, text mining, supply chain optimization, and emergency strategy formulation. However, issues related to data privacy and security, technical complexity, and implementation difficulties remain major challenges in current applications.

The model incorporates historical growth rates from the last mineral production supercycle and critical raw material trade flows to estimate future availability. Our findings reveal that under the current trade strategy and production growth, the US may achieve only 65% of its clean energy goals, with nickel, silicon, and rare earth elements identified as key bottlenecks.

By utilizing a decentralized ledger system, stakeholders can access real-time data about drug provenance and distribution, thereby increasing consumer confidence and improving regulatory compliance. Existing pharmaceutical supply chains face significant challenges, including counterfeit drugs, lack of visibility, and inefficiencies in tracking products through complex logistics networks. These issues lead to financial losses, compromised patient safety, and regulatory penalties. This study proposes a novel framework, the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain using Blockchain Technology (PSC-BCT), designed to address these existing challenges. The PSC-BCT framework leverages smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and IoT integration to create a secure, transparent, and efficient supply chain ecosystem. This framework enables all participants, from manufacturers to pharmacists, to share and verify transaction data, thereby enhancing accountability and reducing the risk of fraud. The proposed method is utilized to streamline operations, reduce delays, and enhance data integrity within the pharmaceutical supply chain. By ensuring that every transaction is recorded immutably, stakeholders can verify product authenticity and track the drug's journey from production to the end consumer. The findings indicate that the PSC-BCT framework significantly improves supply chain transparency and efficiency while reducing instances of counterfeit drugs. Furthermore, the implementation of blockchain technology fosters trust among stakeholders and enhances compliance with regulatory standards, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and safety.</jats:p>"

The research focuses on the Supervision of halal products from BPJPH or the Provincial Halal Certification Service Task Force. While the techniques used were observation, interviews, and documentation. The results showed that the implementation of halal supply chain management in the mardika market did not work as it should, due to the transfer of duties and functions of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) to the Organizing Body for Halal Product Guarantee (BPJPH). so almost all broiler chicken sellers do not know the function of BPJPH and do not know and have met with supervision from BPJPH or the Maluku Province Halal Certification Service Task Force. Lack of supervision from the Provincial Halal Product Assurance Service Task Force both at distributors and at retailers or small business actors in the mardika market in Ambon city.

This study tackles this by investigating the integration of sustainability criteria into supply chain optimization for a biomass energy company in Portugal, using a combination of simulation modeling through anyLogistix software (version: 2.15.3.202209061204) and multi-criteria decision-making. Four supply chain scenarios were designed and simulated, differing in their number of distribution centers, the adoption of green logistics, and split-by-ratio distribution strategies over a 305-day period. Through the weighted sum model, Scenario C emerged as the optimal configuration, achieving a balance between operational efficiency and sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and lowering transportation costs without compromising revenue. Sensitivity analysis further highlighted the trade-offs between cost efficiency, lead times, and environmental impact, showing that the strategic placement of distribution centers and the use of eco-friendly vehicles significantly improve the sustainability of the biomass supply chain. These findings provide practical insights for decision-makers, demonstrating how digital modeling tools can enhance supply chain management by optimizing environmental and operational goals simultaneously. This research contributes to the fields of sustainable logistics and supply chain management by validating the effectiveness of green logistics strategies and multi-criteria decision-making approaches in reducing environmental impact while maintaining economic viability.</jats:p>"

To secure such water supply, regular maintenance, including the replacement of deteriorating pipelines, is essential. In this study, a methodology has been developed for determining optimal pipeline replacement solutions in water supply systems at water utilities with limited data availability. Hydraulic analysis has been conducted on the segment of 25 km of the water supply network using the free software EPANET. Applying water network optimization, eight pipeline replacement projects according to 13 pre-defined criteria have been identified and evaluated. The paper outlines the methods for evaluating the criteria, including defining specific quantitative limits. The Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method was used in the paper to determine the weights of the criteria. The reason for applying this method refers to problems that involve a set of criteria with a mixed structure, including both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Also, the paper describes the steps of the multi-criteria optimization method VIKOR, used to select the optimal project.

The supplier needs to decide on a production quantity by balancing the shortage cost and the excess inventory holding cost with respect to the retailer’s demand. The retailer’s demand is random, but the retailer receives an informative signal about the demand before the supplier sets the production quantity and places orders after learning the demand realization. The retailer wants to reduce the shortage cost, and to this end, the retailer can disclose information about the retailer’s signal to persuade the supplier to increase production levels. For this setup, we characterize the optimal information disclosure policy of the retailer and shed light on settings in which the retailer strictly benefits from carefully designed information disclosure policies relative to a full- or a no-disclosure policy. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: O.

The main objective of the research was to assess the strategies firms can use to incorporate sustainability in their supply chain practices while maintaining their financial viability. The study applied a qualitative approach to find out the sustainability practices companies apply in their supply chain process. The data collection techniques applied included semi-structured interviews with 20 participants from diverse organizations. The study also used focus groups comprising of 5 participants for dynamic discussions and peer-to-peer learning. Themes were developed from the group interviews and focus groups that helped to draw conclusions from the study. The key findings from the research are as follows: First, regulatory restrictions are the major driving force towards sustainability. Secondly, consumers show high affinity towards products offered by sustainable organizations. Third, lack of awareness is the main reason why some organizations have not incorporated sustainability into their supply chain. The fourth finding is that the circular economy leads to significant reduction in wastes, hence supply chain sustainability. Incidentally, the study finds out that supply chain sustainability cuts costs for organizations.The research findings validate the importance of supply chain sustainability in enhancing financial performance of companies, boosting brand reputation, and increasing consumer loyalty and retention.</jats:p>"

Load profile in addition to the PV and Wind energy profiles were studied and used as input data to the simulation model. Different cases of RE penetration levels as a percentage of load demand were considered and entered to the simulation model as well. Other factors, such as allowed over-generation and ESS efficiency also provided and calculations carried out accordingly. In addition to the technical consideration, an economic analysis approach added to the study. Results show that staying with the current level of RE penetrations, i.e. at PV 11% and W 9% (RE level 20% of load demand) and 5% curtailment, no need to install ESS to absorb the RE intermittency and variability. As RE penetration level increases, the need for ESS becomes necessary, i.e. to reach 100% RE penetration and de-carbonize the electrical network accordingly, an ESS of 138,900.00MWH/ 7,386.57MW PHES would be required at PV 65% and Wind 35% penetration level and 25% curtailment with initial CAPEX investment of   JOD 15,367,314,444.10. Economic feasibility study shows that with the current RE energy prices and ESS CAPEX, reaching the 100% RE penetration level would not be the optimum solution as there will be a negative cost impact, unless these prices reduced to a certain level making the solution feasible.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change has far-reaching implications for global freshwater availability and environmental balance. The increase in greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels has triggered global climate change, affecting precipitation patterns, glacier melt and sea level rise. Parts of the United States are experiencing significant changes in precipitation patterns, with some areas experiencing frequent storms and others experiencing more prolonged droughts. Accelerated glacier melt is leading to fewer water sources during the dry season, and sea level rise is threatening coastal freshwater resources, triggering saltwater intrusion and a decline in freshwater quality. Wildfires in California are an important consequence of climate change, severely affecting freshwater resources and environmental balance. Wildfires lead to reduced water resources, impacting agricultural water use and irrigation infrastructure, and affecting water quality through increased sediment and pollutant loads. The 2018 Camp Hill Fire contaminated local water sources, and the rebuilding process has increased demand for water resources, exacerbating resource constraints. Global warming has lengthened wildfire seasons and increased fire intensity, leading to increased pressure on freshwater resources. By analyzing the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, this paper hopes to draw public attention to environmental protection and provide a reference for gradually optimizing ecosystems and creating a healthy living environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we study the decision-making and coordination problem of a two-tier fresh food supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer. Considering the influencing factors of consumers’ information preference, freshness, and misrepresentation, we construct a centralized decision-making model and a decentralized decision-making Stackelberg game model. We also analyze the changes in the equilibrium solution of the supply chain before and after the input of blockchain technology, identify the conditions for the investment in blockchain technology, and design a “cost-sharing + benefit-sharing” combination contract for the coordination of the blockchain. The results are as follows: Firstly, under decentralized decision-making, if the fresh supplier misreports the freshness of the product, it will mislead the retailer to increase the order quantity, and its own profit will rise. Therefore, the fresh supplier has the motivation to misreport freshness. However, the backlog of fresh products will eventually damage the retailer’s profit, and the overall profit of the supply chain will also be damaged. Therefore, the increase in the profit of the fresh supplier is at the expense of the overall interests and stability of the supply chain. Second, when the investment cost of blockchain technology is within a certain threshold, it is feasible to invest in blockchain technology. Consumers’ preference for traceable fresh products will encourage the fresh supply chain to improve the level of information traceability and increase investment in blockchain technology. Finally, there are double marginal effects in the fresh supply chain under decentralized decision-making. The combined contract of “cost-sharing + revenue-sharing” can coordinate the overall revenue of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. When the contract parameters meet certain conditions, Pareto improvement in revenue can be achieved for all parties involved in the fresh supply chain. The willingness of retailers to invest in blockchain technology will change with the change in contract parameters. When the proportion of retailers’ costs and the proportion of shared income are higher, the level of retailers’ investment in blockchain technology will decrease. Therefore, the interests of supply chain members need to be balanced in the process of contract coordination.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several stakeholders are involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC), including those who provide raw materials, make and sell drugs, and oversee the industry, hospitals, pharmacies, and patients. An efficient traceability system is necessary to ascertain the present and all prior ownership of products because of the intricate nature of product and transaction flows in PSC. Furthermore, regulatory supervision and product safety can be significantly improved by digitizing the track and trace procedure. A permanent, trustworthy, responsible, and transparent system in the PSC can be achieved using blockchain-based medication tracing, which provides a distributed shared data platform. A hybrid blockchain network (HBN) based on secure pharmaceutical supply chain architecture (SPSCA) has been proposed for this research. The suggested system relies on smart contracts to record significant events and track how all the parties engaged in the supply chain perform their respective tasks. In this way, everyone concerned can remain informed of developments and protect the supply against manipulations of supply records and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. All parties involved benefit from a secure, immutable record of transactions due to the smart contract, which additionally guarantees the provenance of data and deals with mediators. Detailed methods and the system architecture that enable the solution's functioning are laid out here. We perform testing and validation to assess the system's efficacy in improving pharmaceutical supply chain traceability and provide cost and security evaluations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Forestry has a profound impact on environmental protection, economic development and social welfare. With the improvement of global environmental protection awareness, the construction of platform supply chain of forest products has become the core driving force to promote sustainable development of forestry. Studying the resilience of supply chain of platform of forest products is of great importance to solve the contradiction between economic development and natural ecosystem protection. However, the existing resilience evaluation methods are not suitable for the dynamic and complex performance evaluation of the current forest products platform supply chain. Therefore, in order to make up for this shortcoming, this paper evaluates and analyzes the supply chain resilience of forest products platform based on AI recommendation and extension theory. Firstly, the paper integrates the innovative thinking method of extension into the AI recommendation technology, and constructs the resilience performance evaluation index system of the platform supply chain of forest products combined with the characteristics of forest products. Secondly, the evaluation model of the supply chain toughness of forest products platform was constructed, and the weight value of each index was obtained. Finally, in order to ensure the authenticity and credibility of the evaluation results, the resilience levels of different types of forest products platform supply chains were illustrated by numerical examples, and the effectiveness of the application of AI recommendation and extension theory in the resilience performance evaluation of forest products platform supply chains was verified. The scientific value of this paper is that it provides a new idea and a new method for the resilience performance evaluation of the forest products platform supply chain, and makes theoretical and practical contributions to the fruitful application of AI recommendation in the supply chain field. In addition, this study also provides a new practical guideline for protecting the natural environment and realizing the sustainable development of forestry.</jats:p>"

These companies deal with numerous complex contracts containing intricate legal language, cross-references, and long document lineages spanning amendments and supplemental materials. Manually extracting insights and managing obligations from these highly unstructured contracts is extremely time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) to automate and streamline contract management. The proposed solution utilizes large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and chain-of-thought reasoning to extract structured data (such as fees, escalations etc.) from contracts, perform analyses, and generate natural language responses. It enables use cases like optionality analysis, fee calculation, cross-contract insight generation, invoice processing, and user feedback integration. The architecture combines LLMs with contract knowledge bases and external data sources to optimize operations, mitigate risks, and enhance decision-making. Key capabilities include centralized repositories, clause extraction, compliance tracking, workflow automation, and advanced analytics leveraging LLM question-answering, summarization, and code generation abilities. The paper discusses technical details, use case scenarios applicable to crude oil transportation contracts in supply &amp; chain, and highlights GenAI's potential to transform energy industry contract management practices. When conducting analyses involving hundreds of contracts, the proposed solution exhibited significant efficiency gains. Case studies showed that it reduced processing time by 10 to 100 times compared to manual methods.</jats:p>",

However, despite literature on supply chain resilience is copious, tools for quantifying the resilience of a business are lacking, especially when dealing with the a priori resilience of a system, since several assessments are a posteriori carried out, after a disruption has manifested. In response, an analytic quantitative model is here proposed, whose output is a Global Resilience Index for a company. The model is divided into 3 phases: Supply (8 factors), Production (12 factors) and Distribution (5 factors); these elements were derived from literature and semi-structured interviews with practitioners. The logical functioning of the model is based on weighted averages attributed to each single factor; for defining the weights a survey was sent, in which respondents had to express their opinion with reference to the perceived impact of those factors on resilience. For validating the model, it was implemented in three companies manufacturing the following products: fresh milk, ginseng coffee and vegetable preserves. Despite none of them reached the higher resilience level, results offer interesting insights for let the users understand where the system is weaker. This model is intended to be made available to those who desire to include the resilience assessment to manage operational decisions.</jats:p>"

We find that, in terms of welfare losses, the costs of decoupling are roughly five times higher in the short‐run compared with the long‐run, while country losses are heterogeneous. A reshaping of global supply chains increases the level of consumer prices in most countries, as well as producer prices, especially for trade‐intensive manufacturing sectors. Global supply chain decoupling entails also a reallocation of labour across skill levels. Finally, global trade would decrease substantially, driven by lower trade in intermediate inputs and a higher reliance of countries on domestic production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Premature birth is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period, with long-term consequences for the child’s further psycho-physical development and health. Given the objective deterioration of the economic component and social instability during the hostilities in Ukraine, the birth rate is not expected to increase in the coming years. So, it is important to preserve the life and health of every newborn child. The well-being of the intrauterine environment and birth, morphological and functional maturity at birth are the basis for the child’s postnatal adaptation. Perinatal hypoxia is a predictor of significant metabolic disorders at the subcellular, cellular, organ and systemic levels. This results in impaired adaptation in the neonatal period and a high risk of developing functional and chronic pathology in the future. The purpose of the study is to examine the features of intracellular energy exchange in perinatal pathology in preterm infants. This will facilitate the investigation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of severe forms of diseases and provide justification for the introduction of additional laboratory markers of hypoxic inflammation in practical neonatology. Materials and methods. A clinical and laboratory examination was conducted on 68 preterm infants with a gestational age of 32–33/6 weeks who exhibited severe forms of perinatal pathology. The comparison group comprised 27 conditionally healthy children with a gestational age at birth of 34–36/6 weeks. The inclusion criteria were a gestational age at birth of 32–33/6 weeks and severe perinatal pathology. The exclusion criteria were as follows: a gestational age at birth of less than 32 weeks or above 37 weeks, congenital malformations, and neonatal sepsis. In addition to the conventional methods of clinical and laboratory examination of newborns, indicators of intracellular energy exchange were determined: glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) (EC 1.1.99.5), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (EC 1.3.99.1) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3) in lymphocytes, lactate, pyruvate and the lactate/pyruvate ratio in blood serum. The values of SDH, GPDH and NADH were employed in order to calculate the aerobic respiration (AR) rate and electron transport chain (ETC) coefficient. The statistical processing of the study results was conducted using the software package Statistica (StatSoft Inc., USA, version 10). A Student’s t-test was employed for the comparison of quantitative indicators with normal distribution, at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001. The qualitative diffe­rences between the comparison groups were assessed with the MedCalc software package (Statistical Software Package for Biomedical Research, 2023, version 16.1). Results. The findings demonstrated significant alterations in energy exchange in preterm infants subjected to hypoxic conditions in the context of severe perinatal pathology. In particular, a reduction in pyruvate levels accompanied by an increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio suggests an insufficient energy exchange and the dominance of anaerobic glycolysis. Additionally, alterations in the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, including a decline in GPDH, an increase in SDH, a decrease in NADH, and a reduction in the AR rate accompanied by an increase in the ETC coefficient, were observed. The results of statistical receiver operating characteristic analysis of the laboratory indicators of energy exchange demonstrated a satisfactory level of sensitivity and specificity suggesting the potential utility of these parameters in perinatal pathology in preterm infants. Conclusions. The use of laboratory indicators of energy exchange, along with the conventional methods for additional paraclinical examination, will facilitate the prompt rectification of therapeutic measures, thereby enhancing the efficacy of medical care for preterm infants. This is achieved by the realignment of oxygen therapy measures at the intensive care stage. Furthermore, it provides a scientific foundation for the search for pharmacotherapeutic agents to control mitochondrial respiration disorders in conditions of hypoxic damage to the body.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">While there is a high uptake of BDA in the realm of supply chain management, in the view of automation supply chains and improving their value proposition by providing more accurate data for demand forecasting. There are material knowledge gaps on the SC-specific analytics applied to match demand, albeit the existing knowledge could be more amorphous. From this backdrop, the study endeavored to analyze extant literature within the ambit of BDA to unpack the current trends and possible future research directions to foster the application of BDA in SC contexts. The study adopted a systematic literature review of the extant literature published between 2014-2023. The study adopted the five-stage iterative procedure used in the systematic review methodology. The review&amp;apos;s findings depict extensive use of big data analytics in matching demand and supply and supply chain optimization. The findings of this study adduce almost non-rebuttable evidence that big data analytics can be applied in procurement, inventory control, logistics, and order processing. Under the auspices of BDA is the SCA. Arguably, extant research has demonstrated the capability of SCA in mitigating contemporary SC risks such as mismatches between demand and supply, sub-optimal SCs, and underutilization of the supply chain infrastructures at the cusps of various echelons.\n</jats:p>"

This literature review distinguishes more than 80 different determinants related to either the international system interaction, an international state or the aircraft offered. The determinants can be related to the main characteristics of the market, namely, security, economics and normative values. Measurable effects are only visible for security and economic determinants. Normative factors appear to play a rudimentary role across the board, although they can be found to be significant in individual studies. One conclusion that can be drawn is that the most commonly studied determinants are not those with the greatest impact. In addition, it is important to note that all but a few of the publications analysed do not address the difference in market power between a producing and a supplying (reselling) state.</jats:p>"

In recent years, supply chain finance has been widely applied in various sectors, effectively addressing the financing difficulties faced by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the supply chain. In this environment, the development of supply chain finance has received significant attention. To encourage its development, government agencies can leverage their macro-guidance capabilities, introduce relevant measures based on the actual situation, and require banking and insurance institutions to rely on core supply chain enterprises. By treating the transactions of core enterprises and their upstream and downstream partners as the foundation, financial institutions can integrate various types of information and provide comprehensive financial services to all participants in the supply chain. However, during the process of innovation and development in supply chain finance, various risks inevitably arise. These risks must be managed and mitigated through different risk management strategies to enable supply chain finance to better serve the real economy and promote its sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>This AHURI research examines how governments can encourage small-scale private investors to provide affordable rental housing. It finds that landlords who follow the positively geared, long-term hold investment (LTHI) model are most likely to be part of affordable housing schemes.The LTHI landlords invest on the basis of positive cashflow earning reliable rental income. In general, they purchase cheaper housing in lower value locations and seek to own their investment property outright by retirement. LTHIs landlords can provide a source of affordable rental housing, but do not tend to lead the creation of new stock.The landlords will participate in affordable housing schemes that maximise the potential for a positive cashflow, and not those based on financial schemes such as negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. It is important to index rental increases to market rates so that investors who lock-in to long-term schemes are not disincentivised.Focus groups with small-scale landlords who lease their properties to social housing providers (SHPs) found the landlords were unanimous in their support for headlease programs. The advantages for landlords included:- guaranteed rental payments provided cashflow security—such rental guarantees made investors 12 per cent more likely to participate in a scheme- no loss of rent due to vacancy and no need to advertise for new tenants- guaranteed make-good provisions gave confidence that the property would be returned in original condition- reduced administration demands provided peace of mind and a ‘hands free’ approach.</p>"

This paper provides an improved SCR metric while exploring the inherent tradeoff between investments in inventory and production capacity to yield the most resilient supply chain network given budget constraints. Discrete event simulation is used to develop a generalizable metric to provide insight into how supply chain design and investment determine a network's response to a disruption. The developed resilience capability metric (RCM), utilizing area under the curve, measures the cumulative performance level of the system from disruption to a predetermined endpoint, representing how much of the system demand can be served by different network designs. Results indicate inventory and production have different effects on how a system behaves postdisruption, but that the two SCR investments should not be viewed independently since optimal performance is connected to coordinated adjustments to both. Additionally, the use of the RCM shows that a key factor in a supply chain's resilience is the speed of the response. By measuring the cumulative performance over the total event, RCM provides managers with the ability to truly compare different SCR investments to see which has the greatest impact on overall resilience.</jats:p>",

A pot experiment was conducted at the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, to evaluate the performance of a popular Thai rice variety (RD57) commonly cultivated in Thailand's central plains under three soil moisture levels as affected by five Si application timings. Si was added to the soil at 300 kg Si ha–1. Reduced water supply (75% field capacity [FC] and 50% FC) caused lengthening of the growth period with reduced yield and its components. Si application resulted in an enhanced root and shoot growth irrespective of application timings, compared with the control. However, Si application with split doses of 25% at basal, 50% at panicle initiation (PI), and 25% at the heading stage was found to be the most effective. Even under severe water stress, more root growth and panicle numbers were found during this application timing. Si absorption was also found more for all application timings than the control; however, the same application timing resulted in the highest absorption (8.62%). A strong positive correlation was observed between Si uptake and grain and straw yield under all moisture-deficient conditions. Si application can be recommended in split doses for rice cultivation under a limited water supply.</jats:p>"

The Granger causality test suggests that the predictions of inflation expectation based on its own past values and the past values of the global supply chain pressure are better predictions of inflation expectation than just using the past observations of inflation expectation. In contrast, Impulse Response Functions suggest that surprise increases in  global supply chain pressure lead to increased inflation expectation and monetary policy uncertainty; this shock lasts up to two years. Meanwhile, the Impulse Response Functions suggest that surprise increases in the global supply chain pressure decrease consumer sentiment (confidence), lasting up to two and a half years. Afterward, the impact converges back to zero. Additionally, the Variance Decomposition results suggest that by the final period, the impulses of the global supply chain pressure explain over 22%, 7%, and 44% of the variation of consumer sentiment, monetary policy uncertainty, and inflation expectation, respectively.</jats:p>"

Thus, the objective to establish an energy system using remote renewable sources arises. The study aims to elaborate a methodological approach for an integrated assessment of systems for energy supply from remote renewable energy sources. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is a separate analysis of the main technological processes of production, conversion, storage, and use of energy carriers, with specific attention given to the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources.

This research investigates the impact of disturbances on a two-tier supply chain network with asymmetric competing firms. We establish the equilibrium in a unique structure that represents the maximum set of profitable upstream supply paths achievable through competition and exhibits stability under specific conditions. We evaluate the efficiency of the supply chain configuration by a shortfall problem and solve it with an adapted pseudoflow algorithm that efficiently identifies the mismatches between shortfalls and capacity surpluses in the multitier network. The parametric analysis reveals that the disturbance loss can be significantly offset by supplier competition, although the marginal benefit of competition decreases rapidly with the number of suppliers. Furthermore, shortfalls could be magnified by network asymmetries that increase configuration inefficiency, and supply chain performance could be improved by pushing high-cost firms to cease production. Simulation results indicate that the supply chain with a moderate level of competition and a balanced configuration can be robust against disturbance and demand volatility. </jats:p>"

While offering substantial benefits, CLSC adoption faces challenges, including high infrastructure costs, complex reverse coordination, and inconsistent regulatory support, which hinder widespread application. Through a mixed-method approach using surveys and case studies, this study reveals barriers such as financial constraints and operational restructuring needs, while highlighting enablers like digital tools (e.g., blockchain, IoT) that enhance efficiency and transparency. Furthermore, it emphasizes the critical role of regulatory incentives (subsidies, tax breaks, and extended producer responsibility mandates) and strategic partnerships that pool resources and share risks, essential for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) aiming to implement CLSCs effectively. By proposing a practical CLSC framework, informed by empirical data, this research provides actionable insights for businesses to embrace circular economy principles, aligning environmental responsibility with corporate resilience, profitability, and consumer expectations. CLSCs, therefore, are not only an environmental solution but also a strategic opportunity that addresses sustainability imperatives while meeting regulatory requirements and advancing competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

The best part is, due to its low cost and simplicity, it is popular among hobbyists as well. The output power of a practical HeNe laser tube is usually less than 1mW. In order to operate the HeNe laser, it requires a few kilovolts of direct current (DC). The necessary high voltage DC is generated by a HeNe laser power supply. A typical HeNe laser power supply is a complex, high voltage circuit which is designed to provide the gas discharge current, as well as to maintain the helium and neon mixture within the laser tube at an optimal pressure and temperature. There are many existing laser power supply designs. Therefore, the objective of this design project, \"Development of Helium Neon Laser Power Supply\" is to design and construct a HeNe laser power supply which is low cost, efficient, light in weight and most importantly, to develop a high voltage DC power supply circuit which can be used to power the HeNe laser. Through this design project, a comprehensive and systematic study from the analysis of the existed laser power supply designs to the performance testing of the developed HeNe laser power supply has been carried out. The use of organic electro-optic material for electro- optical applications was suggested many years ago. Many devices have been developed since then, but some of them have been examined for their electro- optic response. Due to the many and important uses of radioactive isotopes in medical and industrial applications, it became necessary to evolve materials that are used in protection. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].</jats:p>"

This paper describes the design and analysis of an efficient power conditioning system for a CubeSat standard small satellite. For this purpose, the aim of this paper is to propose a two-input maximum power point tracker (MPPT)-based interleaved boost converter. The design copes with the fact that when a satellite revolves around the Earth, a single panel or at most two panels face solar radiation at different angles. In order to extract maximum power from the panels, the designed converter drives the solar panels at the maximum power point (MPP). A small signal model is drawn for the converter, and the closed-loop gain of the converter is analyzed using a Bode diagram. To improve the phase margin and gain, a PID compensator is designed and added to the closed loop of the converter. Finally, the performance of the proposed converter is validated by the simulation results.</jats:p>"

A pot experiment was conducted at the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, to evaluate the performance of a popular Thai rice variety (RD57) commonly cultivated in Thailand's central plains under three soil moisture levels as affected by five Si application timings. Si was added to the soil at 300 kg Si ha–1. Reduced water supply (75% field capacity [FC] and 50% FC) caused lengthening of the growth period with reduced yield and its components. Si application resulted in an enhanced root and shoot growth irrespective of application timings, compared with the control. However, Si application with split doses of 25% at basal, 50% at panicle initiation (PI), and 25% at the heading stage was found to be the most effective. Even under severe water stress, more root growth and panicle numbers were found during this application timing. Si absorption was also found more for all application timings than the control; however, the same application timing resulted in the highest absorption (8.62%). A strong positive correlation was observed between Si uptake and grain and straw yield under all moisture-deficient conditions. Si application can be recommended in split doses for rice cultivation under a limited water supply.</jats:p>"

The remanufacturing supply chain is analyzed using the game theory approach in these three recycling modes. Using game theory to analyze the optimal pricing and profits of each supply chain participant, we also discuss the impact of consumers’ perceived value uncertainty on the profits of each party under the different recycling modes, and we then explore the selection of recycling channels in the remanufacturing supply chain. The results show that when the perceived value uncertainty is at a medium or low level, retailers are responsible for recycling used products and producing remanufactured products, which brings higher profits to the supply chain system; when the perceived value uncertainty is high, the demand for remanufactured products in the market decreases, and the recycling revenue of remanufactured products is lower. Finally, the validity of the theoretical model is verified by a numerical simulation.</jats:p>"

Choices about where and what foods are produced is important for nutritional security, but has rippling consequences for land use, rural populations and across the food system. To support choices about where and what might be produced, we present an estimate of the nutritional value of agricultural commodities produced in Scotland.</jats:p><jats:p>Building on a Scottish Government-built model, annual agricultural census data were used to identify commodities for human consumption, which were matched to the minimally processed foods from each commodity. We focused on the value of the least processed form of each commodity, before food processing and ingredients from elsewhere are incorporated. For example, wholewheat flour and hulled barley. Nutrient data for each food were drawn from the UK Composition of Foods Integrated Dataset<jats:sup>(2)</jats:sup> and the energy and 27 macro and micronutrients were extracted for each food item. Using average yield and production data, the supply of nutrients was estimated.</jats:p><jats:p>Cereals could provide many nutrients, but are mostly used for non-food products (approximately 1% of barley and 12.5% of wheat are for human consumption<jats:sup>(3)</jats:sup>) so their realised contribution is attenuated. Vegetables are an important source of nutrients despite relatively little hectarage, however, their contribution to the nutrient supply is largely driven by large yields of potato and carrot (particularly for vitamin A). Given the quantity produced, milk is the largest source of nutrients, but livestock meat, which uses a significant proportion of agricultural land (including fodder crops, animal feed and grazing) has a disproportionately small contribution to nutrient supply. However, recognising nutrients vary between products which needs to be considered. Energy (71% of population needs), fibre (64.1%), iron (68.5%), selenium (59.7%), niacin (90.5%) and vitamins D (21.1%) and E (55.8%) all have a low supply from Scottish land.</jats:p><jats:p>These results are based on a nutrient supply from production of commodities on the land in Scotland, and the supply from primary production is not always what consumers have access to and the supply of nutrients often changes in food processing along the whole food chain. The supply of nutrients for human consumption is not only from domestic production and about half of the diet in Scotland is from imported foods (especially fruit and vegetables)<jats:sup>(4)</jats:sup>. However, the aim of this study was to estimate the potential of supply from current agricultural production. Understanding the potential and realised nutrient supply from domestic agricultural production helps to evidence a discussion about how agriculture is valued, the opportunities to reimagine food production to maximise the supply of nutrients across Scotland and consider uses of land.</jats:p>",

Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-based intelligent inventory management model (BC-IIMM) with deep learning techniques for hospitals to prevent running out of supplies, run their systems sustainably, and optimize their profits in the hospital supply chain (HSC).Preventing the contamination of pharmaceuticals requires a pharmaceutical cold chain monitoring system that uses IoT devices, blockchain, and cloud computing to track items across their entire supply chain reliably. One other perk is that both doctors and patients may benefit from drug recommendations made by a deep belief network (DBN) model. Further, to construct deep learning (DL), the proposed cold chain monitoring system produces large-scale, high-quality data. Holding cold chain items would become less expensive and cold chain inventory management decisions would be easier with it.Next, they provide a numerical result proving the suggested method works better than the baselines regarding refilling cost and shortage rate.</jats:p>"

It applies fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA) to examine the configurational conditions necessary for high supply chain resilience from a configurational viewpoint. The findings indicate: (1) four configurations contribute to elevated supply chain resilience: facility-led, facility-institution dual-drive, and facility-society-alliance-public joint-drive; (2) Investment in facilities is an essential prerequisite for achieving high supply chain resilience. The findings identify the institutional factors contributing to elevated supply network resilience, with the objective of offering recommendations for provinces to augment supply chain efficiency and bolster their capacity to manage emergencies.</jats:p>"

The strategies of keeping the food under a certain temperature can be achieved by active, passive and hybrid systems combining electrical components (coolers and freezers) and packaging materials in the form of insulating materials. The energy consumption of the cooling devices is running in many cases on fossil fuel sources and requires energy efficiency to achieve decarbonization efforts. On the other hand, certain passive packaging systems are made from materials which are not yet fully recyclable on the scale throughout the EU.

Utilizing growth accounting methods, the article seeks to discern the variety of routes through which technology (frontier movement) and efficiency (catch‐up effects) propagate their effects on TFP. Our primary objective is to identify the most potent mechanism for fostering productivity enhancement, a task that previously eluded systematic examination. The methodology involves creating an empirical approximation of the agricultural production frontier from a selection of national data. Bounded‐adjusted linear programming techniques are subsequently employed to disentangle the observed TFP growth within the agricultural sector of each country into its technology and efficiency facets. It is important to note that this study also integrates resource and environmental footprints as additional input–output variables, quantified via the multi‐region input–output (MRIO) model. The analysis, spanning from 2000 to 2016, reveals that the most advanced nations demonstrate the most vigorous growth in agricultural productivity, with a global upward trend in agricultural productivity over the sampled years.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Tools to predict pollinator activity at regional scales generally rely on land cover maps, combined with human-inferred mechanistic rules and/or expert knowledge. Recently, Giménez-García et al. (2023) showed that, using large pollinator datasets, different environmental variables, and machine learning models, those predictions can be enhanced but at the cost of losing model interpretability. Here, we complement this work by exploring the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques to directly infer wild-bee visitation rates across different biomes only from land cover maps and available pollinator data while maintaining a mechanistic interpretation. In particular, we assess the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are deep learning models, to infer mechanistic rules able to predict pollinator habitat use. At a global scale, our CNNs achieved a rank correlation coefficient of 0.44 between predictions and observations of pollinator visitation rates, doubling that of the previous human-inferred mechanistic models presented in Giménez-García et al. (2023) (0.17). Most interestingly, we show that the predictions depend on both landscape composition and configuration variables, with prediction rules being more complex than those of traditional mechanistic processes. We also demonstrate how CNNs can improve the predictions of our previous data-driven models that did not use land cover maps by creating a new model that combined the predictions of our CNN with those of our best regression model based on environmental variables, a Bayesian ridge regressor. This new ensemble model improved the overall rank correlation from 0.56 to 0.64.\n                    </jats:p>"

This study employs a quantitative methodology and analyzes a sample of 250 SMEs to examine many facets of supply chain flexibility, including supplier flexibility, production flexibility, delivery flexibility, inventory flexibility, and market responsiveness. The results demonstrate a substantial correlation between market responsiveness and competitive advantage, underscoring its vital importance in improving SMEs' market standing. In contrast, the research revealed that other aspects of supply chain flexibility did not have a statistically significant effect on competitive advantage. This study enhances the comprehension of supply chain dynamics in emerging economies, specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The research is constrained by its concentration on a single geographic area and its dependence on self-reported data, potentially introducing biases. Practical implications indicate that SMEs have to emphasize market responsiveness in formulating their supply chain strategy, hence enhancing agility and flexibility to changing market circumstances. The study underscores the need of assisting SMEs in developing adaptable supply chains to improve their competitiveness and foster economic development. The novelty of this research is in its concentrated examination of supply chain flexibility within Bangladeshi SMEs, addressing a deficiency in the literature of supply chain management in developing nations.</jats:p>"

To this end, we first propose a model for a stylized economy using Solovian framework, in which the production function employs energy input, along with capital and labor. We show the full algebraic solution of the model at the steady-state and in the transitional period and derive the supply-side determinants of energy consumption. Then, using firm-level micro panel data on the Turkish manufacturing industry from 2009 to 2015, we test the proposed model with static and dynamic panel data estimators. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed model is consistent with Turkish manufacturing data. Out of the supply-side determinants, firms’ output/value-added and total factor productivity, as a proxy for technological progress, are found to be the most significant determinants of firm-level energy use. Estimations also reveal quite heterogenous effects of technology on energy use in different manufacturing subsectors. Hence, although promoting technological change in the manufacturing industry is, without a doubt, the most convenient way to reduce energy use, policymakers should develop sector-specific incentives to achieve this goal.\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Introduction: Botulinum toxin injections effectively smooth dynamic forehead wrinkles by temporarily relaxing the underlying muscles, creating rejuvenated appearance. Complications may range from minor issues, such as transient swelling and bruising, to severe adverse events, including vascular occlusion leading to tissue necrosis and vision loss. The knowledge about the depth and morphology of the frontal area vessels may aid in reducing the number of complications. Materials and methods: Five research papers were included in the meta-analysis. The analyses were performed in two distinctive places bilaterally: at the level of the glabella and above the eyebrow. Results: A total of 201 SOA arteries and 282 STA arteries were analysed at the following horizontal levels, respectively: at the level of the glabella and above the eyebrow. The final results were as follows: 5.68 mm, 95% CI (4.58–6.78) for SOA at the glabella, 5.53 mm, 95% CI (4.79–6.28) for SOA above the eyebrow, 4.45 mm, 95% CI (3.43–5.47) for STA at the glabella, and 3.53 mm, 95% CI (3.21–3.85) for STA above the eyebrow. Conclusions: The supratrochlear artery tends to become more superficial along its path, while the supraorbital artery remains at a consistent depth across various anatomical levels. For injections in the medial part of the forehead, it is advisable to place the needle up to 2.5 mm deep or laterally to the artery's path. In contrast, injections in the lateral part of the forehead can be administered at slightly deeper depths, up to 3.5 mm. To minimise the risk of complications, performing a high-resolution linear ultrasonography (USG) exam prior to injection is recommended, allowing for needle placement either laterally or medially to the vessels.</p>"

Key results   SC1-LWLR had higher purge than SC2-Berk (2.85% and 1.83% respectively; standard error of the difference (SED) = 0.33; P = 0.003), higher cook loss on Day 16 (24.63% and 16.79% respectively; SED = 1.62; P = 0.017) and higher WBSF on Day 2 and Day 16 (Day 2, 30.9 N and 26.7 N respectively; Day 16, 28.6 N and 22.0 N respectively; SED = 0.98, interaction P = 0.003). SC1-LWLR had a lower proportion of Type I (10.1% vs 16.0%; SED = 0.51) and Type IIA (14.0% vs 22.0%; SED = 0.77) and a higher proportion of Type IIB (75.9% vs 62.0%; SED = 0.74) (P &lt; 0.001 for all) fibres. SC1-LWLR had lower DSC temperatures for two peaks. SC2-Berk had higher citrate synthase activity (P = 0.003) and glycolytic potential (P &lt; 0.001) than SC1-LWLR.     Conclusions   SC2-Berk longissimus had improved quality compared with SC1-LWLR pork, most likely owing, in part, to higher proportion of oxidative and intermediate fibres in the Berkshires. However, effects of differences in environmental conditions and/or processing conditions cannot be ruled out.     Implications   The experiment increased our understanding of how variation in supply chains and muscle fibre-type proportion can impact the production of consistently high-quality pork.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past ten years, blockchain technology has significantly captured interest in various application fields. Originally devised for the Bitcoin peer-to-peer cryptocurrency network, extensive research now explores integrating blockchain with various other service domains. The technology is celebrated for its decentralized structure, robust security, immutability, and transparency. In blockchain systems, consensus algorithms play a crucial role in establishing unanimous agreement among participants within a distributed computing environment, facilitating the addition of new blocks to the blockchain network. The effectiveness and security of the network largely hinge on the performance of these consensus algorithms. However, existing consensus algorithms face challenges with throughput, latency, and communication complexity. To address these issues, an enhanced consensus algorithm known as Intuitive Random Selection based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFTIRS) is introduced. This algorithm optimizes the consensus process by selecting a subset of nodes, thereby reducing network complexity and enhancing efficiency without sacrificing security. To tackle scalability issues in blockchains, a hierarchical BFTIRS algorithm that incorporates sharding is developed. This approach segments network participants into local and global consensus groups, each conducting the consensus process independently. Performance evaluations of this algorithm show improvements in both efficiency and security over existing solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Indonesia's economic growth in the logistics sector is becoming increasingly significant, alongside the rising demand for goods. However, the complexity of logistics supply chain management in Indonesia still faces challenges, including security, human error, and lack of transparency. This research proposes the use of blockchain technology for a logistics supply chain management system, which is capable of storing transaction data in a decentralized and distributed manner. Ganache is used as a local blockchain server, Metamask for transactions, and smart contracts to manage user flows on a web3 dapps-based website. The research procedure includes literature study, design, development, and system testing. The test results indicate that all features and functions of the system operate as expected. The system not only successfully handles high demand and transaction spikes but also demonstrates enhanced data security, improved transparency through real-time tracking, and robust performance under high workloads. Overall, this blockchain-based logistics supply chain management system effectively secures and manages transaction data while enabling data tracking and tracing, thereby increasing transparency and handling high concurrent transactions efficiently.</jats:p>"

The digital transformation of supply chain management (SCM) has emerged as a critical enabler of operational efficiency, sustainability, and innovation in the global marketplace. The research examines how these technologies improve visibility, enhance decision-making, streamline processes, and foster agility in supply chains. The study aims to include 150 participants for surveys and 10 industry experts for interviews, ensuring adequate representation across sectors and regions. Statistical analysis is performed using tools like SPSS or Microsoft Excel. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and ANOVA, t-test are used to analyze survey data.Through a mixed-methods approach, involving both qualitative case studies and quantitative surveys, this study investigates the experiences of organizations implementing digital solutions in supply chain management. The findings reveal that while digital transformation can lead to substantial improvements in supply chain efficiency and responsiveness, its successful implementation requires careful planning, strategic investment, and overcoming resistance to change. The thesis offers practical recommendations for organizations to mitigate these challenges, such as phased implementation, employee training programs, and strong cybersecurity measures. Additionally, it suggests that policymakers play a crucial role in supporting digital transformation through incentives, regulations, and fostering public-private partnerships. In conclusion, digital transformation presents both immense opportunities and considerable challenges for supply chain management. With the right strategies and investment, organizations can leverage digital technologies to create more resilient, sustainable, and competitive supply chains in the rapidly evolving global business landscape.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a simulation library for 5GDHC networks as sustainable shared energy systems, developed in the object-oriented simulation framework OpenModelica. It comprises sub-models for residential buildings acting as prosumers in the network, with additional roof-mounted thermal systems, dynamic thermo-hydraulic representations of distribution pipes and storage, time-series-based sources for heating and cooling, and weather conditions adjustable to user-specified locations. A detailed insight into an in-house development of a sub-model for horizontal ground heat collectors is given. This sub-model is directly coupled with thermo-hydraulic network simulations. The simulation results of energy balances and energetic efficiencies for an example district are described. Findings from this study show that decentralised roof-mounted solar thermal systems coupled to the network can contribute 21% to the total source heat provided in the network while annual thermal gains from the distribution pipes add up to more than 18% within the described settings. The presented simulation library can support conceptual and advanced planning phases for renewable heating and cooling supply structures based on environmental sources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this review, we argue that access to financial advice and the quality of this advice are shaped by a broad array of demand-side and supply-side constraints. While the literature has predominantly focused on conflicts of interest between advisors and clients, we highlight that the transaction costs of providing advice, mistaken beliefs on the demand side or supply side, and other factors can have equally detrimental effects on the quality of and access to advice. Moreover, these factors affect how researchers should assess the impact of financial advice across heterogeneous groups of households. While households with low levels of financial literacy are more likely to benefit from advice—potentially including conflicted advice—they are also the least likely to detect misconduct and perhaps the least likely to understand the value of paying for advice. Regulators should consider not only how regulation changes the quality of advice but also the fraction of households who are able to receive it and how different groups would have invested without any advice. Financial innovation has the potential to provide customized advice at low cost but also to embed conflicts of interest in algorithms that are opaque to households and regulators.</jats:p>",

A survey of 423 firms in the Greek food industry was conducted to meet these objectives. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, followed by confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, to explore the relationships between the model’s constructs. The results indicate that “firm-level critical sustainability factors” and “supply chain critical sustainability factors” significantly enhance “supply chain collaboration” and “supply chain strategic orientation”. Additionally, “supply chain strategic orientation” positively influences “social performance” and “environmental performance”, while “supply chain collaboration” positively affects “economic performance” and “environmental performance”. Furthermore, “social performance” is found to have a significant positive impact on “economic performance”. This study provides empirical evidence that helps managers understand the importance of the relationships among SSCM critical factors, SSCM practices, and SSCM performance, and enables them to allocate resources effectively and design SSCM strategies. Finally, the developed constructs offer a measurement tool useful for both practitioners implementing SSCM in their firms and researchers who wish to apply or test the proposed scales in other projects or use them as benchmarks.</jats:p>"

For the initial factor collection phase, there were a total of eighteen (18) responses, and for the factor evaluation phase, a total of twenty-six (26) experts were used to collect responses. Identified factors were shortlisted and evaluated using a Relative Importance Index (RII) analysis. The study’s findings are presented through a Causal-Loop Diagram (CLD) to illustrate the relationships between factors. The framework provides practical guidance for organizations planning to adopt IRPA, informing decision-making, resource allocation, and strategy development. The final process analysis framework highlights the importance of accuracy, level of human involvement in a task, and standardization as the main three primary factors for successful IRPA adoption. Three major secondary factors were identified: digital data input, integration with existing systems, and the cost of adopting new technologies. This research contributes to the added value to existing knowledge and serves as a foundation for future research in IRPA adoption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a buyer-led supply chain, the buyer utilizes a forward contract to effectively cope with the risk brought about by uncertainty in demand and raw material prices. However, the production cost, as private information of the supplier, will inevitably affect the formulation of a forward contract. This study constructs a procurement system consisting of a buyer, a supplier, and an imperfect spot market to explore how the buyer designs the forward contract under asymmetric cost information. By applying the principal-agent theory, this study allows the buyer to maximize profits while disclosing the supplier’s cost information. The results obtained indicate that in order to screen the cost type, the forward order quantity from the high-cost supplier is downward distorted. Asymmetric cost information reduces the buyer’s profits, but brings additional information rent to the supplier. Interestingly, it is also observed that asymmetric material cost information can discourage the buyer from engaging in speculative activities in the spot market. While the existence of a well-developed raw material spot market with a reduced price provides the buyer with an alternative means of procurement, which mitigates the negative impacts of his cost information disadvantages.</jats:p>",

The main aim of this paper is to provide a data-driven solution for effective water resource management and thereby controlling the effects of floods and droughts. The Malampuzha dam, which has a spillway, a right bank canal (RBC), and a left bank canal (LBC), is considered for the study. While the spillway helps to control the water level in the reservoir by allowing extra water to flow downstream during times of severe rainfall or high inflow, hence reducing the risk of floods, the LBC and RBC are intended to divert water for agriculture. Altogether, 10 years of consecutive meteorological and dam-related data are utilized for training and testing the models in forecasting water discharge through LBC, RBC, and the spillway. Different deep-learning models, namely, long short-term memory, bi-directional long-short term memory, recurrent neural network, gated recurrent unit, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), deep neural network, autoencoder, and residual networks are explored in predicting the accuracy of dam water discharge. After testing eight deep-learning models, it was discovered that 1D-CNN performed well in predicting the discharge of water.</jats:p>",

Apples are a common type of fruit that is present in our diet almost all year round. They contain a significant amount of vitamins (C, B1, B2, P, E), manganese, potassium, and easily digestible iron.  Apples are hypoallergenic and can be consumed by almost everyone.\r\nThe purpose of the work is to intensify the drying of apple slices to low residual moisture without loss of biologically active substances.\r\n Research methods. The study of the kinetics of the slices drying process was performed on an experimental convective stand with a system of automatic recording and processing of information at a drying agent temperature of 60, 80, 80/60 ºC and a stepwise combined mode with a combination of IR radiation and convective heating of IR (100 W)+60 °C/60 °C, speed 1.5 m/s, moisture content 10 g/kg dry air.\r\nResults and conclusions. Summarising the research results, it can be concluded that the temperature of the drying agent at 80 °C ensures a short duration of the dehydration process, but the organoleptic characteristics of the finished product are unsatisfactory.\r\nDrying at a temperature of 60 °C leads to an increase in dehydration time, and as a result, to an increase in energy consumption and a deterioration in organoleptic characteristics and recoverability.\r\nIt is recommended that the dehydration process of slices be carried out according to the developed stepwise drying modes: convective 80/60 °C and combined infrared-convective IR (100 W) + 60 °C / 60 °C.\r\nBased on the study of the kinetics of moisture exchange in the combined convective-infrared mode of drying apple slices, a formula for calculating the total duration of the process was obtained. The difference between the experimental and theoretical values of the drying time does not exceed 3%.\r\nThe analysis of the constructed dependences of the Rebinder's number confirms the energy efficiency of the recommended modes of drying apple slices.\r\nThe resulting product under the developed stepwise drying regimes has high recoverability (78...80%) and organoleptic characteristics: balanced taste, natural aroma, and light cream colour inherent in the raw material.</jats:p>"

The role of aerial reconnaissance using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has recently increased dramatically. The main reason for this is the low cost compared to reconnaissance aircraft and the rapid deployment of UAVs. Thus, reconnaissance UAVs are assigned the following tasks: reconnaissance; artillery fire adjustment; situational awareness. The data obtained during aerial reconnaissance using UAVs are critical for planning, conducting and evaluating the results of military operations. As practice has shown, it is not recommended to use off-the-shelf neural networks for recognizing objects on the ground, because the recognition speed is slow and the power of existing mini-PCs is not enough for real-time recognition on board a UAV, and they are not suitable for UAV autonomy tasks. It is necessary to create a separate neural network and train it using satellite images. To determine the aerodynamic corrections to the UAV's air pressure receivers, the “loop” method is suitable, in which GPS coordinates are used instead of a measurement base, and aerodynamic corrections to the altitude are determined by formulas. The scientific novelty consists in a comprehensive approach to the issue of improving the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance from the point of view of improving navigation and flight technical characteristics. Thanks to the practical use of artificial intelligence and the method of analysis of hierarchies, it is proposed to improve the quality of evaluation of the criteria for the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance with the help of unmanned aircraft systems.\r\nThe results of the research are of practical importance and can be used in the development of the latest reconnaissance UAVs and the improvement of existing ones to evaluate the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance.</jats:p>"

Strategies have a significant impact on global trade because they enable the effective development of goods across international borders. The decision making is an important task for the development of Logistics Supply Chain (LSC) infrastructure and process. Decisions on supplier selection, production schedule, transportation routes, inventory levels, pricing strategies, and other issues need to be made. These decisions may have a big influence on customer service, profitability, operational efficiency, and overall competitiveness. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach of Fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (Fuzzy-Promethee-2) is used to assess the priority selection of the factors associated with the LSC and evaluate the importance in global trade. The role of AI is very useful compare to statistical analysis in terms of decision making. The computational analysis placed promotion of exports as the most important priority out of five selected attributes in LSC, with infrastructure development. The result suggests that LSC depends heavily on export promotion as the most significant attribute. Infrastructural development also appeared another factor influencing LSC. The foreign investment was ranked the lowest. The evaluated results are useful for the policy makers, supply chain managers and the logistics professionals associated with the supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been much focus toward increasing integration of AI in healthcare generally, with a specific focus on inventory management systems in particular. As more hospitals in the United States public and private side face increasing costs and concerns over cost and length of operation all systems supporting inventory must be made most efficient and AI system offers the US hospitals the opportunity to maintain accurate inventory and hence improve the quality of patient care. But the literature review presents a small number of studies that focus on the effects of these systems as the means to improve healthcare results and organization. In this study, it is proposed that improving inventory management by actioning artificial intelligence in healthcare organizations will result in enhanced patient care and improved inventory accuracy, cost reduction and supply chain efficiency in the United States of America’s healthcare institutions. A cross-sectional, quantitative survey was administrated to 200 healthcare personnel and supply chain managers from different healthcare organizations based on hospitals, clinics and specialty medical centers of the USA. Sample design: Participants were purposefully chosen, who had prior exposure to the AI-induced systems or are aware about workflow of such systems. Respondents’ data was gathered via an online questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS: descriptive analysis, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relationships of the study variables: AI systems, healthcare outcomes and supply chain performance.  The results showed that the use of AI in inventory management systems enhances its accuracy in ordering order itself and overall patient care. Separate studies showed that where the management of a facility has deeper insight of the AI system then there will be more operations worked on to improve efficiency or cut costs. Adoption of these pathways among smaller providers including clinics and long-term care facilities was difficult, especially due to cost constraints. An analysis of the multiple regression equation showed that knowledge of AI improved the projection of potential healthcare outcome, creating greater worth and also increases the performance of supply chain. The outcomes of using AI based inventory management systems in the United States seem to have a lot of advantages that may help improve the efficacy of operations in the healthcare system. Issues such as funding and skills needed for implementation, especially in small healthcare organization, continue to slow the uptake of the technology. These existing problems may be solved if more focused investments in the development of comprehensive AI training or systematic solutions are given to enable the healthcare industry to reach the full potential of the application of artificial intelligence.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The pharmaceutical supply chain is a multilayered and complex structure designed to deliver medicines to customers in a timely manner while ensuring optimal quality and quantity of medicines. The COVID-19 outbreak exposed the vulnerability and uncertainty of the pharmaceutical supply chain, so managing the risks in the pharmaceutical supply chain has become particularly important. This study demonstrates that digital twin (DT) technology can improve pharmaceutical supply chain agility and reduce the ripple effect caused by disruptions. The ripple effect refers to the effect that a sudden disruption at one node in the supply chain has on causing a chain reaction in the rest of the supply chain. The most used risk management method today is the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which allows for real-time data sharing but has limitations in predicting and modeling the entire supply chain and lacks the ability to make quick decisions and simulate the entire supply chain. DT technology creates a virtual model of the supply chain, which enables continuous communication and information exchange between real assets and the virtual model, offering a promising alternative to risk management for pharmaceutical supply chains. risk management by providing a promising alternative. This study utilizes the AnyLogistix platform to construct a DT model and demonstrates the effectiveness of DT technology in reducing ripple effects and improving supply chain agility using quantitative analysis. This paper focuses on analyzing the pharmaceutical supply chain for 75mg aspirin tablets in London. A supply chain that operates normally, a supply chain that introduces a disruptive event (closure of the logistics center due to an earthquake), and a supply chain that applies a proactive strategy (activation of an alternate logistics center) to mitigate risk are simulated separately. The positive impact of DT technology on the supply chain is evaluated by analyzing the methods of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as inventory level, order fulfillment rate, and delivery time. The experimental results show that DT technology enhances the responsiveness, flexibility, speed, and proactivity of the supply chain, which significantly improves the agility of the supply chain. Proactive and effective strategies also reduce the financial impact of disruptions and service levels are quickly recovered. In addition, the proactive strategy stabilized inventory levels and reduced delayed orders. The above key metrics confirm the hypothesis that DT technology can improve supply chain agility and effectively reduce the ripple effect. Despite the significant conclusions drawn in this paper, there are some limitations. Firstly, sensitivity analysis and t-test were not used in the study for secondary testing, which resulted in the lack of reliability of the validation results. In addition, the possible interaction between the ripple effect and the bullwhip effect was not discussed, leading to a confounding factor in the experimental results. The above issues can be considered in further research in the future. Finally, this paper explores the possibilities and uses of introducing machine learning techniques and considers the supply chain risk factors of globalization. In summary, this study validates the potential of digital twin technology in improving agility and coping with ripple effects in pharmaceutical supply chains. As research continues, DT technology is expected to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce supply chain risk while ensuring patient safety.</jats:p>"

The results show that supply chain governance has significant positive effects on information sharing, supplier trust, supply chain integration and firm performance. Government support plays a positive moderate role between supply chain governance and supply chain integration. Supply chain governance will indirectly affect enterprise performance through information sharing, supplier trust and supply chain integration, and the indirect effect is stronger than the direct effect.

The fair profit distribution (FPD) approach offers a solution by optimizing supply chain flows (materials, information, and money) to promote economic equity among members. However, our literature review highlights a gap in applying the FPD approach to the facility location-allocation problem in supply chain network design (SCND), particularly in sugarcane-derived biofuel supply chains. Methods: Consequently, we propose a multi-period optimization model based on FPD to design a sugarcane biofuel supply chain. The methodology involves four steps: constructing a conceptual model, developing a mathematical model, designing a solution strategy, and generating insights. This model considers both investment (crop development, biorefinery construction) and operational phases over a long-term planning horizon, focusing on farm location and crop allocation. Results: By comparing the FPD model to a traditional centralized planning supply chain (CSC) approach, we examine the impact of the planning horizon, number of farms, and sugarcane prices paid by biorefineries on financial performance. While the FPD model results in lower overall system profits, it fosters a fairer economic scenario for farmers. Conclusions: This study contributes to economic justice in supply chains and offers insights to promote fair trade among stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Operating through both online and traditional channels with uncertain demands, the producer’s distribution strategy prompts an exploration of supply chain dynamics. Utilizing an integer programming model, this study calculates optimal prices, optimizes total profit, and minimizes transportation costs to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, depending on the transportation mode. Additionally, this study incorporates renewable energy sources into the production and transportation processes to further minimize carbon dioxide emissions. The integration of renewable energy not only supports environmental goals, but also contributes to the overall profitability of the supply chain by reducing energy costs. Employing a theoretical technique for linearization, the model, resolved through the Jimenez and TH methods, demonstrates efficacy in reconciling economic and environmental goals. The Jimenez method enables the transformation of fuzzy parameters into deterministic equivalents, allowing for a more reliable optimization during uncertainty, while the TH method provides an interactive fuzzy multi-objective approach, aligning the model’s dual objectives for both economic and environmental goals. Notably, when transportation costs to both markets are equal, the model prioritizes devices with a lower environmental impact, showcasing adaptability. Furthermore, the proposed solution empowers decision makers to influence pricing and enhance the entire supply chain’s profitability. In conclusion, this research offers nuanced insights, strategically aligning economic viability with environmental sustainability in the discourse on green supply chains.</jats:p>"

In particular, the decrease in precipitation during the summer months had a significant impact on urban tree water availability. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methodologies for determining the available water supply and evapotranspiration rates for urban trees. We mapped data from 49 urban small-leaved linden trees with varying characteristics including groundwater levels, shading situations, tree pit sizes, pavement materials, and sealing ratios. By combining these data with an adapted Penman-Monteith method to calculate evapotranspiration, we simulated the soil water storage and evapotranspiration rates of these trees during the very dry year of 2018 as an example. Model validations were performed using lysimeter and sap-flow studies on Tilia cordata trees in 2022. During the growing season, most trees experienced water stress on &gt; 85% of the days because of weak precipitation events that failed to refill soil water storage. In contrast, trees with additional water supply through capillary rise reached water stress approximately 45 days later. The model results suggest that many trees will require additional water supply during predicted droughts in the future, which could have significant implications for urban forestry management. This model approach can be used to test and refine future water supply management strategies, making it a useful planning tool for improving the water efficiency of trees in urban areas and blue-green infrastructure.</jats:p>",

This system was developed on a local device using Java and Java Servlet/JSP as the front-end, and JDBC for database connectivity, with MySQL data storage. It applies blockchain technology's decentralized and immutable structure to create a trusted network among diverse stakeholders within the supply chain. This means that in a peer-to-peer blockchain model in which the nodes are connected for the registration of each transaction, no record can be altered or tampered with. It actually scans the QR codes and verifies the product at every level within the supply chain in real time. That way, only authenticated drugs can have a transaction completed while preventing counterfeit drugs from reaching consumers. Its decentralized blockchain network further helps mitigate the issues with the possibility of data tampering or a single point of failure, hence making the system secure against multiple security threats. The system further uses cryptographic methods, such as digital signing and double encryption, to ensure integrity and anonymity to users. This paper discusses technology, system design, and how this blockchain solution offers an efficient supply chain toward the demands of the pharmaceutical industry for safe dispensation of drugs for which consumers eventually gain confidence in later stages.</jats:p>"

The research aims to identify key barriers to CVD care, assess the socioeconomic impacts of these diseases on affected families, and explore potential interventions to improve healthcare access and outcomes in rural Kenya.\r\nMethodology: A descriptive design study employing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. A stratified random sample of 399 households from three sub-counties in Bomet County was surveyed using structured questionnaires. Additionally, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted with CVD patients and caregivers, along with three focus group discussions involving healthcare workers. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns and themes.\r\nFindings: The study reveals significant challenges in accessing CVD healthcare services in Bomet County, with only 23.2% of respondents reporting easy access. Financial constraints emerged as the primary barrier, cited by 75.2% of participants. CVD-affected households experienced substantial economic hardship, with healthcare expenditures consuming an average of 42% of non-food household income, compared to 12% for non-CVD households. The study also found that 68% of CVD-affected households faced catastrophic health expenditures. Qualitative data highlighted the emotional and social toll of CVDs on patients and their families, including asset depletion, increased debt, and food insecurity.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Policy and Practice: This research enhances theoretical frameworks on health equity and access in resource-limited settings by providing a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between CVD care access, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes in rural Kenya. The study's implications span policy and practice, advocating for the expansion of universal health coverage to include CVD services, implementation of financial protection mechanisms, and development of community-based care models. Practical recommendations include enhancing CVD screening programs, improving coordination between primary and specialized care, implementing telemedicine solutions, and developing support systems for CVD patients and their families. These insights contribute to both the academic discourse on health disparities and provide actionable strategies for improving CVD care in similar resource-constrained environments.</jats:p>"

This study uses bibliometric analysis on 1069 articles from the Scopus database, using text mining and Python to uncover predominant themes and research trends at the intersection of blockchain and SCM. The key findings revealed three main thematic groups: ‘blockchain to improve transparency and traceability in SCM’ (supported by 323 articles), ‘impact of blockchain on supply chain efficiency and cost reduction’ (295 articles), and ‘blockchain-enabled supply chain resilience’ (191 articles). Furthermore, text mining highlighted prominent themes such as ‘decentralized supply chain networks’ (204 articles), ‘smart contracts for automated processes in SCM’ (234 articles), and ‘blockchain for sustainable supply chain practices’ (227 articles). The inclusion of sustainability themes reflects the growing importance of environmentally conscious strategies within supply chains, driven by the capacity of blockchain to reduce waste, and promote resource efficiency. The study identifies critical literature gaps, advocating for further exploration of the socio-economic impacts of blockchain on SCM. The topic extraction suggests new directions for SCM theory, while the role of blockchain in fostering sustainable and ethical supply chains is underscored. Practically, blockchain and IoT emerge as pivotal in the advancement of SCM, with text mining offering industry foresight and emphasizing blockchain-driven resilient strategies.

This suggests that exogenous PD-L1 and Gal-9 may have promising potential as therapeutics for the treatment of T1D. In light of these reports, a recent work investigated the potential of artificial extracellular vesicles (aEVs) with the presentation of PD-L1 and Gal-9 ligands (PD-L1–Gal-9 aEVs) as a treatment for T1D, with the findings published in Diabetes . Notably, the PD-L1–Gal-9 aEVs demonstrated the capacity to induce apoptosis of T cells and the formation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby maintaining immune tolerance. Furthermore, the in vivo  administration of PD-L1–Gal-9 aEVs resulted in a reduction in T cell infiltration in the pancreas, an increase in β-cell integrity protection, a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, and a delay in the progression of T1D. In conclusion, this study proposed an innovative approach to the treatment of T1D progression through the use of immunosuppressive EVs. This highlight provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the pivotal findings of this study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has long been clear that the water supply in ancient Greece was transformed over time, with the relative number of various types of water sources varying in time and space. Yet, what patterns this produced has never been explored, and the degree to which trends suggested by local or qualitative studies are representative for larger areas and patterns is unknown. The root of this uncertainty lies largely in the difficulty assembling an extensive and representative material beyond individual sites or cities. Following this, the present article has two aims. The first is to test and evaluate a method for collecting an extensive and (more) representative material for the investigation of the water supply in ancient Greece on a regional scale, based on a systematic review of the material from the Peloponnese published in Archaeological Reports 1887–2012. The second aim is to discuss how the collected data can be used to explore the transformations of the water supply systems on the Peloponnese in the period 900 BC–AD 300. Together the results are intended to develop further the WaterWorks project, which aims to create a better understanding of the development of the ancient water supply. The method produced a considerably better dataset than previously available. The dataset, recorded in an Access database, suggests that some hitherto acknowledged trends are probably valid for larger areas while others are less prominent than previously believed. However, in the end, the dataset is too limited to allow firm conclusions concerning how, and to a larger degree why, the water supply system was transformed over time. The dataset will be made publicly accessible in an open access repository.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the prevalence of green supply chains, the government has basic requirements for companies’ green investments and outcomes while consumers increasingly favor green products. Thus, green degree decision has garnered significant attention from manufacturers. This paper incorporates green degree decisions into a dual-channel supply chain and adopts a Stackelberg model to analyze the green degree and pricing strategies under centralized and decentralized decisions. We find that, when the manufacturer only decides on price, dual-channel choice is always the optimal strategy under centralized decision-making; however, under decentralized decision-making, the dual-channel choice will be chosen only when the wholesale price is low. Considering green degree decision, both direct and indirect channel prices increase with the green degree, and the indirect channel price is more sensitive to changes in the green degree under centralized decision-making; and higher green degrees are always advantageous for the retailer, but the manufacturer’s profit initially decreases and then increases as the green degree rises under decentralized decision-making. Moreover, the wholesale price is used as a strategic tool for the manufacturer to control the distribution channel, particularly when the green degree is not introduced, the manufacturer can always ensure the introduction of dual channels. Besides, higher consumers’ environmental awareness is always beneficial to channel members, as it promotes channel prices and green degree. This study provides strategic insights for optimizing pricing and green degree decisions in dual-channel supply chains to achieve better economic and environmental outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A profound transformation of the entire food system is necessary to achieve sustainable development in the agricultural sector. This pertains to the production, distribution, and consumption of food. In the case of distribution, this transformation involves changes both at the beginning of the chain, namely, in the agricultural structure, and at the final stage, in consumer behaviour. By analysing the existing literature, we identify key areas where the principles of short supply chains can be harmonised with smart village initiatives. The concept of smart villages itself is based on using modern technologies and innovative practices to improve the quality of life in rural areas and support sustainable development. Consequently, as mentioned, one of the critical elements of this concept is the cooperation of farmers for sustainable short supply chain management. This study analysed statistical data from the Central Statistical Office of Poland and unpublished data from the General Veterinary Inspectorate, complemented by desk research on relevant reports, scientific literature, and legal documents concerning local food systems. The study investigates local food systems in the Mazowieckie region, where 9% of Polish entities operating within local food systems are registered. Activity within this framework is characterised by significant spatial diversity across the region. The spatial distribution is mainly related to the location of the raw material base, e.g., the concentration of specialised agricultural production, distance to the sales market (proximity to consumers), and other broadly understood conditions for conducting business activity. The paper highlights the need to transform food systems to support sustainable agricultural development, focusing on short supply chains and smart village initiatives. By examining local food systems in Poland’s Mazowieckie region, it identifies how spatial and resource factors impact local food distribution and rural sustainability.</jats:p>"

As the world's fourth-largest coffee producer, Indonesia has a vast potential to increase its coffee exports. This economic impact is not only a source of foreign exchange but also a significant source of income for smallholder farmers. However, recent inefficiencies have led to declining exports and quality control issues. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of transparency and traceability in the coffee supply chain, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to monitor the movement of coffee beans from farm to market. Thus, this research aims to address these problems by developing a blockchain-integrated traceability platform enhanced with IoT technology. The platform connects all stakeholders in the coffee supply chain, including farmers, processors, distributors, sellers, and consumers, ensuring real-time monitoring and data transparency throughout the coffee supply chain. This benefitted not only the involved stakeholders but also the end consumers.

High-quality seed also encourages using extra agricultural inputs like fertilizers and insecticides. The Ethiopian seed system development strategy recognizes the formal, intermediary, and farmer seed systems. The farmers&amp;apos; system is the primary seed source, with relatively little contribution from the formal system. The public sector primarily controls the formal system&amp;apos;s breeding and seed distribution. The formal, farmers&amp;apos;, and intermediary systems are comparable to each other. The government encourages Seed Producers Cooperatives (SPCs) to cultivate and supply seeds to the market. Cooperatives (SPCs) supply of high-quality seeds for various crops in response to local and international demand and the needs of farmers. This helps to ensure national seed security. Policymakers and development experts have recognized the significant role of SPCs in Ethiopia&amp;apos;s seed industry, and the country&amp;apos;s agricultural development initiatives reflect this. It is essential to reform the seed industry to have a positive impact on Ethiopian agriculture&amp;apos;s progress. However, the seed industry in Ethiopia faces limitations due to institutional, organizational, technical, and infrastructure challenges, preventing it from meeting the increasing demand from different agro-ecologies and farming systems. Despite this, little research has been conducted to study and document SPCs&amp;apos; involvement in the seed industry and their contributions. Unfortunately, not much work has gone into examining and recording their contributions to increasing seed access and availability as well as their involvement in the seed industry. Concerning improving seed supply and guaranteeing seed security in Ethiopia, this review aimed to evaluate Seed Producers Cooperatives&amp;apos; present standing in the seed industry.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research discusses the design of a performance measurement system for supply chain management using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model developed by the Supply Chain Council. The SCOR model focuses on five main activities within a company's supply chain, namely plan, source, make, deliver, and return. All activities are linked with performance attributes such as reliability, responsiveness, flexibility, cost, and assets. The implementation of this model is applied to CV. XYZ, a company that operates in the production of plain and printed T-shirts, which is located in East Java. The research was conducted from January 2024 to September 2024. The results of the study identified that there are 35 performance indicators representing supply chain activities, with the following breakdown: 9 indicators for the plan activity, 7 indicators for the source activity, 6 indicators for the make activity, 7 indicators for the deliver activity, and 6 indicators for the return activity. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to weight each activity in the SCOR model. Based on the results, the highest priority was the source activity (0.252), followed by deliver (0.222), plan (0.221), make (0.209), and return (0.095). From the scoring system, it was found that 23 indicators have a green score, 8 indicators have a yellow score, and 4 indicators have a red score. The limitation of this research is that one SCOR activity, \"enable,\" was not analyzed. Therefore, it is recommended that future research analyze all SCOR activities.</jats:p>"

Methods: Using data from 29 Ethiopian footwear industries and 205 respondents, the relationship established in the theoretical framework was validated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The study’s findings provided several important insights. First, upstream supply chain complexity (USSCC), midstream supply chain complexity (MSSCC), and downstream supply chain complexity (DSSCC) negatively affect SCP. Second, additive manufacturing best practices have significant moderation effects between supply chain complexity and supply chain performance. Third, the negative impacts of USSCC and MSSCC on SCP are reduced at a higher level of additive manufacturing adaptation. The findings of this study also revealed that the effects of DSSCC on SCP have no difference at both low and high levels of additive manufacturing best practices. Conclusions: This work offers the first empirical investigation to which the detrimental effects of SCC on SCP are mitigated or improved through the moderating role of additive manufacturing best practice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The gallium resources were assessed and used as input to long term simulations using the WORLD7 model. The content of gallium in different mother ores has been estimated to be about 14.7 million ton of gallium. Much of this is not accessible because of low extraction yields, about 610,000 ton gallium appear to be extractable (4%) with present practices. The gallium content in all source metal refining residuals is about 51,000 ton/yr, but only a production of 1,374 ton/yr appear as the maximum with present technology and conditions. The actual gallium production was about 450 ton/yr in 2023. The gallium price is very sensitive to increases in demand, and production is not very likely to be able to rapidly increase. The simulations show that soft gallium scarcity sets in after 2028 and physical scarcity will occur about 2060. Better gallium extraction and recycling yields may push the scarcity date forward to 2100. In the long term, only 60% of the gallium demand to photovoltaic technology can be satisfied. To really improve the situation and prevent scarcity, extractive access, gallium extraction yields and recycling yields must be significantly improved to better than 50%. At present the overall yields are 7-15%. Increasing both extraction yields and recycling yields can reduce the shortage. The long term sustainable extraction is under Business-as-Usual about 300 ton gallium per year, about 67% of the present production. Doubling present extraction and recycling yields may increase this to 460 ton per year. This poses a major challenge to future plans for an energy transition, where under Business-As-Usual (BAU), such a transition will remain a fair fantasy. The four EEA imaginaries, Ecotopia, The Great Decoupling, Unity in Adversity, and Technocracy for the Common Good, offer different policy pathways for managing future gallium scarcity through varying degrees of technological advancement, resource conservation, and avoidance strategy.</p>"

High-quality data related to containers is essential for container movement across the border speed. However, customs and port authorities face information incorrectness and inconsistency, which are significant determinants that decrease the performance of container clearance in supply chain activities. The Seamless Integrated Data Pipeline principle has been proposed to overcome the mentioned data quality shortcomings and enhance supply chain visibility. Based on the Data Pipeline idea, we proposed the Distributed Trust Backbone (DTB) as a model of secure information exchange between parties within the supply chain activity. However, the supply chain data is highly dynamic. Access control on dynamic resources is the key to enabling secure data exchange and clear visibility. We take this challenge up in this paper. We propose an access control mechanism based on the supply chain Data Pipeline concept and apply it to the DTB model. The elaboration on the concrete detail of the system is presented in this paper. The prototype has been developed and performed in the simulation tests. It reduces 58% of requesting data for supply chain activities. The results of the experiments show that our proposed method performs 100% access control to data with BigO(1) accessing the Access Control List. It can ensure that the information for decision-making in the supply chain is of high quality. The supply chain visibility is clearer and speeds up a modern information exchange system of supply chains.</jats:p>"

Results confirm ten significant antecedents and eight outcomes of BDA based on identified literature. We further estimate the heterogeneity based on subgroup analysis by considering two types of moderators as (a) economic regions (developed vs developing), and (b) type of industry. We find that organizations in developed countries adopt big data largely due to environmental and organizational factors. Further, developed countries can harness the potential of big data for better performance (e.g., supply chain integration, collaboration, customer relationship management, and innovation). This study provides multifaceted insights for practitioners and academia alike regarding the use of big data.</jats:p>"

Simultaneously, as a member of the EU and due to its geographical location in Europe, Poland must meet emission standards and ensure energy security. The aim of this publication is to analyze and evaluate the management of the fuel supply chain (FSC) in Poland in the context of energy security. The main research question formulated is to what extent the management of the FSC can ensure Poland’s energy security. The publication employs two models: MAED (Model for Analysis of Energy Demand) and CDM (canonical distribution model). The research is based on data from the Statistical Office and data provided by the fuel industry. Between 2021 and 2023, Poland diversified its supply sources, mainly from Saudi Arabia (45.2%) and Norway (35.2%), which together account for 80.4% of imports. The current fuel storage capacity (15.05 million m3) is capable of securing production logistics in the event of SC disruptions and market uncertainties. The shift in fuel supply logistics during the discussed period, along with the increase in the fuel safety stock coefficient to quantities exceeding current demand in case of further disruptions caused by external factors, affects the security of the Polish state as well as neighboring countries in Central Europe. Distribution logistics are managed domestically through networks of fuel stations operated by Polish and foreign corporations, including a group of independently owned private fuel stations (47.5%). The fuel industry in Poland has risen to the challenge, maintaining the stability of fuel supplies and their prices.</jats:p>"

However, rural South Africa faces ongoing challenges in delivering reliable and clean water due to infrastructural inadequacies, climate variability, and historical disparities. Addressing these water supply issues is critical for reducing poverty, improving health outcomes, and fostering sustainable development in rural areas. This study utilises a mixed-methods approach within a positivist framework, collecting data through document analysis, self-administered surveys, and structured interviews with various stakeholders across four rural settlements in the Joe Gqabi and Gert Sibande District Municipalities. The primary aims are to evaluate water accessibility and reliability, examine the impact of water scarcity on poverty, investigate the availability of water infrastructure, and assess the effects of water supply on health and education. Findings indicate that deficient water infrastructure and intermittent supply significantly disrupt daily life, educational access, and healthcare services. Health risks due to contaminated water were prevalent, leading to waterborne diseases. Socio-economic impacts included exacerbated poverty, with particular challenges for female students in maintaining menstrual hygiene due to inconsistent water availability. The study proposes a sustainability model that integrates indigenous practices, such as rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, with modern water management technologies. This model, customised to local needs, underscores the importance of increased investment, integrated planning, and enhanced capacity-building in rural water management. By combining traditional and modern approaches, this model aims to improve water reliability, promote health, and support economic resilience in rural settlements.</jats:p>"

In today’s dynamic and uncertain global environment, healthcare supply chains must be resilient, agile, and adaptive to disruptions caused by pandemics, natural disasters, and evolving market demands. Absorptive capacity, defined as an organization's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit external knowledge, has emerged as a critical factor in enabling healthcare supply chains to innovate and respond effectively to these challenges. This systematic review, conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, reviewed 50 peer-reviewed studies to explore the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing absorptive capacity within healthcare supply chains. The findings reveal that AI and BDA significantly improve operational efficiency, demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and risk mitigation while fostering stakeholder collaboration through real-time data sharing and advanced decision support systems. However, several challenges, including data privacy concerns, technological complexity, and resistance to change, hinder the widespread adoption of these technologies. This review also identifies actionable strategies to address these barriers, such as implementing robust cybersecurity measures, standardizing data exchange protocols, and providing training programs to build digital competencies. By synthesizing insights from the reviewed articles, this study offers valuable perspectives for policymakers, healthcare administrators, and technology developers seeking to build innovative, resilient, and efficient healthcare supply chains capable of meeting the demands of an evolving healthcare landscape.</jats:p>"

This study analyzes the influence of the nonuniform operational strategy of FFUs (including the opening rate, arrangement position, and air velocity of FFUs) on the distribution of airborne particulate matter concentration in the cleanroom using CFD simulation technology. Results showed that opening only the top part of the source FFU can significantly reduce the indoor particulate concentration in the cleanroom and maintain the cleanliness that meets the requirements of cleanrooms. In the case of the same number of air exchanges, increasing the air velocity of the upper FFU of the indoor airborne particulate pollution source has a significant effect on the purification of indoor particulate matter in the cleanroom. These results show that the nonuniform air supply from the upper FFU of the source has good purification performance for airborne particles in a typical cleanroom.</jats:p>"

The main challenge faced by magnetic resonance sounding in actual detection processes is the complex electromagnetic noise interference in the environment, making it difficult to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio for water detection. The signal detected by the instrument can be stacked multiple times, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio by √ n times. Therefore, the collected signal can be stacked multiple times through repeated measurements. However, the power supply system of previous nuclear magnetic resonance water detectors used the LCC resonance mode, which presents issues such as low power, fewer signal acquisition times per unit time, and difficult heat dissipation. This article proposes a nuclear magnetic resonance power supply system based on Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS), which adopts constant resonance technology to reduce switching loss and shorten the time required for the power supply to charge the energy storage capacitor. This approach increases the number of measurements per unit time, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio.</jats:p>",

Previous research has demonstrated that the efficiency of single-phase powered asymmetric motors is only viable when the applied load matches the rated load of the motor. Given that this mode of operation is shown to hold practical infeasibilities for asymmetric three-phase motors, the proposal of a solution is put forward that involves varying the capacitance according to demand. This approach results in a significant improvement in efficiency regardless of whether the motor is running on a full or reduced load.</jats:p>"

Our previous findings indicated that low N (LN) conditions increase<jats:italic>E. amylovora in planta</jats:italic>titers and expression of virulence factors.

We observed that LN-AWF induced stronger virulence gene expression than HN-AWF. Metabolomic analysis of both apoplast extracts revealed the presence of common metabolites, however, their proportions were distinct, indicating a direct effect of N availability on apoplast content. Interestingly, changes in the apoplast metabolite proportions were also observed early after bacterial infection, but only in plants grown under LN conditions. To evaluate the effect of single metabolites on virulence gene expression, we selected 43 metabolites and observed that 29 of them were activators whereas two, GABA and citrate, acted as repressors. This study shows that environmental constraints, such as N availability, impact plant-pathogen interactions by altering the apoplastic content.</jats:p>"

By focusing on supply chain security and aiming for sustainable enterprise development, this study explores how stable supply chains contribute to enhanced productivity of core enterprises, using the theory of social capital as a framework. An empirical analysis was conducted using a sample of A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2021. The research findings indicate that greater supply chain stability is associated with higher total factor productivity in enterprises. The mechanism test results show that the supply chain stability relationship can improve the total factor productivity of enterprises through two paths, such as improving the operation and management level of enterprises and optimizing resource allocation. After further heterogeneity analysis, it is found that the stable relationship of the supply chain has a stronger positive impact on the total factor productivity of core enterprises in the non-state-owned enterprise group, the eastern enterprise group, and the large-size enterprise group. These findings help to provide insights for enterprises to achieve sustainable development in the new era.</jats:p>"

The supply chain consists of various stakeholders who are involved either directly or indirectly. Thus, the supply chain is an integrated marketing unit that includes the integration of stakeholders and products to provide satisfaction to customers. Pinrang Regency is one of the largest rice-producing districts in South Sulawesi. The purpose of this study is to analyze the structure of the inter-island rice supply chain in rice mills in Pinrang Regency, analyze the relationship pattern in the inter-island rice supply chain in Pinrang Regency, analyze the influence of inter-island traders on the rice market in Pinrang Regency, the analysis used is descriptive analysis, panel data regression analysis. The results of this study indicate that the structure of the rice supply chain in the mill starts from farmers who supply grain to the mill, then the mill sells rice to inter-island traders, then the mill sells to wholesalers and retailers then finally the mill sells rice to direct consumers. The rice supply chain in each mill has 3 flows, namely product flow, financial flow and information flow. The pattern of relationships in the inter-island rice supply chain, namely the raw material supply channel (grain), the rice product distribution channel (milling), and the inter-island channel cooperate in completing a purchase transaction and the pattern of relationships in the supply chain uses a general trading partnership pattern. The results of the study using the Common Effect Model (CEM) show that the variable amount of production has a positive and significant effect on the volume of inter-island shipments. The destination price variable has a positive and significant effect on the volume of inter-island rice shipments. Then the variable Shipping cost has a positive and significant effect on the volume of inter-island rice shipments.</jats:p>",

The modular design concept is adopted in this research, where the overall flow of the duct is considered as the sum of local flow fields within the duct modules. By analyzing the structural parameters such as cross-section ratio, pipe length, and flow direction within each duct module, a numerical prediction model for flow based on fluid-structure parameters is developed using numerical fitting techniques. Experimental results show that the flow rate prediction accuracy for normal modules is within 10%, and the flow rate prediction accuracy for modules with irregular structures is within 15%. It validates that this numerical prediction method, based on the flow structure, is a reliable tool for assessing and optimizing the flow state and quality of the flow field in the entire rectangular piping system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Existing research provides limited evidence on the impact of supply chain relationships on the financial performance of upstream and downstream firms. Taking the recent proliferation of supply chain alliances between Chinese listed companies as an opportunity, we study the impact of supply chain alliances on the performance of customers and suppliers as well as the underlying mechanisms at play. We focus on Chinese A-share listed companies from 2001 to 2021 and use announcements issued by the listed companies to identify whether they have established a supply chain alliance with another listed company. The announcements come from the information disclosure system of listed companies of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Finally, we obtained 148 pairs of supply chain alliances which formed by 231 listed companies and involved 296 announcements of supply chain alliances. By using the propensity score matching method and difference-in-differences regressions, we find that supply chain alliances can alleviate friction between customers and suppliers and significantly improve the efficiency of working capital used by both customers and suppliers. Supply chain alliances increase suppliers’ inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover, and reduce cash holdings, while supply chain alliances improve customer raw material turnover, and reduce accounts payable turnover. Moreover, the economic impact of supply chain alliances on customers and suppliers is asymmetric. Suppliers benefit more from alliances relative to customers, as evidenced by significant improvements in their financial performance and significantly reduced performance volatility. The “inherent differences” in market power and market value between customers and suppliers can have considerable asymmetries on economic consequences. We divide firms in a pair of supply chain alliances by market power and market value. The magnitude of the financial performance accruing from an alliance is considerably higher for the lower-market-power firm than for the higher-market-power firm. The magnitude of the financial performance accruing from an alliance is considerably higher for the lower-market-value firm than for the higher-market-value firm. Additionally, vertical supply chain alliances can significantly improve firm performance and reduce performance volatility compared to horizontal supply chain alliances. This paper provides new empirical evidence for our insight into the economic consequences of supply chain alliances and their boundary conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Liquidity is a crucial word in the success of both large and small-scale businesses. Generally, MSMEs run their businesses with their capital, so they easily experience financial constraints in their operational cycles. Therefore, efforts to optimize liquidity are a major concern. Research in the field of supply chain focuses more on the physical flow of products/services and the flow of information. Meanwhile, the financial aspects and their sustainability in the supply chain have only received more attention after the financial crisis. Uncertainty in the economy increases business pressure on the supply chain of micro and medium enterprises (Supply Chain Finance). Given the role of the SCF concept and its potential, this study explores the understanding of SCF in MSMEs based in Pontianak and access to financial resources for sustainable business stability. This study is qualitative, using a questionnaire, and the results show that the relationship between buyers and suppliers still needs to be stronger because they do not invest much in infrastructure or production lines to create similarities with the business characteristics of the product. In addition, this paper suggests some implications for the development of local MSMEs in general and their supply chains in particular.</jats:p>"

Firstly, a prototype of a digital unloading valve under high-pressure and high water-based conditions was developed, and a digital control scheme was proposed to control the pilot valve by a servo motor to adjust the system pressure in real time. Then, an experimental platform for simulating the hydraulic bracket and a co-simulation model was constructed, and the validity of the co-simulation model was verified through experiments. Secondly, a collaborative multi-mode pressure stabilization control method for the pump valve based on a GRNN (General Regression Neural Network) was established to control the flow and pressure output of the emulsion pumping station according to the actual working conditions. Finally, numerical research and experimental verification were carried out for different working conditions to prove the effectiveness of this method. The results showed that the proposed pressure stabilization control method could adaptively adjust the working state of the digital unloading valve and the liquid supply flow of the emulsion pump station according to the working condition of the hydraulic support, effectively reducing the frequency and amplitude of the system pressure fluctuations and making the system pressure more stable.</jats:p>"

However, in imperfectly competitive markets such as the illegal drugs market, it is the seller who determines price. Moreover, even models that focus on supply‐side behavior often ignore key factors such as risk. This paper develops an expected utility model of a risk‐averse seller. We find that under risk aversion, increasing punishment costs (i.e., severity) is more effective than increased enforcement (i.e., certainty) and demand reduction is more effective than interdiction. If risk neutrality is assumed, increases in severity and certainty have the same deterrent effect. Under risk neutrality, the deterrent effect of demand reduction policies dominates all other interdiction policies. These results lend theoretical reinforcement to the growing policy bias in favor of demand‐side intervention.</jats:p>"

Medical organizations can boost the logistics of their tasks, reduce pharmaceutical trash, and strengthen revenue projections through the adoption of AI tools. This study aims to provide a structured evaluation of AI-driven solutions for enhancing healthcare supply chain robustness, especially under conditions of uncertainty and complex logistics demands. To determine the investment value of AI applications in HSC management, the current research adopted a revolutionary multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology tailored to the healthcare sector’s unique demands, including six critical factors. In light of these criteria, six highly technologically advanced AI-based solutions are examined. The implementation of a circular intuitionistic fuzzy set (CIFS) in the instance discussed provides a versatile and expressive way to describe vague and uncertain information. This study leverages the CIF topology to address data complexities and uncover the underlying structural features of a large dataset. At the outset, we adopted the LOPCOW approach, which includes logarithmic variation to assign weights to criteria, whereas the AROMAN method utilizes a powerful two-step normalization technique to rank alternatives, hence guaranteeing a trustworthy and accurate appraisal. A substantial degree of robustness was confirmed by the technique following a comparison of the operators as well as sensitivity testing.</jats:p>"

The main objective of this study was to analyze and evaluate the variability of drinking water quality in a selected water supply system located in the southern part of Poland. The results of the research and analysis presented in the study were prepared on the basis of test reports carried out by the water supply company during the operating years 2018–2022. A total of 28 indicators from the group of physicochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed: color, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrates, nitrites, chlorides, chromium, aluminum, cadmium, magnesium, manganese, copper, nickel, lead, mercury, sulfates, total iron, oxidizability, chloroform, total THM (Trihalomethanes), total organic carbon, chlorites and chlorates, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Coliform Bacteria, Clostridium perfringens (with spores), and total hardness. The results obtained were compared with national and European standards. The analyzed tap water was characterized by a stable physicochemical composition and did not exceed microbiological parameters. The only parameter that would not meet the acceptable value is chromium. Its value in each of the analyzed months was &lt;3.0 μg/L, while the new directive tightens the requirements to 0.25 μg/L. The water supply network operator should take action to reduce the amount of chromium in tap water so that it follows the introduction of new regulations on the quality of drinking water.</jats:p>"

Despite its significance, limited literature has researched the role of insurance companies in addressing automotive supply chain emissions. This research explores strategies developed by insurance companies for addressing carbon emissions in the automotive supply chain in the UK. It employs a qualitative multiple case study approach and conducts in-depth analysis of main drivers, barriers, and strategies in four insurance companies in addressing automotive supply chain emissions. It finds that cost savings and competitive advantage, changing mindset, impending regulation, market changes, and increased connectedness are the main drivers. But further progress is slowed down by five main barriers: ‘the complexity of tracking and quantifying emissions’, ‘conflicts of interest in the supply chain’, ‘skill shortage’, ‘lack of accountability’, and ‘profit prioritisation’. To overcome this, the study establishes five main strategies for insurance companies to follow: ‘circular business model with green parts and repair-over-replace methodologies’, ‘supply chain collaboration’, ‘quantifying emissions and setting key performance indicators’, ‘higher weighting for ESG in tenders and policies’, and ‘education and awareness’. If followed correctly, businesses will be able to achieve ‘emission reductions’, ‘gain competitive advantage’, and ‘reduce costs in the supply chain’. Taking into account these findings and the academic literature, this study develops a framework for insurance companies to mitigate automotive supply chain emissions. This is one of the first papers to study carbon emissions in automotive supply chains from the perspective of the insurance industry. It provides practical implications for the insurance industry in developing carbon emission strategies in automotive supply chains.</jats:p>"

Currently, supply chain design typically begins after the majority of product design decisions have already been made. While many firms recognize the importance of integrating product design decisions with supply chain design decisions, there is currently a lack of understanding of how to effectively do so for complex products. In order to address that research gap, this work compares the traditional sequential design strategy (in which supply chain decisions follow product design decisions) with an integrated strategy in which all design decisions are made together. We examine these strategies within the context of profit optimization of the product design and supply chain of a ground vehicle. Our results indicate that the integrated approach may yield substantially better solutions, albeit at the cost of a more complex optimization procedure.</jats:p>",

As the reliance on DC-powered electronic devices grows, optimizing AC-DC converters becomes increasingly important. Various converter topologies, including buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk, and SEPIC configurations, exhibit unique characteristics that affect their efficiency and impact on the power grid. This study examines the performance of Cuk and modified Cuk converters, utilizing PSIM software to simulate these converters for a 1.4 kW power supply. The simulations reveal that both the Cuk and modified Cuk converters achieve reduced ripple in voltage and current outputs, addressing a significant concern for DC power supplies. Additionally, the modified Cuk converter demonstrates a marked reduction in the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the source current. This study explored the interaction between converter topologies and varying load conditions, emphasizing their impact on power factor—a measure of electrical power consumption. A higher power factor indicates improved efficiency and reduced reactive power, benefiting both the electrical system and the grid. The research further investigates how load variations affect power factor and converter performance, providing insights into designing converters that enhance system reliability and efficiency. By validating the simulation results with experimental data, it has been established that the modified Cuk converter topology offers superior performance and stability. This advancement supports the development of converters that optimize power factor and energy consumption, which are crucial for advancing electrical infrastructure. By bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance, this work aims to provide valuable insights that can inform future enhancements in domestic EV charging infrastructure, ultimately contributing to the broader adoption of electric vehicles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, the supply chain is multi-layered and complicated, and its failure detection is based solely on the characteristic threshold, which does not lack the ability to describe the complex supply chain. An overload cascading failure detection algorithm for multi-layer supply chain network considering delay probability is proposed. Based on the multi-layer supply chain network including raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, the overload cascading failure model of the multi-layer supply chain network is constructed through networking, and the overload cascading failure process of the multi-layer supply chain network is described through three aspects: initial load, node capacity and overload node load distribution. By monitoring and analyzing the status update messages of each node in the supply chain network, and considering the delay probability factor, the node and path that may lead to cascading failure are identified by predicting the delay probability of the next message through the historical message delay probability, and the overload cascading failure detection of the multi-layer supply chain network is realized. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively detect the failure of each overloaded enterprise node in the multi-layer supply chain network, which is helpful to enhance the early warning and response ability of the cascade failure of the supply chain network. The algorithm can realize the failure detection of supply chain network under different attack conditions and initial failure ratio of nodes, and measure the anti-risk ability of supply chain network. Under deliberate attack and when the initial attack node is a supplier network layer node, it has a greater impact on the multi-layer supply chain network.</jats:p>",

However, these models are not suited to the majority of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs). This is compounded by a lack of technical knowledge of microentrepreneurs linked to the high costs and complexity of the CSMs. These issues are significant as 99% of Brazilian companies are MSEs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a CSM for an MSE that commercializes construction materials in São Paulo, Brazil. This research is quantitative and characterized as a case study whose CSM is based on the Naive Bayes algorithm implemented in Microsoft Office Excel 2016. This model calculates the probability of default and adherence by weighting the results based on the Modern Finance Theory with the Cost of Denying and the Cost of Granting. The application of the model demonstrates that the successes in approvals (70%) and disapprovals (66%) of Credit Sales were significant with a result of R$ 32.20 thousand and an increase in net profit by 124.2%. We have evidenced that the proposed CSM is able to weigh the risk in investment and financing decisions for the Credit Sales of an MSE. This paper provides a low-cost CSM, adapted to reality and easy to handle and implement in MSEs. This research is a reference to the development of CSMs focused on the credit concessions conducted by MSEs.</jats:p>"

Containment policies and stimulus packages resulted in unpredictable demand shifts, challenging urban supply chain planning and resource distribution. These disruptions underscored the need for robust risk management models, especially in cities where economic activity and population density exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities. This study develops a comprehensive risk model tailored for G-7 urban economies, analyzing the causal and cointegration relationships between key economic indicators. Using Granger causality tests and a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) approach, the study examines complex time series and high-dimensional variables, focusing on urban-specific indicators such as the composite leading indicator (CLI) and business confidence indicator (BCI). Our results indicate strong causal relationships among these indicators, validating CLI as a reliable early predictor of urban economic trends. The findings confirm the viability of this urban supply chain risk management model, offering potential pathways for strengthening urban resilience and economic sustainability in the face of future disruptions. This approach positions the study within the context of urban science, emphasizing the impacts on cities and how urban economies can benefit from the developed risk model.</jats:p>"

In supply chain cooperation, competing developers can cooperate with the platform either separately or collectively. In contrast to previous studies, this study not only examines online games, with their unique cost structures, but also innovatively uses product quality as a decision variable in the characterization of product demand. It begins by constructing decision‐making models that reflect three different coopetition situations among enterprises in the online game supply chain: a competition model, a separate bargaining model, and a collective bargaining model. Equilibrium analysis of the decision‐making models is then used to obtain the enterprises' optimal coopetition strategies, and to reveal how these strategies depend on product substitutability and bargaining power. Finally, a comparative analysis of the coopetition models is used to identify the optimal coopetition strategy in the online game supply chain and reveal this strategy's dependence on product substitutability, bargaining power, and internal operating capabilities. These findings provide strategic guidance for enterprises in the online game supply chain about how to pursue coopetition within various business environments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the importance of the means of ensuring water supply in the formation of the architectural profile and basic social organization of Pompeii. It sees the city’s domestic water supply, for over two centuries ensured through rainwater-harvesting areas, basins and cisterns situated mainly in and below the many atria, as a stabilizing factor of both cityscape and household. Through the introduction of the city aqueduct in the 1st century AD and the creation of a generous network of public fountains this situation changes and the need to maintain the traditional organization of the “houseful”, comprising enlarged family, slaves and dependents of various kind including shopkeepers, is lessened; the physical proximity between those of different status renegotiated. This development, witnessed in adaptations of the architecture, can be followed through close study of the standing structures in Insula V 1. The hallmarks are the creation of upperfloor living quarters seemingly independent from the life of the large households of the atrium houses, and in parallel the introduction of private water lines from the city aqueduct. The remodelling that resulted in the creation of the double-atrium house of Caecilius Iucundus is focal to the discussion since it offers a coeval chronological fix point in the AD 40s for both remodelling and obtention of piped water. Given that the change in the domestic architecture observed was merely in its embryonic state in AD 79, the tenability to attribute a lower dating than that traditionnaly attributed not just to the private lines, but to the city’s distribution system of public aqueduct water as well, is reasoned. The particularities of Pompeii’s geomorphological situation and political status and how they impacted the discussed change in social relationships are also raised.</jats:p>",

The research reveals that local coffee enterprises in Baoshan primarily focus on selling coffee raw materials, operating at the lower end of the value chain with relatively low added value. The main obstacles to their development are issues related to the organizational, technological, informational, and financial aspects of the supply chain, particularly concentrated in the critical upstream and midstream segmentsplanting and production. To address these challenges, the paper proposes an innovative development approach for the Baoshan coffee supply chain based on the integration of the \"Four Chains.\" This approach explores sustainable development strategies for the Baoshan coffee supply chain from the perspectives of organizational, technological, informational, and financial chains, incorporating modern technologies such as the Internet, IoT, and big data, as well as concepts of supply chain integration and supply chain finance. The goal is to establish a robust coffee supply chain environment and achieve sustainable development for Baoshan coffee. </jats:p>"

This study focused on the alga Chlorella variabilis RSM09, which was isolated from a brackish-water environment at Raksamae Bridge in Klaeng District, Rayong Province, Thailand. The effects of the carbon dioxide gas (CO2) concentration (0.03%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% v/v), light intensity (3000, 5000, and 7000 Lux), and photoperiod (12:12, 18:6, and 24:0 h L/D) on algal growth and lipid production were investigated. The results indicated that C. variabilis RSM09 achieved optimal growth under 20% v/v CO2 aeration, with an optical density of approximately 2.91 ± 0.27, a biomass concentration of 1.32 ± 0.14 g/L, and a lipid content of 21.96 ± 0.29% (wt.). Among the three different light intensities, higher optical density (4.20 ± 0.14), biomass (1.79 ± 0.25 g/L), and lipid content (20.75 ± 2.0% wt.) were at the 5000 Lux of light intensity. Additionally, the photoperiod of 24:0 h (L/D) produced the highest biomass at 1.86 ± 0.21 g/L, followed by the 18:6 h light/dark photoperiod with a biomass of 1.65 ± 0.17 g/L, and the 12:12 h light/dark photoperiod with 1.35 ± 0.43 g/L. In contrast, the 18:6 h L/D photoperiod yielded a higher lipid concentration of 25.22 ± 2.06% (wt.) compared to the others. All cultured microalgae showed significant effects on fatty acid composition. Palmitic (16:0), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) acids were predominant in C. variabilis RSM09 under all photoperiods. This study exhibited that the microalga C. variabilis RSM09 has great potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The analysis of groundwater use as a source of drinking water supply is an important task in the context of ensuring sustainable development and conservation of natural resources. Groundwater, a vital source of fresh water for the population, industry, and agriculture, can be subject to overuse, leading to a decrease in its level, pollution, and other negative consequences.\nThis article provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation with groundwater use in the Mykolaiv region, highlighting the main causes of this phenomenon, its consequences, and possible solutions.\nAnalyzing the reasons for the overuse of groundwater, it was found that the key factors are insufficient supervision by government agencies, underestimation of the role of groundwater in the water supply and sewerage system, and imperfect water management. These problems require immediate attention and resolution. Another important aspect is the lack of public awareness of the methods of rational water use, which also contributes to excessive groundwater consumption.\nThe second aspect of the analysis concerns the consequences of excessive groundwater use. These include lowering the groundwater table, depletion of water sources, contamination of groundwater with chemicals and microbiological pollutants, reduced quality of drinking water, and environmental damage. These effects can have long-term impacts on ecosystems and human health. In addition, a decline in groundwater levels can lead to degradation of natural landscapes, loss of biodiversity, and changes in the region's hydrological regime.\nPossible solutions to the problem may include improving legislation and regulatory mechanisms, implementing effective systems for monitoring and controlling groundwater use, and creating and applying innovative technologies for water treatment and conservation. It is also important to raise the level of environmental awareness among the population through educational programs and information campaigns aimed at promoting the rational use of water resources.\nThus, an integrated approach to groundwater management, including legal regulation, technological innovations, educational activities, and international cooperation, is a key to ensuring reliable water supply to the population of the Mykolaiv region and preserving natural resources for future generations.</jats:p>",

Taking an urban water supply pipe network in East China as an example, the model is solved by three kinds of population intelligent algorithms: Krill Harvesting Algorithm (KHA), Bat Algorithm (BA), and Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO). The optimization results of the three algorithms are compared in various aspects, and it is found that the KHA algorithm shows the most excellent search accuracy and efficiency in the problem of optimal arrangement of monitoring points, because of the strong global optimization ability and not easy to fall into local optimal solutions.</jats:p>"

Emphasizing the large-scale implementation of the mission, we utilized sample survey data and multiple linear regression models to investigate whether or not access to household water tap connections has succeeded in reducing the burden of drinking water collection on women and female children in rural regions. Overall, our findings suggest moderate attainment of JJM even at a very early stage, whereas the positive achievements are reflected in terms of reducing the burden of water collection on women. Further, a higher probability of wealth-related inequity favoring advantaged groups was found in the coverage of household water tap connections both in pre- and initial-JJM period.

As a crop that heavily relies on irrigation water, rice production has implications for the nation’s water security. Nevertheless, there is still hope for reducing the future food gap by implementing agricultural policies that encourage farmers to increase production. Therefore, it has become essential to understand the responsiveness of rice cultivation area supply to changes, as this is crucial for making decisions regarding agricultural policies related to production and farm prices during the period from 2010 to 2023. The aim is to estimate farmers’ responsiveness, and the time required to achieve this response, as well as the supply elasticity. To achieve the research objective, both descriptive and quantitative statistical analysis were used, applying the Stepwise method in its logarithmic form to estimate the Supply Response. The elasticity of supply response for the rice cultivation area was estimated to be approximately 1.86% in the short term and 2.09% in the long term. It was also found that the response time of the cultivated rice area supply in Egypt to changes is low, estimated at around 1.12. This may be due to the inability to expand the cultivated area of this crop in the following year, as rice cultivation requires large amounts of water, posing a challenge given the scarcity of water resources. Additionally, farmers aim to maximize profits from the crops they cultivate.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Businesses are undergoing an environmentally focused transformation in all their activities within the value chain. Therefore, the necessity of integrating and maintaining the concept of “green” in all processes such as production, technology development, marketing, and supply chains has emerged. Topics such as environmentally sensitive production systems, green supply, and green innovation (GI) are both accepted in practice in various sectors and are examined in the literature. When the impact of green practices on the performance items of businesses is taken into consideration, it is important to examine the issue from this perspective. In this context, the aim of this study is to examine the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on GI, environmental performance (EP), and competitive advantage (CA). Within the framework of this aim, a survey was conducted on 283 businesses producing plastic, packaging, and textile products in Gaziantep (169) and Konya (114) provinces in Türkiye. In this study, where the quantitative research method was adopted, the hypotheses established were tested by using structural equation modeling (SEM). SPSS 22.0 package program and AMOS 22.0 program were used in the analysis. Within the scope of the analysis, the measurement model (confirmatory factor analysis) was first tested. As a result of the analysis, GSCM practices have a positive impact on GI and CA; GSCM has a positive impact on EP; GI has a positive impact on CA; and EP has not a positive impact on CA. This study is significant as it examines the combined impact of GSCM, GI, EP, and CA. Also, this study is important as it is the first study to examine the impact of GSCM practices on GI, EP, and CA in Türkiye.</jats:p>"

In the first-stage system model, we employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm for day-ahead supply and demand forecasting to improve the forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we develop a hybrid convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), which effectively includes both spatial and temporal dimensions of time series data. In the second stage, a bidirectional real-time energy sharing strategy is designed based on forecasted data, facilitating the efficient distribution of surplus energy among communities. The two-stage system model integrates forecasting and energy sharing to accurately predict supply and demand, as well as effective energy sharing among GICN participants. The measurements including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and generation utilization rate are defined to evaluate prediction accuracy and energy sharing effectiveness thereby ensuring optimal grid operation and sustainability. Finally, the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM algorithm is compared with the single LSTM and CNN models to demonstrate the performance superiority of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Numerical simulation experiments indicate that the proposed model CNN-LSTM achieved high accuracy in predicting user PV, wind, and load demand. Additionally, the implemented real-time energy sharing strategy efficiently manages energy distribution within GICNs.</jats:p>"

Considering the lead wire and capacitor as a charged whole, we formulate the boundary value problems of the Helmholtz equation for the EMF in the lead wire space and capacitor space, respectively. First, we solve for the EMF generated by the total current in the lead wire space of an AC current. Following this, we solve for the EMF boundary value problem of a capacitor filled with linear, uniform, isotropic, and non-magnetic lossy dielectric under an AC current excitation, using the continuity of the total current as a basis. Second, the EMF distributions in the capacitor space and the lead wire space under an AC voltage excitation are provided, following the principles of the generalized Helmholtz theorem. Third, the EMF distribution is discussed when the electromagnetic ‘standing-wave phenomenon’ occurs in the ideal dielectric capacitor, and identify the ‘resonance phenomenon’ and the ‘current-stopping phenomenon’ of the capacitor's EMF when excited by an AC current and AC voltage, respectively. We also present the corresponding ‘resonance frequency’ and ‘current-stopping frequency’. Finally, we explore the quasi-stable solution of the capacitor's EMF under low-frequency condition and the static solutions of the electric and magnetic fields under DC excitation and static voltage excitation. Our findings suggest that the existing formula for the capacitor's EMF approximates our analytical solution under quasi-stable condition.</jats:p>",

Although scholars have proposed various methods and classification models to counter these cyber threats, a comprehensive cyber-attack taxonomy for maritime supply chain actors based on a systematic literature review is still lacking. This review aims to provide a clear picture of common cyber-attacks and develop a taxonomy for their categorization. In addition, it outlines best practices derived from academic research in maritime cybersecurity using PRISMA principles for a systematic literature review, which identified 110 relevant journal papers. This study highlights that distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and malware are top concerns for all maritime supply chain stakeholders. In particular, shipping companies are urged to prioritize defenses against hijacking, spoofing, and jamming. The report identifies 18 practices to combat cyber-attacks, categorized into information security management solutions, information security policies, and cybersecurity awareness and training. Finally, this paper explores how emerging technologies can address cyber-attacks in the maritime supply chain network (MSCN). While Industry 4.0 technologies are highlighted as significant trends in the literature, this study aims to equip MSCN stakeholders with the knowledge to effectively leverage a broader range of emerging technologies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The adoption of heat pumps in Ukraine is increasing, yet precise data on their economic viability is limited. This study compares the Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH) in implemented and calculated heat pump systems under Ukrainian conditions. By analyzing real installations and theoretical projects, we assess ground-source and air-source heat pumps, focusing on technical indicators like the Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) and economic factors such as investment costs and discount rates. Findings reveal that promotional materials often underestimate costs, leading to significant discrepancies in LCOH. Implemented ground-source heat pump projects have investment costs constituting 20–40% of LCOH, while for air-source heat pumps it&amp;#039;s 60–65%. The discount rate significantly impacts LCOH, more than electricity costs. Air-source heat pumps in large buildings offer the lowest LCOH, whereas ground-source heat pumps in small houses have higher LCOH due to substantial capital investments. The study concludes that while heat pump systems can enhance energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts in Ukraine, their economic competitiveness hinges on accurate cost assessments and favorable economic conditions.</jats:p>"

In light of current circumstances, the question of how the government can incentivize relevant stakeholders to actively engage in recycling and improve its efficiency has become increasingly pressing. In this context, this study analyses and develops four closed-loop supply chain recycling models to investigate how different government subsidy recipients under varying power structures influence recycling efficiency, profitability, and the overall supply chain structures. The following conclusions are derived from numerical simulations: (1) Government subsidies serve to elevate recycling prices, expand profit margins, and consequently boost the volume of recycled batteries, thus incentivizing corporate engagement in recycling initiatives. (2) When the processor assumes the role of the leader in the Stackelberg game framework, it can maximize the overall efficiency and profitability of the supply chain. (3) The sensitivity coefficient and the competition coefficient are closely interrelated, exerting opposing impacts on the recycling decision made by enterprises. (4) The supply chain leader plays a crucial role in ensuring orderly supply chain development, with government subsidies of the supply chain being transmitted to its members through the leader. Consequently, this study offers a theoretical foundation for the government to enhance policy-making and for enterprises to make informed decisions. It also holds significant practical relevance in addressing the challenges associated with power battery recycling.</jats:p>"

This situation compromised their ability to deliver essential health services. This study aims to portray the supply-side capacity of Puskesmas during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on health service delivery, pandemic response, and community engagement. It also identifies crucial components to enhance primary-level pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR). \n<bold>Methods: </bold>An explanatory sequential mixed-method design was employed, gathering quantitative data through phone interviews and qualitative data from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with Puskesmas’ staff and district health officials. A total of 385 Puskesmas across 34 provinces were selected using proportional multistage stratified random sampling. \n<bold>Results: </bold>Findings indicate that during the pandemic’s early and peak phases in 2020 and 2021, Puskesmas struggled to deliver their tasks. Due to social restrictions, over 80% of Puskesmas adjusted their operations, including reduced working hours (35.97%), limited service types (33.94%), and restricted patient visits (18.55%). These adjustments adversely affected essential health services, like tuberculosis detection and treatment and childhood immunisation programs, with COVID-19 budget reallocations affecting essential service funding. Around 40% of Puskesmas failed to meet the personal protective equipment (PPE) standard, and over 80% experienced PCR test delays for over 24 hours. Furthermore, half of the Puskesmas in Indonesia had inadequate capacity to conduct COVID-19 vaccination programs. Despite these challenges, community health workers (CHWs) played a crucial role in contact tracing, monitoring self-isolated COVID-19 patients, and improving vaccine coverage. \n<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The study highlights the importance for prioritising resource allocation and investment to strengthen primary healthcare in Indonesia for future pandemics, including enhancing the role of CHWs as critical partners of Puskesmas.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globalization has contributed to the increasing complexity of supply chain structures. In this regard, precise demand forecasting for the intricate supply chain holds paramount importance in effective supply chain management. Traditional statistical models and deep learning methods often face challenges in efficiently discerning correlations within a myriad of interconnected demands. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an intricate supply chain demand forecasting method based on graph convolution networks adept at handling non-Euclidean data. First, the companies within the supply chain are treated as nodes in the graph structure, and the relationships between them are treated as edges, with demand data serving as the features of these edges. Then, a graph convolutional network is constructed to aggregate node and edge information. Through a multi-layer network, the relationships among nodes, edges, and historical demand are established to facilitate the prediction of supply chain demands. In this process, the graph convolutional network incorporates supply chain connectivity information into demand time series analysis. This integration of surface-level topological features and deeper latent correlation attributes across the supply chain’s nodes refines the demand forecasting precision across the entire supply chain. The validation experiment in this paper is grounded in sales data of a singular product from multiple sales nodes of an electronics company. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses four other traditional demand forecasting algorithms significantly in terms of accuracy, providing substantial evidence for the superior performance of graph networks in the analysis of intricate supply chain relationships.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Last-mile delivery of health commodities is a critical component of efficient supply chains, and third-party logistics (3PL) providers are pivotal in ensuring cost-effective and reliable product distribution. This study explores the implementation of last-mile delivery outsourcing by government-operated warehouses and drug management agencies (DMAs). This research focuses on the relationship between 3PL utilization and key performance metrics, such as cost reduction, timely delivery, and end-user satisfaction. This study combines a literature review, surveys, and interviews conducted with employees of the DMAs in Minna, Niger State, to establish significant correlations. The findings show that using 3PLs significantly reduced operational costs, improved the frequency of timely deliveries, and enhanced end-user satisfaction. These findings underscore the need for continued engagement with 3PL providers to optimize supply chain performance and improve service delivery outcomes. Managers are recommended to maintain and expand such collaborations to sustain these benefits.</jats:p>"

The component was redesigned using topology\r\n                    optimization based on suitable replacement materials and design data from the\r\n                    representative part. In parallel, a brief review of AM standards identified a\r\n                    process to qualify the component through post-processing, non-destructive\r\n                    evaluation, and witness testing. Alongside this redesign analysis, a brief cost\r\n                    analysis was conducted to understand the cost associated with manufacturing and\r\n                    qualifying this part for multiple AM materials.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;The resulting analysis demonstrated that for this component, which was subject to\r\n                    high design loads, Scalmalloy, Ti-6Al-4V, and 17-4PH Stainless Steel could\r\n                    produce the most cost-effective parts. Scalmalloy was the lightest part, with a\r\n                    67% reduction in weight from the original bracket, while 17-4PH could produce\r\n                    the lowest-cost component. Ti-6Al-4V performed in the middle for both.

In this case, it is necessary to take into account the value of the natural gas compressibility factor under standard and operating conditions. Modern reference data and the recommended minimum value for the application of equations of state of real gases is limited to 250K, but in practice, actual values may be significantly lower. Errors in the use of substitute values of the compressibility factor affect the calculation of the final volumes of natural gas. The article presents the results of calculating the compressibility factor of natural gas of the estimated composition using two equations of state that take into account real properties in the temperature range of 223,15…303,15 K and pressures of 0,1…0,6 MPa used for gas supply to consumers of the housing and communal complex. We propose an equation that allows calculating the compressibility factor of natural gas of the estimated composition depending on the pressure and temperature in the considered range with high accuracy.</jats:p>",

В связи с этим представляется актуальной разработка подхода, направленного на анализ функционирования сети и на предложение адекватных решений при создании взаимосвязей участков сети для обеспечения большей надежности обслуживаемого сектора системы водоснабжения. Вопрос выбора рационального решения этой проблемы является весьма актуальным, поскольку многие городские кварталы имеют перерыв в подаче воды, причем количество подаваемой воды в отдельных коммунах не пропорционально количеству жителей, а некоторые потребители получают воду с интервалом в один или несколько дней. Процесс урбанизация и рост населения оказывают значительное влияние на водные ресурсы. Несмотря на инициативы, предпринятые компанией REGIDESO, отвечающей за подготовку и распределение питьевой воды, ситуация с водоснабжением до сих пор не решена. В статье предпринимается попытка анализа проблемы снабжения Бужумбуры питьевой водой, выявления причин нестабильности и недостаточности водоснабжения, предлагаются технические решения для устранения основных возникших проблем, и прогнозируется будущее состояние городской водопроводной сети Бужумбуры, не только путем реконструкции водораспределительной сети, но и путем внесения структурных изменений в топологию сети с целью повышения качества водоснабжения в будущем.

In this regard, it seems relevant to develop an approach aimed at analyzing the functioning of the network and to propose proper solutions in the creation of interconnections of network sections to ensure greater reliability of the served sector of the water supply system. The issue of choosing a rational solution to this problem is very relevant, since many urban neighborhoods have interruption in water supply, and the amount of water supplied in some communes is not proportional to the number of inhabitants, also, some consumers receive water with an interval of one or several days. The process of urbanization and population growth have a significant impact on water resources. Despite the initiatives taken by REGIDESO, the company which is responsible for the preparation and distribution of drinking water, the water supply issue is still up in the air. This article attempts to analyze the drinking water supply problem in Bujumbura. We tend to identify the causes of instability and insufficient water supply, propose technical solutions to eliminate the main problems encountered, and predict the future state of Bujumbura's urban water supply network. We try to do that not only by reconstructing the water distribution network, but also by making structural changes to the network topology in order to improve the quality of water supply in the future. It is planned to convert the existing dead-end network into a ring network and to install another water intake point at Lake Tanganyika to eliminate the existing water deficit for consumers.</jats:p>",

This study employs the dynamic panel analysis, Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PARDL) - Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach. The result shows that agriculture credit supply and its explanatory variables have a significant relationship in the long run. Unfortunately, only previous credit supply and agriculture risk contribute to the agriculture credit supply in the short run. The result varies across countries in the short run.  Banking in Indonesia considers agricultural risk by decreasing the agricultural credit supply while banking in Malaysia and Turkey maintains a positive agricultural credit supply despite the increase in agricultural risk.</jats:p>"

As the principal source of carbon emissions, companies can effectively enhance their emission reduction levels through the vertical spillover of emission reduction technologies to investigate the impact of vertical spillover rates, consumers’ low-carbon preference coefficients, emission reduction cost coefficients on optimal supply chain decisions, and profits in centralized and decentralized decision-making environments. Considering consumers’ preferences for low-carbon options, this paper constructs a Stackelberg game model under centralized and decentralized supply chain decision-making scenarios. It examines the effects of considering the vertical spillover effects of emission reduction versus not taking them into account. Using backward induction, this study optimizes the emission reduction levels of leading suppliers and manufacturers. The results indicate that an increase in consumers’ low-carbon preference levels and vertical spillover rate not only enhances the emission reduction levels of suppliers and manufacturers but also increases their profits. Conversely, an increase in emission reduction cost coefficients impedes emission reductions, with a more pronounced effect under vertical spillover conditions. In centralized decision-making, increases in vertical spillover rates, consumers’ low-carbon preferences, and decreases in emission reduction cost coefficients create a synergistic effect, resulting in greater increases in emission reduction levels and profits for suppliers and manufacturers compared to the sum of the effects of changes in individual coefficients. This finding provides new insights for governments in formulating relevant policies to promote corporate emission reductions.</jats:p>"

Implementing village merging and relocation and carrying out comprehensive land management are effective ways to promote rural management system reform and production intensification. However, during the implementation of the policy, the demolition and relocation inevitably involve the reorganization of production factors, leading to social contradictions. Therefore, the implementation of the village merging and relocation policy must not only focus on decision-making, but also address the problems encountered during policy implementation, take into account villagers' willingness, and enhance residents' sense of identity.</jats:p>"

Qualitative methodology was used to analyse the information gathered within this study, using in depth literature review and checking important releases on this subject in scientific papers available, focusing also on the Audi case study that shows real application of artificial intelligence technology into their manufacturing process and the opportunities to further apply this in Europe. Major changes in European automotive supply chains are underway as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence, not only solves existing problems but calls for advanced algorithms to be developed to meet new demands. The implementation of artificial intelligence needs to follow ethics, and in some cases needs human supervision. The use of artificial intelligence has both advantages and disadvantages.

Compounding this complexity is the presence of vague and imprecise data, complicating the evaluation and selection process. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces an extended fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making (FMCGDM) model, leveraging compromise solutions and relative preference relations, specifically tailored for EWS situations. The proposed model employs linguistic variables with multiple experts’ judgements to rate the alternatives versus conflicting criteria and assign weight to these criteria. By utilizing triangular fuzzy numbers, the model effectively handles information imprecision, enabling nuanced evaluations and distinguishing among potential alternatives. Employing a relative preference relation, the model computes distance values between alternatives and ideal or anti-ideal solutions, aiding in decision-making. Finally, the practical application and computational effectiveness of the model are demonstrated through a real-life case study on EWS in Iran. The results show that the mobile water treatment units and packaged water alternatives received the highest score, placing first and second in the order ranking, respectively, while the existing distribution systems were deemed most inappropriate for the EWS situation in the case study.</jats:p>",

The proposed system is integrated with machine learning, blockchain, and IoT technologies to solve the unique problems of rare diseases and drug distribution. A comprehensive program has been developed, including a multi-layered AI model for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and intelligent routing. The system uses different data and a pre-defined algorithm to improve the accuracy of the prediction. A new multi-agent support learning method is used for decision-making in networked devices. The framework's implementation strategy includes the deployment phase, starting with pilot research and progressing to full deployment. Collaboration with key stakeholders and compliance with regulatory requirements are clearly defined. Performance evaluation and methods are described, focusing on the quantitative and qualitative assessment of supply chain performance and patient outcomes. Preliminary tests show that product costs are reduced by 20-30%, product processing time is reduced by 15-25%, and 40-60% reduction in drug shortages. The proposed system promises significant improvements in access to rare drugs, supply chain optimization, and efficiency, which will lead to potential increased R&amp;D investment in orphan drugs and inform healthcare policy decisions.</jats:p>"

Using the U.S. Time Use Survey and exploiting a series of recent reforms in several U.S. states that reduced the rights of eligible spouses, we find that wives surprised by the reforms reacted by increasing their labor supply, but the adjustment mechanism varied by educational group. While college educated wives' labor supply increased at the expense of time spent on housework and childcare, wives with less than a college degree sacrificed personal care and leisure time. Effects for men are generally smaller and not statistically significant. We also find a reduction in the rate of new births following the reforms, with the effect being much more pronounced in the case of women with a university education, suggesting that part of the difference in time use may be attributable to differences in preferences and the cost of children by educational levels. Since children are a marital public good, our results imply a decrease in marriage‐specific investment. The estimated effects are robust to various sensitivity tests and are greater in couples with a high‐income differential and therefore more exposed to changes in alimony laws.</jats:p>"

The study identifies and analyzes eight key strategies: supplier diversification, increased inventory and safety stock, adoption of advanced technologies, improved forecasting and demand planning, vertical integration, reshoring and nearshoring, contingency planning and risk management, and collaboration and information sharing. Drawing on these strategies in the context of the United States, the review examines the advantages and potential challenges associated with them. The implementation of strategies such as supplier diversification and the adoption of advanced technologies shows positive effects, but these approaches require significant resources and face policy restrictions. This paper also analyzes the policy and industry implications of these strategies, emphasizing the need for collaboration between the government and industry. Various policy implications include the need to encourage supplier diversification, support for strategic stocking, and funding for technology implementation. For the industry, there is a need for operational adjustments such as redesigning supply chain networks with emphasis on enhancing risk management practices. Although implementing these strategies presents certain complexities, they hold great promise for improving the overall resilience of the US pharmaceutical supply systems and should be further explored in the future.\r\nKeywords: Supply Chain, Risk Management, Industry Disruption, Inventory Management, Blockchain Technology</jats:p>"

However, the risk of unauthorized leakage of sensitive information poses a significant challenge. We aim to propose a Privacy-preserving Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (PMaRL) method to enhance SC visibility, coordination, and performance during inventory management while effectively mitigating the risk of information leakage by leveraging machine learning techniques. The SC inventory policies are optimized using multi-agent reinforcement learning with additional SC connectivity information to improve training performance. The simulation-based evaluation results illustrate that the PMaRL method surpasses traditional optimization methods in achieving cost performance comparable to full visibility methods, all while preserving privacy.

Sidoarjo Regency has the potential to produce watermelons independently; this is supported because Sidoarjo Regency is included in the Gerbangkartasusila region, with Surabaya City as one of the main supporting districts. Watermelon fruit has a very abundant amount of production in Sidoarjo Regency, but watermelon fruit is a seasonal fruit with erratic public consumption and tends to decrease, causing an excess supply of watermelon. Therefore, this research was conducted to determine supply chain behavior, then model and simulate it, as well as design a model for improving the watermelon supply chain in Sidoarjo Regency. Through a system dynamics simulation approach using Vensim software, the results show that the amount of watermelon stock in Sidoarjo is affected by production, consumption, and depreciation values. Then, the current total production of watermelons will be 1110 quintals in 2021. Through a simulation of the improvement model design with the addition of other regional distributions and the assumption of a distribution of 350 tons/year for the next 5 years, the supply of watermelons is still able to meet the needs of the people of Sidoarjo Regency.

Renewable energy resources can be regenerated through the natural method within a reasonably short time and can be used to bridge the gap in extended power outages. Achieving more renewable energy (RE) than the low levels typically found in today’s energy supply network will entail continuous additional integration efforts into the future. This study examined the impacts of integrating renewable energy on the power quality of transmission networks. This work considered majorly two prominent renewable technologies (solar photovoltaic and wind energy). To examine the effects, IEEE 9-bus (a transmission network) was used. The transmission network and renewable sources (solar photovoltaic and wind energy technologies) were modelled with MATLAB/SIMULINK®. The Newton-Raphson iteration method of solution was employed for the solution of the load flow owing to its fast convergence and simplicity. The effects of its integration on the quality of the power supply, especially the voltage profile and harmonic content, were determined. It was discovered that the optimal location, where the voltage profile is improved and harmonic distortion is minimal, was at Bus 8 for the wind energy and then Bus 5 for the solar photovoltaic source.</jats:p>"

Through checking the properties of the model of external factors that affect the amount of money supply (M2), it was found that the coefficient of decision Adjusted R Square = 0.9931, which means that the independent variables Gross National Income (GNI), Exchange Rate (Exr), and Consumer Price Index (CPI) can explain the variable according to the amount of money (M2) determined up to 99.31%; the rest depends on other factors that are not included in the study. Therefore, the model of external factors that affect the amount of money M2 can be used and depends on at least one factor identified. Also, by bringing the data to test the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable in the long term and in the short term, ECM(-1) found that the model that simulates the effect of the amount of money M2 on the economic growth of the Lao PDR in the long-term equilibrium state (co-integration) and in the short-term equilibrium state (Error Correction Model: ECM) is not applicable and does not depend on the identified factors. But it will have a long-term effect, which, through checking the properties of the model from a long-term perspective, found that the coefficient of decision Adjusted R Square = 0.6877, which means that the independent variable M2 money can explain the variable according to the economic growth rate determined in the long term up to 68.77%. The change in the money M2 in the short term does not affect the economic growth rate of the Lao PDR, but the change in the money M2 in the long term will definitely affect the economic growth rate.</jats:p>"

In addition, COVID 19 disturbed the balance of the labor market; many workers retired, changed professions, moved, etc. creating a shortage of workforce. The supply chain disturbance and labor shortage lead to inflation rates that have not been seen for 40 years. The construction industry is a significant part of the any country’s economy including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries which is composed of: United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. It is hypothesized that the GCC States are immune to such supply chain and inflation drivers due to the oversupply of imported work force and the economic prosperity that these countries enjoy. Is the construction sector, which is one of the leading economic sectors in the GCC region also immune as well? This paper attempts to examine this hypothesis through a survey designed to capture the opinions of construction professional operating in these states. This survey attempts to \n\n•\tExamine the impact of supply chain disturbance, labor shortage, and inflation on the construction industry in the GCC countries.\n•\tFigure out how the construction industry reacted to and dealt with these challenges.\n\nThe findings of this research would give us a snapshot of the state of the construction industry and help the industry deal with the above-cited challenges.\nKeywords: Inflation, supply chain, construction industry, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)</jats:p>"

It addresses the potential for\r\n                    improved integrated system efficiency over traditional alternator-based system\r\n                    solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;Robustness of ISG-based systems is evaluated in the paper, particularly when\r\n                    integrated into military vehicles and placed in demanding environments. A range\r\n                    of product realizations is presented, from low-cost solutions intended for\r\n                    higher volume production, to high performance solutions employing state of the\r\n                    art technology. Experience in transitioning from high performance to\r\n                    production-ready realizations is included in support of this evaluation. ISG\r\n                    generators range up to 160 kW also providing considerable power at idling speed,\r\n                    and crank start capability at low voltage and low temperatures. Their slim\r\n                    design allows for flexible mounting conditions. A family of electronic inverters\r\n                    and converters supplies various output voltage levels at DC and AC phase\r\n                    conditions. The modular approach offers the combination to systems according to\r\n                    various customers’ requirements. An integrated device incorporating the\r\n                    low and high voltage DC and AC output in a common box is also available.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;The components were developed to meet harsh military requirements. More than 50\r\n                    systems have successfully completed customer evaluation procedures representing\r\n                    over 350,000 miles of satisfactory operation in TD and EMD phases.

Methods: A descriptive qualitative approach was employed, involving systematic observations, documentation, and interviews with key informants from the production and marketing divisions. This approach enabled a detailed analysis of phenomena affecting supply chain activities and production processes. Results: The findings indicate that the implementation of SCM at PT Perkebunan Tambi is suboptimal due to recurring constraints in key areas, including machinery reliability, transportation of tea shoots, workforce readiness, and inventory management. The primary bottleneck lies in the aging machinery, which, despite regular maintenance, fails to perform effectively, leading to production delays and reduced output. These challenges hinder the alignment of production capacity with market demand, creating a supply-demand gap. Novelty: This study highlights the critical link between aging infrastructure and supply chain inefficiencies, emphasizing the need for strategic machine renewal and improved inventory management to sustain continuous operations and meet growing market demands. The research provides actionable insights into overcoming production challenges through enhanced SCM practices, contributing to the literature on supply chain optimization in tea production industries.</jats:p>"

Numerous temperature data loggers (TDLs) are available to reduce the significant amount of food loss and waste (FLW) (equivalent to around 50%) in vegetable supply chains; however, its widespread adoption remains a challenge for the actors along the chain. This study seeks to understand the adoption of TDLs within selected Australian vegetable supply chains to address the challenge of FLW. Three representative cases of vegetable supply chains were purposively selected, including growers, packers, transporters, distribution centres along with technology providers, and industry experts. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed utilising thematic analysis. The findings indicate that members of vegetable supply chains recognise temperature management as one of the key factors for preserving quality and extending shelf life of their produce; however, they are not proactively seeking to utilise TDLs in their supply chain operations. Resistance to adoption of TDLs is deeply rooted in product-based challenges such as cost and compatibility, and process-based challenges including information sharing and product mixing. Additionally, presence of an individual’s undesirable behavioural aspects such as status-quo bias and responsibility shirking as well as prevailing social norms within the industry influence the adoption of TDLs.</jats:p>",

As opposed to numerous other techniques, such as modeling and forecasting and applying them over a certain period, RL allows for the making and adapting these decisions in real-time, depending on the current demand and other conditions in the market. Supplementary to this, RL-based models enable supply chains to constantly adapt to shifts since they directly update knowledge from incoming data, making them less susceptible to economic shocks or other supply uncertainties. This flexibility is particularly important for contemporary supply chains in uncertain global environments where conventional, deterministic demand planning techniques cannot address changing needs. In this research, we discover how RL-based models could reduce demand volatility and react to contingencies. As such, it is best suited for industries that are required to respond flexibly and faster. This paper enlightens RL on the benefits of demand planning. It provides live examples that give insight into how it may be used to improve inventory, reduce cost, and improve decision-making. Regarding the specific research questions, this study helps investigate the methodologies, evaluation metrics, and case outcomes that shape RL's potential for changing demand planning and improving supply chain adaptability for future research on adaptive supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Such reliance has encouraged attackers to shift their focus on conducting supply chain attacks, which is expected to become the most common type of cyberattack by 2030. Thus, it is crucial for Information Systems practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of supply chain cybersecurity. To that end, this teaching case demonstrates the importance of supply chain cybersecurity in the digital era drawing on two recent attacks with significant impact on supply chains: SolarWinds and Kaseya. We first discuss different dimension of cyberattacks, followed by an introduction of supply chain attacks. We then introduce an analytical tool called cyber kill chain that is widely used for analysing different stages of a cyberattack. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of cyberattacks that can be used as a tool, alongside other tools, to analyse cyberattacks. The taxonomy is especially useful for conducting a lightweight analysis and presenting an overview of cyberattacks to non-technical stakeholders, especially executives and directors. </jats:p>"

However, the distribution process of snake fruit exports to foreign countries faces several risks, such as perishability, bulky, diverse quality, and seasonality. Therefore, qualified management of risk barriers in the snake fruit supply chain system is needed, which is not only found in the distribution process but also in the production process and financial risks to maintain the quality of snake fruit. This study aims to identify potential risks, analyze the level of risk, and formulate risk mitigation measures in the snake fruit supply chain. The research method uses the intrinsic case study method and is analyzed using the House of Risk approach. The results showed that there were 32 risk events and 33 risk agents. Two of them are priority risks for mitigation, namely the risk of natural factors and demand fluctuations, which have led to 3 recommendations for mitigation actions, consisting of collaborating with related agencies and institutions, conducting intense communication among supply chain actors, and providing counselling and supervision of farmer-level snake fruit cultivation activities.</jats:p>"

As humanity encounters the finite constraints of Earth's ecosystems, it becomes imperative for strategic management to transcend mere economic metrics and incorporate environmental and social dimensions. This paper explores the critical role of Wholeness Systems Thinking (WST) in transitioning from traditional Knowledge-based educational frameworks that emphasize a Maximization Mindset to those fostering an Understanding-based, Purposeful mindset in lifelong learning. Employing the sustainable educational model, 21st EWA Edu, this approach cultivates a human capital intellectual capability. Furthermore, the study investigates how this paradigm aids in harmonizing the concepts of effectiveness and efficiency within Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). The findings indicate that when applied to lifelong learning, this novel intellectual capacity not only refines decision-making processes but also ensures alignment between long-term sustainability objectives and short-term operational strategies in the automotive sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article explores how Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) can revolutionise Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) models. VMI is a supply chain approach where vendors manage customer inventory levels. However, traditional VMI models face challenges in data sharing, integration, real-time access, security, and enforcing service agreements. To overcome these limitations, this paper suggests using BaaS to implement VMI with blockchain technology.  The utilisation of BaaS in VMI processes allows organisations to utilise blockchain’s attributes, including trustless collaboration, real-time data access, heightened security, data integrity, immutability, and automation through smart contracts. The article explains how BaaS platforms offer streamlined provisioning, easy configuration, rapid member onboarding, and seamless integration with existing systems. Furthermore, it highlights the benefits of using BaaS to enhance supply chain efficiency by facilitating smooth collaboration among VMI stakeholders. In addition to these benefits, the proposed solution emphasises the use of built-in functions within each partner’s ERP/supply chain/enterprise applications, combined with blockchain integration capability, to establish a comprehensive end-to-end VMI solution. Moreover, the article provides a conceptual model of the solution that covers an end-to-end VMI process. It also provides guidelines for selecting a suitable BaaS provider tailored to VMI implementation.  Through these contributions, the article proposes an innovative VMI model built upon BaaS foundations, effectively addressing the inefficiencies of traditional VMI, and ushering in a new era of optimised supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The main problem in the development of chili\nagribusiness is the lack of variety, quality,\ncontinuity of supply, and quantity that are in\naccordance with market demand, especially for\nmodern market purposes\n(supermarkets/hypermarkets), and processing\nindustries, institutional consumers (hotels,\nrestaurants, hospitals. One of the problems is\ncaused by the lack of coordination between\nagribusiness actors. This causes the institutional\nstructure of chili commodity agribusiness to\nbecome fragile and the linkage of supply chain\nmanagement to become weak. Only certain groups\nare able to control the stock of chili in the Bungo\nRegency market. The objectives of this study are 1)\nto identify the structure of the chili commodity\nsupply chain in Bungo Regency; 2) analyzing the\ninstitutional structure of chili farmers in Bungo\nRegency; 3) formulating strategies to increase the\ncompetitiveness of chili commodities in Bungo\nRegency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tThe cost-effective and sustainable deployment of hydrogen supply and demand networks, especially in large economic regions like California, can be challenging considering the spatial-temporal availability and variability of the different actors across the network such as production processes, distribution modes, and end-users. In this presentation, we will provide an overview and demonstration of a modeling framework used to assess the environmental, economic, and human health impacts of plausible hydrogen production and supply chain networks in California. Scenarios focus on green hydrogen production pathways using water electrolysis and biomass gasification. End-use applications included in the model are transit, medium and heavy-duty trucking, port authorities, and power and aviation companies that currently consume natural gas, diesel, and aviation fuel for their day-to-day operation. Representative locations for hydrogen production and end-use are based on recent projections of the hydrogen economy in California.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>All mass and energy flows, as well as estimated emissions, are based on H2A process model designs and projections of technology performance, literature review, and LBNL process, economic and life cycle modeling, and not on company data for the sake of this presentation. Human health impacts are included following methodologies developed for the University of California Irvine HyDeal project. Life cycle phases associated with hydrogen production include feedstock preparation (water and biomass), energy production and consumption (renewable, grid, and combination of renewable and grid electricity), maintenance (chemical utilization in electrolysis and natural gas combustion in gasification), carbon sequestration, hydrogen storage (compression and liquefaction), and distribution (truck and pipeline). We apply the framework utilizing California specific emission factors, financial data, and human health damages and explore the impact of network characteristics on results. Example variations include: the inclusion of policy incentives or not, different representations of the electricity grid and source, electrolysis versus gasification versus combinations of both for production, liquefaction versus compression based on producer capacity cutoffs, transportation truck versus pipeline based on existing infrastructure, and ultimate end use. Comparison of these different scenarios can help inform future projects by demonstrating the trade-offs among environmental, economic, and human health impacts. This model, automated in R, is a starting platform upon which new analysis, modeling capabilities, locations, and emission factors can be rapidly tested and integrated.    </jats:p>",

The system generates micrometric vibrations in the structure to delaminate and break the ice with a low power requirement. However, designing the power supply and its control for driving piezoelectric actuators is challenging due to their distinctive capacitive behavior at most frequencies, especially in deicing applications requiring high operational frequency. This contribution addresses the two cross‐dependent parts of the deicing system, that is the piezoelectric actuator designed for breaking any kind of ice on a large area and its power supply made of a 1 kW/200 V/2 MHz auxiliary resonant commutated pole inverter (ARCPI). The choice of this converter is based on the specific constraints of the application, such as varying the operating frequency with the actuator working conditions, the long cables and necessary insulation between the actuator and its supply, the soft‐switching operation and reactive energy balancing for a good efficiency. Based on these criteria, the converter was developed and realized in the laboratory. Deicing tests confirmed effective operation with a power input density of 122 mW/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, using nine piezoelectric patches per dm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.</jats:p>",

Distribution network operators must meet consumers’ qualitative and statistical power demands and ensure their satisfaction. The distribution network function aims to minimize power loss by determining the network’s maximum power supply capacity while considering parameters like power flow dispersion, node voltage, line capability, and other limitations. The emergence of new flexible loads presents opportunities and challenges. The study suggested Open Capacity Distribution Network solutions incorporating Distributed Power Supply and Network Reconfiguration (OCDN-DPS and NR). The paper proposes a novel technique to optimize distribution networks’ open capacity, addressing the issues faced by the expanding use of distributed energy sources. The proposed study produces a rise of 18% in inaccessible capacity and a decrease in power losses by combining distributed electrical power and reconfiguration of network approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of the presented methodologies. The study uses second-order cone relaxing theory to estimate the distribution of the system’s power supply capability on typical days, taking uncertainty into account to satisfy optimization goals. Comparative analysis indicates the unique approach’s superiority, stressing its significance in promoting sustainable energy options in distribution system optimization while maintaining consumer happiness and network security. </jats:p>",

Appropriate regulation of supply voltage magnitude is essential to ensure efficacy and efficiency in the operation of electricity supply networks and consumer equipment. While the theoretical impacts of supply voltage magnitude on the performance of consumer equipment, which include additional energy consumption and decreased equipment lifespan as voltage magnitude increases, are relatively well known, this has not been translated into quantitative impacts. This paper applies the outcomes of previous impact of supply voltage magnitude studies by the authors, in conjunction with domestic load models, to develop algorithms to estimate the quantitative impacts of supply voltage magnitude on consumers. The paper then applies these algorithms to calculate quantitative economic impacts that can be associated with the magnitude of the supply voltage. The outcomes of this research suggest that the per-annum impact of supply voltage magnitude on consumer equipment loss of life is potentially an order of magnitude greater than the resultant increased energy consumption based on case studies using Australian data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product distribution in supply chain management has been hotly debated during the last decade. However, during COVID-19, many supply chains suffered from sudden changes in local market demands. Such changes cause a bullwhip effect throughout a supply chain, making it unable to respond rapidly. This research develops a new model for distributing products in the food chain using real urban and geographical data of blockchain technology. The aim is to re-adjust the product distribution plans by using a horizontal layer product distribution readjustment strategy while local markets confront sudden market changes. To address the problem, a heuristic was proposed and coded by Python based on the <jats:italic>largest density-distance</jats:italic> rule. Then, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the schedules are assessed with some metrics gathered in the literature. For this purpose, a Full Factorial design of experiments is generated by Python. Moreover, the outcomes are compared with those gained from short-traveling time and greedy loading-based heuristics. The results showed that using the horizontal layer product distribution readjustment strategy for modifying the initial schedules could prevent lost sales in all studied cases. Besides, by responding to sudden market demand changes rapidly, which subsequently prevents lost sales, more profits were gained in 58.3% of the studied cases. In addition, in 61.11% of studied cases, the proposed method was faster than other studied heuristics in terms of computational time.</jats:p>",

However, the primary concern for banks is the financial pressure to implement sustainable environmental practices. In addition, banks are obliged by different regulators to maintain standards in conducting their business and allocating funds. Previous studies examined the relationship between sustainability reporting, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and firms’ financial performance. Few empirical studies examined the impact of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) operations on firm financial outcomes, yet the banking sector has been ignored in the analyses. To bridge this gap, we examine the dynamic effect of SSCM operations on deposit money banks’ (DMBs) financial performance. We selected seven banks in Nigeria with national, regional and international authorization and data spanning from 2005 to 2023. Based on the panel co-integration test and the Cross-sectional Dependence Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (CS-ARDL) model, we found that SSCM operations have a significant influence on the financial performance (market value and profitability) of the banks. Impliedly, banks’ SSCM operations and environmental consideration in the allocation of funds drive their corporate image and value. Integration of SSCM strategies for a sustainable environment can help enterprises/companies bridge information asymmetry among diverse stakeholders.

The biblio-metric analysis of this paper reveals the research trend of EPC projects in the past decade, especially in supply chain integration, procurement management, and stakeholder management. This indicates an increasing interest in efficient project management and supply chain optimization in international engineering EPC projects. Although the application of supply chain integration in the manufacturing industry has been a successful experience, its practical application in construction and EPC projects is still insufficient. Integration strategies mentioned in the literature, such as achieving supply chain transparency through digital platforms, reducing operating costs, and optimizing delivery time, are directions that need to be further explored in this field. Effective supply chain integration and increased maturity of procurement management in EPC projects are still less involved areas. In addition, there is also a lack of research on how to manage high-risk and unpredictable risks in large international engineering projects.

The purpose of the work is to perform a hydraulic calculation of the water supply network, to determine the possibility of failures in the network. The main method is to simulate the mode of operation of the water supply network under different modes of operation, modeling hydraulic shock in the main network. The object of the study is a ring water supply network with a length of 4.7km. Using the example of a water supply network for a village with a population of 4 thousand people, we considered operating modes and identified problem zones. We propose to increase the diameters of the ring water supply network. We as well give the main parameters for the hydraulic calculation of the water supply network and determine the main parameters for the joint operation of pumps and pipelines. Also, we determined the main parameters for the joint operation of pumps and pipelines. Besides, we justified the increase in the diameters of the water supply network, which is necessary to comply with the operating mode in the event of a fire in different calculation units.</jats:p>",

To achieve this purpose, operation of the PSS during the last 5 years was studied. The PSS was considered as a restored system which has spinning reserve. The process of the PSS functioning was represented by a simple non-branching graph with one repair team and described by systems of differential and algebraic equations. The solution of the latter allowed calculating the probability components of the PSS availability factor. The operating time of the PSS in a calendar year was calculated with a different number of serviceable generators. The method for calculating overpayment for electricity was proposed. The most significant result is the justification of the use of probability components of the PSS availability factor for assessing overpayment for electricity. The significance of the obtained results lies in the fact that the proposed formula for overpayment for electricity allows to estimate overpayment, identify main causes and recommend measures to reduce it. The reliability of the results is confirmed by the example of calculating overpayment for electricity for a real enterprise. The newly obtained indicators of generator reliability can be used in the analysis of overpayment by other enterprises, which have similar generators.</jats:p>"

Digital capability, which is the organization's ability to utilize digital technology in all aspects of its operations, is the main key in achieving competitive advantage. This study aims to analyze the effect of digital capability on supply chain innovation performance through digital innovation in manufacturing companies in Bogor. The method used is a quantitative approach with a survey using a questionnaire evaluated by a panel of experts. Data were collected from 140 respondents of manufacturing companies in Bogor and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software. The results showed that digital capability has no significant influence on supply chain innovation performance (p-value 0.380 &gt; 0.05). Meanwhile, digital capability has a significant positive influence on digital innovation (p-value 0.033 &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, digital innovation has no significant impact on supply chain innovation performance (p-value 0.484 &gt; 0.05), and digital capability also has no significant effect on supply chain innovation performance through digital innovation based on the mediation flow of direct and indirect (p-value 0.421 &gt; 0.05). The conclusion of this study is that although digital capability can drive digital innovation, it does not necessarily improve supply chain innovation performance directly. Suggestions for future research are to involve more companies from various locations and use mixed quantitative-qualitative research methods to increase validity and in-depth understanding. In addition, there is a need to explore other factors that may affect supply chain innovation performance to strengthen digital capability and digital innovation strategies in manufacturing companies.</jats:p>"

However, recent regulatory changes in various countries addressing the “one out of two” practices of these platforms have facilitated the ability of catering businesses to engage with multiple platforms simultaneously. The existing body of literature primarily focuses on the competitive interactions between bilateral platforms or the optimal strategies for exclusive trading platform supply chains, yet it does not adequately investigate the differentiated impacts of merchant marketing strategies within this competitive framework. This study seeks to evaluate the effects of diverse strategies on the performance of supply chain participants, concentrating on four distinct strategies employed by catering businesses in their selection of service platforms and the execution of marketing initiatives. By employing game theory and inverse solving methodologies, the research determines the optimal profits for each member of the supply chain under various strategies, as well as the influence of valuation discount factors on member profits. The results reveal that the marketing efforts of service providers across different platforms significantly affect the performance of supply chain participants. Additionally, the profits of both service providers and platforms are correlated with the cost coefficient related to the marketing efforts of service providers, and these marketing initiatives also impact the perceived value of platform coupons. This research provides evidence for the positive influence of marketing decisions made by service providers.</jats:p>"

The institutional model ensures the smooth operation of supply chain activities due to the interactions between the actors, facilitating coordination, information sharing, and integration from upstream to downstream. This model can be used to improve the performance. To improve the performance, supply chain of potato chip MSMEs cluster faces several challenges including a limited supply of raw materials and finished products, price fluctuations, non-optimal drying processes, and inconsistent quality. Therefore, the study aimed to conduct a holistic evaluation and improvement method on the interconnected constraints to enhance supply chain’s performance. The integration of Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods was applied to observe interactions between key elements in development of supply chain institutional potentials and to prioritize development strategies. The results showed that the key elements that influenced development of the organizations related to labor capability, diversity of raw material quality, the potential for collaboration relationships, minimizing the risk of drying during the rainy season, and participation of various actors. Based on the largest WANP weight value (0.230), the primary strategy for supply chain development in the SME cluster was the implementation of digital-based marketing. Furthermore, improving the institutional performance model of potato chip MSMEs cluster supply chain included the participation of internal and external quality assurance organizations in the product quality audit process. Ensuring product quality consistency through these audits would support digital-based marketing and help mitigate issues related to product quality and supply consistency.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a comprehensive multiple criteria decision-making method called the SMAA-ORESTE method for SFSC selection. To reduce experts’ efforts, the holistic acceptability index in the SMAA-2 method is used to screen inferior SFSCs from a large number of alternatives. Then, the ORESTE method is combined with the SMAA method to evaluate SFSCs under uncertain information. The ORESTE method can specifically analyze the relationship between alternatives, and the SMAA method can analyze alternatives with unknown criteria weights by Monte Carlo simulation.

A shortage of specialists in rural regions worsens these issues, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Objective: Our research aimed to address a knowledge gap by investigating the availability of three medical specialists—cardiologists, pulmonologists, and endocrinologists—in rural counties of Texas and identifying areas where access to healthcare is limited. Methods: Utilizing data from regional, state, and federal sources, the analysis geocoded specialist locations and created GIS maps to visualize the distribution of specialists across Texas’s 254 counties. Physician demand was calculated by considering disease incidence and population size, resulting in a county-level physician availability index to highlight areas with shortages. Results: Our findings demonstrate a significant deficiency of cardiologists in 196 counties when considering a maximum reasonable travel distance of 50 miles. Comparable deficiencies were observed for pulmonologists and endocrinologists, with western rural counties predominantly comprising the deficiency areas for each specialty. These results emphasize a significant rural–urban disparity concerning access to the three investigated health specialists. Conclusions: Addressing geographic disparities can reduce health inequities, improve rural healthcare access, and promote a more equitable healthcare system across Texas. Solutions may include incentives for specialists to work in underserved areas, expanded telemedicine services, and transportation assistance.</jats:p>"

This model utilizes the fault characteristics post wavelet packet transformation as input and predicts the corresponding fault type as output. We establish an experimental platform for forward switching power supply, construct 10 typical fault modes, collect 30 groups of output voltage signals under each fault mode, and extract the fault characteristics after wavelet packet transform as data samples. Simultaneously utilizing the PSO-BP neural network and CNN neural network enables the realization of fault diagnosis and analysis for the switching power supply. Various test outcomes have demonstrated that the fault detection ratio of the PSO-BP neural network structure exceeds 95%, with a speed of convergence achieving 60 seconds. Meanwhile, the fault detection ratio of the CNN neural network structure exceeds 90%, with a convergence speed of 31 seconds.

It was applied to the swine supply chain using Saaty’s scale and information obtained from managers of two agribusiness companies, adjusted by the AHP method.\nResults: The results showed the relevance of an appropriate definition of the preferences of decision-makers to decide on the best actions towards environmental, economic, and social sustainability.\nLimitations: The limitations of the proposed model are mainly its subjective nature. Despite being necessary in multi-criteria methods, it could be a limitation if more quantitative indicators are relevant or demanded. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology also provides a quantitative perspective, as a result of using the Saaty scale.\nPractical implications: The definition and application of importance levels within a TBL-based model can help managers to prioritize environmental, social, and/or economic dimensions under a large diversity of alternatives toward more sustainable scenarios. The AHP method used in this work is a hierarchy method, particularly appropriate for defining weights that are essentially compensatory by nature.\nOriginality/value: The correct definition and weight of the different dimensions, sub-dimensions, and respective indicators is currently one relevant gap in the literature, limiting the design and prioritization of corrective actions in each stage of the SSC and in the different dimensions of the TBL.</jats:p>"

Основными причинами нарушения   водоснабжения мегаполисов являются аномальные засухи и наводнения, сила и   частота которых в период потепления климата постоянно возрастают. Для   предотвращения событий такого рода необходима разработка и осуществление   гидроклиматических проектов, позволяющих адаптировать водоснабжение   мегаполисов к меняющимся условиям. Эту актуальную задачу можно решить только   путем строительства трасс водноресурсной логистики, осуществляющих   межрегиональное перераспределение водных ресурсов. Транспортировке подлежат   паводковые воды, отвод которых позволяет избежать наводнений, наносящих   значительный экономический и экологический ущерб. Для обозначения вод,   которые могут быть перемещены в другой регион без ущерба для окружающей   среды, предложен термин «мобильные водные ресурсы». Их объем должен   определяться на основе результатов специальных гидрологических исследований,   проводимых с учетом многолетней динамики речного стока. Для обеспечения   устойчивой работы трасс водноресурсной логистики необходимо создание водных   депозитариев, предназначенных для накопления и хранения мобильных водных   ресурсов. Это потребует модернизации режима существующих водохранилищ и   создания новых искусственных водных объектов. Финансовые затраты на   строительство трасс водноресурсной логистики не превысят ущерб, который могут   нанести чрезвычайные ситуации, вызываемые нарушением водоснабжения   мегаполисов. В настоящее время межрегиональное перераспределение вод   осуществляется во многих странах. Некоторые из таких гидротехнических систем   имеют трансграничный характер. На их основе формируется международный рынок   водных ресурсов. Страны-экспортеры не только получают финансовую выгоду от   продажи воды, но и укрепляют свое геополитическое положение. Если Российская   Федерация, обладающая большим количеством мобильных водных ресурсов, создаст   трассы водноресурсной логистики, она сможет стать одним из таких государств.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Shortage of water for supply to megacities as well   as unacceptable deterioration of its quality in the distribution water supply   network may lead to social and economic implications that let one consider   such phenomena as emergencies. The main causes of water supply disruption in   megacities are abnormal droughts and floods which tend to show enhanced   severity and frequency in the climate warming period. To prevent this, the   development and implementation of hydroclimatic projects are required towards   adapting the megacities’ water supply system to the changing conditions. This   pressing task can be solved only through the construction of water-resource   logistic routes used to provide interregional redistribution of water   resources. Floodwater which should be discharged to avoid floods that cause   significant economic and environmental damage is to be exported. The term   “mobile water resources” is proposed to denote water that can be moved to   another region without environmental damage. The volume of water should be   determined based on the results of a special hydrological investigation   carried out taking into account the long-term dynamics of river runoff. To   ensure the sustainable operation of water-resource logistic routes, it is   necessary to arrange water depositories designed for the accumulation and   storage of mobile water resources. This requires modernization of the   existing storage pools and the creation of new artificial water bodies. The   financial costs required for the construction of water-resource logistic   routes will not exceed the damage that could result from emergencies due to   water supply disruptions in megacities. At present, interregional water   redistribution is practised in many countries. Some of such hydroengineering   systems have a transborder character. They form a basis for the international   water-resource market. Exporting countries not only benefit financially from   selling water but also strengthen their geopolitical position. If the Russian   Federation, which has extensive mobile water resources, creates   water-resource logistic routes, it can become one of those states.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tLi-air batteries (LAB) have been attracting much attention because the theoretical energy density are five times as high as that of Li-ion batteries. However, they suffer from a large charging overvoltage and a poor cycleability due to difficulty of oxidative decomposition of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as the discharge product during charging. In general, Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> has both parts of high and low crystallinity, and it is desirable to actively increase the proportion of low crystallinity to reduce charging overvoltage.<jats:sup>[1]</jats:sup> In this study, we focused on oxygen supply such as the amount of dissolved oxygen and oxygen diffusivity in the electrolyte, and we investigated their effects on the discharge/charge performance of LABs. Especially, in order to improve the amount of oxygen supplied to the air electrode, we prepared LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> electrolyte solutions using mixtures of N-mehtylpyrrolidone (NMP), which has a high dielectric constant and low viscosity, and 1H,1H,5H-Octafluoropentyl 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl Ether (OTE) which has a high oxygen solubility as solvent. We fabricated LAB test cells using these electrolyte solutions and conducted discharge and charge tests to evaluate the effect of oxygen supply on the charge overvoltage and cycle life.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Lithium nitrate (LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) was dissolved in Tetraglyme (G4), NMP, and NMP:OTE (2:1 volume ratio) solvents at the concentration of 1.0 M. The ionic conductivity and dissolved oxygen of each electrolyte solution were measured using pH/ion meter and dissolved oxygen meter, respectively. Ketjen Black(KB)-PVdF/NMP slurry was coated on carbon paper, and it dried and fixed to form a positive electrode (KB weight: 1 mg cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>).<jats:sup>[2]</jats:sup> LAB cells were fabricated by assembling a positive electrode, separator, and Li metal negative electrode and immersing them with the electrolyte solutions. The discharge and charge tests were conducted at 30℃ under an oxygen flow, and were measured in constant current mode with a current density of 0.20 mA cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and a limiting capacity of 0.50 mAh cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> in the voltage range of 2.0 to 4.5 V.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold> Figure 1</jats:bold> shows the discharge/charge curves for the LAB cells using each LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> electrolyte solution. When using LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/G4, the overvoltage was high during both discharge and charge processes, and it became difficult to reach the limit capacity after 20 cycles (<jats:bold>Fig. 1a</jats:bold>). Whereas, LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/NMP exhibited a lower overvoltage than the LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/G4 one, and the capacity was maintained even after 20 cycles (<jats:bold>Fig. 1b</jats:bold>). This is suggested that the degree of dissociation for LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> salt and the diffusivity of Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the electrolyte solution are improved by using NMP solvent. In addition, the diffusivity of oxygen in the electrolyte solution also accelerated by reducing the viscosity. Furthermore, when using LiNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/NMP:OTE, the overvoltage much more decreased during the charge and discharge cycling, and the capacity was maintained even after 25 cycles (<jats:bold>Fig. 1c</jats:bold>). This indicates that the mixing OTE with NMP also increased the amount of dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte solution. These results suggest that improvement of the oxygen diffusivity and amount of dissolved oxygen leads to produce a low-crystalline Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on the air electrode surface, and as a result the decomposition overvoltage was reduced.  The other results including the physical properties of each electrolyte solutions and the morphology of Li<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> generated on the air electrode surface will be reported at the meeting to elucidate the effect of oxygen supply in more detail.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] A.

This is very important for offshore supply vessels like anchor handling tug and supply vessels, as they serve a combination of function in the maritime sector. An efficient maintenance system is crucial for increasing operational efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring safety and reliability of vessels. The challenge amongst ship operators is to identify the most critical components of the various systems present in the vessel. In this paper, a failure mode and effect analysis are used to assess the possible risks of components failure in the main engine system of an anchor handling and tug supply vessel operating off West Africa waters. Multiple experienced subject matter experts through questionnaires identified the main engine as the most important system of the anchor handling tug supply vessel, and data from the vessel owners were analyzed and used to identify the most critical components of the main engine system. The result allowed for a wider variety of opinion in selecting the most important system of the anchor handling tug supply vessel. Also, the risk assessment of the main engine was crucial in identifying the most critical components of the main engine.</jats:p>",

The data was presented using tables. The findings revealed that logistics visibility significantly and positively influenced performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms. It was concluded that as a result of ineffective embrace of logistics visibility, the manufacturing firms failed to optimize their supply chain towards enhancing performance. The study recommended the essence of logistics visibility as a way of ensuring control of logistics processes among the food and beverage manufacturing firms for better performance. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. For many years, steel and cast iron pipes have been used in the practice of domestic drinking water supply. However, they can be a source of pollutants entering drinking water. During the hygienic assessment, special attention is paid to metal impurities in corrosion products, which under certain conditions can enter drinking water distribution systems, thereby polluting drinking water and creating a health risk. \r\nMaterials and methods. The material was scientific reports and laboratory studies on the problem of the use of metal materials and their alloys in drinking water supply systems, with special attention to the specific properties of the analyzed materials. \r\nResults. The objective of our research is an attempt to standardize hygienic studies of metal materials (alloys) used in drinking water supply. The object developed was a research laboratory stand that recreates the conditions of a real water supply system, which makes it possible to simulate operating conditions for sanitary and chemical testing of metals and alloys intended for use in contact with drinking water. The stand guarantees a continuous flow of water through the tested material, simultaneous testing of the required number of samples, including control ones, as well as connection to cold and hot water supply systems (with test temperatures from 60 °C to 85 °C). It also allows temporarily stopping the flow of water to simulate standing water (test lines are closed for four hours before sampling), collect at least 3 liters of contact water for further testing, and also makes it easy to install the system and replace test samples. \r\nLimitations. Modelling of operating conditions for sanitary and chemical testing was carried out on metal materials (alloys), which are one of the possible options for using materials in drinking water supply. It is necessary to conduct similar studies on other groups of materials used. \r\nConclusion. This stand can be used by laboratories to carry out sanitary-chemical analysis of alloys that are used in drinking water supply systems. The developed methodology makes it possible to improve the quality and accuracy of the analysis of metallic materials and alloys through the use of a unified research system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim. The aim of the study was to consider the possibility of using the consortia of chemolithoautotrophic ferrobacteria from Gallionella genus and heterotrophic bacteria from Lepthothrix genus for the biological method of groundwater purification. Methods. The photocolorimetric method to determine the concentrations of ammonium and iron ions, the titrimetric method to determine the hydrocarbon and total alkalinity, the method of determining the permanganate oxidizability using the Kubel method, the potentiometric method to determine the values of рН and Еh, the electronic microscopy using the X-ray spectral analysis of matrix structures of bio-minerals, microbiological and statistical methods. Results. The main technological parameters of the water deironing process were defined as follows: the filtration velocity of the bioreactor – 7–11 m/h, and of the filters – 3.5–5 m/h; the filter-cycle duration – 48 h. It was found that the application of the two-stage technology of biological deironing in the bioreactor and filters provided for the possible removal of Fe2+ compounds up to 5.0 mg/cdm, ammonium nitrogen — up to 1.5 mg/cdm, soluble organic substances by PO – up to 6.0 mg O2/cdm. It was determined that the optimal parameters for the process of biological purification of neutral groundwaters, containing increased concentrations of Fe2+ cations were as follows: рН 7.0–7.2; hydrocarbon alkalinity 2.5–2.2 mmol/cdm; content of soluble oxygen – 1.5–2.0 mg/cdm. The ability of concentrated (Dos 200 mg/cdm) matrix structures of Gallionella and Lepthothrix ferrobacteria to remove Cr6+ ions from natural groundwaters was determined. The study found no considerable differences in the efficiency of applying disinfectants, produced using polyhexamethylene guanidine chloride (PHMGchl) or polyhexamethylene biguanidine chloride (PHMBchl). In concentrations of 0.25–0.5 %, they effectively disinfect pathogenic microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The same was found true for the bacteria, most common in the systems of technical reverse water supply, the systems of water circulation, plant watering, and fire tanks, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Pseudomonas sp., E. coli, Flavobacterium columnare, Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Conclusions. This was the first study on the possibility of applying the biotechnology of groundwater purification from excessive amounts of iron in conditions of uneven hydraulic burden, notable for the water supply systems of rural areas and most agricultural enterprises in the north-western and northern regions of Ukraine. The specificities and perspectives of PHMGchl application in the systems of water preparation were studied. It was found that from the standpoint of safety and efficiency, the use of the water deironing processes involving iron bacteria was reasonable in the systems of water consumption and technical water supply, and the disinfection of water using PHMG was possible only in the second case, due to some toxicity of the preparation. The optimal parameters for the process of biological purification of neutral groundwaters, containing increased concentrations of Fe2+ cations were determined.</jats:p>"

The identification of the appropriate location for the IJV reveals a gap in the existing literature. This research was conducted to address the existing gap by examining the impact of IJV location on energy savings and thermal comfort. A comprehensive three-dimensional CFD model is examined to accurately simulate the real environment of an office room (3 × 3 × 2.9 m3) during cooling mode, without the application of symmetrical plans. Four locations have been selected: two at the corners and two along the midwalls, designated for fixed-person positions. The return vent height is analyzed utilizing seven measurements: 2.9, 2.6, 2.3, 1.7, 1.1, 0.8, and 0.5 m. The RNG k–ε turbulence model is implemented alongside enhanced wall treatment. The findings indicated that the optimal range for the return vent height is between 1.7 and 0.8 m. It is advisable to utilize the IJV midwall 1 location, positioned behind the seated individual and away from the exterior hot wall. It is characterized by low vortex formation in the local working zone that contributes to a more comfortable sensation while providing recognized energy-saving potential.</jats:p>"

The influence of the turn ratio of the pulsed transformer on the output voltage was evaluated. The output voltage amplitude increased with increasing secondary turn ratio. Under the conditions of no load, a peak output voltage of 13 kV and a pulse width of 120 ns were obtained with a voltage across the drain–source terminals of the MOSFET of 1 kV. The peak voltage increased, and the peak current and pulse width decreased, with increasing load resistance and decreased capacitance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring the environmental safety of rural drinking water supplies is a critical issue in modern ecology and water resource management. Ecosystem changes, growing human impact, and inadequate rural infrastructure degrade drinking water quality. Water resources in these regions are often polluted by improper land use, untreated sewage discharge, and excessive agrochemical use. Drinking water quality directly affects public health, making the evaluation of water supply systems essential. The problem is compounded by inadequate monitoring, assessment, and management of water resources in rural areas. This study addresses several important scientific tasks, including developing methods and models for monitoring water’s ecological status, identifying human health risks, and formulating integrated approaches to water quality management. Practical measures include improving water supply infrastructure, drafting recommendations for reducing water source pollution, and enhancing public awareness and participation in water resource conservation. The study aims to develop and substantiate methodological foundations for assessing the ecological safety of rural drinking water supply systems. This approach will facilitate identifying and preventing environmental risks while ensuring acceptable water quality for the population. The key methodological approach for assessing the ecological safety of drinking water supply systems in rural settlements is system analysis, which conceptualises rural water supply as a system with specific input and output parameters. Based on an empirical analysis of rural drinking water supply, a “black box” model of rural water systems was developed. This model includes input factors influencing groundwater quality and criteria for assessing drinking water quality. Influential factors (GQ) were categorized into subsets: agriculture (A), urbanization (U), industrial activity (I), environmental conditions (E), and public ecological awareness (EC). Each subset is further broken down into specific parameters, such as fertilizer use, waste disposal, and hydrological phenomena. The study also defines drinking water quality (QW) using organoleptic, microbiological, and toxicological indicators. Evaluation criteria (ADWQ) include water quality classes, total quality indices, comprehensive pollution coefficients, and Hamming distance metrics for rapid and objective assessments. Research conducted in rural areas of the Zhytomyr region revealed critical nitrate pollution in 59% of water samples, attributed to intensive agricultural practices. A mathematical model for assessing water quality was developed and validated, showing a strong correlation (r = 0.87) between real and predicted data. The study also found a relationship between nitrate content and health risks, highlighting high or critical risk zones, especially for children and infants. The study confirms the utility of systemic, multi-criteria approaches in assessing drinking water quality, particularly in rural areas. The developed methodology facilitates effective decision-making to mitigate health risks and improve water quality, ensuring better access to safe drinking water in rural communities.\nKeywords: rural water supply, drinking water, system analysis, drinking water quality, nitrates, total iron, public health.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A model of the dynamics of soluble salts in the water of cooling systems of circulating water supply was developed based on mass balance principles. The proposed model is expressed in a general form under the assumption of a constant volume of circulating water and non-stationary input and output flows. The model accounts for scenarios where the concentration of soluble salts exceeds their concentration in the circulating water, thereby considering the technological necessity to change the system's power source in the event of an emergency at the feedwater treatment facilities. The developed model enables accurate prediction of the water-chemical regime in both existing and new recirculating cooling systems, sufficient for engineering calculations. It also facilitates the selection of optimal management strategies for such systems, including stabilization methods for recirculating water, feedwater preparation, blowdown volumes, etc. The model was validated under laboratory conditions for cases of concentration and dilution of highly soluble NaCl salt, with an observed error margin not exceeding 2%, attributed to experimental and instrumental factors. The variation in the concentration factor was analyzed for different blowdown rates, assuming initial equality of soluble salt concentrations in feedwater and circulation water. It was shown that establishing dynamic equilibrium between the circulation and feed waters can require dozens or even hundreds of circulation cycles for blowdown rates of 1–4%, and this system inertia must be considered during operation and when forecasting the performance of cooling systems with circulating water supply.</jats:p>",

Ancient civilisations exploited these resources in harmony with the environment, though information on their techniques is fragmented. This review provides insights into the efficiency, evolution, and relevance of ancient atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) techniques from 5000 B.C. to the 1900s, alongside modern techniques. An analytical framework and assessment are presented to deduce their viability for replication, revival, restoration, or redevelopment. Modern fog collectors yield an average value of 3–10 L/m2/day and dew collectors 0.3–0.6 L/m2/day. Ancient fog collectors from Mexico and Chile resembled modern collectors, while fog drip from trees offers a natural alternative, collecting 10 L/m2/day. The stone drip method shows potential in urban areas with extensive concrete surfaces. Ancient dew collection techniques include alchemists' dew collectors, lithic mulching for soil water conservation, dew ponds for water retention, and stone-pile condensers, which collected up to 360 L/day. Air wells, however, were less effective. Ancient AWH techniques offer valuable insights and can effectively supplement modern collectors, enhancing resilience and water security, especially in arid regions. Implementing AWH techniques provides sustainable, decentralised, nature-based strategies on a micro and macro scale for mitigating contemporary water shortages amidst increasing climate challenges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of blockchain technology into Supply Chain Management (SCM) is revolutionizing the way businesses track and manage goods across global networks. This paper explores the potential of blockchain integration with SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in supply chain operations. Blockchain's decentralized ledger offers an immutable and transparent record of transactions, which is particularly valuable in industries requiring robust traceability, such as pharmaceuticals, food, and manufacturing. By leveraging SAP’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, businesses can integrate blockchain to streamline data flow, ensuring that each step in the supply chain—from raw material procurement to final product delivery—is accurately recorded and visible to all authorized stakeholders. This integration addresses common challenges in traditional SCM, including fraud, data inconsistencies, and delays. Moreover, it enables real-time tracking of goods, automates contract execution through smart contracts, and reduces costs associated with intermediaries. The combination of SAP’s robust data management capabilities and blockchain’s transparency provides a solid foundation for improving operational performance, building trust with consumers, and complying with regulatory requirements. The paper also discusses the technical challenges and implementation strategies for integrating blockchain with SAP, along with its potential impact on improving the overall supply chain process. In conclusion, the fusion of blockchain and SAP presents a compelling solution for organizations seeking to achieve greater supply chain visibility and operational efficiency</jats:p>"

This research designed to reinforce and brighten the most important magnitudes that improve a physician’s judgment of mobile medical app and the purpose to usage. Furthermore, this study inspected the availability of the model between hospital physicians in UAE. The classic ideal was observed by means of a model of 340 UAE clinic physicians and their personal assistant who utilize mobiles facilities in overall. The review technique, a calculable method, was applied; the fractional smallest cubes organizational calculation exhibiting systems was owned to inspect the planned agenda. The platform emotion dimension, especially fear and resistance to change, and the familiarity with the products were evaluated, and it was discovered that these factors positively influenced the objective to use the application. And the other side, the first dimension of emotion, fear, manifested as “apparent threat”, had no outcome on the purpose to using. These discoveries recommended that scholars should emphasis more on the facilities, merchandises, and the key task of the mobile medical app to control their inspirations on clients’ ordering purpose. This will progress the purchasing ways associated to acquiring medicinal materials utilizing mobile medical app and/or on other operational stages in unambiguously in UAE and the Central East at great.</jats:p>"

Panel surya dapat digunakan untuk keperluan rumah tinggal, seperti pada lampu penerangan. Dikarenakan panel surya tidak selalu menghasilkan listrik, maka sumber PLN masih digunakan sebagai backup. Dikarenakan terdapat 2 sumber, maka digunakanlah Static Transfer Switch  (STS), dikarenakan STS mampu melakukan proses switching yang cepat. Sehingga penggunaan PLN dapat diminimalisirkan dengan adanaya panel surya. Dengan beban yang digunakan pada jurnal ini, STS mampu meminimalisir penggunaan PLN hingga 100%, sehingga beban dapat menggunakan sumber dari panel surya secara penuh selama panel surya tidak mengalami kendala. Dan untuk mengoptimalkan kinerja dari panel surya, maka digunakanlah Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) dengan metode Incremental Conductance. Hasil simulasi menunjukan perbandingan antara MPPT metode IC dan P&amp;O, dimana metode IC memiliki rata-rata akurasi daya sebesar 99,8% sedangkan metode P&amp;O sebesar 99,65%. Dan untuk nilai osilasi MPPT metode IC memiliki nilai osilasi  lebih kecil dibandingkan metode P&amp;O. Hasil simulasi dari STS menunjukan bahwa STS berhasil melakukan switching dari sumber utama ke sumber cadangan, ketika sumber utama mengalami gangguan, dan waktu switching terjadi dalam waktu yang cukup cepat yakni 0,24 ms.</jats:p>",

Disruption of food supply chains can lead to significant economic challenges. Building a resilient supply chain requires resources; however, it is difficult for firms to allocate resources to various resilience strategies. This study allocates the budget to resilient capacity, that is, absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacity, to minimize supply chain costs and maximize service levels. We developed a novel multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming method for problem formulation. The developed model was converted into an equivalent linear model. We used the Monte Carlo approach to generate the scenarios and the average sample approximation to determine the required scenarios. Finally, the Lexicographic max-min approach solves the model using actual data from a dairy supply chain. The analysis revealed that allocating 50% of the budget to restorative capacity and the remaining to adaptive and absorptive capacity optimizes supply chain performance. This study provides insights for managers to make better decisions with a knowledge-based background, allocate resources to various resilient strategies, and build a more resilient and efficient supply chain.</jats:p>",

The basis of PDS are secondary power sources (SPS), which use various methods of controlling and converting electricity, which leads to significant differences in their dynamic properties. From the side of on-board consumers, the dynamics of the power transmission system is determined by the total internal resistance (impedance) of the VIP.\r\nWhen conducting ground electrical tests of spacecraft ETS, due to the complexity of using power supply systems, test complexes are used, the basis of which is simulators of electrical characteristics of electric power transmission systems (EPTS).\r\nModern ISPS use a modular configuration principle, which makes it possible to produce EPTS of different powers, but energy modules have fixed or adjustable impedance frequency characteristics over a narrow frequency range, which leads to a limitation of the types of simulated PSPS. Equipping the EPTS with the property of regulating frequency characteristics in a wide frequency range expands the functionality of the EPTS, as it allows you to simulate the dynamic properties of the PSEP containing different types of VIPs.\r\nThe purpose of the work is to study and comparative analysis of three methods for regulating the impedance frequency characteristics (IFC) of the EPTS module.\r\nMethods for regulating the frequency response of an EPTS are considered on the basis of its generalized functional diagram containing mathematical models: amplifier-adder (AS), serial correction device (CU), power amplifier (PA), voltage divider (DN) and load (L). The article analyzes options for regulating the impedance frequency characteristics of EPTS, and considers three methods for regulating the IFC: two with a passive correction device and one with an active CU.\r\nThe paper presents a simulation model in the MicroCap package of the electrical circuit of the EPTS module, and computational experiments have been carried out on each method of regulating the IFC of the EPTS.\r\nBased on the results of the study, a method for correcting and regulating the IFC of the EPTS is recommended, which makes it possible to separately regulate the low-frequency and mid-frequency regions of the IFC, which makes it possible to significantly simplify the configuration and provision of the IFC of the EPTS in accordance with the specified requirements.</jats:p>"

It was observed that the means of DQN and DDQN were very similar. To validate whether the performance of the Dueling DQN algorithm is better than that of the DQN algorithm, a non-parametric test was performed to compare the mean rank of two related samples and to determine if there are differences between them. The p values ​​were 5.83e−38 and 0.000 for the Normal and Uniform distributions, respectively.\nConclusions: The algorithm with the best results is Dueling DQN, with an average total cost of 151.27 units for the demand with a normal distribution and an average of 155.3 units for the demand with a uniform distribution. This method has less variability once convergence is achieved</jats:p>"

The healthcare supply chain, which includes manufacturers, distributors, providers, and patients plays a critical role in ensuring cost-effective and timely delivery of medical products and services. However, access to these resources is hindered by some significant disparities, impacting health outcomes, and complicating existing inequities. Some key barriers to equitable healthcare supply chain access include geographical disparities between rural and urban areas, socioeconomic factors such as income inequality, racial and ethnic disparities, technological gaps, and regulatory challenges. This review also explores strategies for improving equity, including strategies for improving equity such as policy interventions, technological solutions, community-based approaches, supply chain optimization, and workforce development. By analyzing case studies of successful implementations and lessons learned from challenges, this review aims to inform policy, practice, and future research in healthcare supply chain management and health equity. The paper also highlights the relevance of this topic pointing to the current healthcare reforms and increased focus on health inequality. Finally, it stresses the potential impact of solving these challenges by adopting policy interventions, technological innovations, community engagement, and systemic changes in healthcare delivery and supply chain management.\r\nKeywords: Supply Chain, Health Equity, Risk Management, Healthcare.</jats:p>"

Microbiological assessments revealed widespread contamination, with heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) exceeding the recommended range in nearly all samples. The median HPC levels were particularly concerning, with the untreated source (RE000) exhibiting a median of 2555 CFU/mL. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli were present at alarming levels, indicating significant faecal contamination; the highest total coliform count, 2420 CFU/100 mL, was recorded at RE000. Physically, while all samples complied with electrical conductivity standards (0–70 µS/cm), turbidity levels showed variability, with nine samples exceeding the acceptable threshold of 1 NTU. The highest turbidity, 7.55 NTU, was recorded at the untreated source (RE000). Chemically, pH levels fell within safe ranges (6.0–9.0), with all samples being compliant with standards. However, only one sample (E001) met the free chlorine standard of 0.3–0.6 mg/L, suggesting inadequate disinfection practices. The untreated source was classified as ‘Unsuitable for drinking’ (WQI = 207.27). These findings highlight the critical need for enhanced monitoring and remediation strategies to improve drinking water safety in the region.</jats:p>"

This systematic review, drawing from 52 articles published between 2010 and 2024, identifies key risk areas impacting rebar procurement, encompassing financial, operational, and environmental dimensions. Financial risks, including price volatility and currency fluctuations, are exacerbated by global economic conditions and evolving trade policies. Although less addressed in the literature, environmental risks highlight the increasing need for sustainable procurement practices, considering the carbon footprint and resource intensity tied to rebar production and transport. Despite these advancements, a notable gap exists regarding the integration of environmental considerations within existing procurement risk frameworks, with limited research on green procurement practices for rebar. As environmental sustainability becomes increasingly prioritized, incorporating eco-friendly supplier selection and reducing emissions in logistics are expected to redefine risk management in the industry. This review not only underscores the multi-layered risks in rebar procurement but also identifies future avenues for innovation, particularly in sustainability-focused strategies, digital transformation, and predictive analytics, which can bolster resilience in the rebar supply chain and drive forward the construction industry’s risk management practices.</jats:p>"

The aim of the work is to develop methods for intellectualizing the operating modes of individual heat supply units (IHU) to improve their efficiency and reliability. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: creating and debugging methods for diagnosing IH operating modes; using the cluster analysis method, in particular the K-means algorithm, to identify pre-emergency situations at an early stage; analyzing the relationship between outdoor air temperature data and the pressures of direct and return network water in IHU operating modes using Novosibirsk as an example. The most important results of the work include dividing the measured parameters into five clusters, each of which characterizes a certain IHS operating mode. This was confirmed by the \"Elbow Method\", which determined the optimal number, which made it possible to significantly improve the forecasting of emergency modes. Studies have shown that a sharp increase in outdoor temperature leads to an increase in the pressure of direct network water, which can cause accelerated wear of heating networks due to the peculiarities of weather-dependent automation regulation. Introducing additional parameters into the initial data, such as the service life of heating networks and weather conditions, can improve the accuracy of forecasts. The significance of the obtained results lies in the possibility of early detection of emergency and pre-emergency modes of IHU operation, which helps prevent accidents and reduce repair and maintenance costs.</jats:p>"

A 3-day-old male neonate was diagnosed with type II congenital pulmonary airway malformation after prenatal color Doppler ultrasonography showed a lesion with blood supply from the pulmonary artery in the left lung. Post-birth chest computed tomography(CT) showed that the lesion was located in the posterior mediastinum with low density change, mild stripe enhancement after contrast, and no obvious blood supply vessels. A neurogenic tumor was considered for the preoperative diagnosis. The mass was removed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. During the surgery, the mass was observed to be a dark red solid lump with a feeding vessel originating from the pulmonary artery. The postoperative histopathological diagnosis was extralobar pulmonary sequestration. Combined with the preoperative imaging results, it was considered that the nourishing vessels might have intermittent torsion. The patient recovered well after surgery, and no recurrence was observed after 6 months of follow-up. Therefore, the possibility of extralobar pulmonary sequestration cannot be ruled out for posterior mediastinal masses that are not supplied by the descending aorta or without identified feeding vessels.</jats:p>"

The various parameters considered for developing the three dimensions of the risk index, namely, hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, the rationale for choosing those parameters, and the manner in which these parameters influence them are discussed. The index uses 29 variables: five for hazard, 15 for exposure, and the remaining nine for vulnerability. The variables are natural, physical, socioeconomic, and institutional or policy-related. The quantitative criteria for assigning values for various parameters and the analytical procedure for computing the sub-indices and the final risk index are also discussed.

To examine the response of two distinct natural Antarctic phytoplankton communities (diatom vs. flagellates) to increasing light and Fe availability, we conducted two shipboard incubation experiments during late summer and exposed each community to increasing light intensities (30, 80, and 150 µmol photons m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) with or without Fe amendment. Our results show clearly that both communities were Fe-limited since Fe addition resulted in higher particulate organic carbon (POC) production rates. The magnitude of the Fe-dependent increase in POC production, however, varied between the two stations being higher in the diatom-dominated community relative to the flagellate-dominated community. This differential response to increasing Fe supply could be attributed to the higher Fe requirement of the flagellate-dominated assemblage relative to the diatom-dominated assemblage. Irrespective of Fe availability, light also strongly stimulated the POC production of both communities between low and medium light supply (30 versus 80 µmol photons m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), indicating that both assemblages were light-limited <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>. However, since POC production of both communities did not increase further at the highest light intensity (150 µmol photons m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) even under high Fe supply, this suggests that light supply was saturated or that other conditions must be fulfilled (e.g., availability of trace metals other than Fe) in order for the communities to benefit from the higher light and Fe conditions.</jats:p>"

For centralized SCs with and without CSR, we prove the unimodality of the expected profits of the SCs for generic random yield and demand, and show the uniqueness of optimal ratio of order quantity to production input quantity. We disclose that the optimal expected profit of the SC with CSR is larger than that of the SC without CSR, and the profit difference increases with CSR effort and expected yield. We also find that the optimal CSR investment increases with the expected yield. Subsequently, the Nash equilibrium solutions of decentralized SCs under wholesale price and revenue-sharing contracts are analyzed.

Conduct a hygienic assessment of the main approaches to the use of chlorine dioxide in the water treatment technologies of water supply stations of Ukraine with surface sources of drinking water supply in order to identify and minimize potential risks to human health. Materials and methods of research. The analysis of water purification technologies used at water supply stations in Ukraine for the treatment of drinking water produced from surface sources of drinking water supply was carried out. The results of water quality studies on priority sanitary-chemical and microbiological indicators in the places of drinking water intakes and drinking water, as well as the doses of reagents used for the treatment of drinking water, during 2021-2023. A comparative analysis of the requirements for the quality of drinking water in the case of its treatment with chlorine dioxide, Directive 2020/2184/EU on the quality of water intended for human consumption, national regulations of 22 EU countries and SSRN 2.2.4-171-10 of Ukraine regarding the quality of drinking water. Methods adopted in international practice were used to assess health risks. Research methods: bibliographic, analytical, comparative assessment, sanitary-chemical, microbiological, hygienic assessment, risk assessment, mathematical and statistical. Research results and their discussion. Currently, in the context of the social and political crisis in Ukraine, chlorine dioxide is used at separate water stations in Ukraine with the purpose of: additional final disinfection; additional primary and secondary treatment along with chlorination; primary treatment of water before it enters the water supply station; complete replacement of chlorine gas with chlorine dioxide. Only at the water stations of the Dnipro city of Kyiv and Horishni Plavni city of the Poltava region, chlorine dioxide is used continuously throughout the year for the disinfection of raw water from the surface source of drinking water supply (Dnipro). At the Dnipro water station in Kyiv, the use of chlorine dioxide led to the greatest changes in the technological process of drinking water production and made it possible to ensure its epidemic safety, reduce the amount of dangerous reagents and the content of chlorination and ozonation by-products, as well as ensure the content of toxic chlorites at a level of ≤0.7 mg/l, which corresponds to the permissible human health risk (≤1.0). According to the results of mathematical modeling of the process of formation of chlorites in drinking water, it was determined that the risk of formation of chlorites in the drinking water of the distribution network of the Dnipro water station of the city of Kyiv in excess concentrations will be at the level of  ≤1.0, if the total dose of chlorine dioxide is at the level of ≤3.5 mg /l, and the hygienic norm of chlorites is ≤0.2 mg/l. If the hygienic norm of chlorites is adopted at the level of ≤0.7 mg/l, then the risk of formation of excessive chlorite content in the drinking water of the distribution network will decrease by 2.5 times. The current hygienic requirements of Ukraine regarding the content of chlorites (hygienic standard ≤0.2 mg/l) and chlorine dioxide (hygienic standard ≥0.1 mg/l) in drinking water of the distribution network are the strictest compared to the requirements of EU countries and need to be revised. Conclusions. Chlorine dioxide is used in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a small (15-25 thousand m3/day) and large capacity (100-200 thousand m3/day), most often as an additional or main method of disinfecting drinking water produced from surface, discrete or continuous mode. The risk of excessive chlorite content in the drinking water of the distribution network depends on the total dose of chlorine dioxide and the effectiveness of measures to minimize it. Technologies for the production of drinking water using chlorine dioxide at the water supply station in the city of Horishni Plavni, Poltava region, which involves the use of chlorine dioxide for the treatment of raw water before it enters the water supply station, as well as at the Dnipro water station in the city of Kyiv, which involves the replacement of chlorine gas with preammonization to chlorine dioxide with ferric chloride, allow to optimize the traditional technological process and improve the quality of drinking water in the absence of potential health risks. Keywords. Drinking water, disinfection, chlorites, health risk.</jats:p>",

Experimental results show that the XGBoost, Random Forest, CNN-BiLSTM, and MLP models exhibit superior predictive performance. In particular, the XGBoost model demonstrates the best results across all performance metrics, attributed to its effective learning of complex data patterns and variable interactions. Although the KNN model also shows perfect predictions with zero error values, this indicates a need for further review of data processing procedures or model validation methods. Conversely, the BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer models exhibit relatively lower performance. Models with moderate performance include Linear Regression, RNN, Conv1D-BiLSTM, Attention-LSTM, and the LSTM-CNN hybrid model, all displaying relatively higher errors and lower coefficients of determination (R²). As a result, tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and certain deep learning models like CNN-BiLSTM are found to be effective for predicting order quantities in supply chain tiers. In contrast, RNN-based models (BiLSTM, BiGRU) and the Transformer show relatively lower predictive power. Based on these results, we suggest that tree-based models and CNN-based deep learning models should be prioritized when selecting predictive models in practical applications.</jats:p>"

Healthcare supply chains face several challenges such as fragmentation, lack of real-time visibility, and inventory management issues. However, there are solutions with the help of AI and machine learning, including the availability of predictive analytics to improve demand forecasting, optimization algorithms for inventory and logistics, and automated quality control. Application areas demand forecasting, supplier selection, logistics optimization, quality control, and real-time tracking. The applications of AI in healthcare supply chains have the potential to improve the healthcare supply chain in terms of reduced costs, increased efficiency, optimized decision-making, and better patient outcomes. However, the implementation experience has shown several challenges such as data quality, privacy concerns, regulatory compliance, and workforce adaptation within organizations. Successful implementations in various health organizations in the US give valuable insights into how AI could be well implemented. The future presents several opportunities for supply chain optimization with the rise of blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) integration. For healthcare supply chains to adopt AI, organizations should have specific AI plans, start with pilot projects in high-impact areas, invest in data infrastructure, and ensure strong leadership support. As AI becomes increasingly critical for competitive advantage, it has the potential to create more resilient, efficient, and patient-centric supply chains in the US healthcare system.</jats:p>"

Mechanism analysis reveals that agricultural subsidies have driven up farmland scale and increased agricultural labor supply in production, incentivizing the motive for profit maximization among farmers. Meanwhile, agricultural subsidies also encourage farmers to cultivate more grain crops.

Moreover, it examines hybrid and fully electric propulsion systems, considering advancements in battery technology and the integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to further reduce SOV emissions. Key findings from this research indicate that LNG serves as a viable short- to medium-term solution for reducing GHG emissions in the SOV sector, due to its relatively lower carbon content compared to MDO and HFO. This paper finally insists that while LNG presents an immediate opportunity for emission reduction in the SOV sector, a combination of hydrogen, ammonia, and hybrid propulsion systems will be necessary to meet long-term decarbonisation goals. The findings underscore the importance of coordinated industry efforts, technological innovation, and supportive regulatory frameworks to overcome the technical, economic, and infrastructural challenges associated with decarbonising the maritime industry.</jats:p>"

In addition, AI offers new capabilities for data analytics, data adaptation, event/anomaly detection, and prediction. However, novel data supply and use strategies are needed when going toward higher-granularity data trade, in which a high volume of short-term data products is traded automatically in dynamic environments. This paper presents offering-driven data supply (ODS), demand-driven data supply (DDS), event and offering-driven data supply (EODS), and event and demand-driven data supply (EDDS) strategies for high-granularity data trade. Computer simulation was used as a method to evaluate the use of these strategies in supply of air quality data for four user groups with different requirements for the data quality, freshness, and price. The simulation results were stored as CSV files and analyzed and visualized in Excel. The simulation results and SWOT-analysis of the suggested strategies show that the choice between the strategies is case-specific. DDS increased efficiency in data supply in the simulated scenarios. There was higher profit and revenues and lower costs in DDS than in ODS. However, there are use cases that require the use of ODS, as DDS does not offer ready prepared data for instant use of data. EDDS increased efficiency in data supply in the simulated scenarios. The costs were lower in EODS, but EDDS produced clearly higher revenues and profits.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to identify potential risks that arise in the supply chain, find risk agents as the cause of the risk and control the risk by designing risk mitigation and its formulation in the structure of the nutmeg oil supply chain in South Aceh. The technique used in this study is the House Of Risk (HOR) method. The study has obtained 23 risk events and 17 priority risk agents covering Source, Make, Distribution and Costumer (Return) activities. Then from the risk agents obtained, 11 priority mitigation actions were also obtained as a control of the performance of the nutmeg oil supply chain that can be applied in an effort to reduce the occurrence of supply chain risks so that the industry is able to produce optimally and is able to improve the quality of nutmeg oil which of course has a positive impact on the selling value.</jats:p>"

University‐educated grandmothers are more likely to provide regular childcare (at least once a week) and university‐educated mothers are more likely to draw upon it, inconsistent with research in other countries. It appears grandparents are stepping in as both “mother savers” and “system savers,” suggesting a need for more public policy support for Australian working mothers to capitalise on their increasingly high educational attainment.</jats:p>"

In healthcare, traditional supply chain management has focused on cost efficiency to the detriment of environmental considerations leading to higher emissions, waste, and resource depletion. The focus of this study is to investigate strategies for making sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in the U.S. healthcare system, while reducing environmental impact at minimal cost to patient care quality. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the current state of healthcare supply chains, explore sustainable practices, evaluate emerging technologies, propose an SSCM implementation framework, and explore policy implications. Sustainable supply chain management can be achieved by forming the key strategies: comprehensive waste reduction and recycling programs, adoption of energy efficient transportation and storage solutions, green energy sourcing, and use of data driven inventory management that would help optimize inventory, along with other technologies like blockchain, IoT and artificial intelligence that could achieve transparency and efficiency. The research wouldn't go into specific case studies but would likely look at institutions that have already been able to implement these practices. The findings indicate that considerable environmental footprint reduction of the U.S. healthcare sector is possible without sacrificing access to high quality care through adoption of SSCM practices. But it requires joint efforts from policymakers, healthcare providers and industry partners. The long-term goal is a sustainable, resilient healthcare system that will integrate environmental stewardship with high quality care, that will help mitigate climate change and acknowledge the interdependence of environmental and human health.</jats:p>"

The study shows that scenario analysis, quantitative risk assessment, qualitative risk assessment, supply chain mapping, and root cause analysis, as well as supply chain diversification, significantly, impact transport logistics performance. However, real-time monitoring, and tracking, are not, strongly, linked to changes in transport logistics performance.

This study investigates the impact of housing supply, income levels, and key macroeconomic factors, specifically inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth, on housing prices in Nigeria. Using a quantitative research design, secondary data from the Central Bank of Nigeria, the National Bureau of Statistics, and the World Bank were analyzed over the period from 2013 to 2023. Statistical analyses, including trend analysis, correlation, multiple regression, and Granger causality tests, were conducted to determine the relationships between housing prices, housing supply, income levels, and macroeconomic indicators. Findings indicate that increased housing supply plays a stabilizing role in moderating housing prices, while rising income levels drive demand elevates prices. Inflation is identified as a key driver of housing costs, primarily due to escalating construction expenses, while interest rates show minimal impact on housing prices due to limited mortgage accessibility in Nigeria. The study among others recommends policies to increase the affordable housing supply, including incentives for developers and streamlined regulatory processes. Income support measures and affordable mortgage options tailored for low- and middle-income earners are also recommended to improve housing accessibility. To mitigate the impact of inflation, strategies to stabilize construction costs are proposed, along with broader monetary policies to promote economic stability. This study underscores the need for an integrated housing policy framework in Nigeria that addresses supply expansion, income growth, and inflation control to enhance housing affordability in the nation’s urban centers.</jats:p>",

The study also included one mediator, perceived social responsibility (PSR) to test its mediating effects in three direct relationships and one moderator, perceived regulatory pressure (PRP), to test the moderation in the relationship between PSR and PEP. The study used a deductive methodology based on a cross‐sectional survey design. IBM SPSS 29 was used for descriptive analysis and a variance‐based partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) (through PLS 4.0) was used for testing the hypothesised relationships. The study found that, first of all, all the three independent constructs have significant positive relationships with the dependent variable, PEP. Second, GP2 and EGO have significant positive relationships with the mediator, PSR while GP1 has an insignificant relationship with PSR. Third, the mediator (PSR) is positively related to PEP. Fourth, regarding the mediating effects, the study identified that PSR partially mediates the relationships between GP2 and PEP as well as between EGO and PEP while PSR does not mediate the relationship between GP1 and PEP. Finally, the study identified that PRP strengthens the positive relationship between PSR and PEP. It is strongly anticipated that this empirical study will spark further theoretical research and empirical experiments on GSCMP‐oriented environmental performance. The study incorporated two unique variables as mediator and moderator that can open a new avenue for the upcoming research initiatives. Furthermore, the study's findings can serve as a foundation for the policymakers and/or managers working on the formulation and implementation of green supply chain management‐related policies and strategies.</jats:p>",

It seeks to provide insights into the short- and long-term dynamics between these variables and their implications for monetary policy in Algeria.\r\n \r\nTheoretical Framework: The research builds on monetary theory and exchange rate economics, exploring how money supply influences exchange rate movements. Concepts such as the Quantity Theory of Money and exchange rate regimes form the foundation of the analysis.\r\n \r\nMethod: The study employs a Structural Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, utilizing time series data on money supply and exchange rates. Stationarity of the data was tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and the existence of a long-term relationship was examined through Johansen's cointegration test. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and Variance Decomposition (VD) analyses were conducted to capture dynamic interactions.\r\n \r\nResults and Discussion: The findings reveal a significant but limited interaction between money supply and exchange rates. Money supply impacts exchange rates primarily in the short term, with inflationary effects causing initial depreciation of the dinar. The results also highlight the self-driven nature of each variable, with limited cross-variable influence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of Algeria’s oil-dependent economy and fluctuating exchange rate regimes.\r\n \r\nResearch Implications: The study underscores the need for coordinated monetary policies aimed at stabilizing exchange rates and mitigating volatility.

Concentrating on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the crisis is said to substantially impact supply chains in five vital sectors: agriculture, chemicals, manufacturing, metals, and oil and gas. It is highly worrisome that there is a recorded significant reduction in the production rate for agriculture &amp; chemicals and a correspondingly significant reduction in demand for metals, oil &amp; gas. On the other hand, manufacturing has also witnessed a moderate decrease in production and demand. This research study is highly motivated by the historical record of extreme supply chain disruptions, which often translate to untold hardships for the government, firms, employees, and consumers. Furthermore, the current level of supply chain shortages has been termed worse off compared to historical levels during the Nixon administration in the early 70s. The broader objective of the research studies is to proffer feasible solutions to never-ending supply chain disruptions. The landscape is changing, negating the proponents and believers in certain pitfalls, especially unavailable data, few relevant talents and skills, and low adoption rate. The occurrence of significant events such as COVID-19, extreme weather-related events, other natural disasters, logistic failures, and tariff disputes have available and reliable data organizations can utilize in a range of analytical fact-finding projects.</jats:p>",

The results reveal that FinTech promotes corporate innovation by reducing corporate-financing constraints and financing costs, alleviating information asymmetry, and expanding financing channels. This promotion effect is more pronounced for private, small, and young firms, firms with fewer fixed assets, and those located in low-regulation intensity areas. Moreover, credit-based FinTech companies have a greater impact on business innovation. In addition, bank deregulation and increased bank competition crowd out the financial supply of FinTech for innovation financing. Knowledge of these impacts can help corporate managers, governments, and financial regulators to formulate more effective development strategies to promote corporate innovation.</jats:p>",

The prevalence of waterborne diseases in some areas is attributed by inadequate water quality assessments of supply sources. This study focused on evaluating the potability of domestic water sources in the Kilombero district of Tanzania, where approximately 70% of the population depends on untreated natural sources. Two models were utilized: the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI), analysing 15 water quality parameters. The WAWQI identified three groundwater sources as poor quality for consumption, while indicating seasonal improvements in water quality – from 12 in the wet season to 13 in the dry season. Conversely, the CCME WQI classified all 15 sources as potable, with an increase in ‘Excellent’ ratings from 9 to 13 between seasons. The findings showed that all surface water sources were deemed potable, while 67% of groundwater sources met quality standards. The remaining 33% of boreholes were categorized as having poor quality. Overall, both models indicated better water quality during the dry season, with surface water generally exhibiting higher quality than groundwater.</jats:p>",

This article aims to investigate the potential effects of AR technology on organizational performance through the mediation role of SCM and logistics value chain functions to address the existing knowledge gap. Methods: This research employed a cross-sectional design and an explanatory survey as a deductive approach for hypothesis development. The primary data collection method involved the self-administration of a questionnaire to furniture suppliers located in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including six countries. Of the 656 questionnaires submitted to suppliers, 483 were considered usable, yielding a response rate of 73.6%. The research utilized partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to evaluate the gathered data. Results: The current paper’s statistical evidence demonstrates that AR implementation has a positive impact on the supply and logistics value chain activities and organizational performance of furniture suppliers in the GCC region. Moreover, it illustrates that the design and planning variable of supply chain value dominates as the primary predictor of organization performance. The results indicated that the ANN strategy provided a more comprehensive explanation of internally generated constructs compared to the PLS-SEM technique. Conclusions: This study demonstrates its usefulness by advising furniture industry decision-makers on what to avoid and what aspects to consider when creating plans and regulations. The report also suggests operations managers apply machine learning (ANN) for prediction and decision-making in supply and operations value chains. This essay looks at how the AR and resource-based supply value chain view may affect company performance across countries, firm sizes, and ages.</jats:p>"

Using a large national administrative database, we identified OBGYNs enrolling in new states from July 2017 through June 2024. We used difference-in-differences (DID) analyses to estimate the effect of Dobbs on enrollments by state abortion policy (ban vs no ban). Enrollments in ban states were lower than in no-ban states in most academic years (June–July) throughout the study period. In the 2 years post-Dobbs, DID models found no significant differences in enrollments in ban states relative to no-ban states. These findings indicate minimal state-level shifts in the OBGYN workforce following Dobbs. Past research has found that a complex constellation of factors drives physician movement, including state licensure, job availability, income, spousal job opportunities, and social support. While the effect of the Dobbs decision on the workforce are likely to be significant, the full impacts on the workforce will take years to fully unfold.</jats:p>",

However, previous studies have complemented ecological management practices from a holistic or ES supply perspective, with little consideration of spatial and temporal differences in supply–demand mismatches across ecoregions. On the basis of the frameworks of spatial quantification, matching analysis, driver identification, and management strategy development, this study explores the differences in the supply and demand of key ES in various ecological zones of the South China Karst (SCK) and employs correlation analyses to reveal the direction and degree of influence of the drivers on the mismatch of supply and demand. Furthermore, valuable ecological management strategies are provided. The results showed that, in general, the supply of habitat quality (HQ) and carbon sequestration (CS) decreased, and the supply capacity for soil conservation (SC), food provision (FP), and water yield (WY) improved. The demand for WY decreased, whereas the demand for all other services increased to varying degrees. Except for the SC imbalance, the supply and demand of other ES matched well, with localized mismatch areas concentrated around the city. These gradually evolved from a point distribution to a continuous type of line or even surface distribution from 2000 to 2020. The temporal and spatial variability of ES was evident in different ecoregions, and key socio‐ecological drivers were inconsistent in their ability to explain ES supply and demand mismatches, especially in medium‐high mountain regions. Additionally, we provide valuable spatial planning and ecological management strategies for future socioe‐cological system management on the basis of the results of different regional studies.</jats:p>",

Here, an analysis of the financial and economic activities of KENTAU transformer Plant JSC was carried out, a logistic assessment of the activities of the enterprise for the organization of the supply chain was carried out. Commercial organizations strive for an advantage over competitors in the market. To achieve this goal, they develop and build a supply chain, which is the most effective method. An important factor in a successful supply chain is the availability of reliable information necessary to develop the right strategy and choose the optimal solution. To make operational decisions, it is necessary to correctly assess the situation and identify errors and changes in delivery areas using quantitative and qualitative methods. As it turned out in the analysis, it is necessary to further increase the strengths of the organization against the background of increased efficiency and competitiveness. In order for organizations to achieve their goals, a system of closely connected businesses will be used to increase their effectiveness in achieving their goals. At the same time, the enterprise is able to determine the type of its activities and quickly respond to changes in the internal and external environment by modeling business processes. As a result, it is important that the company effectively uses the method of decomposition of objects and processes for a comprehensive study of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the integration of sustainable energy, the power grid has become increasingly information-intensive and complex. To address the issue of power grid cyber-physical systems being unable to operate securely and stably when systems suffer false data injection attacks, a two-stage detection method based on Stacking and Maximum Information Coefficient and Dual-layer Confidence Extreme Gradient Boosting (MIC-DCXGB) is proposed by the paper. Firstly, a Stacking classification model consisting of multiple heterogeneous learners detects anomalies in real-time measurement data samples to determine if false data are present. Secondly, the method incorporates the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) for feature selection, which non-linearly measures the correlation between data features and fairly removes redundant features by evaluating the amount of information one feature variable contains about another. This approach effectively tackles the high-dimensional redundancy problem commonly faced in false data injection attack detection. Then, the paper introduces a dual-layer confidence Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) tree with positive feedback information transmission to classify node states. By combining grid topology learning with label correlation, it selectively uses preceding label information to reduce errors in the predictions learned by subsequent classifiers, achieving precise localization of the attack positions. Finally, extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

The findings demonstrate that when the government chooses static subsidy and static tax policies, there is no evolutionary stable strategy in the game system. The flaws of the static reward and punishment system can be adequately compensated for by the dynamic subsidy and dynamic tax policy, leading to an evolutionary stable state. The likelihood of developers producing prefabricated structures is negatively connected with policy cost and subsidy upper limits and favorably correlated with tax upper limits, according to the dynamic reward and punishment mechanism. The findings of the study have significant implications for government policy that will encourage the widespread use of prefabricated structures in China. </jats:p>",

These two parties can choose from two financing modes: bank financing or mixed financing, in which the latter combines bank financing with equity financing. Two decision-making power structures are formulated, namely the Nash game model and the retailer-led Stackelberg game model. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of equilibrium outcomes for both parties within these power structures is performed, yielding the following insights: (1) In the bank financing mode, retailers find greater profitability in adopting dominance. When emission reduction efficiency is high, manufacturers obtain more profit within a Nash game context. However, when emission reduction efficiency is low, manufacturers accrue more profit in a Stackelberg game context. In the mixed financing mode without cap-and-trade regulations, supply chain participants do not express a preference for any specific game structure. (2) Without cap-and-trade regulation, in both the Nash and Stackelberg game models, the supply chain participants find more profitability in mixed financing when carbon emission reduction efficiency is high. Meanwhile, bank financing proves more profitable when the carbon emission reduction is low. Moreover, this study investigates the impact of wholesale and retail prices of low-carbon products on the financing strategies of the supply chain participants under different power structures and financing modes. Additionally, extended models are considered, including the manufacturer-led Stackelberg game structure and the capital-constrained manufacturer with a certain amount of initial capital.</jats:p>"

Reverse engineering and retrofitting with an innovative design is an easy way out. In this study, a High Pressure 5K rated De-sander is converted to High Pressure Gas Liquid Compact Cyclone Separator (GLCC) to separate High Pressure gas from liquid for gas injection and Gas Lift purposes. All Cyclones are based on the same working principle and the main difference in the design based on the specific separation requirement. The centrifugal acceleration exceeds the gravitational acceleration by far, enabling a similar degree of separation, but in a significantly shorter time and smaller volume. Considering the original equipment design conditions and keeping within the limit, the new field requirements have been taken into evaluation. The same mechanical body of de-sander equipment can be used for different type of applications with different designs of internal cyclones/inserts. Also, the inlet and outlet piping, instrumentation control system have been redesigned with different control strategy. Required field modifications have been carried out. New insert design made based on required new multiphase flow rates, pressure, temperature and fluid properties. Inlet and outlet piping designs were modified to suit new design conditions. Field tests carried out to evaluate performance with actual field set up. Inlet tangential flow properly designed. Liquid separation efficiencies determined for various multiphase flow rate at different pressure and temperature conditions depending on the High-pressure donor wells. Liquid hold up under Zero-Net Liquid Flow at various flow conditions assessed. Acceleration field is increasing with increasing throughput and increasing pressure drop across the cyclone. Whilst the residence time decreases with increasing flow the increase in acceleration field is more significant. Separation efficiency increase with increased flow rate. Smaller cyclone provides higher efficiency. If the gas well start produces more liquid then apparently the bulk phase density will increase and the separation efficiency will decrease. Both liquid and solid particles could be simultaneously removed with close operational settings. Good level of dryness up to 90 % could be achieved. Reverse engineering and retrofitting of Cyclonic equipment such as de-sanders provide huge opportunity in the oil &amp; gas industry. The design offers a large operating range with good performance and provide a quick, cost effective and compact solution for various applications.</jats:p>",

The study has shown evidence that the water level's daily mean value of the Ca River is increasingly reduced. However, the number of occurrences of the daily minimum flow was more than that of the period when it was not hydropower reservoirs and was affected by climate change. The study calculated and built five scenarios for water use in the downstream areas. These scenarios are calculated based on the water demand for domestic, industry, irrigation, and water sea level. A simulation model was developed for optimal hydropower generation of reservoir system upstream and forced to discharge downstream with five scenarios. This study's results demonstrated that four upstream reservoirs could operate with scenario 3 corresponding HNam Dan = 0.7 m. The results suggested options for the operation of hydroelectric reservoirs and simultaneously developed scenarios for taking water for agricultural irrigation downstream of the Ca River Basin with water level for irrigation drains and domestic water factories.

In Emina-Boadi, a small town in Kumasi, Ghana, residents increasingly rely on boreholes due to substandard service from the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). This shift highlights concerns about water reliability, quality, and affordability, impacting public health and hindering progress toward SDG 6. This case study assesses water service levels using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as quantity, quality, affordability, accessibility, and reliability, focusing on sources like boreholes, hand pumps, piped water, hand-dug wells, rainwater, and surface waters. The study aims to delineate the roles of different water providers, understand community dynamics, and evaluate contributions to rural development and SDG 6 through stakeholder interviews and questionnaires. By leveraging the WASHCost framework, which aims to improve planning methods and the provision of water and sanitation services by addressing the lack of cost information in rural and peri-urban areas, and the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) framework, which monitors progress toward global targets related to water, sanitation, and hygiene, the study categorizes indicators and draws connections among them. The findings reveal a significant preference for borehole services, with 87% usage and an 83% reliability rate compared to 13% for GWCL. Daily water consumption averages 60.75 L per person, with on-premises access improving water collection efficiency to 7 min. Dissatisfaction with GWCL services highlights the need for improved delivery aligned with community needs and SDG targets. Adopting sustainable management practices, enhancing infrastructure, and improving governance are crucial for ensuring safe and affordable water access for all residents of Emina-Boadi and similar communities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the potential of blockchain technology to stabilize food supply chains during periods of economic inflation. Economic inflation poses significant challenges to food security, as rising prices can disrupt supply chain transparency, efficiency, and trust among stakeholders. This research develops a conceptual model demonstrating how blockchain can enhance transparency and stability in food supply chains, ultimately improving resilience against inflationary pressures. By providing a decentralized, immutable ledger, blockchain technology allows for real-time tracking of food products from farm to table, enabling better inventory management and demand forecasting. The proposed model integrates key components, including smart contracts, which automate transactions and ensure compliance with quality and safety standards. This feature not only reduces delays but also fosters trust among supply chain participants, such as farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. Additionally, the model emphasizes the role of data analytics in harnessing blockchain data to provide insights into pricing trends and inventory levels, facilitating proactive decision-making in response to inflation. Future research directions are identified, focusing on innovations within blockchain technology that could further mitigate the effects of inflation on food supply chains. Potential areas of exploration include integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive analytics, utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time data collection, and developing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions to enhance liquidity and investment in the agricultural sector.  This study contributes to the growing body of literature on blockchain applications in supply chain management by highlighting its potential as a tool for enhancing food security in inflationary environments. By ensuring transparency, improving stakeholder collaboration, and providing actionable insights, blockchain technology can play a pivotal role in stabilizing food supply chains amidst economic fluctuations. Ultimately, this research advocates for the adoption of blockchain solutions as part of comprehensive strategies to safeguard food systems from the adverse impacts of inflation.\r\nKeywords: Blockchain Technology, Food Supply Chains, Economic Inflation, Transparency, Stability, Smart Contracts, Predictive Analytics, Data Analytics, Food Security, Decentralized Finance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a result of the physical characteristics of metals and their use on a large scale, the industry producing metal products is one of the most important in terms of volume when implementing reverse logistics practices. The relationship between suppliers and customers from the perspective of environmental demands, companies using metal materials are mapped into the Supply Chain operation Reference (SCOR) model. In this study there are Key Performance indicators (KPIs) which are categorized based on the performance attributes of SCOR, namely reliability, responsiveness, agility, cost, and assets management. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is an analytical method for the structure of a problem and is used to make decisions on an alternative that is useful for solving complex unstructured problems. The result of this research is that the performance value obtained is a yellow traffic light which means that the application of reverse logistics metal at PT. XYZ has not been implemented properly, so further research must be carried out with primary data in the form of a reverse logistics process each step by step.</jats:p>"

This paper presents the expression for beam current, high voltage, and bias voltage derived from experimental data on a certain electron beam gun. Furthermore, the main causes of affecting beam current ripple are analyzed, and a novel circuit topology is proposed. According to the ISO14744, Welding-Acceptance inspection of electron beam welding machines, a Faraday cup is used to collect the beam from the electron beam gun. In this paper, the ripple of the beam current of the electron gun driven by the traditional and proposed circuits is tested, respectively. The experimental results show that the ripple of beam current of the novel circuit topology can be achieved to within ±0.18% when the voltage is 150 kV and the beam current is 33 mA, lower than 10 percent of that of the traditional power supply. The stability of beam current is better than 5 μA at 150 kV and 3.3 mA.</jats:p>",

The European Union (EU) reported a distribution of transportation modes dominated by rail, sea/water, and air, while Africa heavily relied on road transport. The significance of road infrastructure in Africa, as highlighted by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Accenture, was underscored by its potential to reduce business costs, lower goods prices, and enhance product competitiveness. Kenya's road infrastructure development, as outlined in Vision 2030 and the Big Four Agenda, encountered challenges in achieving targeted road construction and maintenance due to supply chain collaboration issues. This study aimed to explore the impact of supply chain collaboration practices on the performance of road transport sector agencies in Kenya, with a focus on areas that previous research had not adequately covered. The study utilized a theoretical framework grounded in Collaborative Theory, exploring the connection between supply chain planning and agency performance. The study established a significant positive correlation between supply chain collaborations and agency performance through regression analysis. Recommendations emphasized the importance of maintaining effective collaboration and transparent financial management to strengthen agency performance. Future research could explore comparative studies across sectors and regions and investigate the long-term effects of supply chain collaborations on organizational performance. In addition, qualitative research provided deeper insights into the factors that influenced collaboration effectiveness and performance outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tThe performance of hydrogen PEM fuel cell systems can be optimized by means of pressurization of the cathode air, especially in aviation, where at in-flight conditions the pressure of the ambient air is significantly lower as at on-ground conditions. To provide the inlet air at optimal conditions (p, T, rH) during flight, an air supply system is required and in an all-electric aircraft the compression should happen by means of an electric centrifugal compressor. A challenge for the operation of a pressurised fuel cell system at high altitudes is the control of the compression system. Any unstable operation like compressor surge has to be avoided, since it can damage both the fuel cell stack and the compressor itself. For the development of such an air supply system, a combined experimental and modeling approach was chosen.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A hydrogen PEM fuel cell system was characterized at nominal and at low cathode pressures to obtain the behavior at flight relevant conditions and an experimental air supply system containing electric compressor, intercooler, humidifier, cathode volume and throttle valve at the outlet has been set up and used for the development, parameterization, and validation of a model for the compression system. The model is based on the Greitzer model <jats:sup>1,2</jats:sup>, and has been extended to also represent the additional components between the compressor and the throttle valve (intercooler, humidifier, and cathode volume) <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. It is now able to predict the transient response of the entire air supply system to changes in the reference values of compressor speed and valve opening angle and the resulting mass flow changes and pressures within the individual components.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The model and the data from the fuel cell system were used for the development of improved control strategies, that make it possible to operate the system safely in a wide range of operating conditions. Unstable situations, like compressor surge, are avoided by these control strategies even in the highly varying conditions during a flight. The developed control strategies are verified on the hardware of the experimental setup and tested under realistic flight conditions in a low-pressure climate chamber.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References <jats:list list-type=\"roman-lower\">\n                     <jats:list-item>\n                        <jats:p>Greitzer, E.

Due to a reduction in plant nutrition with sulphur, this has also led to a drop in the S concentrations in certain plant species over time. As a result, a lot of experimental work was carried out to remedy the emerging yield and quality deficiencies on the farms. In this summarized study, data from 98 sites in Central Europe were recorded from 1998 to 2023 received from sulphur fertiliser trials carried out on farms and experimental stations under organic farming conditions. This second part of meta-analysis focuses on establishing relationships between the status of plant nutrient supply with sulphur and DM yield responses, the nitrogen uptake of crop species and the extent of N2 fixation in legumes. Results of regression analyses based on the effect of the S concentrations and the N:S ratios of the crop species on the relative yield differences between 851 standard variants (=100%) and 1177 sulphur treatment variants. In principle, declining yield increases were determined as a result of increasing S concentrations and decreasing N:S ratios. Except in the case of grain legume young plants, both characteristics were suitable for determining corresponding limit values for yield formation. Different values were determined depending on the plant species and harvest material. In extensive comparative analyses and discussion with literature data, minimum sulphur concentrations and maximum values for N:S ratios for young plants, vegetative harvest material (straw) and grain materials are proposed to ensure optimum yields of permanent grassland, lucerne-clover-grass, grain legumes and cereals for use in practice of agricultural systems of different intensities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, the rise of e‐commerce has led to the dominance of some platforms in the market. Both these platforms and third‐party logistics providers are now offering online logistics services. Under this context, the brand manufacturers face challenges of deciding whether to outsource their logistics needs to third‐party logistics service providers (LSPs), rely on the e‐commerce platform itself, or establish collaborative partnerships with them. The combination between the decision to outsource or cooperate and the choice of service providers yields four typical scenarios: outsourcing to the platform without cooperation (Case PB), outsourcing to the platform with cooperation (Case P), outsourcing to the LSP without cooperation (Case LB), and outsourcing to the LSP with cooperation (Case L). This paper proposes a game‐theoretic model to investigate the manufacturer's optimal selection of logistics mode. We examine the economic and environmental performances of four logistics modes, with a particular emphasis on the mutual benefits and costs shared between manufacturers and their logistics partners. Our results reveal that collaboration in sustainable logistics improvement leads to higher sustainability levels, augmented logistics fees, and increased sales volumes compared to noncollaborative strategies. Additionally, we find that outsourcing to the e‐commerce platform generally results in higher profits and superior environmental performance for manufacturers, contingent upon the sustainability enhancement being sufficiently effective. Empirical evidence from surveys and interviews with industry experts supports our theoretical findings, underscoring the critical role of collaboration in achieving both economic and environmental sustainability within the supply chain. This study contributes to the literature on logistics outsourcing by evaluating manufacturers' strategic decisions in selecting logistics modes and accentuates the importance of cooperation in advancing sustainable logistics practices.</jats:p>",

Five treatments were employed in our field experiment: the farmers’ conventional N fertilization rate (zero reduction, as a control) and the reduction in the farmers’ N rate by 20%, 40%, 60%, and 100%. The results showed that moderate N reduction (20–40%) enhanced crop productivity and soil fertility but did not affect soil enzyme activity. Soil bacterial and fungal community diversity were insensitive to N fertilization reduction, whereas their community structures changed significantly, with more prominent alteration in the fungal community. Functional prediction indicated that average relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased with N fertilization reduction but that of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased. Moderate N reduction (20–40%) enhanced species interactions and, thus, provided a more complex cross-kingdom microbial co-occurrence network. Both bacterial and fungal community assembly were governed by stochastic processes, and this was not altered by N fertilization reduction. Overall, the response of the soil microbiome to N fertilization reduction was greatly dependent on the reduced N proportion. The findings obtained here shed light on the importance of optimal N fertilization rate in the intensively cultivated, high-input grain production system.</jats:p>"

Based on the aluminium, zinc, copper and lead industries, the resulting waste streams are discussed and, in particular, the complex process consisting of physical, chemical and metallurgical steps is described. Their diversity, be it slags, dusts or even sludges, has a wide variety of morphologies and compositions due to the process of generation. In the past, many concepts for reprocessing were investigated, but the goal was usually only the recovery of one target element or to avoid landfilling by using it, for example, as a building material, whereby the metals contained are completely lost. If the target is the extraction of valuables, the required interdisciplinary process development must be based on an in-depth characterization to understand the behaviour of metals and trace elements in possible extraction steps and also to develop suitable strategies for influencing the behaviour of target elements with the aim of extraction. This starts with an in-depth comprehension of the formation process, which is the subject of this article and has a direct influence on the composition and morphology of the materials, thus forming the basis for understanding the behaviour in potential recycling processes. Furthermore, typical compositions of the residual material streams, sources and, if available, quantities are shown and, in summary, an attempt is made to evaluate the materials in a SWOT analysis and to address the challenges in developing extraction steps for processing. While mine tailings are mostly found outside of Europe, the potential of the residual materials from metallurgy is local due to the processing of the concentrates in Europe. This leads to several potential advantages in a possible reprocessing, such as no or shorter transport routes, which is linked to lower quantity of emissions, defined volume and known composition, no geopolitical risk, conservation of primary resources, and increasing Europe’s sustainability through a more comprehensive use of the raw materials.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This article is part of the discussion meeting issue ‘Sustainable metals: science and systems’.</jats:p>",

Yet, in rapidly expanding African cities, they remain unobtainable for many and a barrier to the health and wellbeing of millions of people. In Freetown, Sierra Leone, a city that has experienced rapid in-migration in recent decades, urban food security has become a major concern. One critical response has been the proliferation of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) to support food security and income generation for the poor. However, UPA sites are often exposed to a range of pollutants. This paper examines the environmental health status of three different UPA sites in Freetown. Qualitative and quantitative data show heavy metal concentrations that significantly exceed regulatory limits in crop leaves (sweet potato) and arable soil. Soaring readings of faecal coliform bacteria were observed in water used for irrigation, corroborating health-related findings which demonstrate a direct relationship between water supply, handwashing and diarrhoea. Elevated nutrient concentrations were also observed in surface water during the rainy season. Ultimately, crops were revealed to be hyperaccumulators for environmental contaminants, highlighting both the challenges and potential for nature-based solutions to strengthen food security and public health at UPA sites in Freetown and other growing cities.</jats:p>",

It has been established that with an increase in the supply of mobile phosphorus, the influence of negative weather factors on the grain yield of spring wheat decreases in the conditions of the Amur region. The weather conditions during the spring wheat growing season were difficult for plant growth and development. The exception is 2020, in which precipitation and heat were more evenly distributed throughout the growing season of the crop. Using the pair correlation method, it was revealed that with an increase in the supply of mobile phosphorus to crops, the relationship between yield and weather factors became weaker, which determines the leveling effect of phosphorus fertilizers on unfavorable weather conditions. The sum of precipitation (r = 0.57...0.45) and hydrothermal coefficient (r = 0.54...0.37) had a positive effect on the formation of wheat yield in the tillering-booting stage, regardless of the phosphorus level. When conducting multiple regression analysis in the “yield-total precipitation” and “yield-total temperature” models, it was found that the association of these indicators during the tillering-booting stage period was strong for all phosphate levels, however, a weakening of the relationship from low to high degree was noted supply of P2O5. The share of the sum of temperatures and precipitation was significantly higher in the unfertilized variant (69 and 63%, respectively). With an increase in the level of mobile phosphates in the soil, the share of weather factors decreased.</jats:p>"

The performance of drinking water treatment technologies was evaluated with bioassays. CALUX bioassays and the Ames fluctuation bioassay for mutagenicity were used to analyze the responses of raw feed water with and without a spiking mixture of organic contaminants in different pilot-scale water treatment trains applying advanced oxidation processes, reverse osmosis and filtration with activated carbon for the preparation of drinking water. In general, CALUX responses in the spiked feed water were in the same range as in the unspiked feed water, indicating that spiking did not significantly elevate the activity measured in the feed water. This observation was in line with a calculation of the combined additive behavior of the spiking mixture using bioactivities of the spiked chemicals in analog bioassays from ToxCast. This calculation gave no indication of a measurable response in the bioassays to be expected by the spiking, except for oxidative stress. Responses in the Ames fluctuation assay in most feed water were in some cases increased by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and mostly removed by active concentrations. The bioassay responses demonstrate the removal of emerging chemicals with different mechanisms of action by different water treatment technologies.</jats:p>",

We propose a unified definition of reliable water supply for Utah’s public water suppliers that can also be used elsewhere. We derive our definition from a two-part qualitative analysis: (1) an extensive review of existing definitions in industry and academia and (2) semi-structured interviews with managers of six diverse Utah water utilities. We propose that water supply be defined by three overlapping components—hydrology, infrastructure, and governance—and that reliability be defined by the capacity of the limiting component. The results from the qualitative analysis support our definition and further indicate that a definition is necessary to precede quantitative evaluations, set policy, and provide consistency to water resources management.</jats:p>"

The WSS of Varaždin County is a complex network involving three groundwater sources: Bartolovec and Vinokovščak wellfields (alluvial aquifers) and Bela karstic spring. To achieve a comprehensive characterization of WSSs, routine laboratory data was integrated with stable isotopes and geochemical modeling. Within this study, all measured parameters remain below the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), ensuring water safety for human consumption. The Piper diagram identified variations in water sources based on their chemical composition, providing a simplified overview of mixing patterns within WSSs. Among the modeling approaches, inverse modeling (IM) was found to be more reliable than forward modeling (FM) and mass balance modeling (MB). Despite the limited capacity of δ18O to provide accurate mixing results, it was revealed that the reservoir water was in equilibrium with the air (no evaporation effects), indicating well-sealed reservoirs. Mixing modeling showed that the western, southwestern, and northern parts of the WSS mixed all three sources, whereas the eastern and southeastern areas primarily relied on the deeper aquifer of the Bartolovec source, indicating potential vulnerability. Strict validation criteria ensured the reliability of results, demonstrating the effectiveness and applicability of geochemical modeling in water security management plans.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of global carbon emission reduction (CER) targets and slowing economic growth, it is imperative for suppliers to make informed choices regarding CER and financing strategies. However, limited research has explored the impact of financing strategies on CER. This paper develops a supply chain model that includes a supplier, a manufacturer, an E-commerce platform (E-C platform), and consumers with a preference for low-carbon products. The supplier sets the wholesale price, while the manufacturer controls both the production quantity and the unit amount of CER. We examine whether the manufacturer will invest in CER with sufficient capital or under various financing scenarios, namely (1) traditional production with sufficient capital (Scenario ST); (2) CER implementation with sufficient capital (Scenario SG); (3) CER implementation with E-C platform financing (Scenario EG); (4) CER implementation with bank financing (Scenario BG). Through comparative analysis, the analysis reveals that, regardless of the financing method chosen, the supplier’s profit and the manufacturer’s production quantity increase when the manufacturer invests in CER technology innovation compared to the traditional scenario. Furthermore, in terms of the manufacturer’s profit, if the service cost of bank financing exceeds a certain threshold, the manufacturer should either seek financing from the E-C platform or abandon the CER investment. Additionally, with respect to CER outcomes, Scenario BG outperforms Scenario EG. These findings provide a theoretical foundation and decision-making support for supply chain participants when addressing carbon reduction and financing strategy decisions.</jats:p>"

A systematic analysis of how military settlements allocated resources based on external threats and geo-strategic needs is essential to understanding their settlements defense systems. However, this aspect has been relatively under-explored in existing research. Therefore, a resource allocation assessment model for Great Wall military settlements during the Cold Weapon era is established to facilitate a more scientific analysis and quantitative assessment of Military Defense Capabilities(MDC) and Military Requirements(MR). This study employs a combined Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach to determine the weight of each indicator for both military defense capability and military requirement. Spatial clustering using K-means is conducted to visualize the distribution of these strengths and weaknesses. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model links military requirements with defense capabilities, assessing the relationship between settlement locations and historical battle sites. Residual analysis is utilized to identify areas of resource over-allocation or under-allocation. The study reveals that the regional differences in military defense capabilities and requirements within the Zhenbao Town area during the Ming Dynasty correspond closely with the locations of frequent conflicts. This finding suggests that the distribution of defensive capabilities were strengthened in areas with challenging terrain, while the effectiveness and allocation of defense capabilities were determined by logistical support and transportation conditions. This study enhances our understanding of historical military strategies from a historical geography perspective and offers innovative insights for analyzing Great Wall settlement, moving beyond mere sensory intuition and historical experience.</jats:p>"

Findings reveal that Uganda’s consumer protection law falls short and even the available laws do not protect consumers extensively. This Act also does not cater for any redress system for consumer disputes, rights, and remedies of a consumer, and it is upon such a critical analysis that one can conclude that there is an urgent need to protect consumers in Uganda, mainly by setting up a redress system for consumer dispute resolution. More legislation should be enacted and passed, and consumer rights should be enforced since they are intrinsic to any democratic state, and this will lead to economic development. In light of the observations, the article recommends that the government of Uganda amend the law to include the e-commerce provisions that protect consumers on digitally procured products, both intangible and tangible, which give clear and full protection to consumers against fault-sold digital content products. More so, the government of Uganda should amend the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act to clearly define “goods” to also expressly cover digital products and clearly stipulate the mode of digital transactions since such goods are different from ordinary goods that the consumer is able to examine before purchasing them.

It was discovered that both direct and indirect hypotheses supported the findings of the study. The results indicate that Ghanaian manufacturing firms have made progress in implementing supply chain security measures. The findings revealed that the adoption of comprehensive supply chain security practices is positively associated with improved performance metrics, including reduced inventory losses and damages, faster order fulfillment and delivery times, lower costs related to security incidents, and enhanced brand reputation and customer trust. Policymakers can leverage these insights to develop support programs aimed at strengthening the security capabilities of manufacturing firms, ensuring they are equipped to compete effectively in both local and global markets, improving security performance, and reducing the likelihood and impact of supply chain disruptions.

There has been substantial investment across Africa to improve access to piped water supply in urban areas of Africa, but the evidence on which approaches are most effective is sparse. We undertook a scoping review to identify studies in the published and grey literature that provide evidence on projects to improve access to piped water supply in urban areas of Africa. Available evidence is sparse and concentrated in a small number of countries. While progress has been made to increase access to piped water supply, benefits to low-income populations have been lower than for high-income groups. More projects focused on physical expansion of infrastructure rather than use of financial and economic measures, despite evidence of financial barriers being important in restricting access. There was mixed evidence that expansion of services improved service quality with several instances of deteriorating services found. The narrow literature base identified in this review highlights the urgent need for rigorous studies of effective approaches, which is essential to build upon successful interventions that hold the most promise for the future.</jats:p>",

Although the positive effects of cutting fluid have been confirmed in many studies, the relevant cutting fluid parameters such as nozzle cross-section area and supply pressure, as well as their influence on the thermo-mechanical loads of the cutting tool, have been insufficiently investigated. This study investigates the effects of cutting fluid supply conditions on tool loads during continuous and interrupted orthogonal cutting processes. The research specifically addresses the impact of nozzle geometry and fluid jet orientation on the thermo-mechanical loads on the cutting tool, which have been underexplored in previous studies. A prototype tool holder, designed and additively manufactured for this purpose, allows for variations in nozzle geometry and jet orientation. Experiments were conducted under varying cutting parameters, nozzle geometries, and fluid pressures, with tool temperature being monitored through an embedded thermocouple. The results show that nozzle geometry significantly affects chip shape, which directly affects cooling efficiency and, consequently, tool temperature. The study also uses an inversely calibrated analytical model to analyze the tool temperature distribution, which shows that the highest temperatures occur in the tool-chip contact area, while temperatures outside this area decrease rapidly. In addition, the percentage of heat conducted into the tool decreases with increasing Péclet number, which is consistent in both continuous and interrupted cutting scenarios. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how cutting fluid nozzle design affects tool performance and establish a foundation for model-based temperature analysis in machining processes.</jats:p>",

The introduction of AI managers poses new challenges to supply chain management, and how to manage AI managers warrants further exploration. We investigate the optimal AI manager fine‐tuning strategies in a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two competing retailers, each operated by an AI manager in the face of an uncertain market shock. We establish the manufacturer–retailer AI manager fine‐tuning game, where the manufacturer and two retailers endogenously decide whether to fine‐tune their AI managers' logic. The market may suffer an uncertain shock, and once the shock occurs, the AI managers' logic settings and price decisions can be quickly adjusted. We find that the manufacturer would never fine‐tune the AI manager, while the retailers may fine‐tune their AI managers to programmed optimism. Notably, AI manager's fine‐tunability only benefits the retailers and harms the manufacturer, entire supply chain, consumers, and social welfare. To make AI manager's fine‐tunability beneficial to all participants, that is, to reach a win–win–win situation, we design two incentive mechanisms, retailer pessimism incentive mechanism and mutual pessimism incentive mechanism (MPIM), where MPIM can lead to the win–win–win situation. Further, we endogenize the compensation, endogenous retailer pessimism compensation and endogenous mutual pessimism compensation, both achieving the win–win–win outcome. We also make several extensions and provide suggestions for supply chain firms to fine‐tune their AI managers' logic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The forensic application of stable oxygen isotope data from human tissues depends on naturally occurring isotopic variation in drinking water across geographic areas. One factor which complicates interpretation of forensic data is local variability: if a wide range of drinking water values is in a small geographic region it may be difficult to identify or rule out that region as a location of origin. We examine data from community collection programs documenting tap water isotope variation within 30 cities\\developed areas throughout the United States. Isotopic variation within individual developed areas ranged widely, from essentially nil to greater than 9‰ (δ<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O interdecile range). Many (14/30) of the study areas exhibited multi-modal isotope distributions, even in cases where the isotopic range was very small (e.g., &lt;2.0‰), suggesting that the use of multiple, isotopically different sources was common. Most variation was attributed to differences in the source-region altitude or degree of evaporation for different water sources, and we observe limited variation in areas where contrasts in these variables are small. Variation tended to be largest in cities across the western USA. We explored correlations between the magnitude of local isotopic variation and climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic variables. We found that higher levels of variation occurred at sites where local water resources were likely to be more isotopically heterogeneous and in lower supply, consistent with the development of supply systems in these areas that access diverse and isotopically heterogeneous water resources. We also found that variation was positively correlated with larger developed areas, suggesting that pressures related to city growth may affect the degree to which infrastructure tapping diverse water resources is developed. Collectively, our results suggest that the influence of local tap water isotope heterogeneity on the precision of forensic geolocation is systematic and somewhat predictable, information to be factored into future applications.</jats:p>"

A whole system approach in five improvement scenarios including different packaging materials and precision farming encompasses the supply chain from farm to fork and cradle to gate. The largest impact on SRP farming is caused by the use of diesel oil, the excessive use of chemical fertilizers, and the use of electricity. In SRP farming step, the CEnC is mainly caused by 86.5% fertilizer and 11% diesel usage. Hotspot impact categories were determined as abiotic (fossil) depletion potential, global warming potential, and human toxicity potential. The base case scenario has the greatest values for CEnC, CExC, and CCO₂C and impact assessment results. A CEnC value reduction of 48.6%, 50%, and 30% in the factory processing, packaging‐transportation step and whole process, respectively, is observed when the biodiesel scenario is performed. With a 40% reduction in global warming potential value, the combination of polyethylene terephthalate packaging, biodiesel, and precision farming scenario yielded the best results for each impact category analyzed in this study.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increasing demands of urban populations, achieving a balance between the supply and demand in the spatial allocation of urban green park spaces (UGSs) is essential for effective urban planning and improving residents’ quality of life. The study of UGS supply and demand balance has become a research hotspot. However, existing studies of UGS supply and demand balance rarely simultaneously improve the supply side, demand side, and transportation methods that connect the two, nor do they conduct a comprehensive, multi-dimensional supply and demand evaluation. Therefore, this study evaluates the accessibility of UGS within Hefei’s built-up areas, focusing on age-specific demands for UGS and incorporating various travel modes, including walking, cycling, driving, and public transportation. An improved two-step floating-catchment area (2SFCA) method is applied to evaluate the accessibility of UGS in Hefei’s built-up areas. This evaluation combines assessments using the Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve, location entropy, and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, utilizing the ArcGIS 10.8 and GeoDa 2.1 platforms. Together, these methods enable a supply–demand balance analysis of UGSs to identify areas needing improvement and propose corresponding strategies. The research results indicate the following: (1) from a regional perspective, there are significant disparities in the accessibility of UGS within Hefei’s urban center, with the old city showing more imbalance than the new city. Areas with high demand and low supply are primarily concentrated in the old city, which require future improvement; (2) in terms of travel modes, higher-speed travel (such as driving) offers better and more equitable accessibility compared to slower modes (such as walking), highlighting transportation as a critical factor influencing accessibility; (3) regarding population demand, there is an overall balance in the supply of UGS, with local imbalances observed in the needs of residents across different age groups. Due to the high specific demand for UGS among older people and children, the supply and demand levels in these two age groups are more consistent. This study offers valuable insights for achieving the balanced, efficient, and sustainable development of the social benefits of UGS.</jats:p>"

To overcome these issues, it was essential to improve the coordination and communication methods among all parties involved, since this was key to maximising the efficiency of supply chains. This study employed a holistic strategy to reduce risks, enhance resilience, and take advantage of opportunities in the face of currency changes. Recent research highlights the crucial importance of cooperation and communication in optimising supply chains, especially in locations that are susceptible to currency depreciation. Efficient cooperation among stakeholders was crucial for actively tackling difficulties that arose from currency depreciation. Clear and open communication promotes confidence, simplifies the exchange of information, and allows stakeholders to synchronise their expectations and priorities. Collaboration and communication played a particularly important role in South Eastern Nigeria, which was known for its varied socioeconomic and political factors. This article examined the difficulties and advantages linked to the depreciation of currency in South Eastern Nigeria. It suggests a complete method to improve cooperation and communication techniques for optimising the supply chain. This article offered practical advice for firms in the area to successfully and sustainably overcome problems posed by currency depreciation. These recommendations were based on insights from current research and real-world experiences.\n\nKeywords: Currency depreciation, Teamwork, communication, Supply chain optimisation, South Eastern Nigeria.</jats:p>"

This study involved the local communities and their traditional knowledge at all stages: planning, design, implementation, operation, maintenance, and monitoring. The solar distillers produced a total 9652 L of water, with average yields of 2.8 L m2 day−1 and 1.2 L m2 day−1 in the villages of Nueva Venecia and Buenavista, respectively. Likewise, the treatment plants reached a total water production of 790,000 L. Both methods produced water following the quality standards for human consumption.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Social influenced emotions of pride and guilt have been identified by the environmental psychology (EP) literature as crucial drivers impacting recycling behavior, but they have mostly been overlooked in operations management (OM) research. In contrast, EP studies often ignore firms’ operational decisions. We analyze the impacts of both social influence and firms’ operational decisions to provide a comprehensive understanding of consumers’ recycling behaviors, which is essential for realizing remanufacturing’s full potential. Methodology/results: We consider a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer selling a single product to a consumer community. Consumers’ recycling behavior depends on both the recycling reward offered by the manufacturer, as well as intrinsic and socially influenced pride (guilt) from recycling (not recycling). We develop an evolutionary game to model consumers’ recycling behavior and characterize the resulting equilibrium recycling rate, which is then integrated into the manufacturer’s decision problem. We characterize the manufacturer’s optimal strategy and the equilibrium recycling rate in four distinct regions defined by both the product’s overall difficulty of remanufacturing and the underlying strengths of consumers’ socially influenced pride and guilt. We show that in settings where the product has a moderately high difficulty of remanufacturing and consumers have stronger socially influenced pride than guilt, the manufacturer optimally induces an interior recycling rate. In such scenarios, there exist win-win pathways in using social influence–based interventions to increase both the manufacturer’s profit and the recycling rate. However, misalignment may occur when consumers substantially care for the product’s recyclability. Managerial implications: This study bridges sustainable OM and EP literature by analyzing how consumers’ socially influenced emotions of pride and guilt affect a manufacturer’s optimal decisions, profits, and the resulting recycling rate. We provide important insights for designing effective and efficient social influence–based interventions to improve recycling rates. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: W.

The core of the review involves a comprehensive analysis of documented implementations of blockchain in various industries, assessing their impact on enhancing transparency, reducing fraud, and improving overall supply chain integrity. We critically examine case studies and existing research to identify patterns of success and common challenges faced by organizations adopting blockchain solutions. Findings highlight that blockchain technology not only supports better traceability and authentication processes but also fosters a more transparent environment for transactions, significantly deterring the proliferation of counterfeit goods. Additionally, the review points out the technological and organizational hurdles in adopting blockchain, such as the need for standardization and the resistance to change in legacy systems. The paper concludes that blockchain technology holds substantial promise for addressing critical issues in supply chain management. However, achieving its full potential requires overcoming significant adoption challenges and fostering collaborative efforts for standardization across industries. This review calls for ongoing research into scalable blockchain applications and strategic partnerships to drive the technology's integration into mainstream supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

Despite the increase in supply chain channel management conflict literature and the development of the nation’s agricultural industry, there seem to be few empirical research works on supply chain channel conflict management as they relate to marketing performance of agricultural products firms. Particularly, it appears like only few studies have taken into consideration the performance improvement of supply chain channel conflict management on marketing efficacy within the agricultural industry in Nigeria. The lack of literature by scholars with respect to supply chain channel conflict management in the context of Nigerian agricultural industry to resolve conflict among channel members could probably be the root cause of ineffective marketing performance of agricultural products’ firms. On the basis of this limitation, the researchers therefore sought to discuss this lacuna, thereby bridging the acknowledged gap. Based on the objective of the study, a systematic survey was utilized to obtain information from 276 management staff of agricultural product enterprises. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The results demonstrated that supply chain channel conflict management has a significant relationship with marketing performance of agricultural products firms. It was concluded that supply chain managers should develop adequate supply chain channel conflict management techniques in order to enhance their marketing performance.</jats:p>"

In the current world where the global supply chains are continuing to expand and integrate, it has been noted that there is need to protect real time information flows and enhance the integrity and traceability of information. Using Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable structure together with IoT’s data-collection aspect, this research explores ways in which supply chain processes could benefit from these technologies while minimizing the risks posed by data theft, forgery, and disruptions. The research employs published data analysis and a case study, encompassing cross-industry benchmarks, research, and empirical evaluation of Blockchain-IoT applications in industries. Survey data was obtained from recent implementations in industries including pharmaceutical, F&amp;B and logistics. Quantitative tools and techniques were applied to evaluate the integrity and the reliability of Blockchain-IoT systems operations. Some insights discovered reveals that the integration between Blockchain and IoT fosters better real-time monitoring, minimizes counterfeiting and promotes better traceability of an average of 40% based on observed instances. Literature is advanced in this paper by presenting grounded data on Blockchain and IoT’s ability to maintain enduring and reliable supply chain security. The research implies that when the technologies are well deployed, they act as a key driver in facilitating secure and efficient supply chain. The presented research provides guidance on the adaptation of Blockchain and IoT to enhance the stability of the supply chain; it maps a tactical plan that industry participants can follow to achieve sustainable, secure supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

There are two phases to this study: mathematical modeling and model solution using precise techniques. In the first step, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed. This model is an improvement of an existing supply chain model. Further, our suggested strategy is verified by using numerical data based on three criteria and four suppliers. The goals of the proposed model are to maximize supply chain reliability, economic profit, and social responsibilities by taking suppliers’ priorities into account. Modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, the constraints on the problem include budget, emission, demand, allocation, facility, and shipping capacity. Power symmetry and information symmetry are incorporated in order to perform symmetric analysis. The weighted sum method (WSM) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are the two methods used in the second step of solving the model to identify the best supplier.

Given the rising demand for electric motors across various sectors, effective end-of-life management has become critical for enhancing sustainability. The primary objective of the proposed framework is to create a holistic approach that improves motor sustainability by addressing all stages of the product life cycle, from material sourcing and production to utilization and end-of-life management. The study employs a case study methodology, focusing on an electric motor company, to validate the framework’s applicability and effectiveness. Key findings reveal that emphasizing motor recovery significantly prolongs product lifecycles, reducing waste and conserving resources. The framework’s adaptability suggests its potential application across various business contexts, though it requires customization to fit specific production, logistics, and resource allocation needs. Recommendations include further research to refine the framework for other industries and the potential for policy changes that support circular economy practices. The article provides practical insights into overcoming barriers to CE adoption, emphasizing the need for strategic management capabilities, policy support, and industry-specific customization. This comprehensive approach not only addresses current sustainability challenges within the electric motor industry but also serves as a model for other sectors seeking to implement circular economy principles.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the influence of global trade dynamics on food pricing and supply chain resilience, focusing on the development of a quantitative model that examines the relationships between trade policies, economic indicators, and trade volumes. As fluctuations in trade policies—such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies—directly impact food prices and market stability, this model provides a structured framework for assessing these variables’ interdependencies. By integrating data on trade flows, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, the model quantifies the effects of protective and liberalized trade measures on both local and international food markets. This approach allows for identifying trends in pricing volatility linked to policy shifts, thereby offering insights into areas vulnerable to trade disruptions and external economic shocks. The resilience of the food supply chain is measured by evaluating metrics such as delivery times, supplier diversity, and inventory levels across regions affected by trade policy changes. The findings emphasize that trade barriers can result in price spikes, delays, and supply shortages, while open trade policies generally support market flexibility and pricing stability. Additionally, the model incorporates economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment rates, which correlate with food demand and purchasing power, thereby further influencing price and supply chain stability. Future research could leverage this model to develop adaptive strategies that strengthen supply chain resilience under various global trade conditions. Suggested adaptations include diversifying suppliers, increasing inventory buffers, and enhancing predictive analytics for better demand forecasting. By integrating these adaptive measures, stakeholders can mitigate adverse effects on food accessibility and affordability in both developed and emerging economies. This research contributes to the literature on food security, highlighting the need for resilient trade policies and supply chain strategies in an increasingly interconnected global economy.</jats:p>"

However, due to limitations in configuration, the continuous power supply capacity of existing electrical vehicles (EVs) is insufficient, making it difficult to meet the needs of energy transfer and flow regulation in post-disaster distribution networks. Therefore, in this study, we comprehensively considered the energy time-shift characteristics of EVs and the flexible control function of soft open points (SOPs), integrated their advantages, and designed an emergency vehicle with SOP (EV-SOP) and its management strategy for distribution network line faults. Firstly, we present the EV-SOP architecture and its mathematical model. Then, aiming to minimize the economic losses caused by power loss during line faults, an EV-SOP emergency management strategy based on data collection, scheduling judgment, and optimal modeling techniques is proposed. Finally, by taking the case study of an IEEE33-node distribution network with contact switches as an example, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the EV-SOP and its emergency management strategy compared with traditional energy storage emergency vehicles.</jats:p>"

Timely identification and localization of these faults are crucial for ensuring the stable operation of electric locomotives and the safety of passengers. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for grounding faults (GFs) that integrates mechanistic insights with data-driven feature extraction. Firstly, this paper analyzes the mechanisms of grounding faults and summarizes the characteristics of their time–frequency distribution. Then, a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to derive a frequency signature vector enabling classification into three principal categories. Concurrently, a time series sliding window approach is applied to extract time domain indicators for further subdivision of fault types. Finally, a time–frequency hybrid-driven diagnostic model framework is constructed by integrating the frequency distribution with the spatiotemporal map, and validation is conducted using an experimental platform that replicates system fault scenarios with a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and executes the real-time diagnostic frameworks on a DSP diagnostic board card. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect and accurately locate grounding faults in real time.</jats:p>"

In the scenario of demand information asymmetry, we use the contrasting signals game model to examine the interaction effect of recycler information distortion on the remanufacturer’s belief criterion of recycling market scale and its response to the choice of whether or not to exploit the online channel. Recyclers attempt to distort recycling quantity to induce remanufacturers to make incorrect judgments about the recycling market scale and determine incorrect recycling prices. The discrepancy in recycling prices is then profited by recyclers. The study discovered that expanding online channels in a small market would result in costly signal behaviors by recyclers, such as downward distortion of the actual recycling quantity. This downward information distortion exacerbates the dual marginalization. In contrast to the “win–win” situation found in the online channel under information symmetry, the invasion of an online channel under information asymmetry may result in “double losses”. Then we investigate the impact of other practical factors on channel expansion and information-sharing strategy. These conclusions can improve the efficiency of e-waste recycling and promote the process of waste recycling.</jats:p>",

Adopting a structured approach, we provide a roadmap for supply chain network evolution (SCNE) to systematically build a multidimensional understanding of SCNE and bridge the gap between theoretical underpinnings and research methods useful to investigate SCNE. We first broaden the scope to identify insights on dynamic network evolution from a wider array of disciplines. Next, we categorize the drivers of SCNE identified within the business literature into exogenous and endogenous factors. We then synthesize theoretical frameworks that lay the groundwork for future research directions proposed in the context of these frameworks. Finally, we outline contemporary methodologies for studying network evolution and evaluate their relevance and application to the supply chain management (SCM) field. Collectively, this roadmap paves the way for a deeper, interdisciplinary understanding of SCNE and outlines a future research agenda, providing a forward‐looking path for supply chain researchers to explore SCNE.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the continuous improvement of battery energy density and converter power density, as well as the miniaturization and lightweighting of related airborne electrical equipment, all-electric aircraft with hybrid power supply systems provide more trade-off space and possibilities for the design of future aircraft. It is indispensable to search for a more valuable topology and apply it to airborne power supply. This paper proposes an airborne high-gain unidirectional DC-DC converter suitable for between low-voltage unit and high-voltage bus, which consists of interleaved magnetic integrated switched coupled inductor units and improved switch capacitor units. This paper first analyzes the steady-state operating characteristics under different modes; the new topology has higher voltage gain and lower stress. Secondly, in response to the challenges of high efficiency and high power density, we propose a magnetic integration design method and comprehensive experimental scheme based on the EIE-type magnetic core structure. This successfully integrates multiple discrete inductors into a single magnetic core. Furthermore, based on the comprehensive consideration of steady-state, transient performance and power density, the general design criteria for a high-gain switched coupled inductor are summarized through the equivalent mathematical model of reverse flux coupling. Additionally, by adjusting the coupling coefficient, the converter can achieve zero-voltage switching under light load conditions, demonstrating versatility and scalability and better meeting the application requirements of electric aircraft. The proposed prototype can provide voltage gain in the range of 12–22 times the input voltage gain by varying the input voltage from a 12–24 V fuel cell. The comprehensive performance of the converter, including steady-state, transient, and efficiency, was tested under D &lt; 0.5 and D &gt; 0.5. The experimental results show that the proposed converter possesses advantages such as high gain and low stress, a high dynamic response and low ripple, and high efficiency and high power density, which can provide a more advantageous DC-DC converter solution for airborne hybrid power supply systems.</jats:p>"

Follow-up computed tomography (CT) revealed an irregular nodular tumor measuring 13 mm in the pancreatic head. The patient was diagnosed with resectable pancreatic head cancer without lymph node metastasis (cT1cN0M0, cStageIA) according to the Union for International Cancer Control, 8th edition. As a standard pancreatic cancer treatment, two courses of preoperative chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus S-1 were administered. CT after preoperative chemotherapy identified no significant changes in tumor size but revealed SMA stenosis due to atherosclerosis. Blood flow to the left-sided colon was supplied from the middle colic artery via the SMA because of the past sigmoidectomy with inferior mesenteric artery detachment. Therefore, SMA stent placement was performed 1 day preoperatively. Subsequently, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) was performed, preserving the remnant stomach with the right gastroepiploic (RGE) artery and vein. After resection, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging confirmed a good blood supply to the remnant stomach. The operation time was 467 min, and the blood lost was 442 mL. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as moderate adenocarcinoma and pT1cN0M0, Stage IA. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 23. S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy was administered on postoperative day 63.

To meet the needs of SIMO converter design in advanced processes, this paper first proposes a SIMO converter with an adaptive power supply buffer (APSB) and voltage‐limiting techniques in 22‐nm CMOS. The proposed APSB technology ensures that the driving voltage of the power stage remains unchanged under the changing power supply, solving the breakdown problem caused by low MOSFET withstand voltage and simplifying the circuit design of the power stage.

The proposed SIMO is designed and validated under a 22‐nm CMOS process. The input power supply range is 2.8–5 V, and the three output voltages are 0.8, 1, and 1.8 V, respectively. The maximum load for each output voltage is 250 mA. The SIMO system achieves a peak efficiency of 92.2% over the full load range.</jats:p>"

Blockchain Technology (BCT) has been introduced to tackle the current challenges in the ASC, due to its ability to improve food security, lower waste, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, this research is conducted to identify the enablers of BCT implementation for NZSs in the Indian ASC. We use an integrated “TISM‐Grey‐DEMATEL‐Fuzzy MICMAC\" approach to stimulate identified enablers. TISM results indicate that Transparency and Traceability are the most important enablers that drive other enablers and are placed at the bottom of the model. Grey‐DEMATEL results indicate that traceability is the most important cause enabler which drives other enablers and is classified into independent enablers based on MICMAC clustering. The interaction between enablers will support the ASC specialist in persuading firms to implement BCT in their supply chains to incorporate NZSs.

For this, 272 groundwater samples were collected during the pre- and post-monsoon periods in 2022. Several indices, including SAR, PI, Na%, KR, magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), and IWQI were derived. The results of SAR, Na%, and KR values indicate that the groundwater is generally suitable for irrigation. On the other hand, PI and MAR exceeded the established limits, primarily showing issues related to salinity and magnesium content in the groundwater. Furthermore, according to the IWQI classification, 47.06 and 25% of the total collected samples fell under the ‘severe restriction for irrigation’ category during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods, respectively. Spatial variation maps indicate that water quality in the western portion of the study area is unsuitable for irrigation during both periods. Three ML algorithms, namely RF, SVM, and XGBoost were integrated and validated to predict the IWQI. The results revealed that the XGBoost with random search achieves the best prediction performances. The approaches established in this study have been confirmed to be cost-effective and feasible for groundwater quality, using hydrochemical parameters as input variables, and highly beneficial for water resource planning and management.</jats:p>",

To address these issues, this research proposes a mixed reality (MR) inspection method that integrates multi-source information, combining building information modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), monitoring data, and numerical simulation technologies. This approach aims to achieve in situ visualization and real-time computational capabilities.

Using an empirical survey of Vietnamese developing nation logistics companies, this study applied the PLS-SEM approach for data analysis including assessments of mediation and moderation. The sample comprised 272 valid replies from a structured survey aimed at managerial personnel. The findings demonstrate that the competencies of logistics managers substantially improve individual performance, hence mediating the favorable correlation between management competencies and organizational logistics performance. The results indicate that both education and experience enhance these linkages at both individual and organizational levels. This study advances the application of RBV theory by highlighting human capital as an essential, distinctive resource that, when augmented by education and experience, enhances organizational performance. Nevertheless, this study’s shortcomings encompass a concentration on the Vietnamese logistics sector, indicating the need for future research across various businesses and geographical settings. These observations highlight the necessity for specialized education and training programs to develop managerial competencies for enduring organizational effectiveness.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, today, all organizations are striving to preserve the environment and improve the climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study presents a bi-objective mathematical model for a three-level supply chain. The primary objective of the model is to maximize profit, while the secondary objective is to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting this model, companies can strive towards achieving their business goals while simultaneously contributing to a sustainable future. Numerical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the developed model, and a case study in a soap factory is presented to calculate the optimal production quantities and determine the best price to increase demand while achieving profit. Finally, by conducting sensitivity analysis, optimal strategic decisions and useful management insights have been identified. According to the results and examination of the experiments, expanding the capacity and production rate, especially when the market potential for buying products is higher, fulfills the main goals. Also, in times of market recession, the variety of quality and price of products will lead to more profit.</jats:p>",

Because the flows of EVs in the proposed model are represented in a path-based manner, we apply a column generation-based algorithm to avoid enumerating all of the possible paths. The contributions of this study are that 1) we consider both pre-trip charging and charging during a trip, and that 2) we focus on the difference in the impact of power supply constraints on vehicles that need to charge during a trip and those that do not. The proposed model is applied to a hypothetical network. As a result, we confirmed that 1) while the share of EVs in the middle distance tends to be higher, the share of EVs in the short and long distances tends to be lower, and that 2) in case of inadequate power supply, the share of EVs in the short and middle distances decreases significantly, whereas the share of EVs remains almost unchanged in long OD.</jats:p>",

This study seeks to delineate the spatiotemporal distribution and circulation patterns of supply and demand for staple crops, identify the major producing and consuming zones in China, and investigate the drivers underpinning efficient coordination of food supply and demand. Results indicate that between 2000 and 2020, China's food supply and demand expanded by 73.8% and 36.62%, respectively, achieving a supply surplus. However, the most significant threats to supply–demand coordination are the extensive use of feed and industrial crops, compounded by the import vulnerabilities arising from global supply chain uncertainties. In terms of major producing and consuming zones, Northeast China plays a vital role in the national food supply, contributing 71% of domestic soybeans, 55% of its maize, and 34% of its rice. Climatic conditions and self‐sufficiency rates are key determinants of provincial supply and demand for staple crops. Provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong represent balanced producing–consuming zones for these staple crops. To enhance food supply–demand coordination, tailored and adaptive measures for different provinces are imperative. This study offers theoretical insights to understand the trends of food supply and demand and further contributes to adaptive strategies to address climate change for sustainable food systems.</jats:p>",

(2003). The articles were collected from the Science Direct, Web of Science and Scopus databases, using search strings previously defined in the research protocol.\n \nResults and Discussion: The research identified 65 relevant articles, highlighting the importance of EPR in assigning responsibility for CSR. Approximately 37% of the articles did not mention specific waste, while almost 40% focused on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), highlighting the relevance of this topic\n \nResearch Implications: Offered insights into the attribution of responsibilities in CSR and the application of EPR. In waste management, the results may influence how stakeholders share responsibilities, especially for WEEE. Theoretically, the research revealed gaps on EPR, especially in emerging economies. These findings can guide more effective public policies and strategies for waste management and sustainable practices.\n \nOriginality/Value: Contributes to the literature by refining the extraction parameters in the context of CSR responsibility, highlighting an academic gap on the complexity of EPR. The originality lies in the critical analysis of terminology, highlighting the growing relevance of EPR in WEEE management, reflecting global interest, especially in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the three main categories of resilience strategies are integrated to mitigate the severe impacts of disruption. In order to solve the model, lexicographic goal programming is applied for small-scale problems, and NSGA-II is utilized for large-scale problems. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by implementing it in a real case study during the COVID-19 situation. Also, a set of sensitivity analyses is conducted to validate the model and show the behavior of the objective functions.

How to maintain effective storage capacity and meet water supply requirements for a long time is one of the problems to be solved in the efficient operation of sediment-laden river reservoirs. In this paper, Dongzhuang Reservoir of Jinghe River is taken as the research object. Through the analysis of measured data and mathematical model calculation, the measured hydrological sediment and cross-section erosion and deposition in the lower reaches of Jinghe River and Weihe River are analyzed. The reservoir sediment discharge flow index which is beneficial to reduce the sediment deposition in the lower reaches of Weihe River and maintain the effective reservoir capacity for a long time is studied, and the joint regulation mode of reservoir runoff and sediment is put forward. The results show that the sediment regulation of Dongzhuang Reservoir during the sediment retention period is mainly to reduce the deposition of the lower reaches of the Weihe River, and the sediment regulation during the normal operation period of the reservoir is mainly to maintain the effective storage capacity of the reservoir for a long time. The joint regulation of the Dongzhuang Reservoir and the surrounding four storage reservoirs, such as the Ganhe Reservoir, the Xijiao Reservoir, the Longtan Reservoir, and the Helan Reservoir, can reduce the deposition of the lower reaches of the Weihe River by 11 million tons per year, increase the guarantee rate of agricultural irrigation from 30 to 50%, and increase the guarantee rate of industrial water supply from 57 to 95%. And the outflow of the reservoir meets the requirements of the ecological base flow of the river. The research results provide technical support for the optimal operation of reservoirs in sediment-laden rivers.</jats:p>"

Fat-poor renal angiomyolipoma is a relatively rare type of in renal angiomyolipoma. Its fat imaging features are not obvious, and it is easily misdiagnosed as renal cell carcinoma.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>CASE SUMMARY</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We report the case of a 41-year-old man who complained of osphyalgia. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography scans revealed that a heterogeneous mass was seen in the lower pole of the right kidney, with the size of about 53 mm × 47 mm. And showed two right renal arteries, with the mass supplied by an ectopic vessel from the abdominal aorta. Fluorescent laparoscopic blockade of the right renal heterotopic artery and partial nephrectomy was performed.

Due to the supply chain (SC) 's vulnerabilities, it requires enhanced capabilities to address these challenges. In Iran, specific economic and political issues have intensified the vulnerabilities of the PSC. Objectives: This study investigates the issues caused by the COVID-19 crisis in the PSC, identifies and characterizes these issues, and recommends appropriate courses of action to address future SC disruptions. Methods: This study is a qualitative-quantitative analysis conducted in Iran during the COVID-19 crisis. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed from July 2022 until May 2023. Semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 23 Iranian PSC specialists were conducted until saturation was reached. The qualitative phase was analyzed using MAXQDA 2021. The quantitative phase included a survey of 547 individuals working in pharmaceutical manufacturing in Iran, with the questionnaires analyzed using SPSS 26. Results: In the qualitative phase, the research identified two main themes: (1) vulnerabilities and (2) capabilities, along with 15 subthemes providing solutions to enhance the resilience of the PSC. In the quantitative phase, findings from 64 questionnaires highlighted major vulnerabilities and capabilities necessary to create a resilient SC. The median score for vulnerabilities was 5.12, while the median score for capabilities was 5.39. Conclusions: According to the questionnaire results, the quantitative findings indicate that capabilities received a higher score, suggesting that this sector of the PSC demonstrated better resilience against the pandemic. This study, with its contextual focus, mixed-method approach, comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities and capabilities, and sector-specific insights, offers a novel contribution to the understanding of SC resilience within Iranian pharmaceutical manufacturing. It also has the potential to promote further research in other sectors of the PSC.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to investigate the moderating effect of enterprise resource planning on the relationship between electronic order processing system and supply chain performance among manufacturing firms in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. The study utilized resource-based theory, explanatory research design, a census approach, and a closed ended questionnaire to collect data from 270 heads of 9 departments in 30 manufacturing firms in Uasin Gishu County. A hierarchical regression model was used to test all the study hypotheses. Results of the control variables indicate that firm age (β=.190, P = .021) significantly influences supply chain performance while firm size (β=.101, P=.223) does not. These control variables explain 4.8% of the variance in supply chain performance (R2 of .048). Furthermore, the electronic order processing system (β=.837, P=.000) and enterprise resource planning (β=0.117, P=.003) significantly influence supply chain performance. Finally, enterprise resource planning moderated the link between electronic order processing system and supply chain performance (β=.132, P =.000). This moderation model indicates an improved R2 of .579 and a change in R2 of .083 implying that all the variables in the study account for 57.9% and 8.3% of the variance in supply chain performance. This study contributes to knowledge by examining the interaction of enterprise resource planning and the study variables. The study suggests that manufacturing firms should adopt electronic order processing systems and ERP to enhance supply chain efficiency. In addition, policymakers and managers should develop policies and strategies that encourage investments in these technologies, as they have been found to influence supply chain performance and competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

A total of 108 SM-scale farmers from the three regions were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Results indicated that broiler chicken farming is dominated by women (&gt;58.3%) in that age-bracket 40 to 59 years. Most were involved in other income generating activities, including mixed farming and formal employment. The most common challenges to SM-scale broiler production were listed as the high feed costs, diseases and marketing the birds. The average flock size per batch was largest in Dar es Salaam (551.1±70.4) and smallest in Pwani (430.5±3.2), with the number of batches per producer per annum ranging between 6.6±3.2 (Morogoro) and 9.8±6.5 (Dar es Salaam). Feeds were mainly bought from retail shops. The most commonly used feed ingredients by farmers were soybean, maize bran, rice, cotton, fish, di-calcium phosphate (DCP), and premixes and were mainly brought from retail shops. Approximately half of the respondents were satisfied with feed quality, a few (&lt;5.7%) were very satisfied with the remainder either dissatisfied or undecided. Birds were sold as live or dressed carcasses, with major outlets reported to be farm gates, restaurants, and supermarkets. Most farmers sold their chickens between 5±0.6 and 6±0.8 weeks of age, weighed between 1.4±0.3 and 1.6±0.3 kg. The profit margin per bird was about TZS 1,089.9±493 in Morogoro, TZS 780±267 in Pwani and TZS 849.7±358 (US$ 1=TZS 2,298.20) in Dar es Salaam. The study findings reveal that poor broiler performance of broiler chickens in the SM-scale sector is mainly attributable to feed costs, price fluctuations and feed quality, among others.</jats:p>"

The model is analyzed under both integrated and decentralized scenarios, focusing on dynamic pricing, demand over two cycles, and corresponding profits. The study identifies the reasons for the TSC’s performance loss and proposes a revenue sharing contract mechanism to achieve coordination within the TSC. The findings indicate that an increase in the proportion of communication service utility (PCSU) leads to a higher wholesale price and lower retail prices, which is advantageous for the handset manufacturer but may not be beneficial for the telecom operator. In the decentralized scenario, the first cycle demand remains unchanged, yet the first cycle profit is higher, and the overall two cycles profit is lower compared to the integrated scenario. Enhancing PCSU can mitigate strategic consumer behavior, but it also exacerbates the gap between supply chain profits in two scenarios. Under certain conditions, the revenue sharing contract can achieve perfect coordination within the TSC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pressure differences in the envelope of a building result in leakage airflow (i.e., the unintended flow of air). This can lead to increased building heating and cooling energy, decreased thermal comfort for occupants, and the spread of moisture. To address this problem, it is necessary to know the leakage airflow in a building. Generally, the leakage airflow in a building is calculated by determining the leakage function through fan pressurization methods, such as the blower door test, and substituting the pressure difference measured by the pressure sensor. However, it is difficult to install continuous pressure sensors in an operating building. Therefore, this study proposes a method to utilize the supply and return airflow of an air conditioning system to predict the variation in the leakage airflow with changing indoor and outdoor airflow, and the efficacy of this approach was verified through experiments. The experiment measured the indoor and outdoor pressure difference of the building with a change in the speed of the supply and return fans and the opening rate of the variable air volume (VAV) damper. As a result of the experiment, the indoor–outdoor pressure difference is proportional to the difference between the indoor supply airflow and the ventilation airflow. In addition, the relationship between the pressure difference and the leakage airflow was derived through the pressurization/decompression method using an air handler, and the leakage airflow from the pressure difference generated by the operation of the air conditioning system was calculated. Lastly, the relationship between the supply and return airflow difference and the leakage airflow was derived based on the experimental results, and the leakage airflow was predicted based on the relationship.</jats:p>"

We assessed the effectiveness of microflocculation (MF) as a pretreatment to enhance treatment efficiency under complex water conditions, focusing on its role in mitigating membrane fouling. The results demonstrated the superior adaptability of UF membranes when combined with MF pretreatment, particularly in managing high turbidity during heavy rainfall, a challenge for standalone UF processes in meeting regulatory standards. This integrated approach notably improved UV254 removal efficiency from approximately 60–80%. Additionally, excitation–emission matrix spectroscopy revealed that while the MF–UF process is effective in removing dissolved organic matter (DOM), it faces limitations with high DOM concentrations in raw water. Comparative analysis of membrane flux between the two methods showed that MF pretreatment reduces filtration time, enhances flux rates, and significantly decreases membrane fouling. Finally, scanning electron microscopy further provided insights into the structure and morphology of UF membrane surface filter cakes, illustrating how MF pretreatment contributes to the sustained efficiency of membrane flux.</jats:p>",

However, the spatial heterogeneity and its theoretical and comprehensive analysis of drivers are still poorly revealed. This paper uses spatial analysis methods and micro-scale big data on land transactions to depict the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of land supply, and analyses its driving mechanisms via an endogenous–exogenous factor framework and regression models. Land supply experienced fluctuating “growth–decline–growth” trends in 2001–2021, spatially showed a large cluster in the east, a small cluster in the center and scattering in the west, with the gravity center relocating southwest, and formed a multi-core, hierarchical, circular structure of high density in core cities, density in peripheral cities and sparseness in districts. Endogenously, total land resources and road accessibility facilitated land supply, while topographic relief and urban proximity showed inhibitory effects; land supply positively correlated with land finance dependence, officials’ appraisal pressure, local government competition and officials’ corruption but negatively related with fiscal tax revenues and fiscal transparency; construction land indicators directly determined land supply, while the intensity of use control restricted the conversion of arable land and weakened land supply. Exogenously, urbanization, industrialization, capital investment, technological innovation and marketization level promoted land supply, while the substitution of human capital reduced the demand for land; economic fluctuations showed non-significant relationships with land supply. Differentiated impacts of multiple factors on land supply pattern are emphasized and should be integrated into formulating land policy and optimizing land allocation.</jats:p>"

However, if this demand is not fulfilled efficiently, it can have costly consequences, even for the biggest and best brands. Order delays and errors mean customer satisfaction suffers, and costs inflate – a combination which squeezes an organization’s bottom line. This increasing pressure on efficient order fulfillment has led to advances in warehouse design and automation. However, new research suggests that warehousing efficiencies can be increased a further 20% or more by using an algorithm that combines two datasets – demand for a product, and its affinity to be ordered with other products. This research, by Masoud Mirzaei, Nima Zaerpour and Rene de Koster, found these gains in warehouses that use automated order picking – where robots bring entire racks with products to human operatives.1 We believe that the core insight can change the game for all warehouses – regardless of the degree of automation – by reducing order-picking time, enabling faster delivery times and improving space utilization</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. Assessment of the role of stress hormones and vitamin D levels under the influence of a long-term psychotraumatic factor provides information necessary for the prevention of type 2 dia­betes mellitus (T2DM) complications. The aim of the study was to evaluate the dynamics of the stress hormone cortisol and the state of vitamin D supply in patients with T2DM during the full-scale war in Ukraine compared to the pre-war state. Materials and methods. In 2021–2024, a prospective study was conducted, which inclu­ded patients with T2DM and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥ 7 %, individuals with insulin resistance without DM and people without DM aged 19–75 years. Exclusion criteria were as follows: T2DM with severe chronic complications, HbA1c level &lt; 7 %, acute inflammatory processes, oncological diseases, body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2, intake of antidepressants, vitamin D drugs less than 2 months before the study. The average level of 25(OH)D, serum and salivary cortisol were studied every year from 2021 to 2024. Laboratory studies were performed using the methods of chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results. Patients with T2DM have a lower mean level of vitamin D and it decreases during the war, being significantly lower in 2023 and 2024 compared to 2021. In people without diabetes, the average level of vitamin D also decreases during the war years, but in general it is higher, within the limits of vitamin D insufficiency. In 2024, the average level of vitamin D in these patients increased, which indicates a more active medical intervention. When determi­ning the dynamics of serum cortisol in patients without DM in 2024, the following is observed. It was significantly higher than before the war, and in patients with DM2, it was highest in 2022 with a gradual downward trend in 2023 and a return to an increase of the average level in 2024. In this group of patients, the difference between indicators is not reliable. When determining the dynamics of salivary cortisol, we observe an increase in the average level during the war in patients without DM, and an increase in the average level during the war with a peak in 2023 in patients with insulin resistance without DM. In patients with T2DM, there is an increase in cortisol during the war, which was also present before it began. The lowest level was observed in this group of patients in 2022. Conclusions. Patients with T2DM during the war compared to the pre-war period had a stably increased level of salivary cortisol. In people without T2DM, there is a significant increase in the average level of cortisol in saliva during the war compared to the pre-war period. It is recommended to reduce the level of insulin resistance through lifestyle modification, maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D.</jats:p>"

Thus, a quantitative approach was employed, with data being collected through both online and in-person surveys from employees with sufficient knowledge of their hotel’s food products, food supply chain, and quality management practices in five-star hotels in Egypt. SPSS and WarpPLS-SEM techniques were used to analyze the research data. The findings showed that Food Supply Chain Quality Management (FSCQM) practices positively influence both FSCSP and Supply Chain Digital Integration (SCDI), with SCDI serving as a mediator in the relationship between FSCQM and FSCSP. This study is helpful for hospitality businesses in developing economies because it shows how important it is to combine digital innovation with strong quality management to improve operating efficiency and gain a competitive edge in terms of sustainability. This involves fostering a technology-driven culture that encourages creativity, innovation, transparency, and information-sharing among employees to ensure the successful integration of FSCQM practices with hotels’ digital competences.</jats:p>"

Ecological and hygienic assessment of the quality of drinking water at the centralized water supply of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region by the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals. Object and research methods. The analysis of the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals in the drinking water of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region - Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Kamianske over a 5-year period was carried out. The evaluation of the obtained data was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the current legislation on the safety and quality of drinking water in accordance with SSRN 2.2.4-171-10, international recommendations and data from the scientific literature. Results. It has been established that in the Dnipropetrovs'k region over the 5-year study period, the percentage of non-standard drinking water samples for sanitary and chemical parameters ranged from 24.4-30.6% from centralized water supply systems, and 14.5-18.4% from water supply networks. The average long-term concentrations of metals in the drinking water of the studied cities ranged from 0.0001 mg/l for mercury to 0.19 mg/l for aluminum, which meets the MAC requirements, but the maximum values of the content of individual metals in all industrial cities exceeded the hygienic regulations, most pronounced for iron, which reached 60%. At the same time, the proportion of samples exceeding the hygienic standard in some years of the study was 5-12%. In the dynamics of the study, a gradual decrease of 14.2-54.5% in the concentration of lead in drinking water in all industrial and control cities was noted (p&lt;0.05; R2= 0.51-0.78). A similar trend is also characteristic of the aluminum content in drinking water in Kryvyi Rih - a 2.5-fold decrease (p&lt;0.001; R2=0.79) during the study period. At the same time, a significant increase in the content of a number of trace elements from the group of biotic and abiotic heavy metals was found in Kamianske, in particular copper and zinc - by 2.0-2.4 times (p&lt;0.01; R2= 0.72-0.77), mercury and arsenic - by 1.3-1.9 times (p&lt;0.01; R2= 0.87-0.92). The dynamics of concentrations of other heavy metals in the drinking water of the studied cities was unreliable. The sum of the ratio of the concentrations of trace elements from the group of heavy metals belonging to hazard classes I and II according to the sanitary and toxicological limiting sign of harmfulness ranges from 1.1 to 1.9, i.e. the simultaneous presence of these metals in the drinking water of industrial cities exceeds the safe level regulated by SSRN 2.2.4-171-10.  Conclusions. The results of the conducted research indicate the urgency of the problem of ensuring the quality and safety of drinking water intended for human consumption and the need for further improvement of water treatment and control methods at all levels. Keywords. Trace elements, heavy metals, drinking water, content, pollution, impact, public health.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of live streaming marketing, it is crucial for members of the supply chain to allocate resources not only to enhance product quality through quality improvement efforts but also towards marketing initiatives aimed at boosting sales. This paper focuses on a dual-channel supply chain comprising a brand vendor and a streamer and investigates the spillover effect of the live streaming channel on traditional channels and product goodwill. By analyzing the Stackelberg game and differential game, this study compares the optimal equilibrium strategy and equilibrium profit under two decentralized models: the brand vendor-dominated decentralized model and the streamer-dominated decentralized model, as well as the centralized decision-making model. Additionally, this paper presents the optimal strategy and profit function of the product goodwill trajectory for the brand vendor, streamer, and the entire supply chain, considering different spillover effects using numerical simulation. The analysis reveals that the level of quality improvement consistently increases over time, while the variation in product goodwill is more diverse. The optimal pricing of products is influenced by the market share of the channel with goods under the decision of the two decentralized models. Risk-averse brands tend to collaborate with waist and tail streamers to gain control over bargaining power, while risk-seeking brands often choose top streamers to distribute their goods when the market share of goods channels is significant. The overall profitability of the supply chain is influenced by consumers’ preferences for quality and marketing.</jats:p>",

We investigate the optimal strategies by further considering logistics cost difference between the poor areas and other areas. The results indicate that the platform and consumers’ supporting preferences are both beneficial to improve the poor farmer’s profit, while they may decrease the sales quantity and the price of general agricultural products. In addition, the high logistics cost of poor areas has negative impacts on the sales of PA agricultural products and the poor farmer’s profit. By virtue of some numerical analysis, we further discover that the platform’s profit improves with its supporting preference only when consumers’ supporting preference is relatively large, or when the platform and consumers’ supporting preferences are both relatively small. In addition, the consumer surplus always improves with supporting preference.</jats:p>",

It has endocrine-disrupting effects and poses potential risks to health, which is also related to the development of various diseases. Nevertheless, using conventional biological treatment techniques has proved challenging in fully breaking down this particular hazardous substance. The degradation ability of the target substance was explored by investigating the effect of an ascorbic acid (Vc)-modified Fenton-like system. The results showed that the degradation rate of the modified system reached 74.6% after 20 min, which was much higher than the 9.1% degradation rate without Vc. Under different ratios of Vc and Fe(III), when the ratios were 1:1 and 1/2:1, the reaction efficiency was the best, and the degradation rate exceeded 83%. When pH = 6.5 and the ratio of Vc to Fe(III) was 1:1, the optimal conditions were achieved, and 83.5% of the BPA could be degraded within 60 min. The results of the quenching experiment provided evidence that •OH was the main reactive oxidizing species (ROS). Analysis of the BPA degradation pathway and the product toxicity evaluation revealed a reduction in the acute/chronic toxicity of BPA from toxic/very toxic to non-harmful/harmful levels. The presented evidence demonstrates that Vc significantly enhances the performance of the modified Fenton-like system and has definite potential for application.</jats:p>"

The method involves developing a three-layered superstructure. The first layer consists of bio-based renewable energy sources connected to the second layer through various transport modes. The second layer, a centralized polygeneration hub, includes combined heat and power systems and resource subnetworks, featuring a boiler for generating high-pressure steam, turbines for power generation, process and utility heat exchangers, and a stripping column for regenerating solutes from mass separating agents. The third layer, connected to the second layer via pipelines, comprises co-located process plants where energy and resource demands are met through heat and mass exchanger network synthesis. The integrated superstructure, represented as a mixed-integer non-linear programming model, is applied to a hypothetical case study involving wood pulp, corn stover, and glycerine as renewable energy sources. It includes two turbines for generating a specified amount of power, hot and cold streams to be cooled and heated in three co-located plants, and gaseous streams from which ammonia is absorbed using mass separating agents in one of the plants. The solution, dominated by the cost of the supply chain, involves seven process heat exchangers (three of which are used for interplant heat exchange), six utility exchangers, and seven mass exchangers, including one stripping column. When the case study is compared to its equivalent non-integrated scenario, the proposed integrated model shows a 79% reduction in total annual cost for a case where the cost of fossil energy is $0.1/kg. Additionally, in terms of environmental impact, it releases 58% less carbon. The results demonstrate the benefits of adopting a centralized design approach using a polygeneration hub integrated with multiple resource networks.</jats:p>",

This paper considers the strategy of the E-SC to provide cash rebates for consumers participating in the trade-in program and incorporates the e-commerce platform’s trade-in service efforts into the E-SC’s decision-making system. Depending on who provides the cash rebate, we construct four decision-making models of the E-SC, i.e., the no-cash-rebate model, the manufacturer model, the platform model, and the cooperative model, where both the manufacturer and the platform jointly provide the cash rebate. We show that the platform model reduces the trade-in service level, but the manufacturer model increases the trade-in service level. In addition, since the cash rebate increases operation costs, the sale price of products is inevitably improved. Furthermore, the platform model raises product demand, but the manufacturer model lowers product demand. The cooperative model proves effective in enhancing demand only when the manufacturer contributes a minor share of the cash rebate and the trade-in service is less efficient. Cash rebates can increase the E-SC’s profits, but the degree of this increase becomes smaller as the cash rebates increase. The manufacturer and the platform always want to exploit each other’s cash rebate strategies. Consumer surplus and social welfare are highest in the platform model and lowest in the manufacturer model. Taking into account the profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare, the platform model is the most conducive to E-SC system operations.</jats:p>"

The synergy of these technologies presents a robust framework to address counterfeit risks, facilitating end-to-end product authentication and allowing for secure, real-time collaboration in project management settings. This integration minimizes vulnerabilities in data handling and improves compliance with privacy regulations by securing data at rest and in transit. By evaluating case studies and recent advancements, this paper highlights the potential of blockchain and homomorphic encryption to redefine security protocols, fostering a trustworthy and resilient supply chain ecosystem.

As the “last mile”, the building water supply system (BWSS) is the crucial part in ensuring tap water safety, and its deteriorating water quality has attracted increasing attention. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of the pollution, configuration, purification and regulation of BWSSs, with a focus on ensuring water quality safety. Periodic water usage in buildings is a unique feature that leads to intermittent water stagnation and reduced residual chlorine. Biological pollution has become a key focus of existing studies due to its acute effects on human health, compared to the chronic effects of chemical pollution. For new systems, water quality risks can be reduced at the source by optimizing pipe materials and reasonable layout. It is recommended to introduce secondary disinfection technologies, as they are important for ensuring biosecurity. Moreover, supervision and maintenance are the basis for long-term efficient operation of BWSSs. This review constructs a framework for controlling water quality deterioration based on the wholse process, which is instructive for the design, operation, maintenance and management of BWSSs, and provides relatively clear research directions for improving water quality.</jats:p>"

The findings indicate that from 2020 to 2035, HQ, CS, and WY have basically achieved coupling coordination at both scales. However, there is a notable disparity in the supply and demand of water resource production and carbon emission production. To ensure the long-term balance of ecosystem service supply and demand (ESSD), the research area was ultimately divided into five ecological zones: ecological conservation zone, ecological agriculture zone, ecological moderate development zone, ecological improvement zone, and ecological protection zone.

However, the cultivation of grain legumes is inherently exposed to various risks, including lodging and fungal infections. Mixed cropping of pea (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>Pisum sativum</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> L.) and barley (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:italic>Hordeum vulgare</jats:italic></jats:styled-content> L.) presents a promising approach to increase plant‐based protein production while also improving yield stability. We performed a multi‐environment‐mixed cropping comparison with pure pea and pure barley to determine the effects of the cultivation method on root rot resistance, N supply in successive crops, grain yield, and economic performance. While the economic performance was similar for pure pea and mixed cropping, we observed a lower variability of the farmer's gross margin in mixed cropping compared with pure cropping across 3 years and two locations. Especially in seasons with high precipitation, the mixed cropping approach prevented lodging and harvest losses. The N supply in the successive crop was equal or higher in mixed cropping compared with pure pea cropping. No variation in the pea root rot infestation levels was observed between mixed and pure cropping, indicating a general demand for resistance breeding. Our experiment indicated genotype‐specific effects on the gross margin in regard to culture (pure pea and mixed cropping). Leafy genotypes in particular demonstrate substantial performance gains when cultivated in mixed cropping systems. The conclusion is that mixed cropping leads to similarly positive crop rotation nitrogen effects as pure pea cropping, with the advantage of reduced gross margin and yield variability.</jats:p>",

Dynamic material flow analysis method is used and the demand and supply pattern of China's thulium is clarified. Results reveal that the final demand for thulium grows at an annual rate of 6.2%, reaching from 121 tonnes in 2011 to 208 tonnes in 2020, driven mainly by laser‐related end‐use sectors. Accumulative 1506 tonnes (80.7%) of domestically produced thulium in China originates from illegal mining during 2011–2020. This, combined with imported thulium compounds, bridges the significant gap between final demand and domestic legal supply. Moreover, 1422 tonnes of thulium are stocked in end‐use sectors by 2020, with 30.8% in fiber‐optic communication sector. A supply–demand gap has emerged since 2016 with thulium demand surpassing its domestic supply, which is projected to further widen in the future. Measures like promoting recycling and recovery, optimizing the trade patterns, and exploring material and technology substitution are proposed to mitigate such a gap.</jats:p>",

The study combines numerical simulation and experimentation to analyze the effects of discharge power, initial pH, gas flow rate, and liquid flow rate on copper and zinc removal rates. The results show that a better gas–liquid mixing distribution can be achieved when the inlet flow rate is 40 L/min and the inlet flow rate is below 200 mL/min. The removal of Cu can be up to 98.68% and Zn up to 96.28% when the discharge power is 56 W and the initial pH is 11. The optimum treatment time for Cu2+ is 3–6 min, while the best copper removal occurs at a gas flow rate of 20–30 L/min and a liquid flow rate of 100 mL/min. It was found that the optimum treatment time for Zn2+ was different for different process parameters, mainly in the range of 9–12 min, which needs to be noted in future production applications. Therefore, DBD can efficiently eliminate copper and zinc ions from groundwater to meet environmental discharge standards.</jats:p>",

This unpredictability makes it difficult to characterize the typical demand for grid power balance regulation, which results in a lack of clear objectives for evaluating the contributions of demand‐side users to power balance. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, a new approach is proposed on the basis of the inherent difficulties in grid power balance regulation. First, a method for portraying the change in power balance regulation demand is presented, which emphasizes the trend characteristics of time‐varying regulation demand through the weighting of trend segments. Second, demand periods and curves are calculated on the basis of a regulation capacity of 5% of the maximum load, and their distribution during the monthly cycle is analysed. Finally, to elucidate the contribution of random samples to typical demand features, a sample weighting method utilizing clustering categories is proposed and a distance‐minimum optimization model is constructed to estimate typical features by leveraging the “group effect” concept. Actual power data from a region in China are selected for verification, confirming that the proposed typical value calculation method is more representative of random sampling situations. Moreover, considering the power grid's time‐varying nature, the evaluation of the contribution of demand‐side users to the power grid is improved.</jats:p>",

This study applies the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model to project the impacts of climate change on future surface water availability, integrating the findings into an Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) framework. Using bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), this study examines scenarios from low to high emissions (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) for the assessment of potential variations in water supply. The results indicate a significant vulnerability to water availability, especially under SSP370 and SSP585, where climate warming is pronounced, leading to significant reductions in streamflow. Conversely, SSP126 suggests relatively stable conditions with less pronounced hydrological changes. The study also explores the socioeconomic drivers that affect water demand, including population growth and land use changes that influence agricultural water needs. The findings underscore the urgency of using adaptive management strategies to conserve water resources in the face of these anticipated challenges. Key recommendations include optimizing water use efficiency in all sectors, establishing protective zones around natural ecosystems, implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, and promoting community engagement in water management. These measures are critical for enhancing water security and promoting sustainable development within the watershed, contributing to the broader goals of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. This study offers decision-makers and resource managers an evidence-based framework for integrating hydrological modeling into IWRM, providing valuable insights to navigate the complexities of climate change and ensure the long- term sustainability of water resources in the Philippines.</jats:p>"

The data was analyzed using ATLAS.ti version 10, and themes were identified through coding. The study's findings revealed that a lack of knowledge and information sharing presents the most significant barrier to GSCM implementation, as there is insufficient awareness and dissemination of green concepts and practices among SME employees and consumers. Information sharing is crucial for facilitating green activities and promoting collaboration within the supply chain. Additionally, green manufacturing was identified as the most important driver in encouraging environmentally friendly practices among the top five drivers. SME companies need to find a balance between production performance and meeting sustainability requirements. Understanding the barriers and drivers of Malaysian F&amp;B SMEs will enable practitioners to make well-informed decisions regarding GSCM implementation, ultimately enhancing the performance of the F&amp;B industry and ensuring a sustainable food supply.</jats:p>",

The integration of the GWO automates the hyperparameter tuning process, enhancing the predictive performance of the GRU network. The proposed GWO-GRU method was validated utilizing actual PEMFC data under dynamic load conditions.

By integrating several energy sources, a hybrid renewable and sustainable power supply system (HRSPSS) has been created to solve the global warming problem. HRSPSS aims to develop contemporary electricity grids that benefit society, the environment, and the economy. However, there is a need for thorough assessment of these complex HRSPSSs for making the most use of renewable energy potential and carefully crafting suitable solutions. This paper provides a thorough investigation of the most effective methods for sizing, optimizing, controlling, and managing energy, as well as how to combine different renewable energy sources to create a hybrid sustainable power supply system. Information on several software simulation tools and optimization methods that have been used to support HRSPSS development, research, and planning is presented in this study. Additionally, this study covers energy management and control strategies that have been used to ensure efficient and optimal operation of HRSPSS. Furthermore, this article presents an extensive comparison among various strategies utilized in each area (sizing, optimizing, controlling, and managing energy) to provide conclusive remarks on the suitable strategies for respective applications. The outcome of this study will help various stakeholders in the energy sector to make appropriate decisions during the design, development, and implementation phases of a hybrid sustainable power supply system.</jats:p>"

Here, we redefine solar drought events by considering supply demand imbalance in solar power. Observation and multi‐model simulations reveal an anthropogenic exacerbation of global solar drought frequency in the past three decades. Moreover, compared to the pathway SSP2‐4.5, the carbon neutrality pathway SSP1‐2.6 can mitigate the increasing frequency and severity of solar droughts by 60% and 63% in the 2090s, respectively.

This paper aims to test the use of an indicative approach to assessing the security of electricity supply. The paper considers the possibility of using an indicative approach to assessing the security of electricity supply. Within this paper, the indicative approach is understood as a method of management and planning based on the use of indicators or indicators to assess the state and efficiency of a particular process, system, or phenomenon. The main focus is on forming a list of indicators to assess the security of electricity supply. The initial assessment of the level of the indicator for ensuring the balanced reliability of the power system and the quality and level of maintenance of power grids will allow us to assess the security of supply in general. Unlike the existing principles for assessing supply security, this approach allows for systematic monitoring and objective data on which to base strategies and plans, which increases management efficiency. To solve the problem of finding an assessment of the security of the electricity supply, an indicative approach may be proposed for use, which provides a unified indicator that allows further analysis and formation of a list of tasks for the development of the Ukrainian power system. The feasibility of applying the indicative approach is proved by the example of calculating all weighted average integrated indicators and the level of security of electricity supply. The above calculations and conclusions can be extended to the indicators of the Reports of the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine for other years.\nKeywords: indicative approach, security of electricity supply, indicator, indicator, assessment, risk, statistical data, standardization, unified indicator.</jats:p>"

Статья посвящена патоморфологическим изменениям в коре и подкорковых структурах головного мозга при гипотиреозе, вызванном нарушением кровоснабжения щитовидной железы. Цель. Изучить патоморфологические изменения в корковых слоях и подкорковых структурах головного мозга крыс при нарушении функции щитовидной железы ограничением ее кровоснабжения. Материалы и методы. Исследована ткань головного мозга 16 белых беспородных крыс-самок массой 250±50 г на базе Самаркандского государственного медицинского университета и Республиканского патологоанатомического центра в период 2021–2023 гг. Технология операции состояла в осуществлении ряда последовательно выполняемых этапов. После обработки операционного поля производились разрез кожи и разведение краев раны на держалках. Тупым способом раздвигались мышцы и обнажалась трахея, что открывало доступ к щитовидной железе. Далее электрокоагулятором производилась коагуляция верхней и нижней щитовидной артерии справа. После прекращения кровотока через артериальные сосуды щитовидной железы обнаруживались признаки ишемии головного мозга, сама же щитовидная железа становилась синюшной (но при этом не производилась оценка секреторной активности щитовидной железы). Затем по возможности послойно восстанавливали топографию мышц и мягких тканей. Из 16 животных умерли, не выходя из наркоза, 4, примерно через 12 часов по окончании операции. Оставшиеся 12 животных легко вышли из наркоза и через 6 часов уже подходили к корму и воде. Выведение животных из опыта осуществлялось под этаминалнатриевым наркозом путем внутрибрюшинного введения наркотического средства в дозе 50 мг/кг массы тела. Сразу же после наступления смерти у животных выделяли головной мозг и сердце, ополаскивали их 2-кратно холодным 0,9%-ным (9 г/л) раствором хлорида натрия, осуществляли фиксацию органов в 10%-ном (100 г/л) нейтральном формалине с последующими проводкой в изопропаноле, заливкой образцов в парафин и приготовлением срезов и стекол. Окрашивание препаратов ткани выполняли гематоксилином-эозином. Результаты. Установлено, что у животных с нарушением функции щитовидной железы возникают характерные изменения в нейронах коры больших полушарий головного мозга и подкорковых центров. По мере усугубления нарушений цитоархитектоники коры головного мозга увеличивалось количество пирамидных клеток и астроцитов, уменьшалась масса белого вещества, замещаемого миелиновыми нервными волокнами. Отмечена размытость границ пирамидных клеток коры головного мозга, которые выглядели тоньше, с резко истонченными отростками апикальных дендритов. Патоморфологические изменения мозговой ткани проявлялись также в уменьшении просвета сосудов, мукоидном набухании их стенок, неравномерной полноте, извилистости сосудов, деформации стенок сосудов с развитием ангиосклероза. Выявленные патоморфологические нарушения завершаются атрофическими и склеротическими изменениями ткани и отеком головного мозга. Нарушения структурно-функциональных свойств головного мозга могут быть расценены как ведущий этиопатогенетический фактор в развитии патоморфологических изменений в тканях головного мозга. Заключение. Вызванное обтурацией артериальных сосудов щитовидной железы нарушение кровоснабжения в ней влечет за собой формирование сочетанной патологии – ишемии головного мозга на фоне нарушений функции щитовидной железы, которая проявляется дистрофическими изменениями в нейронах коры головного мозга и подкорковых центров. Выявлено, что усугубление нарушений в коре головного мозга выражается в увеличении количества пирамидальных клеток и астроцитов. Происходящие в ткани головного мозга патоморфологические и сосудистые изменения (сужение просвета сосудов, их извилистость, мукоидное набухание клеток), выявленные после обтурации артериальных сосудов, кровоснабжающих щитовидную железу, рассматриваются как главные факторы нарушения функций головного мозга, что расценивается как одно из проявлений сочетанной патологии.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Introduction. The article deals with pathomorphological changes in the cortex and subcortical structures of the brain in hypothyroidism induced by impaired blood supply of the thyroid gland. Purpose. To study pathomorphological changes in the cortical layers and subcortical structures of the rat brain in thyroid dysfunction due to limited blood supply. Materials and methods. The brain tissue of 16 white outbred female rats weighing 250±50 g was examined at the Samarkand State Medical University and the Republican Pathological Anatomical Center in the period 2021–2023. The surgical technology consisted of a number of sequentially performed stages. After processing the surgical field, the skin was incised and the wound edges were spread on holders. The muscles were bluntly moved apart and the trachea was exposed opening access to the thyroid gland. Then, the upper and lower thyroid arteries on the right were coagulated with an electrocoagulator. After the blood flow through the arterial vessels of the thyroid gland was stopped, signs of cerebral ischemia were detected, and the thyroid gland itself became cyanotic (but the secretory activity of the thyroid gland was not assessed). Next, the topography of muscles and soft tissues was restored layer by layer, as far as possible. Of the 16 animals, 4 died without coming out of anesthesia, approximately 12 hours after the end of the operation. The remaining 12 animals easily came out of anesthesia, and after 6 hours they were already approaching food and water. The animals were withdrawn from the experiment under ethaminal sodium anesthesia by intraperitoneal administration of the narcotic agent at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. Immediately after death, the brain and heart were extracted from the animals and rinsed twice with cold 0.9% (9 g/l) sodium chloride solution; the organs were fixed in 10% (100 g/l) neutral formalin, followed by immersion in isopropanol. The specimens were embedded in paraffin, and sections and slides were prepared. Tissue preparations were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Results. It was found that animals with thyroid dysfunction exhibited characteristic changes in neurons of the cerebral cortex and subcortical centers. As the cytoarchitectonic disorders of the cerebral cortex worsened, the number of pyramidal cells and astrocytes increased, and the mass of white matter, replaced by myelinated nerve fibers, decreased. Blurring of pyramidal cortex cell boundaries was observed; they looked thinner, with sharply thinned processes of the apical dendrites. Pathomorphological changes in the brain tissue were also manifested by vessels lumen narrowing, mucoid swelling of their walls, uneven fullness, tortuosity of the vessels, and deformation of the vessel walls with subsequent angiosclerosis. The revealed pathomorphological disorders resulted in atrophic and sclerotic tissue changes and cerebral edema. Disturbances of structural and functional properties of the brain can be recognized as a leading etiopathogenetic factor of pathomorphological changes in the brain tissue. Conclusion. The disruption of blood supply in the thyroid gland caused by obstruction of the arterial vessels leads to a combined pathology, i.e. cerebral ischemia, against the background of dysfunction of the thyroid gland, which is manifested by dystrophic changes in the neurons of the cerebral cortex and subcortical centers. It was revealed that the aggravation of disorders in the cerebral cortex was expressed in an increase in the number of pyramidal cells and astrocytes. Pathomorphological and vascular changes occurring in the brain tissue (vessels lumen narrowing, their tortuosity, mucoid cells swelling), revealed after obturation of arterial vessels supplying the thyroid gland, are considered the main factors of brain dysfunction, which is regarded as one of manifestations of combined pathology.</jats:p>",

Spatial computing (SC) technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital twins, offer promising solutions by enhancing precision agriculture, logistics, manufacturing, and retail operations. This review explores SC's potential across the entire food supply continuum, emphasizing improvements in resource management, supply chain transparency, and consumer engagement. Despite its promise, the widespread adoption of SC is limited by technical challenges and a lack of standardized protocols. The findings suggest that while SC has the potential to revolutionize the food supply chain by improving sustainability, efficiency, and safety, further interdisciplinary research and collaboration are essential to fully unlock its capabilities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aim: This study aims to develop supply air jet models for split air conditioners. Background: Designing and operating an air conditioning system based on the unique characteristics of the supply air jet is essential to control the draft risk. Motivation: Due to the distinct differences in air supply characteristics of the split air conditioners caused by the intermittent operation and the complex design of supply air outlets, the existing supply air jet models designed for central air conditioning systems are unsuitable for split air conditioners. Significant results: In this study, models for the trajectory position, velocity, and temperature of the supply air jet for split air conditioners are established based on the Abramovich jet theory and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed models is demonstrated via comparison with the training dataset from the experimentally validated Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation of a split air conditioner. For the model testing dataset, the RMSEs of trajectory position, velocity, and temperature are 0.01 m, 0.09 m/s, and 0.09 °C, respectively, with a low supply air velocity and 0.01 m, 0.25 m/s, and 0.03 °C with a high supply air velocity. The proposed models of velocity and temperature of the supply air jet are general for various supply air conditions, while coefficients in the trajectory position model of the supply air jet need to be recalibrated with the proposed Bayesian MCMC algorithm for different supply air conditions. The proposed models provide valuable guidance for the operation of split air conditioners.</jats:p>"

Drawing on the idea of the waterscape, I conceptualise the DWSP as an embodiment of power and socio‐environmental relations, encompassing a wide array of physical objects, institutions, and agencies. I show that, on one hand, the DWSP has expanded, improved, and renewed its physical forms over the past six decades and intertwined with various institutional and administrative changes that consolidate its role. On the other hand, the materialisation of the DWSP has been associated with diverging spatial configurations in both water‐exporting and water‐receiving areas. That has exacerbated disparities in water access, conservation responsibilities, and socioeconomic opportunities, perpetuating uneven waterscapes. This historical‐material examination of the DWSP provides a nuanced understanding of how power and social relations can manifest through water and how hydraulic infrastructure is intimately linked with development, governance, and inequalities over space and time.</jats:p>"

Real-world supply chains, which consist of various components such as goods, warehouses, and plants, often feature intricate network structures that pose challenges for resilience analysis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a framework for studying supply chains using multi-layer network community detection. The complex multi-mode supply chain network is transformed into single-mode, multi-layer weighted networks. A multi-layer weighted community detection method is proposed for identifying local clusters within these networks, revealing interconnected groups that highlight flexibility and redundancy in production capabilities across different plants and goods. An empirical study utilizing real data demonstrates that this clustering method effectively detects indirect capacity links between plants and goods. The insights derived from this method are useful for strategic capacity management, allowing businesses to respond more effectively to supply shortages and unexpected increases in demand.</jats:p>"

To achieve the objective, a quantitative scope methodology was applied, developing a Linear Regression model with polynomial trends, which related the relevant variables within the agricultural sector to determine the economic impact that occurred on the supply of the agricultural sector caused by confinement. of Covid-19, considering the period between January 2018 until April 2021. These variables are: Gross Agricultural Value Added and the price indices of Inputs, Fertilizers, Agrochemicals, Consumer and Producer. The findings of this analysis show that the COVID-19 lockdown did not directly affect the overall production of the agricultural sector, but rather certain factors. In turn, benefits were generated for the farmer, since the prices of inputs and agrochemical products decreased considerably, reducing production costs. It is concluded that Covid-19 caused changes in five of the six variables evaluated, that is, that confinement affected the most important price factors in the agricultural sector, but not total production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A prefabricated construction supply chain(PCSC) is a complex network with high interdependency between entities. After disturbance, it is prone to cascading failure, leading to project delays or budget overruns. Therefore, it is necessary to model a robust network against cascading failure to achieve a sustainable prefabricated construction system. This study explores the functional robustness of a prefabricated construction supply chain network (PCSCN) against underload cascading failure. First, the PCSCN is constructed as a three-echelon supply chain network based on complex network theory, which can characterize the general characteristics of PCSC and provide the network foundation for the subsequent numerical simulation research. Then, a more realistic underload cascading failure model that adds the new element of substitute nodes is established to describe load loss propagation in the PCSCN. Finally, the Order Fulfillment Rate(OFR) is used as the robustness index to quantify network robustness from a functional perspective. The numerical simulation results indicate that in the PCSCN, the larger the initial load is, the more important the node, and component manufacturers are more important than building material suppliers. In addition, the node capacity upper bound parameter <jats:italic>α</jats:italic> has a positive relationship with robustness, the failure coefficient <jats:italic>β</jats:italic> has a negative relationship, and the edge weight adjustment coefficient <jats:italic>θ</jats:italic> has no significant impact on robustness. This research can provide guidance for developing cascade control and defense strategies in PCSCN risk management.</jats:p>",

The normal operation of the water supply and the drainage pipeline is of great significance for conserving water resources and preventing water pollution. However, due to characteristics such as deep burial, diverse materials, and extensive lengths, the detection of defects becomes exceptionally complex. Traditional detection methods used in practical applications, such as ground excavation and destructive testing, typically require the shutdown of water pipelines. This process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, often resulting in significant economic losses. This paper proposes an effective technique for detecting defects in the water supply and the drainage pipeline. The method involves capturing images of the inner walls of water supply conduits and subsequently utilizing an artificial intelligence large-scale model approach (grounded language-image pre-training, GLIP) and a You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model to detect defects within them. The experimental results show that GLIP demonstrates impressive detection performance in zero-shot scenarios, while YOLOv5 performs well on existing datasets. By combining these two models, we were able to achieve a balance between fast, flexible detection and high precision, making our approach both practical and efficient for real-world applications.</jats:p>",

The theoretical framework of the research included concepts from Industry 4.0, sustainability, circular supply chains and emerging technologies, underpinning the analysis of the integration of these elements. The research was conducted through a systematic literature review, analysing 28 articles published between 2017 and 2024 that discussed the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains. The results indicate that the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies predominantly occurs through the paradox of economic growth, efficiency, and technological innovation. This integration aids in promoting circular practices by identifying waste, opportunities for material reuse, tracking waste and by‐products and predicting product demand with greater accuracy, among other benefits. The conclusion of the research highlights the importance of sustainability, innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in driving more efficient and sustainable practices within supply chains. The contributions include the expansion of knowledge on the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies into circular supply chains, the identification of opportunities for future research, the encouragement of interdisciplinarity and collaboration, and the promotion of more efficient and sustainable practices across various sectors of the economy.</jats:p>",

The risk evaluation of water supply pipeline failure in a distribution network is a challenging task, because most of the available data cannot fully reflect pipeline failure events and many of the mechanisms still cannot be fully understood. Therefore, a predictive model is urgently needed to assess pipeline failure risk based on available data. In this paper, based on the traditional risk assessment theory, seven main factors affecting pipeline failure are selected and scored, and then a pipeline failure model is established by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) neural network. The model uses the neural network training of historical data to evaluate the failure of the water supply pipeline, and the PSO is used to optimize the neural network to effectively improve the training time and accuracy. The model error and correlation coefficient are 0.003 and 0.987, respectively. The proposed model can be used as a powerful support tool to assist infrastructure managers and pipeline maintainers in their plans and decision-making.</jats:p>"

However, the potential for nutrient and carbon processing is still largely unknown in streams impacted by agriculture, representing major pathways for eutrophication and diffuse pollution. In this study, we measured solute concentrations and gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) to infer nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) supply and demand across contrasting hydrological conditions. As expected, solute supply greatly surpassed in‐stream biological demand for both NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and DOC for intermediate to large discharges. However, during four consecutive weeks in summer, lowered NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> supply and high metabolic activity led to a 60% and 31% reduction in stream NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and DOC export. We also compared metabolism‐discharge versus solute concentration‐discharge patterns during storm events to better understand biogeochemical responses to high flows. Metabolic rates showed a contrasting response to storm events: ER increased while GPP decreased following declines in NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> concentrations. The positive correlation between GPP and NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> concentrations suggests that GPP suppression can be partially attributed to decreased NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> availability during storm events. This study supports the idea that agricultural streams have a limited capacity to biologically process DOC and NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>. However, it also emphasizes that the balance between supply and demand can vary from severe saturation to limitation, depending on seasonal fluctuations in discharge and metabolic activity, highlighting the crucial role of mitigating pollution at its source during hydrologically active periods to improve water quality.</jats:p>",

Combining a mesocosm approach and two‐point dilution incubations, we quantified how natural plankton assemblages respond to moderate and extreme warming (+6°C vs. +12°C above ambient temperature), covering a nitrogen‐to‐phosphorus gradient from nutrient‐saturated to limited conditions. We addressed how both drivers altered the community structure and mediated the phytoplankton growth (<jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>) and microzooplankton grazing (<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>) rates. Moderate and extreme warming effects on the microzooplankton–phytoplankton relationship differed and were mediated by time.

By contrast, after the acclimation period, the trophic interaction was strengthened by increased grazing under extreme warming. The variable grazing pressure found at different temporal scales only under extreme warming could be due to a decreased microzooplankton grazing pressure with increasing temperature when prey biomass is low, and vice versa. Also, it could be a consequence of a switch toward mixotrophy or that the temperatures experienced by grazers were suboptimal compared to their prey. Finally, we found that temperature was the main driver whereas resource availability played a minor role in this trophic interaction. As climate change will intensify in the future, food webs could be less productive but more efficient, and thus, potentially support a higher secondary production.</jats:p>",

The accurate prediction of solar irradiance is crucial for determining the power capacity of photovoltaic power generation (PVPG) systems for mobile sprinkler machines. In this study, a prediction method is proposed to estimate the solar irradiance of typical irrigation areas. The relation between meteorological parameters and solar irradiance is studied, and four different parameter combinations are formed and considered as inputs to the prediction model. Based on meteorological data provided by ten typical radiation stations uniformly distributed nationwide, an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model optimized using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is developed to predict solar radiation. The prediction accuracy and stability of the proposed method are then evaluated for different input parameters through training and testing. The differences between the prediction performances of models trained based on single-station data and mixed data from multiple stations are also compared. The obtained results show that the proposed model achieves the highest prediction accuracy when the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, sunshine hours ratio, relative humidity, wind speed, and extraterrestrial radiation are used as input parameters. In the model testing, the RMSE and MAE of WOA-XGBoost are 2.142 MJ·m−2·d−1 and 1.531 MJ·m−2·d−1, respectively, while those of XGBoost are 2.298 MJ·m−2·d−1 and 1.598 MJ·m−2·d−1. The prediction effectiveness is also verified based on measured data. The WOA-XGBoost model has higher prediction accuracy than the XGBoost model. The model developed in this study can be applied to forecast solar irradiance in different regions. By inputting the meteorological parameter data specific to a given area, this model can effectively produce accurate solar irradiance predictions for that region. This study provides a foundation for the optimization of the configuration of PVPG systems for mobile sprinkler machines.</jats:p>"

Particle trapping was determined by measuring the increase in relative fluorescence intensity at the gap region between the single pair of triangular posts.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forestry is an important component of Canada’s economy with British Columbia (BC) contributing almost half to the national roundwood production. Yet, the country’s timber supply and forest economy are threatened by climate change, with increased frequency and severity of natural disturbances and changes in forest productivity. Mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks are endemic in BC, but the latest climate change-driven outbreak has resulted in a cumulative loss of over half of all merchantable pine, leading to a mid-term timber supply shortage. In this study, we investigate the potential of commercial thinning and alternative planting regimes based on species diversification and assisted species migration to mitigate the anticipated decrease in timber supply in BC. We simulated the long-term effects of these management options in a case study area in interior BC, using a toolbox that combines management- and research-oriented data and models. We found that combining commercial thinning and species diversification has the best potential to mitigate future timber supply shortages in BC. We discuss the limits of this toolbox approach and identify research needs and recommendations for future studies aiming at modelling cumulative effects of management, climate change, and natural disturbances on timber supply. </jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aimed to contribute initially to this area by supplementing the diets of ewes with a high dose of GAA evaluating its effects on reproductive response. Twenty adult sheep had their estrus synchronized using an MPA sponge, eCG and PG2α. After estrus detection ewes were mated. For 10 days until mating, ewes were grouped in baseline diet (BSD; n = 10), and a GAA diet (GAAD; n = 10), which was the BSD with daily 0.9 g/kg DM of GAA. After the eCG+PG2α dose, the GAAD group exhibited an increase in the peak diastolic and pulsatility of the ovarian artery, a reduction in the systolic/diastolic peaks ratio and a larger intraovarian blood perfusion area. A greater depletion of follicles with &amp;amp;lt; 3 mm was observed in the GAAD group, and a higher number of follicles ≥ 3 mm. No differences were observed between the diets respect to pregnancy, and twin rates. Thus, a high GAA supply before mating significantly alters ovarian vasculature and improves follicular growth in ewes but does not affect the pregnancy rate.</jats:p>"

However, it is still unclear whether different vegetation restoration patterns will aggravate the trade-off of grassland ecosystem services in this area. This study focuses on grassland ecosystems in the karst desertification control area, comparing artificial restoration measures (Dactylis glomerata single-species sowing grassland, DG; Lolium perenne single-species sowing grassland, LP; Lolium perenne + Trifolium repens mixed-species sowing grassland, LT) with natural restoration measures (NG). Seven ecosystem services (forage yield, soil retention, soil water conservation, carbon fixation and release, soil carbon storage, soil nutrient retention, and biodiversity conservation) as well as total ecosystem services were quantified using field monitoring data. The relationships between these services were evaluated through Spearman correlation analysis. The results showed that different vegetation restoration patterns significantly influenced the provisioning, regulating, and supporting services of the grassland ecosystem (p &lt; 0.001). Three types of relationships were observed (trade-off, synergy, and neutral), but the trade-off relationship was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). The total ecosystem service of LT (0.79) was significantly higher than that of NG (0.21), DG (0.36), and LP (0.41), with a significant synergy observed between soil nutrient conservation, forage yield, and carbon sequestration and oxygen release (p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, LT is considered the best vegetation restoration practice for the karst rocky desertification control area compared with other patterns. This study provides theoretical guidance for vegetation restoration in degraded karst ecosystems.</jats:p>"

However, designing an appropriate solar power supply without oversizing and avoiding output power disruption all year long is not a trivial task. This paper provides a set of guidelines as well as useful information and advice for environmental researchers and other non-experts to select the right components when designing their own autonomous solar power supply for a range between 10 mW and 10 W. The design steps are compiled into a comprehensive document, free of irrelevant information yet still presenting a general overview of the solar power supply design process, in order to make this task more accessible and understandable for non-experts. The methodology for simple initial dimensioning was carried out and applied to a real-life use case by using the estimated or measured daily consumption combined with free meteorological data of the deployment site provided by various websites. Next, an hourly simulation completed the first sizing. A year of experimental results validated the methodology.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the timely detection, qualitative assessment, and handling of major equipment defects are crucial. The classification of defect levels in main electrical equipment is a fundamental task in this process, which is often manually completed, supplemented by knowledge bases or expert systems. However, this approach is time-consuming, labor-intensive, involves challenging human–machine interaction, and relies on expert experience. Conversational large language models, such as ChatGPT, ERNIE Bot, ChatGLM, have garnered widespread recognition in various domains. However, these models may have errors in the reasoning process, resulting in biased or even erroneous outputs, which is referred to as the “hallucinations”. The hallucinations’ problem of large language models poses challenges in specific fields. To mitigate the hallucinations in large language models, researchers often seek to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into these models through methods like fine-tuning or prompt learning. In order to enhance model performance while minimizing computational costs, this study adopts the prompt learning approach. Specifically, we propose a large language model prompt learning framework based on knowledge graphs, aiming to provide the large language model with reasoning support by leveraging specific information stored within the knowledge graph and receive explainable reasoning result. Experimental results demonstrate that our module achieved superior results on the power defect dataset compared to the non-prompt method. </jats:p>"

Unlike most empirical studies that examine the adoption of new and improved crop varieties from a farmer's perspective, our study shifts the focus to the seed supply side. We analyse data collected from 200 private seed dealers who cater to the needs of over 163,000 farmers spread across 10 districts in Bihar. We use descriptive statistics alongside dealer-level and varietal-level regression models to examine the relationship between seed sales and varietal age. Findings indicate that the number of varieties available with a dealer (varietal richness) is positively associated with the number of seed buyers (dealer’s reach) and the total quantity of seeds sold. Private varieties are in demand despite their higher prices. Dealer-level models showed that varietal age affects neither the reach nor the sales, allowing older public-sector varieties to coexist with more recent private-sector ones. However, the varietal-level regression models show that dealers rank the new varieties higher as the ones being sold more. To explore the potential of private seed markets to reduce the proliferation of old wheat varieties that are more susceptible to evolving biotic and abiotic stress factors, we recommend strengthening the varietal registration and seed certification processes, implementing better seed traceability systems, and fostering public–private partnerships in variety development and seed dissemination. Investing in market experiments to incentivize seed dealers to engage in quality assurance can help refine strategies and ensure efficient and inclusive dissemination of promising wheat varieties.</jats:p>"

Among them, the factors affecting the quality of livestock products are composed of 10 factors pertaining to breeding, slaughtering and processing, circulation, and sales; the factors affecting the service quality of the green supply chain of livestock products are composed of 16 factors in five links of supply chain services, such as logistics, information flow, capital flow, personnel quality, and public services. The quality of livestock products and the quality of green supply chain services of livestock products are not independent from each other, but show a relationship of mutual influence and mutual restriction.

Following the initial rapid, overwhelming demand for services at these locations, the water services have evolved through different phases of investment with concerted efforts made to both improve services and reduce costs. Most recently, this has included the adoption of utility management models. In Itang, Ethiopia, the transition from emergency water supply and water trucking to a metered piped water network along with the establishment of a utility and a shift to solar power has significantly reduced the cost of supplying water from $11.38 per cubic metre (m3) to $0.93 per m3 between 2014 and 2024. In Rwamwanja, Uganda, the costs of water supply, including both capital investments and estimated operating costs, were $1.42 per m3 in the first phase and later reduced to $0.29 per m3 between 2012 and 2024. This paper seeks to provide evidence to support the discussion on how water services can be financed to meet the needs of refugees and their host communities on a sustainable basis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intense market competition has driven small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector to collaborate and form supply chain coalitions, which can improve the information flow and resource sharing and significantly enhance supply chain management efficiency. However, the distribution of cooperative benefits poses a core challenge for the long-term stability of coalitions. This paper addresses the impact of dynamic changes in complex business environments by utilizing triangular fuzzy numbers to represent the value of coalition, effectively depicting the uncertainty and ambiguity in the cooperation process. Compared to traditional models (which do not use triangular fuzzy numbers), this model is better suited to dynamic changes, offering flexible response mechanisms that ensure adaptability and fairness in the decision-making process. In addition, considering the influence of each member’s weight in the coalition, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to determine the weights. With the goal of minimizing the dissatisfaction of enterprises in benefit distribution, a least square contribution with triangular fuzzy numbers is constructed to replace the marginal contribution of the classical Banzhaf value, and an improved Banzhaf value based on the player’s triangular fuzzy number-weighted excess contribution is proposed to arrive at a fair and reasonable benefit allocation strategy in order to enhance the long-term stability and cooperative benefits of coalition. By analyzing an example of the supply chain coalition, the effectiveness of the proposed improved Banzhaf value is verified, which satisfies the uniqueness, the individual rationality, and the group rationality. It not only promotes the level of risk management and decision making under the uncertainty conditions of complex business, but also deepens the theoretical foundation of cooperative game theory and expands its possibilities in practical applications and future development.</jats:p>"

While traditional logistics often generate redundancies and inefficiencies, CLS stand out by promoting the integration of resources and the reduction of waste, enhancing positive environmental impact through coordination between multiple market players. Based on a detailed literature review and analysis of global case studies, we propose a theoretical model that identifies the main opportunities - such as improved transport efficiency and inventory optimization - and limitations, including the organizational, logistical and technological challenges that compromise the full adoption of this approach. Among the opportunities, we highlight the role of SLCs in mitigating emissions and strengthening sustainable practices that directly impact the chain's eco- efficiency. On the other hand, we analyzed the limitations inherent in the complexity of inter-organizational collaboration and technological barriers, which can limit complete integration and the sharing of essential data between companies. We contribute to the literature by identifying the key elements for the successful implementation of SLC in different contexts and sectors, addressing gaps related to the scarcity of theoretical frameworks that integrate collaborative logistics and sustainability. The article therefore not only broadens the understanding of the applicability of SLCs, but also establishes a basis for future research focused on viable and innovative solutions to promote an environmentally sustainable supply chain.</jats:p>"

Previous control strategies for stormwater basins have typically treated water quality and quantity as separate objectives. With the increasing urban runoff caused by climate change and urbanization, current single-objective control strategies cannot fully harness the control potential of basins and therefore require improvement. However, designing multi-objective control strategies for basins is challenging because of the conflicting operation goals and the complexity of the dynamic environmental conditions. This research proposes a novel real-time control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. It employs a deep Q-network to develop an agent capable of making control decisions. After being trained on three different rainfall events, the reinforcement learning agent can make appropriate decisions for previously unseen rainfall events. Compared to the other two rule-based control scenarios and a static state scenario, the deep reinforcement learning method is more effective in terms of reducing total suspended solids, reducing peak flow, minimizing outflow flashiness, and controlling effort, striking a good balance between conflicting control objectives.</jats:p>",

However, the widespread adoption of EVs has presented several challenges, such as the lagging development of charging infrastructure, the impact on the power grid, and the dynamic changes in user charging behavior. To address these issues, this paper first proposes a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) optimization framework that responds to regional dynamic pricing. It also considers power balancing in charging and discharging stations when a large number of EVs are involved in scheduling, with the aim of maximizing the benefits for EV owners. Next, by leveraging the interaction between environmental states and the dynamic behavior of EVs, we design an optimization algorithm that combines the recurrent proximal policy optimization (RPPO) algorithm and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This approach enhances system convergence and improves grid stability while maximizing benefits for EV owners. Finally, a simulation platform is used to validate the practical application of the RPPO algorithm in optimizing V2G and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) charging strategies, providing significant theoretical foundations and technical support for the development of smart grids and sustainable transportation systems.</jats:p>"

A fixed time extended state observer (ESO) is employed to approximate the cathode pressure. The parameter uncertainty is compensated by an adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Then a prescribed performance sliding mode controller is designed with fixed convergence time. The proposed control law could guarantee the prescribed transient response for oxygen excess ratio (OER) error under stack current changing and bounded uncertainty.

The approach allows us to determine energy and material consumption at all life cycle stages, from raw material extraction to the end of a product's life, including the design, production, operation, and end-of-life stages. The LCA aims to assess the overall environmental impact of a facility, consider its strengths and weaknesses, and identify possible solutions to reduce the environmental burden sustainably. This research focuses on a novel approach to using carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) as a working medium. The following research combines two key aspects of electricity production and carbon dioxide sequestration, a solution that can contribute to producing clean energy and reducing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in the atmosphere. This paper aimed to assess the impact of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) through a life-cycle analysis carried out under Polish conditions for the Gorzow block. It includes differentiating the main impact categories and key system components that indicate the most vulnerable areas. A framework available in the literature and the modelling results performed within the EnerGizerS project were adapted to carry out the study. Calculations were performed using SimaPro software. The work was performed for EGS with supercritical CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (sCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-EGS) as the working fluid in a configuration involving direct expansion in a turbine for electricity production. An environmental impact assessment was conducted, including estimating the carbon footprint for such an installation and different working fluid mass flows. The main objective of the environmental analysis is to examine how the project will affect the various environmental elements (air, water, soil) or forms of nature conservation and to identify ways to prevent, reduce or minimise the effects of the planned investment. The study results show that the construction phase, which includes well drilling and hydraulic fracturing, has the most significant impact on the environment with climate change values for different working fluid mass flows. This phase dominates the indicators obtained, which are considered typical for renewable energy sources.</jats:p>\n              <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical Abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Atmospheric visibility is a crucial meteorological element impacting urban air pollution monitoring, public transportation, and military security. Traditional visibility detection methods, primarily manual and instrumental, have been costly and imprecise. With advancements in data science and computing, deep learning-based visibility detection technologies have rapidly emerged as a research hotspot in atmospheric science. This paper systematically reviews the applications of various deep learning models—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformer networks—in visibility estimation, prediction, and enhancement. Each model’s characteristics and application methods are discussed, highlighting the efficiency of CNNs in spatial feature extraction, RNNs in temporal tracking, GANs in image restoration, and Transformers in capturing long-range dependencies. Furthermore, the paper addresses critical challenges in the field, including dataset quality, algorithm optimization, and practical application barriers, proposing future research directions, such as the development of large-scale, accurately labeled datasets, innovative learning strategies, and enhanced model interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in enhancing atmospheric visibility detection techniques, providing valuable insights into the literature and contributing to advances in the field of meteorological observation and public safety.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As global cities rapidly develop, the realization of sustainable urban development has become a pressing global concern. As a critical component of the urban built environment, urban green spaces are essential for maintaining the sustainability of urban ecosystems by offering a variety of ecological benefits. However, there are some problems in the design and construction of urban green framework, which often disregard the real needs of residents and hinder the sustainable development of urban areas. Therefore, urban planning that takes into account the supply and demand relationship of urban green space is considered to be a key technology that should help to improve residents’ happiness and promote urban sustainable development. This paper takes Zunyi City as an example; selects six indicators; combines UAV images, population, economic, and environmental data to evaluate ecosystem services valuation existing green space in the city; and analyzes its social and ecological needs. Affected by land utilization and development density, the supply value showed low spatial density characteristics in the central urban area and high spatial distribution characteristics in the surrounding urban area. The correlation between demand value and population density is the largest, and the distribution pattern is similar to that of population density. The supply-demand ratio in the study area is −0.54, indicating a severe imbalance between supply and demand. The correlation analysis between the comprehensive supply and demand ratio and each influencing factor shows that the correlation with population density is the largest. The combination of supply and demand maps addresses a major problem in planning, namely, ensuring that communities have priority in providing urban green space based on society’s need for ecosystem services. In addition, these maps will help develop the best green space planting plans to meet the specific needs of different communities. Taken together, the findings can help city planners and decision makers improve the layout of urban green areas, increase ecosystem service potential, and improve urban environmental quality and sustainability.</jats:p>"

However, how the balance of ES supply and demand and its driving mechanisms vary with the degree of urbanization has been little studied. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal changes and the correlations between ES supply and demand and the degree of urbanization in the Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area (ZZMA) from 2000 to 2020 and further explored the driving mechanisms behind these changes. The results showed that, (1) between 2000 and 2020, the ZZMA experienced a deficit in comprehensive ES supply and demand, and regions with rapid urbanization development were more likely to trigger imbalances in ES supply and demand; (2) the spatial mismatch between low–high ES supply and demand was primarily distributed in the built-up areas of various cities, while the high–low spatial mismatch was mostly found in forest and grassland areas; (3) the comprehensive urbanization level of the ZZMA was spatially negatively correlated with the ratio of ES supply and demand. Regions with lower ES balance were more susceptible to disturbances caused by urbanization; (4) population density was the key factor influencing the supply and demand of carbon sequestration, oxygen release, water conservation, and food provision services, while the proportions of forest land and construction areas had the greatest influence on the supply and demand of air purification and leisure services. It is important to ensure the ecological status of the northwestern, southwestern, and central mountainous and forested areas; maintain the agricultural status of the main grain-producing areas in the eastern plains; strengthen ecological restoration and green infrastructure in built-up areas; and formulate differentiated management policies to promote the sustainable supply of ES and safeguard the ecological security of the region.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To investigate the causes of water leakage in the waterproof hammer air valve and its impact on sustainable water resource management, the DN100 waterproof hammer air valve was taken as the research object. By using the overset grid solution method of ANSYS Fluent 2021 R1 software, the flow field simulation of the waterproof hammer air valve was carried out. The transient action during the ascent phase of the key structural component floating ball, and the velocity and pressure distribution of the flow field inside the air valve are analyzed. The results showed that by giving different inlet flow velocities, the normal flow velocity range for the floating ball to float up was below 35 m/s and above 50 m/s. When the inlet flow velocity was between 35 m/s and 50 m/s, the growth rate of the pressure difference above and below the floating ball increased from 1.48% to 5.79% and then decreased to 0.4%. The floating ball would not be able to float up due to excessive outlet pressure above, which would cause the DN100 waterproof hammer air valve to leak water and fail to provide water hammer protection. When the inlet flow rate is 5 m/s, the velocity and pressure inside the valve body increase with time during the upward movement of the floating ball inside the waterproof hammer air valve and tend to stabilize at 400 ms. Through the generated pressure and velocity cloud maps, it can be observed that the location of maximum pressure is at the bottom of the buoy, directly below the floating ball, and at the narrow channels on both sides of the outflow domain. The location of the maximum velocity is at the small inlet of the bottom of the buoy. When the inlet speed of the valve is constant, a large amount of water flow is blocked by the floating ball, reducing the flow velocity and forming partial backflow below the floating ball, with an obvious vortex phenomenon. A small portion of the water flow passes through the air valve at a high velocity from both ends of the channel, and the water flow below the floating ball is in an extremely unstable state under the impact of high-speed water flow, resulting in a large gradient of water flow velocity passing through the valve. The research results not only help to improve the operational efficiency of water resource management systems but also reduce unnecessary water resource waste, thereby supporting the goal of sustainable water resource management.</jats:p>"

With the rapid economic development and urbanization, the gap between urban and rural water supply has become increasingly evident, and rural areas face severe challenges such as insufficient water sources and substandard water quality. Yunnan Province, due to its unique topography and natural environment, encounters numerous difficulties in promoting the construction and development of urban–rural water supply integration, and there is a severe lack of research specifically focused on sustainable development measures for urban–rural water supply integration in Yunnan Province. In light of this, this paper first reviews the current research status on urban–rural water supply integration both domestically and internationally, pointing out that existing studies mainly focus on optimizing urban water supply systems, addressing rural drinking water safety issues, and exploring water supply management models. It then analyzes the challenges faced by Yunnan Province in advancing urban–rural water supply integration, including limitations in engineering construction, inadequate operation and maintenance, complex and variable water source conditions, and insufficient public awareness of water conservation. In response to these issues, a series of sustainable development measures are proposed, including revitalizing existing assets, enhancing construction planning and quality, promoting water pricing reforms, upgrading the technical system for drinking water safety assurance, and advancing the information technology construction of urban–rural water supply integration, with the aim of providing references and insights for the sustainable development of urban–rural water supply integration in Yunnan Province and other regions.</jats:p>"

This paper introduces an energy efficiency optimization algorithm for HWSNs based on the Deep Q-Network (HDQN). The algorithm aims to address these challenges by selecting the optimal information transmission path. The HDQN leverages energy differences between nodes and real-time environmental data to enhance network efficiency. Its reward function takes into account node distance, remaining energy, and relay node count to balance node participation and minimize overall energy consumption. The Deep Q-Network (DQN) uses the mean squared error for precise reward estimation, and an improved packet header structure supports effective routing decisions. Simulation results show that the HDQN significantly outperforms existing algorithms—EEHCHR, 2L-HMGEAR, NCOGA, DEEC, and SEP—in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, and robustness, demonstrating its potential to advance the performance of HWSNs. The research results of the paper provide a theoretical basis for future energy efficiency research in wireless communication and contribute to the study of the new generation of wireless networks.</jats:p>"
