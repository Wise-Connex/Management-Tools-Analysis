      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The construction industry in South Africa has a lot of potential but its performance is still restricted by numerous internal and external challenges. Unless these challenges are identified and understood better, further growth of this industry is likely to be hindered, which has negative economic implications for the South African economy.Objectives: This study investigated supply chain bottlenecks faced by the construction industry in South Africa. It also discussed solutions for addressing the identified bottlenecks in order to facilitate the continued development of supply chain management in the construction industry.Method: The study used a qualitative approach in which in-depth interviews were held with purposively selected senior managers drawn from the construction industry in South Africa. Content analysis using ATLAS.ti software was employed to identify the themes from the collected data.Findings: The findings of the study showed that supply chain management in the construction industry in South Africa is constrained by five major bottlenecks: skills and qualifications, procurement practices and systems, supply chain integration, supply chain relationships and the structure of the construction industry. Recommendations for addressing each of these five challenges were put forward.Conclusion: The study concludes that both awareness and application of supply chain management in the construction industry in South Africa remains inhibited, which creates opportunities for further improvements in this area to realise the full potential of the industry.</jats:p>"

It is challenged by the increased complexity of water supply management, mainly because of the doubled reality of administrative, legal, accounting and decision-making processes. Analyzed water pricing of existing cross-border utilities clearly demonstrates applied water pricing approaches mainly based on pure negotiation principles demonstrating different and often heavily asymmetric bargaining positions of partners. In order to overcome this situation applicable water pricing principles are presented. The model is demonstrated on real business cases of three water utilities from Central and South East Europe, but similar concepts are applicable for drinking water transfer between regions or municipalities in other countries.</jats:p>",

However, the predetermined storage targets adopted in the two-period model result in shortsighted decisions without considering the control of long-term reservoir operation. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new model to seek a more promising water supply operation policy by embedding the hedging rule derived from the two-period model in an optimization program for storage targets. Two modules are incorporated in the new model: the two-period model for optimizing water release decisions in each period with given storage targets and the optimization module to determine the optimal values of storage targets for connecting different periods. The Xujiahe water supply system is taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that the new model is superior to others based on standard operation policy or rule curves during droughts and reduces the maximum water shortage.</jats:p>",

So, it's urgent to take some actions to transit from the current high carbon economy to a low-carbon and high resource efficient economy. This paper examines a two-echelon agricultural product supply chain with a producer and a processor and the market demand is influenced by the retail price and the level of low-carbon technology. The optimal solutions in the decentralized and centralized agricultural product supply chain with or without low-carbon technology are studied. To make the decentralized agricultural product supply chain perform as well as the centralized agricultural product supply chain, the coordination mechanism of the low-carbon supply chain that few of papers focused explicitly on is designed. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to study the behaviors of supply chain members.</jats:p>",

This is a descriptive research using correlation and structural equation modeling. Management and specialists from many Vietnamese provinces were chosen as study subjects. Study instruments included a questionnaire and Smart-PLS. The results of data analysis demonstrate a positive and signiﬁcant association between a green supplier, green innovations, and environmental performance of an organization, as well as a negative yet signiﬁcant relationship.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: In South Africa, deemed the ‘gateway to Africa’, there is limited evidence of the  existence of a survey ranking third-party logistics providers (3PLs). This lack of comparative  information of the major 3PLs based on key outsourcing and ranking criteria complicates the  selection process for companies that intend to contract 3PLs.Objective: The purpose of this article was to determine the critical selection and ranking  criteria for the creation of an index to evaluate 3PLs in South Africa for developing a 3PL  benchmarking index.Method: Survey data were collected from 103 of the Top 500 Companies in Africa that use 3PLs  and operate within the sectors that mostly outsource logistics services in South Africa. A factor  analysis method was employed.Results: Three factors for 3PLs selection converged: service quality, information management  and compliance, and collaboration. The top three ranked categories for 3PLs selection are cost  and price structure, service delivery and the relationship with the 3PL provider. Most  respondents (90%) confirmed a need for a 3PLs index in South Africa.Conclusion: The results help managers with the strategic selection of 3PLs as these critical  logistics outsourcing selection criteria can be used to evaluate and rank 3PLs prior to  contracting. Based on the selection criteria for logistics outsourcing identified and ranked in  this article, a ranking index for 3PLs in South Africa can be developed.</jats:p>"

To address this issue in industry, suppliers are selected in the context of a resilient supply chain since it is one way to overcome disruptions. Selection of suppliers involves a variety of both qualitative and quantitative attributes. This research proposes the five main criteria of supplier selection which are chosen based on vulnerable areas and production requirements to develop flexibility in procuring material. In order to select appropriate suppliers for optimal order allocation the fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) is proposed which overcomes the vagueness of the information. Also to calculate the importance of each criterion fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used. Finally, the practical usefulness of the proposed method is ascertained through a case study in steel industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mismatch between supply and demand always exists within the supply chain and among retail stores. This situation is even worse for SMEs who work without state-of-the-art technologies, especially in terms of quantitative demand and size distribution in fashion industry. In this paper, we develop a cloud computing and smart device (CCSD) model to address the stochastic deviation between supply and demand. A computational experiment proves that the performance of inventory management in the supply chain and among retail stores can be significantly improved by application of CCSD, irrespective of demand and size distribution. In this paper, we illustrate its benefits for both normal and right-skewed demand distribution. We find that different stages in supply chain can also be coordinated by using the CCSD platform. The results show that using all-channel communication network through CCSD increases the information sharing performance.</jats:p>",

Two relevant civilizations, the Roman Empire and the Arab invasion, had great influence on Portugal's water and sanitation knowledge. Following the creation of Portugal in AD 1143, the Cistercian order was called for removing Arab influence and received large domains, where it built large monasteries, all provided with remarkable examples of water supply, sanitation and waste management, merging the Roman background in sanitary engineering with the local Arab experience. One of them, the Monastery of Christ in Tomar, is provided with a brilliant water and waste self-sustainable system, based on rainwater collection and storage, wastewater treatment and application in agriculture of treated waste and effluent. It testifies to the experience and innovative expertise of the Cistercian Order in sanitary/hydraulic engineering. It shows also one of the world's first examples of a wastewater treatment plant. Their knowledge influenced also the lifestyle and water management of Portuguese medieval cities, ruled by municipalism, and protected the population from pestilence until the first half of the fourteenth century, making Portugal a powerful country, in contrast with the rest of Europe.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the impact of integration with suppliers and supply disruption risk on environmental practices. It also examines the role of supplier integration and supply disruption risk on performance. Finally, it investigates the relationship between environmental practices and performance in order to sustain green supply chains. Based on 272 survey responses from supply and purchase managers, our research results support the positive impact of integration with suppliers and the negative impact of supply disruption risk on the adoption of environmental practices. Furthermore, they provide empirical evidence that environmental practices and integration with suppliers are positively associated with performance, while supply disruption risk is negatively associated with performance. This study identifies antecedents and establishes a research framework of GSCM. More importantly, it provides meaningful insights to managers regarding the implementation of environmental practices related to other supply chain practices for sustaining green supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To achieve the goals of sustainable economic and environmental protection, more and more firms intend to implement green supply chain (GSC) initiatives in their products. The adoption of GSC initiatives in turn influences the firms’ operations performance. Thus, the firms have to evaluate their performances carefully when implementing GSC initiatives. The performance evaluation of GSC initiatives is a laborious task, which needs to take into account many factors including the inventory level and assurance of supply purchasing-wise and the technical capability and the innovation capability manufacturing-wise, etc. This paper develops a new probabilistic linguistic VIKOR approach to support such an assessment. To do so, a new comparison method of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is first presented to effectively determine the probabilistic linguistic positive ideal solution and the probabilistic linguistic negative ideal solution. Next, a new defuzzification function of PLTSs is proposed to take into account the main-criteria weights and the sub-criteria weights which are represented by PLTSs. Furthermore, several probabilistic linguistic measures are introduced, such as the probabilistic linguistic group utility measure, the probabilistic linguistic individual regret measure and the probabilistic linguistic compromise measure. Finally, the compromise solution is obtained based on these three measures. The desirable advantages of the developed method are summarized as (1) it allows the evaluators to employ PLTSs to express the imprecise performances of the GSC initiatives with respect to various criteria, which greatly improves the elicitation of linguistic information; (2) it presents a probabilistic linguistic compromise solution, which is a maximum probabilistic linguistic group utility for the majority and a minimum probabilistic linguistic individual regret for the opponent. This proposed technique provides a simple and efficient decision making approach to assist the firms to make an appropriate decision in GSC management.</jats:p>"

The stabilizing effect is modest for plausible parameter values and more importantly, it is questionable whether any components of aggregate demand can be viewed as autonomous in the long run. By contrast, models that include the supply side (the labor market) and/or economic policy can address Harrodian instability and produce level and growth effects that resemble those derived in the literature on autonomous demand.</jats:p>",

All of these factors can lead to a significant amount of shortage of food items and a substantial retail loss. The recent development of tracing and tracking technologies, which facilitate effective monitoring of the inventory level and product quality continuously, can greatly improve the performance of food supply chain and reduce spoilage waste. Motivated by this recent technological advancement, our research aims to investigate the joint decision of pricing strategy, shelf space allocation, and replenishment policy in a single-item food supply chain setting, where our goal is to maximize the retailer’s total expected profit subject to stochastic retail demand. We prove the existence of optimality for the design of the perishable food supply chain. We then extend the single-item supply chain problem to a multi-item setting and propose an easy-to-implement searching algorithm to produce the optimal allocation of shelf space among these items for practical implementation. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In most supply chains (SCs), transaction relationships between suppliers and customers are commonly considered to be an extrapolation from a linear perspective. However, this traditional linear concept of an SC is egotistic and oversimplified and does not sufficiently reflect the complex and cyclical structure of supplier-customer relationships in current economic and industrial situations. The interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers should be analyzed using supply networks (SNs) rather than traditional linear SCs. Therefore, this paper reconceptualizes SCs as SNs in complex adaptive systems (CAS), and presents three main contributions. First, we propose an integrated framework of CAS network by synthesizing multi-level network analysis from the network-, community- and vertex-perspective. The CAS perspective enables us to understand the advances of SN properties. Second, in order to emphasize the CAS properties of SNs, we conducted a real-world SN based on the Japanese industry and describe an advanced investigation of SN theory. The CAS properties help in enriching the SN theory, which can benefit SN management, community economics and industrial resilience. Third, we propose a quantitative metric of entropy to measure the complexity and robustness of SNs. The results not only support a specific understanding of the structural outcomes relevant to SNs, but also deliver efficient and effective support to the management and design of SNs.</jats:p>"

Due to the high dependency on fossil fuels, fluctuations in prices and supply have macro/micro-economics effects for both energy exporters and importers. Therefore, understanding economic stability based on energy market changes is an important subject for policy makers and researchers. Norway, as a fossil fuel export country, is a good choice for the analysis of the relationships between the economics robustness and fossil fuel economics fluctuations. While the country is one of the pioneers in the field of sustainable energy utilization, they have tried to provide a robust economic situation for the oil exports revenues. In this article, the effects of energy changes on the economy are investigated in Norway. In this regard, first, the impact of oil price on macro-economic parameters is discussed. Afterwards, the main issues related to the energy economics including resilience of the energy sector, energy policies, economics analysis of the energy sector, and the electricity markets are discussed.</jats:p>",

As the primary photosynthetic products, carbohydrates are substrate for numerous metabolic and stress-protective reactions. Further, they have been shown to be involved in diverse signalling processes finally affecting and regulating plant stress response on a whole plant level. Sucrose metabolism is known to be central to many stress-related processes and enzymes catalysing its biosynthesis, transport and degradation have been shown to significantly impact stress resistance and acclimation output. However, due to the cyclic structure of sucrose metabolism involving sucrose cleavage in multiple compartments as well as energy-demanding re-synthesis via hexose phosphorylation, it is challenging to derive an unambiguous picture of its contribution to stress reactions. In the present study, a combined stress experiment comprising cold and high-light identified metabolism of sucrose and fumaric acid to significantly separate the stress response of a cold susceptible and a tolerant natural accession of<jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>. Kinetic modelling and simulation of subcellular rates of invertase-driven sucrose cleavage revealed a contrasting picture between the susceptible and the tolerant accession pointing to an important role of vacuolar invertase during initial stress response. Using a T-DNA insertion mutant with a dramatically reduced invertase activity provided evidence for a central role of the enzyme in stabilizing photosynthesis and the central energy metabolism during freezing and high-light stress. Reducing vacuolar invertase activity to about 3% of the wild type resulted in a strong increase of ADP and ATP levels indicating a severe effect on cytosolic and plastidial energy balance. Together with a significant decrease of maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) these results suggest that vacuolar invertase activity stabilizes cytosolic energy metabolism by supplying hexose equivalents being phosphorylated in the cytosol. Finally, the accompanying ATP consumption is essential for cytosolic phosphate balance which directly affects photosynthetic performance by the supply of ADP being crucial for photosynthetic ATP production.</jats:p>"

Spouse selectivity on the basis of human capital, distribution of bargaining power, and labor supply coordination within the household can differ by type of marriage and gender of the immigrant—and, consequently, affect how spouses supply labor to the market. Using the 2010 American Community Survey, a household labor market specialization index is created. Raw two-limit Tobit estimates show lower specialization in intermarried households for both genders, compared to their intra-married counterparts. The finding for intermarried female households is reversed, and gender-based specialization increases, when controls for human capital are introduced. The role of immigrant education for both intermarried men and women is underscored—specialization differences, by type of marriage, are insignificant when the immigrant has post-college education. At lower levels of immigrant education, native spouses supply more market labor. Intermarriage may also skew bargaining power in favor of native husbands in immigrant female households.</jats:p>",

This article builds on these articles by using data from the National Survey of Charities and Social Enterprises (NSCSE) to investigate the characteristics of third sector organisations on the supply side of the capacity-building ‘market’. We argue that the ambitions of the demand-led model need to be understood in the context of the embeddedness of these organisations. This is based on findings that suggests that, immediately prior to the identified discursive shift, a significant proportion of third sector capacity-building providers were embedded in the supply-led model through relationships with and funding from the public sector locally and nationally. This, we suggest, could thwart the ambitions of the demand-led model.</jats:p>",

A water budget is used for assessing the accuracy of the groundwater level determination. The computations of the water budget are based on evapotranspiration and the state of land surface hydrosphere. On the basis of the determined water budget, statistics and the prognosis for the next 12 months can be computed. In this paper, all the components of the water budget, such as precipitation, surface run-off and evapotranspiration, are studied for the three tested locations in Poland: Suwalki, Zegrzynski and Tarnow cells. The resultant water budget was also determined and presented graphically. On the basis of the water budget research, a prognosis was determined using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the parameters (2,0,2). A comparison between actual water budget data and a prediction prepared for 2015.08–2016.08 indicated that analysing a 12-month period provides a satisfactory prediction assessment.</jats:p>",

An integrated on-farm drainage management (IFDM) system is an effective method of treatment by successively irrigating zones with drainage water. Each zone is cultivated with crops that have increasing tolerance to salinity, so that the drainage water effluents are minimized to an extent that the final drainage water volume is collected into an evaporation pond. The methodology of the system is proposed herein for a regional irrigation-drainage network (E1 in Agoulinitsa irrigation district in western Greece) as a method of reducing the disposal of agrochemicals in the coastal environment. Based on the design principles of an IFDM system, both the surface area of every irrigation zone and the costs of installing and operating the system are assessed. A scenario regarding the volume of drainage water that must be treated is examined as a sensitivity analysis. The results show that almost 15% of the cultivated area must be bounded for non-productive uses, resulting in a significant economic impact on the net present value of the investment.</jats:p>",

About 183 typical water pollution incidents took place between 2001 and 2014 in China and were analyzed in this study. The results indicate that chemical pollution, heavy metal pollution, and algal blooms were the main types of contamination, accounting for 36%, 20%, and 9%, respectively, of the total pollution. Illegal discharges, pollution water leakage, and leakage during transport were the main sources of chemical pollution, accounting for 63%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. Illegal industrial discharges, leakage incidents, industrial production, and engineering construction pollution were the main contributors to heavy metal pollution, and accounted for 81%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. Industries should promote their environmental responsibility. It is also essential for government and industry to work together to strengthen supervision of industrial discharges and strictly control pollution sources. Alternative emergency response mechanisms for different pollution sources were analyzed allowing guidance to reduce pollution and providing a theoretical basis to establish and improve water pollution management.</jats:p>",

Electricity is a major contributor to the environmental impact of water supply and wastewater treatment, particularly in countries like China where electricity is largely generated using coal and has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity use can also constitute one of the main costs for water and wastewater companies. China is an important country for the study of energy for water, particularly in urban areas where population is rapidly increasing. China's daily wastewater treatment capacity has increased dramatically over the last decade and a half, and energy use for both wastewater treatment and potable water supply has grown significantly. This paper deals with the challenge of energy for water in China. It reviews the growing body of work on energy for conventional water supply and wastewater treatment in urban China. The review covers energy for all parts of conventional water supply and wastewater treatment, including energy for sourcing, treating and distributing groundwater and surface water, and energy for primary and secondary treatment and sludge treatment and disposal.</jats:p>",

Seafood-associated foodborne illness outbreaks are not common and on an average four outbreaks occur each year in NSW. Most of the outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 were related to ciguatera poisoning. The regulation of the seafood industry and the management of food safety is an example of the coordinated work of multiple government agencies and organizations in which NSW Food Authority is responsible for managing the overall risks through the Seafood Safety Scheme.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Sustainable biomass supply chain management (SBSCM) problem is a multi-objective optimisation (MOO) problem since the objectives of each sustainability dimension and (or) each components under a same sustainability dimension can be conflicting. It is unlikely to have a single solution that could simultaneously satisfy all objectives. Therefore, achieving optimum for one objective requires compromise of other objectives. Several approaches have been developed to solve MOO problems. The simplest way reported from the academicians is to transform MOO problem into single objective optimisation (SOO) problem by converting all objectives into a similar form of objectives. However, converting environmental impacts into economic form might produce sub-optimal solution as the optimal result is highly dependent on the magnitude of the penalty cost. This paper presents a systematic approach which integrates both economic and environmental concerns in the supply chain by using the concept of analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Instead of merely focusing on carbon emission, this paper incorporates other environmental indicators as well, i. e., global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), nutrification potential (NP), aquatic toxicity potential (ATP), terrestrial toxicity potential (TTP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP), water footprint and land footprint. On top of that, this paper also proposes a graphical illustration method to present the sustainability performance of the results. Both economic sustainability and environmental sustainability are expressed in a vector form. With the aid of this graphical representation, the tendency of the process towards each sustainability dimension can be clearly seen. A case study in Johor state is used to demonstrate the proposed method and a palm biomass supply chain with high sustainability performance (<jats:inline-formula id=\"j_cppm-2017-0024_ineq_001_w2aab3b7b6b1b6b1aab1c16b1b1Aa\">\n                     <jats:alternatives>\n                        <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"j_cppm-2017-0024_ingr_001_w2aab3b7b6b1b6b1aab1c16b1b1aaAa\" xlink:href=\"graphic/cppm-2017-0024_inline1.png\" />\n                        <m:math xmlns:m=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n                           <m:mrow>\n                              <m:msup>\n                                 <m:mi>λ</m:mi>\n                                 <m:mrow>\n                                    <m:mi>S</m:mi>\n                                    <m:mi>C</m:mi>\n                                    <m:mi>M</m:mi>\n                                 </m:mrow>\n                              </m:msup>\n                           </m:mrow>\n                        </m:math>\n                        <jats:tex-math>${\\lambda ^{SCM}}$</jats:tex-math>\n                     </jats:alternatives>\n                  </jats:inline-formula>= 0.8437) is synthesised in this paper.</jats:p>",

Thus, the joint distribution of irrigation water and ET0 can reveal water shortage risk under the condition of the manual water supply. In order to understand their relationships and overcome the drawbacks of different marginal distributions of hydrological variables, Archimedean copulas are introduced. Based on the data series of ET0 and irrigation water in the Luhun irrigation district of China, the univariate marginal distributions of ET0 and irrigation water are first selected. Then, with the Gumbel–Hougaard copula in the Archimedean copulas, the joint distribution of ET0 and irrigation water is proposed. The results show that the best-fitting marginal distributions of ET0 and irrigation water are generalized extreme values and normal distributions, respectively, but for their joint distribution, the Gumbel–Hougaard copula is the best-fitting one. The water shortage risks with different encounter situations of ET0 and irrigation water are better revealed using the proposed copula-based joint distribution.</jats:p>",

In this study, water use events at the outdoor tap were captured using recorded sound. Outdoor taps at 10 homes were fitted with small-sized microphones and digital sound recorders. Sound files recorded over a 1-month period were used in the analysis. In the preliminary analysis, a human operator browsed through the sound recordings, picking out tap use events based on visually recognizable waveform and spectrogram features, then audibly verified each event identified before labeling. The performance of the corresponding automatic detection algorithm was reasonable, showing that water use events can be detected at precision and recall rates of at least 80% under suitable conditions. The results also showed that the technique is less suitable where the drop in pressure during peak demand periods results in significant reduction in the tap flowrate. Indirect flow sensing approaches are attractive for investigating water use event timing, because of the relatively lower cost when compared to conventional or smart water meters. Plumbing changes are not required as the recorder can be mounted on any exposed pipe section near the fixture of interest.</jats:p>",

Secondly, to identify the sustainability performance expected from sustainability practices implemented in different supply chain stages. The study reports on a set of case studies representing four different food supply chain (FSC) stages: breeding/growing, processing, distribution and retail. The findings indicate that each stage selects different collaboration schemes for sustainability practices’ implementation, prioritizing relations with upstream actors, namely grower/breeder, as these are key actors responsible for ensuring product quality and safety. In addition, the type of collaborative relationship is shown to be predominantly transactional for environmental and community practices, especially for solving specific short-term issues. Finally, varied areas of environmental and social sustainability performance are recognized, upstream and downstream, as a result of collaborative practices applied in different FSC stages, showing the diverse sustainability objectives pursued along the chain.</jats:p>"

In this study, the rainwater harvesting tank size was investigated to meet five water-need levels of a mixed goat–sheep farm using a daily water balance method. This method was applied using daily rainfall data for a period of 16 years from six meteorological stations in selected regions of Greece, characterized by different rainfall regimes and well-developed livestock activity, taking into account, among other parameters, the water needs of animals, the rainwater collection area and the runoff coefficient. There is a great variation in the rainwater harvesting tank size among the stations studied due to differences in the annual rainfall and the maximum dry period. Results showed that meeting full demands (100% reliability) requires tank sizes ranging from 20 m3 for short dry period stations–low demand scenario (320 L/day) to 115 m3 for long dry period stations–high demand scenario (576 L/day), assuming a maximum collection area of 450 m2. Correspondingly, reliability analysis showed that very high values of reliability (95%) can be obtained with tank sizes ranging from 10 to 85 m3, respectively.</jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to show how a specific kind of direct supply, Collaborative Food Alliances, may help to foster sustainable urban–rural linkages. This paper presents, compares and discusses seven different cases, located in five different countries: Movimento de Integração Campo-Cidade (MICC) (Brazil), Canasta Comunitaria Utopía (Ecuador), GAS Testaccio Meticcio and Gasper (Italy), Grupo de Consumo Vera and Grupo de Consumo de Russafa (Spain), and De Groene Schuur at Zeist (The Netherlands).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a server power system, a standby converter is required in order to provide the standby output, monitor the system’s status, and communicate with the server power system. Since these functions are always required, losses from the standby converter are produced even though the system operates in normal mode. For these reasons, the losses deteriorate the total efficiency of the system. In this paper, a new structure is proposed to eliminate the losses from the standby converter of a server power supply. The key feature of the proposed structure is that the main direct current (DC)/DC converter substitutes all of the output power of the standby converter, and the standby converter is turned off in normal mode. With the proposed structure, the losses from the standby converter can be eliminated in normal mode, and this leads to a higher efficiency in overall load conditions. Although the structure has been proposed in the previous work, very important issues such as a steady state analysis, the transient responses, and how to control the standby converter are not discussed. This paper presents these issues further. The feasibility of the proposed structure has been verified with 400 V link voltage, 12 V/62.5 A main output, and a 12 V/2.1 A standby output server power system.</jats:p>"

The article is exploratory and descriptive in nature. A survey was conducted among light vehicle manufacturers and the findings analysed by means of descriptive statistics. The results revealed that postponement decisions could be used to determine the supply chain architecture used by light vehicle manufacturers in South Africa. With regard to postponement decisions, the study found that all the light vehicle manufacturers made use of a lean supply chain strategy, while a few made use of an agile supply chain strategy. The results also revealed that all the production lines engaged in full speculation based on projected forecasting, and therefore employed a lean supply chain strategy. In terms of the postponement decisions made in line with the parent company of origin, European manufacturers 1 and 2 kept a work-in-progress inventory of stock to be customised for a particular customer. These manufacturers thus employed a lean and agile supply chain strategy, while most of the manufacturers adopted a lean supply chain strategy. All the manufacturers, except Asian manufacturer 1 and the American manufacturer, employed both lean and agile supply chain strategies. Therefore, the majority of the light vehicle manufacturers employed lean supply chain strategies in their inbound and outbound supply chain, while a few employed an agile supply chain strategy in their outbound supply chain, there by indicating leaglity. The article provides evidence of some form of postponement practice being followed by light vehicle manufacturers.</jats:p>"

CPFs are gravity fed, typically making water production a major limiting factor to a CPF's lifetime and acceptability. Directly connecting CPFs to in-line pumping systems or systems with an elevated storage tank would allow filter usage for constant water treatment at increased pressures, increasing the quantity of treated water. Ceramic disks were manufactured for testing in a specially designed housing apparatus. Filters of varying thicknesses and clay to sawdust mass ratios were manufactured to fit tightly. Flowrate and microbiological removal efficacy (logarithmic reduction value (LRV)) were determined over the testing period at various pressures. Flowrate values ranged from 2.44 to 9.04 L per hour, significantly higher than traditional CPF technology. LRVs ranged from 1.1 to 2.0, lower than traditional CPF technology but still effective at removing most Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria. Filters proved effective at removing total and fecal coliforms at pressures less than 70 kilopascals. The optimum filter had a thickness of 3.2 cm and clay to sawdust ratio of 6:1 by mass. Filters proved to be ineffective if flowrates were above 5 L/h.</jats:p>",

Remaining pipe wall thickness data from limited dense inspection are modelled with spatial statistics approaches. The spatial dependence in the available data and some subjective requirements provide a reference for selecting a most efficient sampling inspection scheme. With the learned model and the selected sampling scheme, the effort of inspecting the residual part of the same pipeline or cohort will be significantly reduced from dense inspection to sampling inspection, and the full information can be reconstructed from samples while maintaining a reasonable accuracy. The recovered thickness map can be used as an equivalent measure to the dense inspection for subsequent structural analysis for failure risk estimation or remaining life assessment.</jats:p>",

This study considers the Monte Carlo simulation as the only viable solution to tackle this critical question, which can be used to evaluate the economics of diverse water supply schemes incorporating those alternatives and prepare long-term water supply planning. Built upon actual and conceptual cost data for each alternative, total project cost and operation and management cost estimation models for each alternative were developed and used for generating mean UWPC information using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. The mean UWPC differences between alternative water supply schemes were found to be statistically significant and the simulation results revealed that ASR is the lowest-cost option to provide drinkable water for both cases when a conventional water treatment plant (WTP) and advanced WTP were used as a connected post-treatment process.</jats:p>",

Constructed wetlands and rainwater harvesting systems are commonly used as on-site water supply systems for distributed adaptation. The purpose of this study is to build a community water supply model and to evaluate the performance of low impact development (LID) modules as water supply facilities. The community water supply model simulates four water balances, namely, household storage, the constructed wetland, the rainwater harvesting system, and paddy fields. Three performance indicators are utilized, namely, the water saving efficiency, tolerance duration, and water use efficiency. The results show that the rainwater harvesting system saves up to 25.8% of the total domestic water demand, and the constructed wetland saves up to 40% of the irrigation water demand in Xingshi Village, located in northern Taiwan. In conclusion, the constructed wetland and rainwater harvesting system are good candidates for on-site water supply systems at the community scale. However, constructing a community water supply system requires more study, including a climate change risk assessment and the optimization of adaptation measures.</jats:p>"

Our contribution is twofold. The first is to test the work‐preference model and the second is to investigate the impact of arts grants on artists’ labor supply. The empirical specification draws two distinctions: between arts and non‐arts income and between labor and non‐labor income. Non‐labor income is divided into three different sources: (1) spouse's income, (2) income from financial assets and social benefits, and (3) arts grants and subsidies. Our contribution adds to the literature by estimating the significance of these various income sources on the time allocated to arts work, non‐arts work, and leisure. The results provide convincing evidence for the work‐preference model, and ad hoc evidence shows that art grants have a significant positive effect on the supply of arts hours. This finding supports arts policy and shows the impact of art grants on artists’ motivation to work on their arts. The causality of wages on supply is demonstrated by estimating the effects of wage shocks (grants) on arts labor supply using fixed‐effect and difference‐in‐difference methods.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a case study of Ambo (Ethiopia) is performed, on basis of document analysis, interview and focus group discussion.

The indicators and their interrelations subsequently allow coining efficiency-improvement and effectiveness-improvement strategies. The paper finds that most performance improvement strategies do not involve a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: investing in the maintenance of the water distribution network, involving the community in the production process, ensuring a minimum quality threshold, improving procurement policies, and relying on ground water contribute to both and deserve being implemented. On other aspects, related to commercial policies and the quality of water, local policymakers need to make a choice between pursing efficiency and effectiveness. The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on the added-value of governance for the 2030 Agenda, and paves the way for benchmarking Ethiopian local governments, and warrants further research onto the added value of participation for development.</jats:p>"

Relative advantage that firms can achieve and the perceived benefits in improving product quality and information sharing along with better traceability in the supply chain were significant predictors of RFID adoption. Within the technological contexts, the visible obstacles of RFID adoption through quality of transmission and reliability, understanding of overly high investment costs, and importance of the privacy concerns were all significant. The IT readiness of a firm was also a significant predictor of RFID adoption in the organizational factor, however the size of an organization was not at all linked to the RFID adoption decisions.

For this purpose, one hundred and twenty seven households were proportionately distributed among wards 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8 and selected for data collection. Structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Chi-square test was used to find the factors associated with willingness to pay for improved water supply system. This study shows that there is no any significant association between willingness to pay for improved water supply system and social, demographic and economic variables. However, water source, dental pain, water quantity, want for change are water fetching time have significant association with willingness to pay for improved water supply system. Cases of Jaundice is significantly associated with willingness to pay for improved water supply system However, there is no significant association between willingness to pay and satisfaction from WUC activities, water purification, diarrhea, dysentery, seasonal flu, and suffering from worm. So, it can be concluded that type of water source, quantity, fetching time, will for change, and prevalence of some disease (Jaundice, Dental Pain) are the major factors influencing willingness to pay for improved water supply system in the study area.apriya Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, Vol. 5 (December 2016), Page: 1-13</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Autophagosomes are double-membrane vesicles generated during autophagy. Biogenesis of the autophagosome requires membrane acquisition from intracellular compartments, the mechanisms of which are unclear. We previously found that a relocation of COPII machinery to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) generates ERGIC-derived COPII vesicles which serve as a membrane precursor for the lipidation of LC3, a key membrane component of the autophagosome. Here we employed super-resolution microscopy to show that starvation induces the enlargement of ER-exit sites (ERES) positive for the COPII activator, SEC12, and the remodeled ERES patches along the ERGIC. A SEC12 binding protein, CTAGE5, is required for the enlargement of ERES, SEC12 relocation to the ERGIC, and modulates autophagosome biogenesis. Moreover, FIP200, a subunit of the ULK protein kinase complex, facilitates the starvation-induced enlargement of ERES independent of the other subunits of this complex and associates via its C-terminal domain with SEC12. Our data indicate a pathway wherein FIP200 and CTAGE5 facilitate starvation-induced remodeling of the ERES, a prerequisite for the production of COPII vesicles budded from the ERGIC that contribute to autophagosome formation.</jats:p>"

The Eulerian-Lagrangian operator-splitting method is employed to solve the model with axial dispersion. Satisfactory results were obtained after the numerical solution was tested against the analytical and other numerical solutions. The water quality simulation results without the reaction item show that when water velocity is low (or Peclet numbers are small), dispersion is dominant and significantly affects the numerical simulation results. The contaminant concentration at downstream node gradually increased with time along the upstream pipelines from the source, which is particularly reflected in the terminal. The simulation results show that the biomass concentration may demonstrate synthetic effects of axial dispersion and reaction, i.e. mutual promotion, given the multicomponent (substrate, residual chlorine, and microbial biomass) reaction-transport processes. It is particularly reflected in the low flow velocity.</jats:p>",

This article investigates the environmental stewardship of Kansas well owners, a key social group whose protection of water supplies is pivotal to prolonging groundwater formations. My guiding research question is: Does owning a well lead to a distinct form of citizenship? To answer this, I constructed one of the only data sets of well owners used in sociology by surveying 864 well owners and non–well owners throughout Kansas. My findings reveal that well owners are more aware of the state's water supplies than the general population, they express environmental motivations to conserve water, they deliberately conserve water more often than non–well owners, and well ownership is significantly correlated with highly ranking water security as a challenge facing Kansas. Furthermore, a majority of well owners check their well depth and test for water contamination, routines that connect them to their water supply. This suggests that well owners exhibit “groundwater citizenship” and can be conceptualized as aquifer stewards.</jats:p>",

(2) Human activity intensity has a significant impact on the change of stream structure and connectivity. Under the background of economy domination, the stronger human intervention is, the simpler stream structure will be, and the poorer stream connectivity will be. (3) From the view of time series, it is considered that human activities are the main reasons for affecting the change of stream structure and connectivity in the short term, while the natural factors have little effect. (4) The length of low-level streams is more affected by human activities than that of the high-level streams, but water surface ratio is opposite. This study can provide a reference for coordinating the contradiction between socio-economic development and protection of stream systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors explored how a technology model captured the factors that motivated and demotivated students to accept a new learning management system in online supply chain courses at an accredited public American university. Technology resistance is a well-known social science problem that results in reduced performance in business although it has rarely been examined in higher education. A new LMS is mandatory technology that is necessary to use in order to perform well in online global supply chain management courses. The authors drew a sample of graduating supply chain management students to explore this problem because these participants represent the next generation of employees who are likely to work with mandatory technology. The authors argue that it is important to study management students because their technology acceptance motivations will generalize to the future supply chain workforce. If decision makers could understand why management students resist new software, then they could develop strategies to address the critical success factors in hopes that organizational performance might be increased. The design was statistically powerful according to social research standards because the authors examined actual behavior by measuring grade as the dependent variable instead of relying on behavioral intent (BI) which is a subjective perceptional factor because participants are generally asked to self-report this through a survey. In keeping with published empirical literature the authors determined that perceived usefulness predicted BI using multiple regression. In contrary to the existing literature, they did not find that perceived resources (PR) was causally related to actual performance, although they did observe through regression that BI could be forecasted from PR. Their regression model indicated that perceived ease of use (PEOU) was not related to BI but in regression they found PEOU significantly impacted actual performance. These were two contradictory findings that PU impacted BI but not actual performance yet PR and PEOU predicted actual performance but not BI. Another unique departure from the empirical literature was that Computer Self Efficacy (CSE), Perceptions of External Control (PEC), and Computer Anxiety (CANX) were not related to either BI or actual performance. An interesting finding was that perceived enjoyment was strongly related to both BI and actual performance, although the perceptions were opposite between intention versus actual behavior. Multiple regression revealed that lower perceptions of enjoyment was significantly linked to BI while strong perceptions of enjoyment predicted actual performance. Although the authors were certain that peer influence would impact BI and actual performance, in their sample they did not find any support for subjective norm pressure on BI or actual performance. In a similar breakthrough they determined that job relevance and output quality were not causally linked to BI or actual performance. Another statistically significant finding was that positive perceptions of voluntariness were causally related to BI through multiple regression tests and also positively related to actual performance based on hierarchical regression. The authors determined that results demonstrability was causally related to BI from their multiple regression tests but interestingly it was not related to actual performance. The authors extensively discuss the above findings in their conclusions and provide many recommendations for future research. Finally, another valuable contribution the authors made to the scholarly community of practice through this study was to develop large effect-size parsimonious models with very few required factors that captured 56% of the variance on BI and 49% of the variance on actual performance.</jats:p>",

Polypropylene random (PPR), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and stainless steel (SS) are the common materials for pipelines in domestic hot water systems (DHWS), and biofilm growth characteristics, and biofilm microbial communities and biological diversity on the walls of pipelines are affected by the pipeline materials to a certain extent. In this paper, the effects of different materials on the growth characteristics and diversity of microbial communities were studied. The results showed that after about 60 days, the bacteria of the biofilm on the wall of pipelines completed a microbial growth cycle. Compared with PPR and SS, a greater amount of the total number of bacteria, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) attached to the PVC pipeline. Although the types of bacteria on the pipelines were similar, the proportions of species were different. Proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria at the phylum level on all the walls of the PPR, PVC and SS pipelines, and the dominant bacteria at the genus level changed before and after the exfoliation of biofilm. Some potential pathogens, such as Pseudomonas and Legionella, were detected in biofilm, so effective biofilm disinfection should be considered to ensure biological safety in DHWS.</jats:p>",

The article is exploratory and descriptive in nature. A survey was conducted among light vehicle manufacturers and the findings analysed by means of descriptive statistics. The results revealed that postponement decisions could be used to determine the supply chain architecture used by light vehicle manufacturers in South Africa. With regard to postponement decisions, the study found that all the light vehicle manufacturers made use of a lean supply chain strategy, while a few made use of an agile supply chain strategy. The results also revealed that all the production lines engaged in full speculation based on projected forecasting, and therefore employed a lean supply chain strategy. In terms of the postponement decisions made in line with the parent company of origin, European manufacturers 1 and 2 kept a work-in-progress inventory of stock to be customised for a particular customer. These manufacturers thus employed a lean and agile supply chain strategy, while most of the manufacturers adopted a lean supply chain strategy. All the manufacturers, except Asian manufacturer 1 and the American manufacturer, employed both lean and agile supply chain strategies. Therefore, the majority of the light vehicle manufacturers employed lean supply chain strategies in their inbound and outbound supply chain, while a few employed an agile supply chain strategy in their outbound supply chain, there by indicating leaglity. The article provides evidence of some form of postponement practice being followed by light vehicle manufacturers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To analyze incentives for investing in the capacity to generate renewable electricity, we model the trade-off between renewable (e.g., wind) and nonrenewable (e.g., natural gas) technology. Renewable technology has a higher investment cost and yields only an intermittent supply of electricity; nonrenewable technology is reliable and has lower investment cost but entails both fuel expenditures and carbon emission costs. With reference to existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts—the vertically integrated electricity supplier, market competition, and partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity—and examine the effect of carbon taxes on the cost and share of wind capacity in an energy portfolio. We find that the intermittency of renewable technologies drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms, which suggests that charging more for emissions could unexpectedly discourage investment in renewables. We also show that market liberalization may reduce investment in renewable capacity while increasing the overall system’s cost and emissions. Fixed-price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but not without possibly creating other problems. In short, actions to reduce the intermittency of renewable sources may be more effective than carbon taxes alone at promoting investment in renewable generation capacity. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0621 . </jats:p>",

The developed model can be used to verify node pressures, head losses, and fluid flow rate and velocity in each pipe. The algorithm is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), considering real and discrete variables and avoiding premature convergence to local optima using objective function penalization. The model yields the minimum cost of the network, the node pressures and the velocities in the pipes. The pressures and velocities are calculated using the hydraulic simulator Epanet. Some benchmark problems are used to test the applicability of the developed model, considering WDN for small-, medium-, and large-scale problems.

Stock‐outs can be costly if demand exceeds available product supply, as sales are deferred or lost when prospective customers are waitlisted. Recent research on diffusion under supply constraints has analyzed launch strategies to minimize the chance of stock‐outs. Others suggest that waitlisted buyers generate social exposure that can boost customer demand and shape the diffusion process. We develop a generalized model of new product diffusion under supply constraints that explicitly accounts for endogenous customer waitlisting and waitlist‐generated word‐of‐mouth. We estimate the model for a prominent example of waitlisting, the launch of the Toyota Prius hybrid‐electric vehicle in the U.S.A., finding evidence of positive word‐of‐mouth from waitlisted buyers. Inclusion of endogenous supply constraints and waitlisting also alters the estimated contribution of marketing and adopter word‐of‐mouth.</jats:p><jats:p>Copyright © 2018 System Dynamics Society</jats:p>",

In model formulation process the cost coefficients of the objectives are considered as fuzzy numbers and the supplies and demands are considered as fuzzy random variables with known fuzzy probability distribution from the view point of probabilistic as well as possibilistic uncertainties involved with the model. A fuzzy programming model is first constructed by applying chance constrained programming methodology in fuzzy environment. Then, the model is decomposed on the basis of the tolerance ranges of the fuzzy numbers associated with it. The individual optimal solution of each decomposed objectives is found in isolation to construct the membership goals of the objectives. Finally, priority based fuzzy goal programming technique is used to achieve the highest degree of each of the defined membership goals to the extent possible by minimizing the under deviational variables and thereby obtaining optimal allocation of products by using distance function in a cost minimizing decision making environment. An illustrative example is solved and compared with existing technique to explore the potentiality of the proposed methodology.</jats:p>",

The study was carried out in the period January–May 2009 and focussed on three selected water supply zones (Airwing, Malonje and Sadzi) especially for determination of the components of non-revenue water (NRW). Field measurements of flow and utility records formed the basis of the study. It was established that the NRW for Zomba for the period 1999–2008 ranged from 20 to 36%. During the study period, the average UFW in the specific study areas was 13% of which 81% were real losses (Airwing); 62% with 58% real losses (Malonje); and 51% with 60% real losses (Sadzi). It was concluded that UFW for 2009 Zomba was above 23%, achieved by good performing water utilities in developing countries. Real losses were higher than apparent losses in all three specific study areas and this was driven by pressure. The study recommends real loss reduction through pipe replacement and improved pressure management, and apparent loss reduction through improved metering. Reduction of water losses is imperative in the wake of climate change and the need to attain Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>",

A supply chain system is a dynamical system which contains a number of lead times among supply nodes and is susceptible to demand variation. Control theoretic modelling approaches are proved to be very effective in developing ordering policies for such systems. In this work, we developed a linear discrete time model of a supply chain with multiple supply nodes and pure delays. The model presented here can be used to develop an optimal ordering and distribution policy so that the entire system remains stable. In addition to the mathematical model of the supply chain, a simulation model is also developed using Simulink® toolbox SimEvents®. The simulation model can be used to test various ordering policies to determine system stability. In this work the simulation model is used to test system stability and can be further used to find optimum ordering and optimum routing policies under uncertainty by running a Monte Carlo type simulation using the developed simulation model.</jats:p>",

The district is of hilly terrain with an average rainfall of 1,500 mm per year, yet the district faces acute water shortage during the winter period. The hydro-geological and meteorological characteristics of the sub-watersheds were also studied. The district had very poor soil depth (&amp;lt;50 cm), low water holding capacity of soils (27–28%) with mostly sandy-loam texture. The sub-watersheds were found to have more than 70% first-order streams, higher bifurcation ratio (3.31), higher drainage density (3.99 km/km2) and higher stream density (8.65/km2). Sub-watersheds are mostly elongated with average form factors of 0.21. The rainfall pattern, soil type and morphometry of sub-watersheds indicated poor in situ moisture storage and limited possibility of stream water harvesting. To mitigate the scarcity of water in South Sikkim, the only option left for the planners is to promote household roof water harvesting so that water demand can be met during the average consecutive dry period of 30 days.</jats:p>",

Some commentators argue that the Accord is a ‘game changer’ in times of corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially because it includes transnational buying companies in a legally binding contract with union federations. This article takes the Accord as an interesting case for how labour networks become part of a transnational governance arrangement. Taking a cultural political economy perspective, the author assumes that the Accord marks a practice of implementing ethical demands under conditions of supply chain capitalism and argues that calling the Accord a paradigm shift would be overly optimistic: while labour networks were able to use a crisis in the regime of CSR policies, they could not challenge the managerial culture of translating political demands according to the conventions of supply chain management. These conventions separate the sources of profit from the political claim for decent labour standards. In a transnational governance initiative, labour networks rely on such management conventions, since they are constitutive of the production network. From this perspective the Accord is an impressive reaction to the Rana Plaza disaster, but not a game changer.</jats:p>",

Current evaluation methods are rooted in water quality index, which assesses the water quality based on the exact concentration of various pollutants. However, the interaction between the pollutants and the water environment should also be considered. This paper suggests a new approach, which integrates pollutant interaction with water environment and parameter uncertainty to water quality evaluation. The new approach is compared with traditional methods. Then, an inexact evaluation model, the integrated water quality evaluation model under uncertainty, is established in accordance with the proposed approach, in which catastrophe theory is used to deal with the ambiguous internal mechanism of the interaction between the pollutants and the water environment. As there are significant uncertainties in water quality evaluations, fuzzy random variables are employed to describe the inexact monitoring data. To solve the proposed model, a new algorithm is designed. The model is then applied to an actual case: Lake Chaohu, China. The results are compared between the proposed method and China's current evaluation method (i.e. max-index method). Some brief analysis and discussion are given about the results, which could be helpful in guiding environmental management decision-making.</jats:p>",

In this study, a system composed of a PRV and a pump as turbine (PAT) in combination with intelligent pressure management is proposed and its performance is analysed experimentally. For this, data analysis using hydraulic modelling and extensive experimentation for a case study in Germany was performed. During the laboratory tests, the pressure at the critical point of the system could be successfully maintained at the selected value at variable discharges during a characteristic day, as a result of the advanced pressure modulation. Additionally, up to 2.3 kW of electrical energy were recovered, when the applied PAT was operating under full load, with a maximum total net system efficiency of 40%. Furthermore, the proposed pressure management was found to increase the water savings by up to 16% compared to conventional PRVs. This study concludes that the PAT-PRV-system may be suitable in WDNs with high differences in altitude, high operational pressures and high demand variability. For its application, the benefits and the investment costs, as well as the seasonal flow and pressure variations in the WDN should be analysed in detail.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background and aims: Faith-based organizations (FBOs) provide a substantial portion of the health care services in many African countries. FBO facilities do consider family planning and reproduc­tive health services as essential to reducing maternal and child mortality, and to the growth of healthy families. Many health facilities, however, struggle to maintain adequate stocks of repro­ductive health (RH) supplies because of the various RH supply chains and funding sources, which often operate separately from other medicines and supplies. The purpose of this study is to iden­tify the types of supply chain systems used by African faith-based health facilities to acquire repro­ductive health products (clotrimazole, combined oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive implants, CycleBeads®, emergency contraception, Erythromycin, female condoms, injectable contracep­tives, intra-uterine contraceptive devices, magnesium sulfate, male condoms, Methyldopa, Miso­prostol, Nifedpine, Oxytocin, and Progestin-only pills), to describe their problems and challenges, and to identify possible corrective actions.\nMethods: Through email surveys, phone interviews, and on-site visits, we studied the supply chains of 46 faith-based health facilities in 13 African countries. Sixteen RH commodities, including contraceptives, were selected as indicators.\nResults: Of the 46 facilities surveyed, 55 percent faced stockouts of one or more products in the three months prior to the survey. Stockouts were less common for contraceptives than for other RH products. Significant strengths of the FBO supply chain included creativity in finding other sources of commodities in the face of stockouts, staff designated to monitor quality of the commodities, high capacity for storage, low incidence of expired products, few instances of poor quality, and strong financial sustainability mechanisms, often including patient fees. Weaknesses included unreliable commodity sources and power supplies, long distances to depots, and prob­lems maintaining the cold chain.\nConclusions: By studying the supply chains of faith-based health facilities, Christian Connections for International Health (CCIH) and its members have created new awareness among FBOs and international agencies of the importance and challenges of these systems and have suggested actions toward improvement. The Alliance of Christian Faith-Based Organizations for Family Plan­ning (ACFBOFP) formed in Cameroon to strengthen commodity security may be a good model for other FBOs to consider. Cost recovery models with stronger quantification and forecasting systems, including trained staff, can help meet the FP and RH needs of families and can help assure the long-term sustainability of FBO health systems. This study can serve as a frame of reference as we move forward, anticipating an acceleration in interest to strengthen FBO supply chains to reach as many communities as possible with available, quality supplies and services.</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is to provide high quality input current and to increase the energy efficiency of the output pulse generator by means of improving the circuit topologies of the power supply main blocks. In study, the principle of constructing the power supply for micro resistance welding, which provides high values of output welding current and high accuracy of welding pulse formation, makes it possible to reduce energy losses, and provides high quality of consumed input current, is represented. The multiphase topology of the charger with power factor correction based on SEPIC converters is suggested as the most efficient for charging the supercapacitor storage module. The multicell topology of the supercapacitor energy storage with voltage equalizing is presented. The parameters of the converter cells are evaluated. The calculations of energy efficiency of the power supply’s input and output converters based on suggested topologies are carried out and verified in MATLAB Simulink. The power factor value greater than 99 % is derived.</jats:p>",

In this study, we measured the concentrations of 22 OCPs in the sediment core from the Huaihe River, China by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The total concentration of 18 kinds of 22 OCPs in the sediment core were in the range of 0.01–7.18 ng g−1 with an average concentration of 4.53 ng g−1. The average detection rate was up to 51.60%. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were the predominant species in the sediment core. The different categories of OCPs were in the following order: DDTs &amp;gt; hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) &amp;gt; Chlordanes &amp;gt; Endosulfans &amp;gt; hexachlorobenzene (HCB). Drins were all lower than detection limits. The temporal trends of OCPs were influenced by their different historical usages, different properties or different degradation conditions in the environment. There was an obvious decreasing trend for OCPs in the core in recent years. The findings suggested there was also no new pollution source input in recent years and OCPs could not cause adverse biological risk in the environment.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of value co-creation in CTM area and learning processes in real systems based on value co-creation of CTM. Multiple case studies were used to analyze the value that was perceived by all agents in CTM in each collaboration stage and provided empirical evidence on the interactions among agents. Model-free reinforcement learning was used to predict how CTM could reduce transportation cost, increase visibility, and improve agility. The simulation results show that the input, feedback, and the experience of the agents are used to structure the collaboration processes and determine the strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The International Water Association water balance is an approach applied worldwide for determining and analysing water losses in water distribution systems (WDS) up to the point of customer metering. Thus, water losses occurring ‘before’ a customer meter are at the expenses of the water utility while water lost or wasted ‘after’ the meter is paid for by the customer. This applies to systems where customer metering is in place and/or consumption is charged according to the consumed volumes. However, many WDS in the world lack customer meters, are operated intermittently and a considerable amount of water is lost or wasted within the private property, e.g. by overflows of private tanks. The flat-rate tariff applied might not cover this amount or part of the amount. Thus, actual consumption and wastage should be separately quantified or estimated with respect to the utility's water reduction measures and the calculation of revenue water. This paper presents a water balance approach adapted to WDS which are operated intermittently, lack customer metering and charge flat-rate tariffs as well as a methodology for establishing the balance. The application is demonstrated for a district metered area of the city of Tiruvannamalai, India.</jats:p>",

Poyang Lake, an open freshwater lake in China, and the extensive floodplain wetland surrounding the lake, plays an important role in protecting the biodiversity of this internationally recognized wetland system. This paper is the first field-based study into an investigation of the groundwater dynamics in the floodplain wetland and the associated hydraulic relationship with the lake using hydrological, hydrochemical and stable isotope evidence, as exemplified by Poyang Lake wetland. Results show that groundwater stores within the floodplain wetland exhibit spatial and temporal variability in terms of the magnitudes of groundwater level variations. Floodplain groundwater fluctuations largely reflect patterns of the precipitation and the lake water level; however, the groundwater dynamics are highly affected by the variations in the lake water level, rather than local precipitation. Floodplain wetland is most likely to receive the lake water during spring and summer and may recharge the lake during periods of low lake water level. Additionally, floodplain groundwater displays similar hydrochemical and environmental isotope signatures to that of the lake at different sampling periods, indicating a close hydraulic relationship between groundwater and the lake throughout the year.</jats:p>",

Several strains of brackish water diatoms have been isolated and tested. Among them Pseudostaurosira and Nitzschia species showed promise. Reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate samples from two full-scale advanced water purification facilities and one brackish groundwater RO plant in Southern California have been successfully treated by this process. This new photobiological process could remove aqueous silica, as well as phosphate, ammonia, nitrate, calcium, iron and manganese very effectively. Under non-optimized conditions, 95% of 78 mg·L−1 reactive silica in an RO concentrate sample could be removed within 72 hours. In most cases, addition of nutrients was not necessary because the RO concentrate typically contains sufficient concentrations of macronutrients derived from the source water (i.e., treated wastewater and brackish groundwater). Preliminary characterization of organics indicated that there was no major generation of dissolved organics, which could potentially foul membranes in the subsequent RO process. This new algal process has a strong potential for its application in desalination and water reuse in the United States and around the world.</jats:p>",

The results also reveal mediating influences of resource specificity and collaboration.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The research findings have to be considered in context.

However, do suppliers benefit financially from positioning themselves as leading innovators? Utilizing a secondary dataset of 1039 supplier to customer base observations, and grounding our study in the structure‐conduct‐performance framework, we examine the extent to which suppliers are able to benefit from pursuing a more leading or lagging innovation strategy within their industry. While in general we find that suppliers employing a leading innovator strategy have higher levels of financial performance, such an effect is not universal. Rather, the ability of the supplying firm to leverage their innovation strategy into increased performance is highly contingent upon not only the innovation levels of their own industry, but also the innovation levels of the industries which they supply. Our results, therefore, suggest that it would be advantageous for suppliers to take a supply chain perspective and strategically incorporate the innovation characteristics of their customers when determining whether to pursue a leading or lagging innovation strategy.</jats:p>",

This study empirically tests an example of supply chain taken from 22 functional organizations based on supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model.

Most of these rural aqueducts operate with many deficiencies. Thus the availability of drinking water to rural populations is very insecure. Preceding this reason exposed, and analyzing different methods of disinfection for drinking water especially for rural areas, we select the electrolysis of brine, as a good alternative; already this method as well as low cost of maintenance and operation, requires raw salt, or sea water; what is available anywhere in one way or another to produce hypochlorite of sodium, generated by electrolysis.

The alternate filling and emptying of the pipe network leads to effects, which have negative impacts on water meter accuracy. For example, air that is present in the pipe network due to the emptying process must exit the network during the subsequent filling process. A part of this air is discharged through service connections and, thus, through water meters. In this paper, a study is presented in which the measurement error of single-jet and multi-jet water meters due to the filling process of an empty pipe is investigated experimentally. From the start of air flow to the steady-state flow of water, several causes of measurement errors can be distinguished, such as pure air flow, the impact of the water front on the impeller, the existence of two-phase flow or unsteady flow conditions. For both meter types, it has been discovered that the measurement error is mainly caused by the air flow. The experimental results show that up to 93% of the air volume in the pipe is registered by the water meters. Based on these results, an approach for estimating the measurement error for both meter types is presented.</jats:p>",

The research on SCMIS, an inter-organizational system, is in its early stages and is still to receive that much attention as its predecessor whereas barriers for its implementation are more severe.

Previous studies showed that pollution levels due to activities of phosphate mining (PM) were extremely high and the water quality of reservoirs was severely affected by sedimentation. Yet, detailed knowledge of the sediment is lacking at that high phosphorus (P) concentration basin. Therefore, the different P fractions and its diffusion fluxes at the water-sediment interface of four deep reservoirs have been investigated for the first time to understand the internal P loading. The results indicated that the concentrations of total P , ranging from 9,631.5 to 581.6 mg kg−1, exhibited an apparent spatial trend from the upstream to the downstream reservoirs, which corresponded with the activities of P mining in this basin. The P-fraction concentrations obtained from the sites were mainly ranked in this order: P associated with calcium (Ca-Pi) &amp;gt; organic P (Po) &amp;gt; P bound to aluminum (Al), ferrum (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides and hydroxides (Fe/Al-Pi). The orthophosphate diffusion fluxes ranged from −0.40 ± 0.09 to 0.95 ± 0.14 mg m−2 d−1 which were positively related to P fraction concentrations while negatively related to oxidation–reduction potential and dissolved oxygen values. These results implied the dynamics role of internal P loading. The principle component analysis suggested that PM activities and internal P loading were the most reactive factors in this river system.</jats:p>",

Porter’s value chain model is used to characterize the innovations introduced by the LDB dairy in its milk inbound logistics and supplier relationships. A socioeconomic food security index and qualitative data are used to assess the dairy’s supply chain’s contribution to strengthen smallholder households’ livelihoods. Data for this research were obtained through individual surveys, focus groups and in-depth interviews of LDB managers and milk suppliers. Results show that milk income contributes significantly to household food security. Suppliers who stabilize their dairy income between rainy and dry seasons, diversify income sources and have larger herds are more likely to remain food secure. The LDB innovations contribute by helping herders access biophysical and economic resources, leading to better livestock feed and household food security.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, it analyses how and why actors use plural forms of coordination to support similar transactions. Based on the literature and an exploratory study carried out in the BPC, we propose a framework to analyse how price, volume, quality and resource allocation are coordinated in a transaction. This paper builds on transaction cost economics in two ways. First, it shows that to arrange a transaction, a buyer may set CMs in distinct positions within the market-hierarchy continuum. Second, it shows that actors use plural CMs with different counterparties in similar transactions. We found four explanations for plural governance: market fluctuations, bargaining power of suppliers, stricter coordination and quality, and the exchange context.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Wholesale price bids commonly occur in procurement auctions where dual sourcing is usually employed to mitigate supply risks. When at most two winners are required, unreliable wholesale price bidders face the unique trade‐off between unit margin and quantity allocation that depends on both winners' bids and the reliabilities. Motivated by above facts and considerations, we investigate several auction formats accommodating wholesale price bids for dual sourcing under newsvendor market, with unreliable suppliers possessing private costs. Generalized first‐price auction (GFA) is designed under known cost distribution, while generalized English auction (GEA) and optimal auction with learning (OAL) are examined under unknown distribution. Through a preannounced allocation rule to curb the bidding behavior, both GFA and OAL balance information rent and quantity allocation and generate various diversification degrees. Information asymmetry under GFA depresses the quantity proportion for high‐cost winner, because he charges higher unit information rent than low‐cost winner does. In contrast, two winners in GEA collude at the same price and thus split the order quantity evenly. The full diversification possibly enables GEA to generate higher service level than GFA under high supply risk, although the expected output quantity of GEA is always lower. Regarding the practical requirement for auction format choice, when the costs of implementation and distribution acquisition are not negligible, the previous analysis suggests that the favorable format is driven from GFA or OAL to GEA, as supply risk or the number of bidders increases, or as retail price exceeds a threshold. We also extend to multisourcing cases and examine the impacts of salvage and lost sale on auction format choice.</jats:p>",

Simulation‐based analysis shows that a given outbreak can be caused by either (i) a high infectivity parameter even with sufficient and timely supply of medicines, or (ii) a low infectivity parameter and poor supply of medicines. Also, the use of a stand‐alone epidemic model is found to overestimate disease transmissibility. A compartmental epidemic model is integrated with multi‐echelon supply chain models to further investigate the impact of medicine supply chain on the epidemic dynamics. In integrated models, medicine demands for the supply chain are generated from the disease model, and the medicine supply rate controls the recovery rate of patients in the disease model. It is found that supply chain aspects have a significant effect on epidemic dynamics. Some improvement schemes for supply chain management are also highlighted.</jats:p>",

Pendugaan parameter biologi dilakukan menggunakan model CYP, pendugaan kurva supply menggunakan model Clark dan pendugaan kurva demand menggunakan model Salvatore. Hasil analisis menunjukkan bahwa keseimbangan supply dan demand terjadi pada tingkat harga Rp 5.889 dengan jumlah produksi 10.149 ton per tahun. Sementara itu, berdasarkan hasil survei diperoleh data bahwa harga ikan lemuru berkisar antara Rp 1.500 – 2.000 dengan rata-rata jumlah produksi (tahun 1990-2007) 30.254 ton dengan rata-rata upaya penangkapan 16.934 trip per tahun. Pada kondisi Maximum Sustainable Yield diperoleh maksimum jumlah tangkapan adalah 21.418 ton per tahun dengan jumlah upaya penangkapan 8.023 trip per tahun. Jumlah upaya penangkapan ini setara dengan 81 unit purse seine dengan asumsi setiap unit purse seine memiliki 99 trip per tahun. Mengacu kepada jumlah produksi pada kondisi MSY, maka dengan jumlah produksi 10.149 ton per tahun pada kondisi keseimbangan supply dan demand, hanya 38 unit purse seine yang diperlukan di Selat Bali. Kebijakan pembatasan jumlah upaya penangkapan di lokasi tersebut diharapkan mampu memulihkan sumberdaya ikan lemuru, dan dalam jangka panjang eksploitasi dapat dilakukan secara optimal. Tittle: Optimalization of Governing ‘Lemuru’ Fishery Based on the Supply and Demand Mechanism in the Bali Strait.This research aimed to know amount of fishing effort for capturing lemuru in the Bali Strait based on supply demand equilibrium. Biology parameters were estimated by using CYP model, supply curve was estimated using Clark model and demand curve wos estimated using Salvatore model. Results show that supply demand equilibrium is reached at Rp 5,889 of price and 10,149 MT per year of harvest. Based on survey, price of lemuru was around Rp 1,500 – 2,000 with average of harvest (1990-2007) was 30,254 MT per year. At maximum sustainable yield (MSY), maximum harvest were 21,418 MT per year and fishing effort 8,023 trip per year. Fishing effort at MSY were 81 unit purse seine assuming that one unit purse seine operated 99 trips per year. Based on fishing effort and harvested fish at the MSY, with 10,149 ton per years at the equilibrium point of supply and demand of that particular fish, it required 38 units of purse seine in the Bali Strait. Limiting number of fishing effort in the Bali Strait is to be expected by which enabling to recover lemuru required in the long-run optimal exploitation rate of the lemuru.</jats:p>"

It is important to understand the origin of theory and how it has evolved within the LSCM discipline, because learning the past helps scholars understand the present and presage the future. To fulfill that objective, this research catalogs theories that have been used and also begins to identify how, when, and why borrowed theories have been adapted for LSCM research. The major results include theoretical insights such as trends in theory utilization and the methods and topics where theories are typically used or underused. The top five theories that have been used in LSCM research actually represent five different disciplines—management, economics, mathematics, psychology, and sociology—supporting the multidisciplinary nature of LSCM. To summarize this research, a forward‐looking perspective is taken to identify potential areas for the application of theory for future LSCM research. Comments are also provided on how researchers are employing more theory in the latest period of LSCM development (2011–2015).</jats:p>",

WDNs can be regarded as large sparse planar graphs showing fractal and complex network properties. In this paper, the relationship linking the geometrical and topological features of a WDN to its resilience to the failure of a pipe is investigated. Some innovative indices have been borrowed from fractal geometry and complex network theory to study WDNs. Considering all possible network configurations obtained by suppressing one link, the proposed indices are used to quantify the impact of pipe failure on the system's resilience. This approach aims to identify critical links, in terms of resilience, with the help of topological metrics only, and without recourse to hydraulic simulations, which require complex calibration processes and come with a computational burden. It is concluded that the proposed procedure, which has been successfully tested on two real WDNs located in southern Italy, can provide valuable information to water utilities about which pipes have a significant role in network performance, thus helping in their design, planning and management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A growing global population, combined with factors such as changing socio-demographics, will place increased pressure on the world’s resources to provide not only more but also different types of food. Increased demand for animal-based protein in particular is expected to have a negative environmental impact, generating greenhouse gas emissions, requiring more water and more land. Addressing this “perfect storm” will necessitate more sustainable production of existing sources of protein as well as alternative sources for direct human consumption. This paper outlines some potential demand scenarios and provides an overview of selected existing and novel protein sources in terms of their potential to sustainably deliver protein for the future, considering drivers and challenges relating to nutritional, environmental, and technological and market/consumer domains. It concludes that different factors influence the potential of existing and novel sources. Existing protein sources are primarily hindered by their negative environmental impacts with some concerns around health. However, they offer social and economic benefits, and have a high level of consumer acceptance. Furthermore, recent research emphasizes the role of livestock as part of the solution to greenhouse gas emissions, and indicates that animal-based protein has an important role as part of a sustainable diet and as a contributor to food security. Novel proteins require the development of new value chains, and attention to issues such as production costs, food safety, scalability and consumer acceptance. Furthermore, positive environmental impacts cannot be assumed with novel protein sources and care must be taken to ensure that comparisons between novel and existing protein sources are valid. Greater alignment of political forces, and the involvement of wider stakeholders in a governance role, as well as development/commercialization role, is required to address both sources of protein and ensure food security.</jats:p>"

To do so, the epsilon-constraint method is adopted to generate the set of Pareto optimal solutions. Then, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOSIS) is used to choose the best compromise solution. The multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution (VIKOR), a commonly used method in multiple criteria analysis, is applied in order to evaluate the selected solutions using TOPSIS method.

The objective function of the hedging rule is to minimize the long‐term shortage ratio (LSR).

To eliminate the adverse impacts of air scouring, the concept of separating flocs in the submerged membrane module was proposed. The performance of three types of floc separation devices, including a cylinder module, a module without a floc separation device and a stacked inclined plate module, was compared. In the coagulation-UF process (i.e., without air scouring), the average transmembrane pressure (TMP) growth rates of the cylinder module, the module without a floc separation device and the inclined plate module were 0.58, 0.76 and 1.38 kPa/h, respectively, indicating lighter membrane fouling of the former two membrane configurations. In the coagulation-air scouring-UF process (with an air scouring rate of 35 mL/min), the stacked inclined plate module showed better effluent water quality (lower UV254) and floc integrity (the floc size was about twice that of the other two configurations). Further, the optimization of the air scouring rate was conducted when the inclined plate module was used, and the optimal value was determined to be 60 mL/min for air rates ranging from 0 to 100 mL/min.</jats:p>",

Yet, the extent to which marine reserves are globally interconnected and able to effectively seed areas, where fisheries are most critical for food and livelihood security is largely unknown. Using a hydrodynamic model of larval dispersal, we predict that most marine reserves are not interconnected by currents and that their potential benefits to fishing areas are presently limited, since countries with high dependency on coastal fisheries receive very little larval supply from marine reserves. This global mismatch could be reversed, however, by placing new marine reserves in areas sufficiently remote to minimize social and economic costs but sufficiently connected through sea currents to seed the most exploited fisheries and endangered ecosystems.</jats:p>"

The features of both products in usage and functional are same but in price and environmentally aspect are different. Moreover refund policy is considered for both products that can affect on customers’ decision. We explore and analyze the system performance under both non-cooperative and cooperative strategies. The Stackelberg game in cooperative and Rubinstein bargaining in non-cooperative environments are applied respectively. Results show the cooperation of members increase their profits and products demand for both types of products. By increasing the value of potential demand, refund amount of green product and profits in cooperative and non-cooperative cases are increased and refund amount of non-green product is decreased. Changes of utility level sensitivity to the refund amount of green and non-green products have direct relations with refund amount and system profits, unless the utility level sensitivity to the refund amount of non-green product has contrariwise relationship with the refund amount of non-green products.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine the critical role of advance supply signals—such as suppliers’ financial health and production viability—in dynamic supply risk management. The firm operates an inventory system with multiple demand classes and multiple suppliers. The sales are discretionary and the suppliers are susceptible to both systematic and operational risks. We develop a hierarchical Markov model that captures the essential features of advance supply signals, and integrate it with procurement and selling decisions. We characterize the optimal procurement and selling policy, and the strategic relationship between signal‐based forecast, multi‐sourcing, and discretionary selling. We show that higher demand heterogeneity may reduce the value of discretionary selling, and that the mean value‐based forecast may outperform the stationary distribution‐based forecast. This work advances our understanding on when and how to use advance supply signals in dynamic risk management. Future supply risk erodes profitability but enhances the marginal value of current inventory. A signal of future supply shortage raises both base stock and demand rationing levels, thereby boosting the current production and tightening the current sales. Signal‐based dynamic forecast effectively guides the firm's procurement and selling decisions. Its value critically depends on supply volatility and scarcity. Ignoring advance supply signals can result in misleading recommendations and severe losses. Signal‐based dynamic supply forecast should be used when: (a) supply uncertainty is substantial, (b) supply‐demand ratio is moderate, (c) forecast precision is high, and (d) supplier heterogeneity is high. </jats:p>",

The current density (j: 2–20 mA/cm2), the conductivity (σ: 500–900 μS/cm) and the anode materials (An) were considered as variables to perform the Box-Behnken experimental design together with the response surface methodology analysis for optimization. The statistical analysis indicated that, in the evaluated range, the disinfection efficiency increased with an increase in j and decreased with an increase in σ. The following optimal conditions for the elimination of total and fecal coliforms were found: j: 10 mA/cm2, σ: 500 μS/cm and BDD/Ti used as anode material. The BDD/Ti electrode let to achieve complete coliform elimination after ca. 20 min of reaction while the GP one needed ca. 27 min. In water treated with both BDD/Ti and GP anode, after 7 days, any coliforms growth was observed.

In many regions of the world, water availability is limited and even declining. Moreover, water availability is variable in space and time and often does not match with the spatio-temporal demand pattern. To overcome the temporal discrepancy between availability and consumption, reservoirs are constructed. Monitoring and predicting the water available in the reservoirs, the needs of the consumers and the losses throughout the river and water distribution system are necessary requirements to fairly allocate the available water to the different users, prevent floods and ensure sufficient water flow in the river. In this paper, this surface water allocation problem is considered a Network Flow Optimisation Problem (NFOP) solved by spatio-temporal optimisation using linear programming techniques.</jats:p>",

Characteristics of the Smoky Hollow Member are consistent with a prograding distributive fluvial system including: up‐section increases in average grain size, bed thickness, channel‐body amalgamation, a fan‐shaped planform morphology and a downstream increase in channel sinuosity. The system prograded to the northeast based on thickness and facies patterns, and palaeocurrent indicators. This basin‐axial sediment‐dispersal trend, which was approximately parallel to the fold‐thrust belt at this latitude, is supported by provenance data including detrital zircons and modal sandstone compositions indicating sediment derivation mainly from the Mogollon Highlands and Cordilleran magmatic arc to the southwest, with episodic input from the more proximal Sevier fold‐thrust belt to the west. Progradation occurred during a eustatic still‐stand, relatively stable climatic conditions, and continuous tectonic subsidence, thus suggesting increased extrabasinal sediment supply as a primary control on basin‐fill. Progradation of the Smoky Hollow Member fluvial system culminated in a ~2–3 My hiatus at the top of the lower Calico bed. Correlation with the Notom delta of the Ferron Sandstone, 80 km northeast in the Henry basin, is proposed on the basis of facies relationships and geochronology. The Calico bed unconformity is linked to regional tectonically driven tilting and erosion observed in both basins.</jats:p>",

Batch Cr(VI) removal tests, performed to evaluate and compare the efficiency of ISRs in the presence of FeOOH, qualified Na2S2O4 as the optimum for drinking water treatment. Application of Na2S2O4 in continuous flow rapid small scale column tests, using a FeOOH adsorbent at pH 7 ± 0.1 and artificial (resembling natural) water matrix, verified the high potential for Cr(VI) removal at sub-ppb level. Indeed, a 15 mg S/L Na2S2O4 dose diminished an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 100 μg/L below the method's detection limit of 1.4 μg/L at least for 105 bed volumes. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy revealed that Cr(VI) forms outer sphere complexes, while Cr(III) is involved in 2E, 2C and 1 V geometries with the surface Fe-oxyhydroxyl groups. It can, therefore, be concluded that FeOOH attracts Cr(VI) to its surface via physisorption, offering a solid surface that promotes the transfer of electrons through bridging ions. Thus, when Na2S2O4 is added in the system, Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III), which is subsequently chemisorbed onto the FeOOH surface.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> \tHigher penetration of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and increasing pressure to decarbonize society introduces new challenges. Energy storage and grid stabilization systems are necessary to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (wind, solar etc.) [1]–[4]. Renewable energy storage in form of hydrogen offers an attractive option for energy storage [5], [6]. With advent of hydrogen economy and growing number of fuel cell vehicles, local production and supply of hydrogen infrastructure for refueling stations is essential [7]–[9]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An r-SOC electrochemical reactor system is capable addressing these multiple challenges of energy storage and coupling the energy storage sector with hydrogen economy sector. Electricity storage is achieved by operating such a system in electrolysis mode (reduction of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O). Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy in form of hydrogen. The produced hydrogen can be supplied into gas grids or stored locally which can be supplied to hydrogen refueling stations. During high demand for electricity, the system can be switched to fuel cell mode during which the stored hydrogen is efficiently converted to electricity. r-SOC systems offer an interesting feasible solution for the following challenges: 1) Efficient electricity storage, 2) Grid stabilization required for intermittent renewable energy, 3) Sector coupling of energy storage sector with hydrogen economy supply chain and 4) A decentralized solution for the above challenges via e.g. hydrogen refueling stations. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An r-SOC system as described above poses certain technical challenges as requirements of a stand-alone SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) system and a stand-alone SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) system are different from each other. The simplest design approach for an r-SOC system calls for thermoneutral or exothermic electrolysis operation, although this will yield low round trip efficiencies in the range of 35 % [10]. Coupling highly efficient endothermic electrolysis and exothermic fuel cell mode allows for significantly higher round trip efficiencies up to 60 %. Therefore thermal integration, storage and management between the two modes of operation are crucial. In this study, a process system study of an r-SOC electrochemical reactor system is performed. Process system analysis is performed based on experimental investigation of a commercially available r-SOC reactor carried out under pressurized conditions. Opportunities of integrating thermal energy storage are investigated. Detailed process system architectures are discussed and effects of key system operating parameters are analyzed. Achievable system roundtrip efficiencies for the different scenarios using currently available r-SOC reactor technology are quantified. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>Reference </jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] P.

First, based on the volume of fluid method, a fluid dynamic model for the jetting and forming of ink drop is set up. According to this model, the numerical analysis for the states of forming, fracture, and flight of ink drops is performed; referring to different boundary conditions of piezoelectric ink-jet process, the inherent relations between ink characteristics and ink drop motion are analyzed, and an optimal viscosity range for piezoelectric nozzle is confirmed. Then, a fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative–based ink-supply control method is developed to achieve the fast and smooth responses for ink temperature and to obtain the required ink characteristics and ink-supply effects. Finally, a microcontroller-based piezoelectric ink-jetting experiment platform is established, and the experiment results show that the fluid dynamic modeling method can simulate the flow field profiles of piezoelectric ink-jet; the fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative–based ink-supply system can improve the printing quality; the print stripes are decreased obviously, and the softer and cleaner images can be obtained. </jats:p>",

Fossil energy production consumes large amounts of water, and it is essential to investigate the water footprint of fossil energy production (WFEP) in China. In addition, fossil energy is supplied to consumers in China by both domestic and foreign producers, and understanding the water footprint of fossil energy supply (WFES) is also highly significant for water and energy development programs in the long-term. The objectives of this paper were to provide an estimation of the blue component of WFEP and WFES in China for the period from 2001 to 2014, and to evaluate the impact on water resources from energy production, the contribution of internal and external WFES, and water-energy related issues of the international energy trade by applying water footprint analysis based on the bottom-up approach. The results indicate that generally, the WFEP and WFES in China both maintained steady growth before 2013, with the WFEP increasing from approximately 3900 million m3/year to 10,400 million m3/year, while the WFES grew from 3900 million m3/year to 11,600 million m3/year. The fossil energy production caps of the 13th Five Year Plan can bring the water consumed for fossil energy production back to a sustainable level. Over the long-term, China’s energy trade plan should also consider the water and energy resources of the countries from which fossil energy is imported.</jats:p>"

After reviewing previously cited estimates, we examine and independently validate supply expense data (collected by the American Hospital Association) for over 3,500 U.S. hospitals. We find supply expenses to make up 15% of total hospital expenses, on average, but as high as 30% or 40% in hospitals with a high case-mix index, such as surgery-intensive hospitals.

When the power supply outputs high voltage, the accompanied frequent over‐current protection will return the power to DC side, which leads to over‐voltage protection, so the current limiting protection is applied.

In this study a series of physical experiments and numerical calculations were conducted to investigate the flow pattern, pressure distribution and cavitation downstream of a sudden fall-expansion aerator in a discharge tunnel. When the radial gate was partly open, the bottom cavity length reduced drastically, the lateral cavity disappeared, and the flow cavitation index near the sidewalls was less than 0.2. The pressure on the floor and sidewalls can be divided into four regimes: the cavity regime, the impact regime, the reflective regime and the stable regime. The time-average pressure is subject to a unimodal distribution when the gate is fully open, whereas a bimodal distribution is presented when the gate is partly open. The negative pressure regime presented an elliptic shape. Cavitation erosion occurred easily on lateral expansion sidewalls in the tunnel with the radial gate partly open.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been considerable instability in the exchange rates of many countries. This can directly affect macroeconomic stability on one side and monetary policy or rather money supply on the other. Because central banks are making interventions to the foreign exchange market by buying and selling foreign exchange in order to provide stability of exchange rate. As a result, both the official reserves and the money supply are constantly changing. Since Kyrgyzstan is a country dependent on imports in most commodities, the Central Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic sees the exchange rates’ stability as an important instrument of price stabilizing. However, such a policy may deteriorate the stability of the total money supply and adversely affect the economy. Therefore, in this study, it is aimed to examine the relations between exchange rate, money supply and official reserves by using 2002-2016 monthly data and cointegration method. Empirical results have shown that a change in the exchange rate causes opposite changes in both the reserves and the money supply as a result of the central bank’s interventions. However, more concrete recommendations on the effectiveness of monetary policy in Kyrgyzstan are required to make more detailed analysis. </jats:p>",

This article introduces a supply chain optimization framework which incorporates new renewable ammonia plants into the conventional ammonia supply chain. Both economic and environmental objectives are considered. The framework is then applied to two separate case studies analyzing the supply chains of Minnesota and Iowa, respectively. The base case results present an expected trade‐off between cost, which favors purchasing ammonia from conventional plants, and emissions, which favor building distributed renewable ammonia plants. Further analysis of this trade‐off shows that a carbon tax above $25/t will reduce emissions in the optimal supply chain through building large renewable plants. The importance of scale is emphasized through a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, as the largest scale renewable plants are selected most often in the optimal supply chain. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 63: 4390–4402, 2017</jats:p>",

We investigate a firm's production planning, pricing, and financial hedging decisions under exchange rate and demand uncertainty with the objective of maximizing expected profit while complying with a value‐at‐risk (VaR) constraint that limits the firm's losses in amount and probability. The study makes three contributions. First, we show that production hedging, when compared to matching demand with production, can substantially reduce risk both from VaR and conditional‐VaR perspectives while increasing expected profit. Our second contribution relates to the optimal pricing decisions. When a firm has pricing flexibility, it is commonly expected that the optimal price would increase under production hedging. Our study, however, shows that production hedging causes the firm to decrease the optimal price below the riskless price in order to benefit from exchange rate fluctuations. The pressure from risk aversion on the optimal price decision is not one directional, and can lead to both an increase and a decrease in price. Third, our work examines the interactions between financial hedging and production hedging. It identifies when financial hedging serves as a complement, and when as a substitute, to production hedging. Our work shows that financial hedging cannot always eliminate production hedging from being an optimal solution. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, smartphone-based in-app advertisement forms a substantial portion of the online advertising market. In-app publishers go through ad-space aggregators known as Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs), who, in turn, act as intermediaries for ad-agency aggregators known as demand-side platforms. The SSPs face the twin issue of making ad placement decisions within an order of milliseconds, even though their revenue streams can be optimized only by a careful selection of ads that elicit appropriate user responses regarding impressions, clicks, and conversions. This article considers the SSP's perspective and presents an online algorithm that balances these two issues. Our experimental results indicate that the decision-making time generally ranges between 20 ms and 50 ms and accuracy from 1% to 10%. Further, we conduct statistical analysis comparing the theoretical complexity of the online algorithm with its empirical performance. Empirically, we observe that the time is directly proportional to the number of incoming ads and the number of online rules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health sensing module in prognostics and health management (PHM) requires accurate acquisition of sensory signal and optimal deployment of sensor nodes. To this end, wireless sensor network (WSN) is widely utilized by virtue of the ease of the sensor deployments and the advances in the wireless communication. However, periodic replacements of the batteries are demanded for continuous operation of the WSN, which incurs additional costs and temporary suspension. To overcome these drawbacks, vibration energy harvesting (VEH) has emerged as a possible solution to realize self-powered/sustainable WSN operation. The VEH converts ambient vibration into electric power through an energy conversion medium. Low output power density, however, is still a critical issue in the VEH for its feasible application. Metamaterial-based energy harvesting (MBEH) has recently been proposed as a breakthrough technology to drastically improve output power generation. Metamaterials are engineered structures to exhibit exotic properties such as a bandgap. The bandgap refers to a certain frequency range within which elastic waves are prohibited to propagate. It can be used to enlarge elastic wave energy going into the energy conversion medium. While various mechanism for the MBEH has been introduced, only a few research has considered detail factors that can degrade the metamaterial’s performance. In this study, we propose a new phononic crystal design which prevents wave cancellation to improve the metamaterial’s performance. In building the model, the multiphysics finite element method are used to analyze dispersion and energy harvesting performance. Finally, the energy harvesting performance of the proposed design is compared with the design without the consideration of the wave cancellation.</jats:p>"

In this study, by taking these stated criteria into consideration, a TV power card has been designed, which has 220W output power and can be used in low profile televisions. Proposed power card will meet desired critical parameters such as surface area and output power of the referenced card which has 13.5mm height, the heat, and power consumption at standby mode. Moreover, it is designed with 10mm height limit without any engraving on PCB in a way that it will meet International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) current harmonic standard to which TVs are subjected.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study the wheat value chain from one of the highest wheat producing areas in Ethiopia (Arsi zone of Oromia region) to central markets in Finfinnee/Addis Ababa was assessed focusing on market performance, post-harvest losses, and the potential of supply chain management to improve the chain.Value chain analysis, questionnaire-based loss estimations, Tobit model for loss factor determination, structure-conduct-performance (S-C-P), four firm concentration ratio (CR4), market and profit margins, and theory of supply chain management were used to evaluate the wheat value chain. Primary data were collected using a semi-structured survey questionnaire and interview of key informants. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Tobit model in SPSS and Excel software.The study identified producers and their cooperatives, collectors, wholesalers, retailers, and processors as primary actors. At these stages of the wheat chain, post-harvest losses reported were 21%, 3%, 4%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. With the highest loss happening at producers’ stage, this stage was identified as loss-hot-spot point. The Ethiopian Grain Trade Enterprise was also identified as main actor connecting the flow of wheat between producers and consumers occasionally. An increase in a quintal of wheat production, bad storage facilities, and weather conditions caused in an increase in post-harvest losses of 5.18, 4.06 and 1.36 Kgs per quintal, respectively, at 1% statistical significance.The assessed wheat value chain was characterized by unfair share of benefit among the chain actors. The producers who were in a position of adding the highest portion of value to the wheat received only 16% of the profit margin. The traders jointly and processors shared 33% and 51% of the profit margin, respectively. The CR4 assessments in the major wheat markets along the chain noted that with CR4 in Etaya (26.8), Asala (37.7), Adama (41.4), and Finfinnee (42.8), the wheat markets near the producers were more competitive than the central ones. Assessment on the degree of clearness noted that for 54% of the chain actors, it was very difficult to get reliable information about the whole wheat market along the chain. Licensing procedure, capital, and competitions were reported as barriers to wheat market entry.For all producers, retailers, and collectors on agreement with their suppliers, the only means of agreement in doing business with their transaction partners were spot-market. However, 63% and 16% of collectors had oral and written contractual agreements, respectively, with their buyers. 36% and 31% of wholesalers reported they had oral contracts with their suppliers and buyers, respectively; 18% and 12% of them had written contracts with suppliers and buyers, respectively. Similarly, 42% and 9% of the processors had oral agreement with their suppliers and buyers while 23% and 27% of them had written contract agreement with their suppliers and buyers, respectively.The study noted that the wheat chain assessed was characterized by disintegrated chain where businesses were self-oriented and mutualism has not well-developed. Working towards supply chain management and relational view of business has been recommended based on the problems identified in the study.</jats:p>"

During the grain‐filling stage, the leaf area index (LAI) and dry matter accumulation (DMA) were greatest at the final SD (SD6) compared with all other treatments. Additionally, the daily mean air temperature (Tmean), daily maximum air temperature (Tmax), and cumulative stressful days (CSD) during this stage across 3 yr decreased at SD6 by 1.4 to 3.2°C, 1.0 to 2.7°C, and 5.7 to 14.7 d, respectively, compared with the values at SD1 to SD5. Planting at SD6 increased the final grain yield by an average of 5.4 to 19.3%.

Kernel number was negatively correlated with Tmax and CSD from 15 d pre‐silking to 15 d post‐silking. Compared to SD1 and SD4, ear leaf at 15 d post‐silking under the SD6 treatment had the highest net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and the lowest ABA concentration. In conclusion, to avoid HTS and achieve the greatest corn grain yields in NCP, spring sowing maize should be postponed until late May.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We studied the effects of dissolved nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and ratios on fungal stoichiometry, elemental homeostasis, nutrient uptake and growth rate in two experiments that used (1) liquid media and a relatively recalcitrant carbon (C) source and (2) fungi grown on leaf litter in microcosms. Two monospecific fungal cultures and a multi-species assemblage were assessed in each experiment. Combining a radioactive tracer to estimate fungal production (C accrual) with N and P uptake measurements provided an ecologically relevant estimate of mean fungal C:N:P of 107:9:1 in litter-associated fungi, similar to the 92:9:1 obtained from liquid cultures. Aquatic fungi were found to be relatively homeostatic with respect to their C:N ratio (~11:1), but non-homeostatic with respect to C:P and N:P. Dissolved N greatly affected fungal growth rate and production, with little effect on C:nutrient stoichiometry. Conversely, dissolved P did not affect fungal growth and production but controlled biomass C:P and N:P, probably via luxury P uptake and storage. The ability of fungi to immobilize and store excess P may alter nutrient flow through aquatic food webs and affect ecosystem functioning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In today's increasingly globalized environment, more and more companies recognize the mutual dependence of supply chain partners in value creation. When making business decisions, they take into consideration their partners’ bottom line profitability, especially in emerging markets. The question is, is this kind of practice sustainable? This study makes an attempt to formalize this issue by examining a stylized two‐party supply chain model in which each player maximizes its own profit while making a certain commitment to its partner. We compare five different games between the two supply‐chain partners, which reflect different power positions of the players and different levels of commitment. We identify conditions under which both players are better off with mutual commitments than without, a situation we call win–win. We show that win–win can be achieved if and only if the mutual commitments are comparable. Thus, the recognition of mutual dependence of the supply chain members needs to be translated into reciprocal concerns. In addition, different players’ commitments play different roles but together they have a similar effect as a profit sharing contract. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of socially responsible operations. In particular, our analyses show that it is possible to care about the supply chain partners’ bottom line without sacrificing one's own profitability, and our models can be used as a tool to determine the commitment levels by evaluating the predicted outcome. </jats:p>",

We investigated the ability of zooplankton assemblages to enter the wide surf zone of the rip‐channeled, more dissipative beach at Sand City, California, and the narrow surf zone of the steep reflective beach at nearby Carmel River State Beach. Every day for a month, we surveyed zooplankton inside and outside the surf zone and concomitant larval settlement of the dominant invertebrate onshore at each site in this upwelling regime. At the more dissipative surf zone, all zooplankters were far more concentrated inside than outside the surf zone. Many taxa increased in the surf zone and the predominant invertebrate on beaches, <jats:italic>Emerita analoga</jats:italic>, settled abundantly when prevailing northwesterly winds relaxed and waves were small. At the reflective surf zone, concentrations of zooplankters of most taxa were far greater outside than inside the surf zone, and many taxa increased in the surf zone when waves were small. Twice as many taxa were positively correlated inside and outside the surf zone at the dissipative than the reflective surf zone, indicating that zooplankters were more freely exchanged although behavior also played a role. Thus, spatial and temporal variation in surf zone hydrodynamics may regulate subsidies of zooplankton food and larval recruits to nearshore communities with potential cascading effects on community dynamics and structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, as a universal clean energy, natural gas plays a greater role in industrial and civil energy consumption than it has previously. Any insufficient supply scenario has a severe impact due to the increasing use of power plants, chemical engineering, industrial production, and public sectors. It is essential to develop a methodology for analyzing gas supply insufficiencies that are caused by pipeline network malfunctions. This paper introduces a systematic method for evaluating the natural gas supply reliability based on the pipeline network. Primarily, the reliability of each unit in the pipeline network is derived from multi-variant distribution principles to initiate topological structure analysis carried out in the real pipeline network. Afterwards, the Monte Carlo simulation shows the random status of the topological network based on preconcerted failure distributions of facilities and pipes rather than estimating the reliability directly. Because the current transmission capacity is possibly excessive relative to the transmission task, both designed capacity and current supply capacity require stochastic simulations. After stochastic simulations of the market demand, a feasible random transmission requirement and a certain structure of the topological network are obtained from random simulations to calculate the total transmission capacity. Ultimately, according to the supply insufficiency level, there are deployable measures that could eliminate this influence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security published in 2012 by the White House identifies two primary goals for strengthening global supply chains: first, to promote the efficient and secure movement of goods, and second to foster a resilient supply chain. The Internet of Things (IoT), and in particular Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, can be used to realize these goals. For product identification, tracking and real-time awareness, RFID tags are attached to goods. As tagged goods move along the supply chain from the suppliers to the manufacturers, and then on to the retailers until eventually they reach the customers, two major security challenges can be identified: (I) to protect the shipment of goods that are controlled by potentially untrusted carriers; and (II) to secure the transfer of ownership at each stage of the chain. For the former, grouping proofs in which the tags of the scanned goods generate a proof of “simulatenous” presence can be employed, while for the latter, ownership transfer protocols (OTP) are used. This paper describes enhanced security solutions for both challenges. We first extend earlier work on grouping proofs and group codes to capture resilient group scanning with untrusted readers; then, we describe a modified version of a recently published OTP based on channels with positive secrecy capacity adapted to be implemented on common RFID systems in the supply chain. The proposed solutions take into account the limitations of low cost tags employed in the supply chain, which are only required to generate pseudorandom numbers and compute one-way hash functions.</jats:p>"

Faced with strong economic and agronomic constraints, the cropping arrangements on these farms result in very tense experiences, both spatially and temporally. However, our analysis shows that while diversified organic market gardening is a demanding farm work environment, it paradoxically can create high professional satisfaction as a result of the complex integration of different elements, including social support and decision latitude. Indeed, the diversity of tasks, farmers’ autonomy, their role in decision‐making, and the challenging dimensions of organic farming contribute to what Karasek and Theorell call ‘active work’. Nevertheless, our research concludes that social support appears to be necessary to reach a good level of work satisfaction. Our findings also identify future research opportunities to examine, for example, how diversification impacts the work and the professional satisfaction of hired workers in organic market gardening contexts.</jats:p>",

The model combines physical and stochastic approaches to simulate key meteorological variables at high spatial and temporal resolution: 2 km × 2 km and 5 min for precipitation and cloud cover and 100 m × 100 m and 1 h for near‐surface air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure, atmospheric pressure, and near‐surface wind. The model requires spatially distributed data for the calibration process, which can nowadays be obtained by remote sensing devices (weather radar and satellites), reanalysis data sets and ground stations. AWE‐GEN‐2d is parsimonious in terms of computational demand and therefore is particularly suitable for studies where exploring internal climatic variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales is fundamental. Applications of the model include models of environmental systems, such as hydrological and geomorphological models, where high‐resolution spatial and temporal meteorological forcing is crucial. The weather generator was calibrated and validated for the Engelberg region, an area with complex topography in the Swiss Alps. Model test shows that the climate variables are generated by AWE‐GEN‐2d with a level of accuracy that is sufficient for many practical applications.</jats:p>",

Boulder Creek's bedrock channel, which is entirely developed on weak sedimentary rock, has a high flow shear stress that is about 3.5 times greater where it transports coarse (~ 22 cm D<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>) diorite in the lower reaches in comparison with the upstream section of the creek that transports only relatively finer bedload (~2 cm D<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>) derived from weak sedimentary rocks. In addition, Boulder Creek's channel abruptly widens and shallows downstream and transitions from partial to nearly continuous alluvial cover where it begins transporting coarse diorite. Boulder Creek's tributary channels are also about three times steeper where they transport diorite bedload, and within the Santa Cruz mountains channels in sedimentary bedrock are systematically steeper when &gt;50% of their catchment area is within crystalline basement rocks. Despite this clear control of coarse sediment size on channel slopes, the threshold of motion stress for bedload, alone, does not appear to control channel profile slopes here. Upper Boulder Creek, which is starved of coarse sediment, maintains high flow shear stresses well in excess of the threshold for motion. In contrast, lower Boulder Creek, with a greater coarse sediment supply, exerts high flow stresses much closer to the threshold for motion. We speculate that upper Boulder Creek has evolved to sustain partial alluvial cover and transfer greater energy to the bed via bedload impacts to compensate for its low coarse sediment supply. Thus bedload supply, bedrock erosion efficiency, and grain size all appear to influence channel slopes here. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many fungi in the Stachybotrys genus can produce various isoindolinone derivatives. These compounds are formed by a spontaneous reaction between a phthalic aldehyde precursor and an ammonium ion or amino compounds. In this study, we suggested the isoindolinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Stachybotrys by genome mining based on three reported core genes. Remarkably, there is an additional nitrate reductase (NR) gene copy in the proposed cluster. NR is the rate-limiting enzyme of nitrate reduction. Accordingly, this cluster was speculated to play a role in the balance of ammonium ion concentration in Stachybotrys. Ammonium ions can be replaced by different amino compounds to create structural diversity in the biosynthetic process of isoindolinone. We tested a rational supply of amino compounds ((±)-3-amino-2-piperidinone, glycine, and l-threonine) in the culture of an isoindolinone high-producing marine fungus, Stachybotrys longispora FG216. As a result, we obtained four new kinds of isoindolinone derivatives (FGFC4–GFC7) by this method. Furthermore, high yields of FGFC4–FGFC7 confirmed the outstanding production capacity of FG216. Among the four new isoindolinone derivatives, FGFC6 and FGFC7 showed promising fibrinolytic activities. The knowledge of biosynthesis pathways may be an important attribute for the discovery of novel bioactive marine natural products.</jats:p>"

The supply chains include feedstocks production and collection, biomass gasification, syngas fermentation, and downstream processing. For each of these stages, different alternatives were considered: four feedstocks (pine, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, and eucalyptus), three products (ethanol, 2,3‐butanediol and hexanoic acid), and three geographical locations (the Netherlands, the USA, and Brazil). Conceptual development and analysis of the supply chains were done through the combination of different design and assessment tools, namely biomass supply chains design, fermentation process design (based on thermodynamics and transport), process simulation, and economic and environmental assessments. The minimum selling price (MSP) and two environmental impact categories, i.e., global warming potential (GWP) and non‐renewable energy use (NREU), were used as performance indicators. These were compared to data reported in scientific literature and commercial sources for similar processes and ­products. The best overall performance was obtained for the production of 2,3‐butanediol from pine sourced in the USA. In the cases of ethanol and hexanoic acid, the syngas fermentation stage had significant contributions to MSP, GWP, and NREU, due mainly to its high energy requirements. Regarding the geographical location, the best economic performance was obtained for the USA followed by the Netherlands and Brazil respectively. Furthermore, operation in Brazil led to the lowest environmental impacts, followed by the Netherlands and the USA. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

We found that incorporating bank credit with a credit guarantee can effectively balance the retailer's financing risk between the bank and the manufacturer through interest rate charging and wholesale pricing. Moreover, SCF equilibriums with risk aversion are highly affected by the degree of both the lender's and guarantor's risk tolerance in regard to the borrower's default probability and will be more conservative than those in the risk‐neutral cases that only maximize expected profit.</jats:p>",

However, this rich data have neither analyzed to understand the underlying patterns, nor have been investigated to identify the factors contributing to this increased efficiency. A national‐scale synthesis of public supply withdrawals (“withdrawals”) reveals a strong North–south gradient in public supply water use with the increasing population in the South contributing to increased withdrawal. Contrastingly, a reverse South–north gradient exists in per capita withdrawals (“efficiency”), with northern states consistently improving the efficiency, while the southern states' efficiency declined. Our analyses of spatial patterns of per capita withdrawals further demonstrate that urban counties exhibit improved efficiency over rural counties. Improved efficiency is also demonstrated over high‐income and well‐educated counties. Given the potential implications of the findings in developing long‐term water conservation measures (i.e., increasing block rates), we argue the need for frequent updates, perhaps monthly to annual, of water‐use data for identifying effective strategies that control the water‐use efficiency in various geographic settings under a changing climate.</jats:p>",

Analytical results reveal that downstream productivity improvement (DPI) through the bilateral interaction is necessary and sufficient for the supply chain members to trade in the bilateral channel in addition to the futures market. We show that when the price in the futures market increases, the manufacturer would purchase less from the futures market and more from the supplier, which not only increases the supplier's expected profit but also increases her risk (variance of the profit) in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the bilateral channel exhibits stronger DPI, the manufacturer obtains a higher expected profit and bears a higher risk, but the supplier enjoys a higher expected profit without incurring any additional risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The island of South Georgia is situated in the iron (Fe) depleted Antarctic Circumpolar Current of the Southern Ocean. Iron emanating from its shelf system fuels large phytoplankton blooms downstream of the island, but the actual supply mechanisms are unclear. To address this we present the first inventory of Fe, manganese (Mn) and aluminium (Al) in shelf sediments, pore waters and the water column in the vicinity of South Georgia, alongside data on zooplankton-mediated Fe cycling processes. The seafloor sediments were the main particulate Fe source to shelf bottom waters as indicated by Fe / Mn and Fe / Al ratios for shelf sediments and suspended particles in the water column. Less than 1 % of the total particulate Fe pool was leachable surface adsorbed (labile) Fe, and therefore potentially available to organisms. Pore waters formed the primary dissolved Fe (DFe) source to shelf bottom waters supplying 0.1–4 μmol DFe m−2 d−1. However, only 0.41 ± 0.26 μmol DFe m−2 d−1 was transferred to the surface mixed layer by vertical diffusive and advective mixing. Other trace metal sources to surface waters included glacial flour released by melting glaciers and zooplankton excretion processes. On average 6.5 ± 8.2 μmol m−2 d−1 of labile particulate Fe was supplied to the surface mixed layer via krill faecal pellets, with further DFe released by krill at around 1.1 ± 2.2 μmol m−2 d−1. The faecal pellets released by krill constituted of seafloor derived lithogenic material and settled algae debris, in addition to freshly ingested suspended phytoplankton specimen. The phytoplankton Fe requirement in the blooms ca. 1250 km downstream the island of South Georgia was 0.33 ± 0.11 μmol m−2 d−1, with the DFe supply by horizontal/vertical mixing, deep winter mixing and via aeolian dust estimated as ~ 0.12 μmol m−2 d−1. We suggest that additionally required DFe was provided through recycling of biogenically stored Fe following luxury Fe uptake by phytoplankton on the Fe rich shelf. This process would allow Fe to be retained in the surface mixed layer of waters downstream of South Georgia through continuous recycling and biological uptake, and facilitate the large scale blooms.\n                        </jats:p>"

The synthesis and accumulation of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content>s depend highly on nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) availability and it is important to understand the underlying control mechanisms. Here we studied how the einkorn (<jats:italic>Triticum monococcum</jats:italic> ssp. <jats:italic>monococcum</jats:italic>) grain proteome responds to different amounts of N and S supply during grain development. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> composition at grain maturity was clearly impacted by nutrition treatments, due to early changes in the rate of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> accumulation during grain filling. Large‐scale analysis of the nuclear and albumin‐globulin subproteomes during this key developmental phase revealed that the abundance of 203 proteins was significantly modified by the nutrition treatments. Our results showed that the grain proteome was highly affected by perturbation in the N:S balance. S supply strongly increased the rate of accumulation of S‐rich α/β‐gliadin and γ‐gliadin, and the abundance of several other proteins involved in glutathione metabolism. Post‐anthesis N supply resulted in the activation of amino acid metabolism at the expense of carbohydrate metabolism and the activation of transport processes including nucleocytoplasmic transit. Protein accumulation networks were analyzed. Several central actors in the response were identified whose variation in abundance was related to variation in the amounts of many other proteins and are thus potentially important for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> accumulation. This detailed analysis of grain subproteomes provides information on how wheat <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> composition can possibly be controlled in low‐level fertilization condition.</jats:p>",

Considering these characteristics, we propose two facility–location models that represent alternative distribution policies in e‐commerce (one based on outsourcing and another based on in‐house distribution). These models take into account stochastic demands as well as more than one regular supplier per customer. Two methodologies are then introduced to solve these stochastic versions of the well‐known capacitated facility–location problem. The first is a two‐stage stochastic‐programming approach that uses an exact solver. However, we show that this approach is not appropriate for tackle large‐scale instances due to the computational effort required. Accordingly, we also introduce a “simheuristic” approach that is able to deal with large‐scale instances in short computing times. An extensive set of benchmark instances contribute to illustrate the efficiency of our approach, as well as its potential utility in modern e‐commerce practices.</jats:p>",

When inflow forecast uncertainty is addressed, hedging acts as insurances for offsetting the negative influence of water shortage in the future, especially when drought is anticipated. This study used a risk-averse criterion, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), rather than the expected value (EV) criterion, to rationalize water delivery for overcoming the shortcomings of risk-neutral hedging rules in minimizing water shortage impacts in unfavorable realizations, in which actual inflow is less than anticipated. A two-period hedging model with the objective of maximizing the CVaR of total benefits from water delivery and water storage is established, and the optimal hedging rules using first-order optimality condition are analytically derived. Differences in hedging rules under the two criteria are highlighted by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The methods are applied to guide the operations of a water supply reservoir, and results show that: (1) the hedging rules under the EV criterion are special cases under the CVaR criterion; (2) water delivery in the current period would be greatly curtailed under the high influence of forecast uncertainty or the significant risk-averse attitude of decision makers; (3) hedging to maximize the CVaR of total benefit is at the cost of reducing the EV of total benefit; and (4) in real-time operations, compared with the hedging policies under the EV criterion, the hedging policies under the CVaR criterion would be more effective when applied to dry and extremely dry hydrological conditions, especially when inflow is overestimated. These implications provide new insights into rationing water supply and risk aversion.</jats:p>"
