The review of 22 empirical tests and 51 case studies shows that private sector participation per se in water supply does not systematically have a significant positive effect on efficiency. Thus, the choice between public and private water delivery is probably not only a question of efficiency.</jats:p><jats:p>We developed a complete theory of the choice between public and private water supply based on four components: difference of cost of funds, transaction costs of outsourcing, difference of efficiency and potential political cost of privatizing. Since determinants of the theory fluctuate over the time and depend on the local context, this theory can explain both privatization and municipalization movements as well as why some local governments outsource water supply, while others opt for direct provision.</jats:p><jats:p>The tests on 459 US counties in charge of water supply in 45 states provide substantial support for the theory. Significant determinants of the choice of public versus private water delivery include the cost of funds, especially the social cost of taxes, transaction costs, the difference of efficiency and the potential political cost of privatizing.</jats:p><jats:p>Moreover, we tested other literature's theories, which suggest employment as a motive of public provision and cost of public wages as a cause of privatization. These two arguments seem to be irrelevant.</jats:p><jats:p>We additionally tested the influence of ownership on the number of drinking water environmental violations and found no significance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the GTAP-AEZ framework the supply of land across different uses is determined through a Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) supply function, where land cover is allocated across forestry, grazing and crops, followed by the allocation of harvested area across cropping activities. This research memorandum describes the empirically based calibration strategy used to determine the CET value for the land cover allocation nest dealing with the broader three commercial uses, and examines how land use responsiveness and the parameter value evolve over time. The calibration is accomplished using the GTAP Land Use Database and time paths of land quantities by use over a 100 year period. These land quantity projections are, in turn, based on matrices of land use transition probabilities and own return elasticities of transition probabilities for the USA. We find that over time there is a rise in the land use response to increases in own-returns and in own return elasticities, while there is a fall in the calibrated CET value. The value of the CET parameter decreases at a decreasing rate every five-year period, although it can be approximated by a linear relationship in the short to medium run. We can use this linear interpolation to estimate the average CET parameter associated with any desired length of run.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the performance of a stylized supply chain where two firms, a retailer and a producer, compete in a Stackelberg game. The retailer purchases a single product from the producer and afterward sells it in the retail market at a stochastic clearance price. The retailer, however, is budget constrained and is therefore limited in the number of units that he may purchase from the producer. We also assume that the retailer's profit depends in part on the realized path or terminal value of some observable stochastic process. We interpret this process as a financial process such as a foreign exchange rate or interest rate. More generally, the process can be interpreted as any relevant economic index. We consider a variation (the flexible contract) of the traditional wholesale price contract that is offered by the producer to the retailer. Under this flexible contract, at t = 0 the producer offers a menu of wholesale prices to the retailer, one for each realization of the financial process up to a future time τ. The retailer then commits to purchasing at time τ a variable number of units, with the specific quantity depending on the realization of the process up to time τ. Because of the retailer's budget constraint, the supply chain might be more profitable if the retailer was able to shift some of the budget from states where the constraint is not binding to states where it is binding. We therefore consider a variation of the flexible contract, where we assume that the retailer is able to trade dynamically between zero and τ in the financial market. We refer to this variation as the flexible contract with hedging. We compare the decentralized competitive solution for the two contracts with the solutions obtained by a central planner. We also compare the supply chain's performance across the two contracts. We find, for example, that the producer always prefers the flexible contract with hedging to the flexible contract without hedging. Depending on model parameters, however, the retailer might or might not prefer the flexible contract with hedging. </jats:p>",

Almost all the towns/cities in Nigeria are unplanned and this has resulted in haphazard approach to Electricity Network Planning and implementation. A detailed theory, methodology and technical considerations, in compliance with both National and International standards are discussed in this paper. A proposed University campus was used to demonstrate the procedures involved in electricity network planning in order to achieve an efficient power supply. This involves the electric power supply, design concepts, load estimates and analysis, network distribution/equipment and sizing of cables and electrical panels taking into account the various modes of distribution. This paper also drew a simple analogy between Benin City and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, to illustrate the objective of the paper while highlighting the merits associated with planned electrical engineering infrastructure and suggested the ways to remedy the unplanned networks in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

A case study of Semarang, Indonesia, shows that such phenomena have a detrimental effect on the environment. Land subsidence, seawater intrusion and sea flooding are, to some extent, the results of the failure of the public water supply company to service all Semarang City inhabitants. The study of the Semarang coastal area shows that the lack of access, especially to the poor, is a business opportunity for small-scale water supply providers. The problem with these providers is that all of them use groundwater as sources. The worse the service of the public water supply company the more necessary it is to regulate groundwater extraction. The poor will become very dependent on groundwater while also becoming victims of environmental degradation due to excessive groundwater extraction. The study shows that all inhabitants, poor and rich alike, are waiting to be supplied by the public water supply company. They will change to the public water supply whenever the service is available.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transportation is one of the most crucial components in supply networks. In transportation lines, there exists a finite time between products leaving a point and arriving to another point in the supply network. This period of time is the delay, which accompanies all transportation lines present in the entire network. Delay is a well-known limitation, which is inevitable and pervasive in the network causing synchronization problems, fluctuating or excessive inventories, and lack of robustness of inventories against cyclic perturbations. The end results of such undesirable effects directly reflect to costs. This paper is motivated to reveal the mechanisms leading to these problems by analytically characterizing qualitative behavior of supply network dynamics modeled by continuous-time differential equations. The presence of delay forms the main challenge in the analysis and this is tackled by developing/utilizing the tools emerging from delay systems and control theory. While the backbone of the paper addresses the qualitative behavior in presence of a single delay representing delays in all transportation paths, it also reveals how to choose production rates and transportation delay without inducing any undesirable effects mentioned. Thorough cases studies with single and multiple delays are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches proposed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Motivated by the challenges faced by the telecom industry during the past decade, in this paper we study a dynamic capacity expansion problem for service firms. There is a random demand for the firm's capacity in each period: the demand in excess of the capacity is lost, and revenue is generated for the fulfilled demand. At the beginning of each period, the firm might increase its capacity through purchasing equipment for immediate delivery, which is constrained by a random supply limit, or it might sign a future contract for equipment delivery in the following period. We assume that the firm's capacity might partially become obsolete due to natural deterioration or technology innovation. We aim at characterizing optimal capacity expansion strategies and comparing the profit functions as well as the optimal control policies of different options. Specifically, we show that the optimal capacity expansion policy for the current period is determined by a base-stock policy. Compared with the case where no future contracts are available, the optimal control parameters of capacity expansion are always smaller. We further show that when the obsolescence rate is deterministic, the optimal policy for capacity expansion through future contracts is also a base-stock type. The results are extended to the cases with stochastically dependent capacity supply limits and stochastically dependent demand processes, which establish the robustness of the optimal policy in various market conditions. </jats:p>",

This paper investigates the impact of both the extreme hot and dry summer of 2003 and the PRUDENCE CHRM climate change scenario summer for 2071–2100 on the monthly water balance (available water resources versus water demand) within the Kitzbueheler Region in the Austrian Alps. As a baseline period the climate normal period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen. In both summer scenarios total flow and ground water recharge decrease substantially, due to the decrease in precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration However, regional water availability is still sufficient to serve all water demand stakeholders. As a result of decreased snow cover duration, flow seasonality changes within the CHRM scenario. Especially springs are very vulnerable to these climatological conditions; average local groundwater recharge is reduced by 20% up to 70% within both scenarios. Due to the hydrogeological characteristics of the case study area and the typical small structured alpine water supply infrastructure, local deficits can occur. But also groundwater aquifers in the valleys show a decrease in water availability. These results are supported by observations made in 2003 throughout Austria and Switzerland.</jats:p>",

We investigate how risk-management strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information. </jats:p>",

Furthermore the revenue-sharing contracts are still equivalent to the buy-back contracts when the retail price is fixed. At the same time, it is shown that the risk-averse retailer of the coordinated supply chain can increase its profit by raising its risk-averse degree under mild conditions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In an attempt to investigate blood unit ordering policies, researchers have created a discrete-event model of the UK National Blood Service (NBS) supply chain in the Southampton area of the UK. The model has been created using Simul8, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) discrete-event simulation package (CSP). However, as more hospitals were added to the model, it was discovered that the length of time needed to perform a single simulation severely increased. It has been claimed that distributed simulation, a technique that uses the resources of many computers to execute a simulation model, can reduce simulation runtime. Further, an emerging standardized approach exists that supports distributed simulation with CSPs. These CSP Interoperability (CSPI) standards are compatible with the IEEE 1516 standard, the High Level Architecture (HLA), the de facto interoperability standard for distributed simulation. To investigate if distributed simulation can reduce the execution time of NBS supply chain simulation, this paper presents experiences of creating a distributed version of the CSP Simul8 according to the CSPI/HLA standards. It shows that the distributed version of the simulation does indeed run faster when the model reaches a certain size. Further, we argue that understanding the relationship of model features is key to performance. This is illustrated by experimentation with two different protocols implementations (using Time Advance Request (TAR) and Next Event Request (NER)). Our contribution is therefore the demonstration that distributed simulation is a useful technique in the timely execution of supply chains of this type and that careful analysis of model features can further increase performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 2000, ambient seawater pressure has been precisely measured at five seafloor benchmarks inside the summit caldera at Axial Seamount to monitor volcanic inflation, using a remotely operated vehicle to deploy a mobile pressure recorder (MPR) in campaign‐style surveys. Additionally, seawater pressure has been measured at the caldera center with multiyear deployments of continuously recording bottom pressure recorders (BPRs). These pressure data (converted to depth) are currently the only measurements of volcanic inflation at a submarine volcano. We show new data spanning 2004 to 2007 documenting steady inflation of 12.7 ± 0.4 cm/a at the caldera center. The spatial pattern of uplift is consistent with magma storage in a shallow reservoir underlying the caldera at a depth of ∼3.5 km, and the current uplift rate implies that magma is being supplied to the volcano at a rate of ∼7.5 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/a. However, the supply rate immediately after the last eruption in 1998 was significantly higher, and the temporal pattern of uplift at Axial caldera appears to be governed by at least two processes occurring at very different time scales. We interpret the high uplift rates immediately following the 1998 eruption as either due to influx from one or more small satellite magma bodies or as the result of viscoelastic relaxation and/or poroelastic behavior of the crust surrounding the shallow magma chamber, and we present a numerical model which supports the latter interpretation. In contrast, we interpret the current lower uplift rate as due to a steady longterm magma supply from the mantle. This two component uplift pattern has not been observed on land volcanoes, suggesting that magma supply/storage processes beneath this ridge axis volcano differ from volcanoes on land (including Iceland). To reconstruct the uplift history at Axial, we fit the combined MPR and BPR data to two possible uplift scenarios, with which we forecast that the next eruption at Axial is likely to occur by about 2020, when most of the ∼3 m of deflation that occurred during the 1998 eruption will have been recovered.</jats:p>",

When firms downstream in the supply chain seek to achieve such improvements themselves, they frequently request that their suppliers adopt greener practices. This paper investigates the rationale for suppliers to comply with or resist the mandate of their customers to adopt the international environmental management standard ISO 14001 in the North American automotive industry. We argue that the effectiveness of such a mandate will vary according to the characteristics of the relationship between suppliers and customers. We contrast and test hypotheses based on both transaction cost and information theories to suggest that suppliers, whether in a dependent or distant relationship with their customers, have incentives to comply with the requests of their customers but through different mechanisms. Our study analyzed the characteristics of 3,152 automotive suppliers located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico over the 2000–2003 period. Findings indicate that suppliers with highly specialized assets, as well as younger suppliers, suppliers headquartered in Japan, and those reporting to the Toxic Release Inventory, are more likely to respond to their customers' pressures to adopt the certified management standard ISO 14001.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Are major evaluative criteria for vote choice—such as parties, candidates, and issues—systematically affected by characteristics of political macrocontexts? For example, does it make a difference in the evaluative process if citizens cast their votes in small, single-member constituencies or in large, multimember districts? How do voters cope with the complexity of their political environment? There is growing evidence that voters’ evaluative criteria for electoral behavior are conditioned by the nature of their political environment (Kroh 2003; Paldam 1991). Thus, generally we expect that the political macro-context matters for vote choice .</jats:p>",

This occurs frequently with biological (biotech) drugs. We use methods from decision analysis to explicitly model the variability in epidemiological data together with the variability in treatment modalities to estimate latent therapeutic demand (LTD)—the underlying demand that captures how physicians would prescribe treatment and how patients would comply if ample supplies of drugs were available and affordable. Our approach evolved from efforts to help Bayer Biological Products with strategic decisions regarding its drug for treating hemophilia A, the future of which had been clouded for several years, primarily due to a lack of confidence in demand estimates. Use of the LTD model resulted in a better understanding of the therapeutic needs of the global hemophilia community and helped Bayer make good decisions. We believe this approach is widely applicable to forecasting potential demand for supply-constrained as well as brand-new drugs, and thus can be very useful in helping both drug manufacturers and health-care agencies worldwide to ensure adequate supplies of critical drugs. </jats:p>",

The classic example is the lighthouse, whose warning light goes out to and benefits all ships. Economists devote special attention to public goods because markets do not deliver them efficiently. Rational, self-interested actors realize that if anyone else provides this good, they can have it without paying for it. The incentives favor “free riding.” Others, however, see the same opportunity and so public goods go underprovided. There is thus a strong case for collective action to furnish public goods. Where collective benefits outweigh the costs of provision, government action can make society as a whole better-off.</jats:p>",

Hence there is no magnetic saturation even under a high-current supply, and it is confirmed to have significantly low magnetic loss resulting from the low coercive force. As a result of using the glassy metal alloy Fe77P7B13Nb3 powder in an inductor core, we have achieved improvement in power supply efficiency by up to roughly 2.0%. Moreover, the reduction in the standby power requirement by the improvement in the power supply efficiency in the low load current case, where the core loss occupies a high ratio in the entire loss, can be expected. Additionally, heat generation in a core is suppressed by using the low loss powder, and it becomes easy to design a temperature rise in the entire power supply circuit.</jats:p>",

A comparative study executed with participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods with groups of women from 11 micro-enterprises in ten villages and five control villages showed that,when an improved domestic water supply does not function, the entrepreneurs groups have a statistically higher loss of the economic use of water and time than the control groups. The extra income that women gain when the supply works and is used economically helps poor families to bridge the dry season. It could further be quantitatively proven that male–female gender relations were significantly better in the entrepreneurs group. This was not so for mother–daughter relationships, which gave new insights into the need to address gender equality issues with the women themselves and with SEWA, the supporting agency. These findings support the view that rural poverty and the status of women would receive a significant boost if policy makers focused on providing employment opportunities for women along with improved water supplies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In drought-affected maize production zones with short growing periods, the development and use of early maturing drought-tolerant cultivars can stabilize maize production. We evaluated 10 improved and 25 farmers' early maturing maize varieties under moisture deficit and well-watered conditions for 2 years to identify suitable genetic materials for breeding drought-tolerant cultivars. The varieties exhibited significant differences in grain yield and other traits under both moisture deficit and well-watered conditions. Changes in the rank order of the varieties for grain yield was not significant across the different levels of moisture supply in this study. Grain yield was significantly correlated with days to anthesis, days to silking, plant height, ear height, ear number and anthesis–silking interval (ASI) under the two irrigation treatments and with leaf death scores under moisture deficit, suggesting that the common traits were beneficial in maximizing grain yield under both sufficient water supply and moisture deficit. Grain yield and the traits significantly correlated with it differentiated the early maturing maize varieties into two distinct groups under well-watered condition and moisture deficit. The improved varieties were superior to the farmers' varieties in grain yield and other traits under moisture deficit, possibly due to selection of their progenitors for improved performance in multiple locations. We found some farmers' and improved varieties with similar yield potential and flowering time under well-watered conditions but with marked differences in grain yield and other traits under moisture deficit. Use of such promising landraces that would also be invaluable sources of desirable farmers-preferred end-use quality traits in combination with promising improved varieties as breeding materials could enhance the genetic grain from selection for drought tolerance in early maize.</jats:p>",

However, the mechanisms behind glacial/interglacial (G/IG) variations in atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations observed in the Antarctic ice cores are still not fully understood. Here we present a new multiproxy data set of sea surface temperatures (SST), dust and iron supply, and marine export productivity, from the marine sediment core PS2489‐2/ODP Site 1090 located in the subantarctic Atlantic, that allow us to evaluate various hypotheses on the role of the Southern Ocean (SO) in modulating atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations back to 1.1 Ma. We show that Antarctic atmospheric temperatures are closely linked to changes in SO surface temperatures over the last 800 ka and use this to synchronize the timescales of our marine and the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C (EDC) records. The close correlation observed between iron inputs and marine export production over the entire interval implies that the process of iron fertilization of marine biota has been a recurrent process operating in the subantarctic region over the G/IG cycles of the last 1.1 Ma. However, our data suggest that marine productivity can only explain a fraction of atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> changes (up to around 40–50 ppmv), occurring at glacial maxima in each glacial stage. In this sense, the good correlation of our SST record to the EDC temperature reconstruction suggests that the initial glacial CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decrease, as well as the change in the amplitude of the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> cycles observed around 400 ka, was most likely driven by physical processes, possibly related to changes in Antarctic sea ice extent, surface water stratification, and westerly winds position.</jats:p>",

Tall fescue and dallisgrass seeds were sown either in the spring (October 2000) or in the autumn (March 2001) in mixed and mono‐specific stands with 0 or 100 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. In the spring, competition from tall fescue depressed dry‐matter (DM) yield of dallisgrass from 1·53 to 0·36 g DM per plant and tiller number from 9·4 to 3·7 tillers per plant in mixed and in mono‐specific stands, respectively, while tall fescue had 3–4 times higher DM yields in mixed stands. Leaf extension rate (LER) of tall fescue was higher (1·3 mm d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) than that of dallisgrass (0·53 mm d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). In the autumn, inter‐specific competition did not affect DM yield of dallisgrass and N fertilizer increased DM yield from 0·53 to 2·07 g DM per plant, tiller number from 6·8 to 14·2 tillers per plant and LER at the beginning of autumn from 1·2 to 2·12 mm d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in both species. As temperature decreased, LER was reduced in both species to 0·31 mm d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> by late autumn. The number of leaves per tiller was not affected by treatment. Nitrogen fertilizer increased N concentration of above‐ground tissues of both species (18 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM in autumn and 20 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DM in spring). It was concluded that a productive mixed pasture of dallisgrass and tall fescue can be obtained by sowing early in the autumn. The application of N fertilizer in this season is essential to ensure a high herbage yield and quality.</jats:p>",
