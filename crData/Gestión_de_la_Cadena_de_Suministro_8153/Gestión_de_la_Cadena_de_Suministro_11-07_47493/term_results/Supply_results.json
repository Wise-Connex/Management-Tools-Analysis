      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Business strategy is linked to organisational values and culture, which is determined to some extent by national culture. This can provide a challenge in a global supply chain where culture and values at one end of the chain do not correspond with culture at the other end. This paper contends that shared values contribute to effective sustainability changes in supply chains. Two case studies from the South African–British fresh fruit export chain present two contrasting business strategies for achieving socially sustainable practices: (i) a unilateral, prescriptive approach (pushing), mirroring a paternalistic value system, in which a company prescribes norms of socially responsible behaviour at the ground level (the Tesco case) and; (ii) a bilateral, collaborative approach (sharing) in which business and non‐governmental organisations work together to improve working conditions (the Waitrose case). Outcomes of these approaches are observed over a 3‐year period. It is concluded that within this specific supply chain a shared value approach is a more successful initiative than paternalistic pushing initiatives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When alum is used as a coagulant in a water treatment plant (WTP), a large volume of sludge is generated. The characteristics of the sludge depend strongly on the water source and the quality and quantity of the chemicals used for processing. For a plant with total suspended solids (TSS)/turbidity unit (TU) factor of 1.7, the weight of the alum sludge produced at an average alum dose of 28.2 mg/L is approximately 25 kg/MLD. Disposal of sludge in a way that is economically and environmentally sustainable is a major challenge faced by WTPs around the globe. In this study, the alum sludge generated during water treatment was used as a partial substitute for clay in a clay brick manufacturing process. Alum sludge and commercial local clay were blended in various proportions and sintered at different temperatures to produce clay-sludge bricks. In this paper, the physical and mechanical properties of clay-sludge bricks, such as loss on ignition (LOI), water absorption, and compressive strength, are investigated. The results from this study indicate that alum sludge could be used as a partial substitute in commercial clay bricks to a maximum of 20% without compromising the strength of the bricks.</jats:p>",

This paper introduces a method to detect the yarn tension during knitting action. A 3-rollor tension sensor was adopted and a sensory system was assembled on a flat knitting machine. A single chip microcomputer and a specially designed circuit were used for the signal capturing and transmission. Yarn tension changes during the knitting process was recorded and displayed by a PC. In order to verify the validity, several experiments were arranged. The results indicate that the yarn tension can be detected, recorded and displayed. After analyzing the tension curves, it is founded that the knitting action especially the yarn elastic properties and feed spring performance affects the yarn supply tension. We also find this method is practical.</jats:p>"

Much recent research activity has been focussed upon the formation, occurrence and control of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in particular. In this study, seven secondary amines were oxidised by chlorine, ozone, and UV-irradiation, with and without post-chloramination, to quantify the effect on the formation of seven nitrosamines, including NDMA. While the yields of nitrosamines ranged from 0.01% for N-nitroso-di-n-butylamine (NDBA) to 2.01% for N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) under conditions of excess monochloramine at pH 7, yields from other oxidants were zero. Pre-oxidation with chlorine reduced nitrosamine formation by up to 83% compared with chloramination alone. This illustrates that in situations where secondary amines are key precursors, chlorine addition before ammonia during chloramination can be expected to limit nitrosamine formation. UV irradiation at 40 mJ cm−2 had little observed impact. Ozonation enhanced NDMA and N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA) formation by subsequent chloramination to 7.48% and 10.15%, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every year 2800 deaths in Pacific island countries result from diarrhoea, and most are children under five years of age. These tragic diarrheal deaths are preventable as they are often linked to unsafe water, lack of proper sanitation facilities and poor hygienic practices. Effective preventive management through the framework of a drinking Water Safety Plan (WSP) is an efficient mechanism for ensuring the safe quality of drinking water thereby reducing the burden of water related diseases. The large proportion (81%) of people in Pacific island countries living in rural or outer island communities mostly have their own water supply (for example rainwater tanks or hand-dug wells), and often the water is consumed untreated. The remoteness and isolation of these rural communities prevent national surveillance authorities to regularly visit and provide advice on drinking water safety issues. In such circumstances empowering rural communities to ensure the safety of their drinking water, through trained local facilitators, could be promoted and utilised effectively. However, WSPs for rural communities have to be relatively simple hence tools such as modified sanitary inspections and the presence/absence hydrogen sulfide test could be used. The approach of empowering communities through trained local facilitators to promote the WSP framework has been implemented in the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI). Positive feedback has been received by trained facilitators in RMI on the use of modified sanitary inspections (translated into Marshallese) and the hydrogen sulfide test. It is believed that the approach of empowering communities on WSPs through training local facilitators and equipping them with the above mentioned simple tools is effective and has potential for further replication in rural Pacific communities to improve drinking water quality and reduce the burden of water related diseases.</jats:p>",

The philosophy of SCM is based firmly on a recognition that it is only by working in a more integrated manner that competitive advantage can be maximised. However, for this to become a reality the development of common definitions and understandings between supply chain partners is a critical success factor. The corollary of this is that a lack of definitional consistency and a common understanding is an inhibitor to the successful adoption of SCM thinking in practice. This paper reviews a number of definitions of SCM, as well as discussions and analyses of such definitions. This leads to the central point posited in the paper – the need for a ‘unified definition’. Such a definitional construct, labelled the Four Fundamentals of SCM, is proposed with the core of the paper providing a narrative description of this construct based on a wide range of literature.</p>",

Then, the paper went on to set the values of compensation coefficients for road breadth, vehicles in parking in and driving out, non-motor vehicles, and lateral clearance, so as to calculate, with the precondition of guaranteeing certain service standards, the maximal values of curb parking lots on road sections under the constraints of traffic capacity. In addition, it also constructed the driving speed model according to BRP resistance function and, via the analysis of “Friction” effect and “Blocking” effect of curb parking on traffic flows of motor vehicle lanes, measured the influence of curb parking on driving speed in order to exactly determine of maximal parking value under the condition that the minimal driving speed of motor vehicles can be ensured. Finally, for the purpose of finding the balance between dynamic and static traffic and of maximally utilizing the remaining road resources, the maximal number of curb parking lots shall be the minimal value to satisfy the constraints of road conditions, traffic capacity and driving speed.</jats:p>"

The operating points of eight resources owned by agents interact with each other are controlled through eight random numbers, the direction, degree, speed and stability of resources flow during interaction among agents are described respectively by matching capability, matching speed and matching time; Furthermore, the evolution process about the resources among agents interacting is described by rules of GEF(Global Evaluate Function) and LEF(Local Evaluate Function), resources flow model of complex system about the supply chain is established; Eventually, through simulating respectively in the Swarm platform both the proposed model and the simple model that doesn’t cunsder the multi-compartment agent but the linear sum of all resources, it is found that the former describes the change rule of the resource more accurately in the supply chain system. It means that syncretizing eight resources, which interact and inter-constrain in the system, to an indiscerptible one is the attributable cause of the emergence.</jats:p>"

Membrane material and pH of feed water were shown to be the influence on the performance of PCO-UF process. It was observed that higher pH of HA feed water and a hydrophobic membrane lead to better removal of HA with relatively higher permeate flux. The experimental results in this study demonstrated that 100 kDa ultraflic UF membrane and pH 9 of HA feed water would be the optimal choice for HA removal in the combined PCO-UF process.</jats:p>",

Although conventional wisdom perceives that IT systems facilitate supply chain collaboration, this research provides an alternative perspective. Drawing on resource-based view and contingency ‘fit’ theory, the study investigates a model of relationships that specify how environmental uncertainty factors influence the nature of the association of two critical but distinctive IT capabilities with collaboration. Findings corroborate the positive association between collaboration and B2B e-commerce and IT analytic capability. However, demand unpredictability enhances the IT analytic capability-collaboration relationship while detracting from the B2B e-commerce-collaboration association. Notably, the study did not find any moderating influence of another critical uncertainty factor, technological turbulence. The findings reveal the complex nature of IT-collaboration relationships and provide managers a framework for understanding the uncertainty contexts under which specific information technologies with various functionalities may be more appropriately leveraged to derive benefits.</p>",

In today’s global competitive business environment, competitiveness is heavily influenced by the ability of the multiple organizations in a supply chain to synchronize and integrate their business activities and processes. Supply chain integration, (SCI) which links the activities, functions, processes, and systems of a firm with its customers and suppliers, can reduce uncertainty, enhance responsiveness, reduce costs, and improve customer service. Empirical studies have explored SCI and reported that information technology (IT) is a key ingredient for the success of the integrated supply chain. While the research on SCI has been reported in OM literature, empirical studies that investigate the impact of different levels of IT utilization (ITU) – strategic, operational, and infrastructural - on SCI are not available. This research also explores the impact of top management support (TMS) on the relationship between ITU and SCI. Based on data collected from 220 manufacturing firms, this study indicates that ITU will have a positive impact on the success of an integrated supply chain when top management is personally involved in the technology implementation process.</p>",

It is observed that critical flux was increased from 20 L/m2·h in the conventional submerged membrane system to 55 L/m2 h in ICSMS.

Dedicated feedback controllers are utilized to maintain product inventory at all nodes of the supply chain network within pre-specified target levels that are subsequently embedded within the optimization control framework. The PID control policy is applied to promoting the predictive control effect, and the comparative simulations of the system under both PID and non-PID control are exerted.

In this paper, extending and enhancing previous models, a general model is proposed for closed loop supply chains using linear programming. The goal of this study is to minimize the leakage of a closed loop supply chain to avoid waste and reduce SCM costs.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sodium metabisulphite (SMBS) is the current standard preservation chemical used in RO plants during shut down. It is a cheap and efficient preservative, but its tendency to oxidize easily has several drawbacks. The use of a non-oxidizing biocide instead could solve some of the issues currently seen with the SMBS, but little has been reported about membrane compatibility and preservation efficiency in the long-term mode. Long-term membrane preservation trials have been executed with three different non-oxidizing biocides: DBNPA (2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide), CMIT/MIT (5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (CMIT) and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT), OIT (2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one) as well as SMBS as the reference chemical. The suitability of these chemicals in this application was confirmed using both new Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (BWRO) and used membranes with various membrane chemistries (Nanofiltration (NF), BWRO, Sea Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO)). The preservation trial with new membranes confirmed the long-term stability of the product when stored in the biocide solution while the trial with used elements is closer to realistic plant conditions and validated the efficiency of the biocide against biofouling in the long-term. These results show that the biocides can be equivalent preservatives to SMBS and that the application is economically feasible. The used active concentrations for biocides are storage time and temperature dependent and this should be taken into account when first applying them in the field.</jats:p>",

In this paper, an AHP-based supplier selection model is formulated and then applied to a real case study for a polyamide fiber plant in China.

This approach requires a comprehensive hazard assessment including the identification and prioritisation of potential hazardous events. The Failure Experience Improvement System (FEIS) supports this key step in developing a WSP. The FEIS can assist water utilities in identifying the causes and effects of hazardous events, determining priorities for risk management and locating vulnerable points in their water supply system. This is achieved through the systematic collection of failure causes and their effects in a database and an analysis of the resulting failure network using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The FEIS provides both graphical visualisation of failure propagation and analytical indicators to evaluate hazardous events. This paper demonstrates the use of the FEIS to support the WSP approach.</jats:p>",

Using survey data on users of motorized piped water supply systems in rural southern Senegal, this paper examines what motivates resource users to contribute financially to the management of water supply system infrastructure by paying their water tariff. Results from logistic regression analysis indicate that users who prefer borehole water and are satisfied with the service provided are more likely than others to pay. In addition, those who trust that other users will pay are more likely themselves to pay than those who do not trust their peers. These findings suggest that assessing the needs of users and providing services tailored to those needs (e.g., quality, convenience) is recommended for future interventions. The incorporation of programs that promote peer trust should also be considered as future interventions to establish or strengthen resource management organization.</jats:p>",

In Exp. 1, populations representing the parental composite and progeny from first and second cycles of divergent selection were seeded on soils testing low to medium for available P and K, a sandy loam (Becker, MN) and a silt loam (Rosemount, MN).

On the other plots, equal K rates (270 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) as KCl were topdressed. Added P did not affect herbage dry mass in the first and second years following stand establishment, but increased herbage P concentration and uptake at Becker. There was no effect of K placement, but the tap‐rooted germplasm had lower K concentration in herbage than the parent. Although progeny did not differ in total root mass, the ratio of thickened‐to‐total root mass was larger below 30 cm for the tap‐rooted selection, which also produced more fine roots. Selected germplasms did not differ in P or K uptake. Selected root system architecture characteristics were expressed under, and apparently not modified by, growing conditions that covered three site‐years on two contrasting soils with differential P supply and K placement.</jats:p>",

An alternative to this method is the under floor air distribution system (UFAD) which is in its fantasy state. Thermal stratification can be established in this method due to the buoyancy flow of the air. In this paper assessment of the impact of temperature sensors in energy savings is done in UFAD system. It is observed that by the placement of temperature sensors in the occupied space, supply air temperature can be controlled while maintaining the comfort conditions. By optimal conditions of the temperature and volume flow, energy savings can be achieved due to reduction in energy requirements in refrigeration and ventilation.

However, hydraulic conductivity, not porosity, is the constant of proportionality that describes flow through porous media. Equations have been developed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of CPF side walls and bottom as well an effective overall hydraulic conductivity. The equations are intended to be used with falling head data that may be collected in the field. The results of flowrate testing and open porosity testing using experimental CPFs provide preliminary indication that hydraulic conductivity is a better predictor of flowrate relative to open porosity. The results of the preliminary testing suggest that the shape and orientation of open pore space may have significant impact on filter flowrates, and that filter researchers and producers may want to evaluate the material used to form the pores as well as the impact of the filter formation process on any spatial orientation of open pore space. A better understanding of hydraulic conductivity may improve the production efficiency of filter factories which could make lower cost filters available to a greater number of households in developing areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 1999 and 2007, several successive years of severe drought put South East Queensland's water supply under immense pressure. The decision was taken in 2005 to build a seawater desalination plant and three water recycling advanced treatment plants as part of a large investment plan to secure the region's potable water supply. The infrastructure built and commissioned in the past 3 years has a combined capacity producing more than 350,000 m3 per day of very high quality water that can be used either directly (seawater desalination) or indirectly (recycled water) for supplying drinking water. All the plants primarily rely on reverse osmosis membranes for water purification which is an effective and reliable barrier to contaminants, but also requires high energy consumption and a high level of pre-treatment and chemicals. In this paper, the actual energy consumption of two of the plants (the seawater desalination plant and one water recycling plant) was investigated with the perspective of drinking water production over the July 2009–June 2010 period. Eolia™ Potable Water, a Life Cycle Analysis tool developed by Veolia Environnement Research &amp; Innovation, was used to model the processes and estimate the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from both plants. As expected, the energy requirement of the desalination was higher (approximately 2.2 times) than the water recycling plant. The plants were found to be significantly more energy efficient when operated at higher flow. In both cases, the purchase of electrical energy represented by far the major contribution to GHG emissions. Indirect GHG emissions from chemical consumption could be reduced at the water recycling plant by optimising the dose of ferric chloride used at the plant and sourcing the chemical from a less distant supplier.</jats:p>",

The control charts for MDT for all pipe types, and the MTTR for CI and CC pipes, were found to be out of statistical control, but the control charts for the MTTR of DI and PVC pipes were discovered to be in control. According to the OC curves, in which the hypothesis stated that the average MDT or MTTR was between the specification limits, there was a high tendency in all pipe types to accept the hypothesis when it was true. However, the probability of type I errors was high from operational standards at the USL level. Process capability analyses found that only CC pipes were able to meet performance design specifications; however, repair times are extremely large for CC pipes.

This article reports on Hong Kong's shift from supply‐side management (i.e., continual increase in developing infrastructure to meet increasing demand) to demand‐side management (i.e., reducing demand so that existing supplies can continue to provide a consistent and wholesome supply) and leakage reduction. Reduction in consumption and effective control of leakage are essential to ensuring that the region's water infrastructure will continue to meet the needs and expectations of Hong Kong's people as effectively as it has in the past.</jats:p>",

For example, the textile, paper, chemical, and steel industries grapple with significant levels of non‐tariff barriers (NTBs) such as safeguard controls and countervailing duties. We explore three often observed supply chain strategies in industries subject to NTBs; direct procurement, split procurement, and outward processing arrangements (OPAs). We characterize the optimal procurement quantities for each of these three strategies, and examine how industry and country characteristics influence the firm's strategy preference. For example, we establish that the direct and split strategy profits increase in the NTB price variance but decrease in the mean price. These effects are sufficiently large that NTB price characteristics can dictate which supply chain strategy is preferred. Both the cost disadvantage and lead‐time advantage of domestic production are also significant influencers of the preferred strategy, as is the domestic‐country mandated production constraint associated with the OPA strategy. </jats:p>",

Being one of the first movers in CSR in the publishing business, AS realized that current practices could spark future public discussion that might put pressure on AS, a key player in these supply chains. In early 2002, AS and one of their main suppliers, Stora Enso, started a joint initiative to redesign the supply chain processes in two of the major Russian logging regions to improve their social and ecological performance. Sometime later, other major players in the publishing sector as well as critical reviewers from several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were invited to participate in the design of the new voluntary sustainability initiative called “Tikhvin Chalna project”, the second phase of which was accomplished by the end of 2006.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Expected learning outcomes</jats:title><jats:list list-type=\"order\" id=\"list22\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Learn that organizations (specifically high-brand owners) are responsible for practices within their entire supply chains (social as well as environmental performance).</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Explore proactive corporate sustainability, CSR strategies are market but also institutional driven; Strategizing involves forming and transforming the rules, norms and standard models of customers as well as institutions such as NGOs or governmental bodies.

Fouling experiments for two different backwashes (UF permeate and demineralized water) were conducted at three fluxes: 120, 180 and 240 L/(h m2) to compare their fouling control efficiency on UF membranes. Results show that backwashing with demineralized water improved the fouling control of UF membranes. When the UF membranes were backwashed with demineralized water, probably because more foulants were flushed away from the UF membrane than UF permeate backwashes, the increase in trans membrane pressure (TMP) for backwashing with demineralized water was less than that with UF permeate. Furthermore, the fluxes of experiments also played a role on the fouling control. When the flux was 120 L/(h m2), the difference between two different backwashes was small. However, at the flux of 240 L/(h m2), the TMP for backwashing with UF permeate increased faster than that with demineralized water, although the TMP for backwashing with demineralized water increased as well.</jats:p>",

In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other local, national, and international partners in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) initiated a series of WSP demonstration projects. The objectives were to raise WSP awareness, build capacity, and promote adoption of the WSP approach while identifying those factors that aid or hinder water safety planning efforts in resource-challenged settings. This paper presents eleven lessons learned from these WSP demonstration projects, including the importance of assembling a well-supported interagency team, long-term commitment to WSP implementation, adherence to a water quality monitoring plan, and determining how WSP impacts will be evaluated prior to WSP initiation. To assist in supporting future WSP activity in the region, this paper shares experiences that led to these successes, challenges, and lessons learned.</jats:p>",

Although changes in the NGO sector in China are well researched, questions remain about the barriers to increasing the supply of social services from registered NGOs. We use Mattei's managerial and democratic accountability framework to examine empirical data about the relationship between the way NGO disability services in Beijing are organised and barriers to improving the type, quantity and quality of their social services. Barriers include limited NGO management capacity and underdeveloped government relations. When viewed through the multidimensional accountability framework, the barriers are not surprising. The NGOs' understanding and application of accountability processes are rudimentary. We conclude that government policy to encourage the development of accountability practices of NGOs in China will be critical if it needs NGOs to supply quality social services.</jats:p>",

Findings provide evidence that organizations choose contract designs that will reduce uncertainty related to securing critical resources. However, different dimensions of dependence have different effects: (1) higher levels of joint dependence lead to more flexible governance forms; (2) the lack of alternative suppliers is a more important factor than high levels of financial dependence; and (3) the parties involved in government procurement are likely to perceive government as a unique type of organization, which, in turn, has implications for contract design choices.

Either party can offer an MIR to the end consumer if it is in his best interest. The consumer demand is stochastic and depends on the product price and the amount of MIRs. When the retail price is exogenous, we show the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium under both additive and multiplicative demand functions and characterize it completely. We show that any of the following four scenarios can be the equilibrium: both parties offer MIR, only one party offers MIR, none offers MIR. When the retail price is a decision variable for the retailer and the rebate redemption rate increases with the amount of MIR, we once again prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium where both the retailer and the manufacturer offer MIRs. Using a numerical study, we show that the average post‐purchase price of the product is higher not only than the perceived pre‐purchase price but also than the newsvendor optimal price without an MIR. This implies that an MIR makes a product look cheaper while the consumers actually pay more on average. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine transshipment incentives in a decentralized supply chain where a monopolist distributes a product through independent retailers. A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a “chain store”) and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store. </jats:p>",

The model experiments carried out separately for the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and south Indian Oceans indicate that distinct local maxima of near-surface baroclinicity observed along the storm tracks can be reinforced most efficiently as a response to the near-surface sensible heating. The result suggests the particular importance of the differential sensible heat supply from the ocean across an oceanic frontal zone for the efficient restoration of surface baroclinicity, which acts against the relaxing effect by poleward eddy heat transport, setting up conditions favorable for the recurrent development of transient eddies to anchor a storm track. Unlike what has been suggested, the corresponding reinforcement of the near-surface baroclinicity along a storm track as the response to the latent heating due either to cumulus convection or large-scale condensation is found less efficient. As is well known, poleward eddy heat flux convergence acts as the primary contributor to the reinforcement of the surface westerlies, especially in the core of a storm track. In its exit region, a substantial contribution to the reinforcement arises also from a planetary wave response to the sensible heat supply from the ocean. In contrast, the surface wind acceleration as a planetary wave response to the latent heating is found to contribute negatively to the maintenance of the surface westerlies along any of the major storm tracks.</jats:p>",

The textural properties and morphology of catalyst were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption and transmission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer respectively. The effects such as metal content and granule size on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane were investigated in fixed bed reactor. The results show that the metallic active components can be well dispersed on the support, and the elements analysis indicates the metal species tend to assemble on the surface layer rather than being distributed equally in the whole catalyst. The La modified catalyst LaNi/AC exhibited superior catalytic performance to Ni/AC and the conversion was 45% for LaNi/AC catalyst at 673K, while only 34 % for Ni/AC under the same conditions.</jats:p>"

It is closely related to the saturation state of the core of the transformer, which harvests energy from the magnetic field generated by the current through the high voltage power line. The recovery current of three types of core material are systematically discussed in terms of their characteristics, which are the Silicon Steel, the Nanocrystalline Alloy, and the Fe-based Amorphous. The closed core of the Nanocrystalline Alloy and Fe-based Amorphous has the feature of low recovery current. Both of them can carry out a lower recovery current within 0.5A in the DC power supply; The gapped core of the Silicon Steel is able to work at the highest recovery current among the three types of cores in the same dimension, which benefits the higher input current of the DC power supply, beyond 2000A. Resultant data of analysis provides a prospective reference for design of the DC power supply with a wide range of input current by application of the combined cores.</jats:p>"

The performance of the column was studied in terms of removal efficiency, metal sequestered in the column during a specified time and biosorption capacity. The observations recorded during the study showed that the removal efficiency of As(V) after 60 min of treatment varied from 0.7 to 45.0% for 25–100 μg/L initial concentrations. The best removal efficiency of As(V) was exhibited by agar-agar and S. platensis biomass combination (45%), whereas agar-agar alone showed only 18.0% removal efficiency at 25 μg/L initial concentration. The biosorption capacity of As(V) varied from 108 to 694 μg/g for 25–100 μg/L initial concentration and the highest value (694 μg/g) was recorded for agar-agar and S. platensis biomass combination. This value was 20% higher than agar-agar alone (556 μg/g) after 60 min of treatment time. The results of the present study suggest that physical entrapment of an appropriate combination of algal adsorbents in polyurethane matrix offers a cost-effective solution for the treatment of water contaminated with arsenic.</jats:p>",

Ruggie’s framework to protect, respect and remedy provides a useful tool to determine the responsibilities of government and business in relation to human rights. If it is applied to product-related environmental aspects, which affect human rights, it offers a good tool to evaluate whether producer responsibility has been implemented in a way to institutionally align business and governments. An analysis of extended producer responsibility up and down the supply chain on the basis of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) legislation, REACH legislation and conflict minerals shows that such alignment has not been achieved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the role of the yield-dependent trading cost structure influencing the optimal choice of the selling price and production quantity for a firm that operates under supply uncertainty in the agricultural industry. The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion. </jats:p>",

One of the main aspects of such an analysis is the optimisation of vehicle routes to deliver final products to customers. There are many algorithms to optimise the related vehicle routing problem. The objective function of that problem usually involves distance, cost, number of vehicles, or profits. This study also takes safety and environmental costs into account. Thus, the authors develop variants to traditional heuristic algorithms, in which they include the traditional costs along with safety and environmental cost estimates for real scenarios in Spain. This methodology is called ASEC (Algorithms with Safety and Environmental Criteria). These considerations raise the value of the global objective function, but permit a more realistic cost estimate that includes not only the internal costs involved in the problem but also the related externalities. Finally, real cases are discussed, and solutions are offered using the new ASEC methodology.</p>",

Its performance is hindered by membrane fouling. In this study pre-treatment methods to reduce RO fouling were investigated including flocculation, adsorption and ion exchange. Detailed organic characterisations were made in terms of florescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix (EEM), UV254 absorbance and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LCOCD). The different pre-treatment methods were assessed in terms of the fouling potential. This was quantified in terms of the modified fouling index measured using a dead-end cell micro-filtration (MF) unit. The existing pre-treatment of granular activated carbon (GAC) filter led to a good organic removal. Among the pre-treatment methods tested in the laboratory, purolite ion exchange/adsorption was found to be better than FeCl3 flocculation in terms of the amount as well as the wide range of organics removal. A pre-treatment of flocculation with Poly-ferric-silicate (PFSi) as flocculent gave a higher removal of organic matter compared to other pre-treatments tested. DOC was reduced from 11.5 to 4.25 mg/L, and it removed mostly the humic type substances.</jats:p>",

Interconnection of small, modular generations and energy storages of low or medium voltage distribution systems forms a new type of power system, which called the micro grid (MG). This paper has developed a methodology of performing the optimal unit sizing for distributed energy resources in MG. The methodology aims at finding the configuration, among a set of systems components, which meets the desired system reliability requirements, with the minimum cost of energy (COE). Other than solar and wind energies, in this study the biogas power plant and the use of urban waste for producing electricity power are considered. The size of biogas power plant is calculated according to available municipal waste. The micro grid system is connected to the utility and can sale its extra produced power to utility. In first step, accurate mathematical models for characterizing standalone photovoltaic module, wind generator, biogas plant, and battery bank are proposed. In second step, based on a breeding particle swarm optimization algorithm, one optimal sizing method is developed to calculate the optimum system configuration that can achieve the customers required loss of power supply probability with a minimum COE. By this methodology, we can analyze MG</jats:p>",

In particular, it is very difficult for them to evacuate safely in blackout conditions with servers down. In the proposed method, passive RFID tags are placed on the walls of the building and each evacuee carries a mobile terminal that is battery‐powered and equipped with an RFID reader‐writer. This device finds evacuation routes based on the information from passive RFID tags touched by the evacuee. The method identifies safety of evacuation routes from the movement of people who have evacuated safely. Mobile terminal communication and RFID tags achieve sharing of information on safe routes among many evacuees. An experiment was conducted, letting people evacuate by two routes in an actual building, and giving about half of them mobile terminals. We easured the increases in the blood pressure and heart rates of the evacuees before and after the evacuation. In both routes, the rates of increase of these two characteristics in the evacuees with terminals were smaller than those in the evacuees without terminals, demonstrating that the proposed method provides assurance to evacuees. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Even when water is plentiful, its quality may be unsuitable for household use such as in the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which is the study area for this investigation. Shortage of potable water has forced inhabitants in the city to rely on water wells dug without adherence to regulations or specifications within perimeters of their homesteads. The water from such wells is often polluted with household waste being generally disposed by burning and burying in shallow pits, thrown in pit toilets or into rivers. Such practices have led to contamination of ground water. This study examines the water quality of drinking water drawn from wells in Fer-bois, which falls under the Kimbanseke municipality in the South East of Kinshasa. The dynamics of well design/location, sources of possible contamination with respect to water treatment and water quality as well as its possible impact on health are examined. The area was shown to have poor groundwater quality with significant amounts of pollutants such as NO3, Pb and Cd leading to environmental and health concerns.</jats:p>",

In this essay we focus on how the field of operations management can provide fresh perspectives and insights in addressing the challenges of product safety and security in the global supply chain. We first examine the product safety issues and challenges that arise in five industries that are increasingly globalizing their supply chains: food, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer products and automobiles. We describe four areas where operations management theory and methodologies can provide fresh insights and innovative solutions in addressing these problems; regulation and standards, product lifecycle management, traceability and recall management, and supplier relationships.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change forced by anthropogenic activities has been ongoing since at least the beginning of the industrial revolution. Part of the recent warming in the western United States has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change. This research seeks to answer the basic question of how declining streamflow, increasing temperatures, and fluctuation in precipitation have impacted water resource allocation in the Snake River Plain over the past 35 years (1971–2005). Understanding how changes in climatic attributes have historically impacted water allocation should help water managers better understand how projected climate change may influence allocation. Annual and monthly diversion trends from 62 locations in the Snake River Plain were compared to temperature and precipitation trends at 10 climate stations across the basin. We found a strong trend of declining annual surface water diversions across the study area. Of the 62 diversion points examined, 45 have highly significant decreasing annual diversion trends, while an additional 8 have significant decreasing trends. Despite the annual decline in surface water diversions, April diversions have increased at more than half of the diversion points, with 15 locations showing highly significant trends and an additional 17 showing significant increasing diversion trends. A comparison of diversions to the Surface Water Supply Index indicates that the decline in midseason and late season diversions is mostly caused by decreasing supply in the study period, while a comparison of diversions to Palmer's <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> index and the Standardized Precipitation Index indicates that early season diversions are highly correlated to early season moisture anomalies.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that the supply of maize grain in the state responds inelastically to changes in the producer price of maize produced under irrigation and elastically if changes arise in the same price level but the offer temporary, with elasticities own-price 0.8531 and 1.0604, changes in input prices that more affect the state offer are the pesticide and labor price, with cross-price elasticities of -0.6154 and -0.5470, changes in the competitive product that more impact are those in the bean, with cross-price elasticities of -0.5489, if produced under irrigation and -1.0292 if produced in temporary. The effect of price transmission, indicate that the producer price of maize under irrigation and temporary state is directly influenced by the wholesale price at a rate of 0.79 and 0.80% for each 1% change in it, while the cost of transport and the international price of maize influence on the wholesale price in the state at levels of 0.21 and 0.13% for every unit percentage change in them.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

First, an optimization framework (based on comprehensive spatio‐temporal techno‐economic analysis) is used to map out optimal transition pathways if H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> were to be introduced in the Dutch transport sector. It is observed that a centralized supply network (with production facilities based on the Rotterdam area and H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is trucked to other regions) will be necessary, in the base‐case scenario with 25% market penetration of fuel cell vehicles by 2050. Second, a critical quantitative and qualitative assessment is carried out to understand when do (or can) other production technologies become economically competitive with steam methane reforming (SMR), to produce H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. For instance, in the case of coal gasification (CG), for a medium size plant (∼150 tpd), coal ($ /MMBtu) needs to be about 7$ cheaper than natural gas ($ /MMBtu) for CG, at its current state of the technology, to be economically competitive with SMR. Third, since the evolution and eventually the success of fossil‐based H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> economy, especially during the transition period, may partly depend on the prospects for the carbon capture and storage (CCS), a qualitative assessment of the Dutch CCS potential and current activities is carried out.

We are developing a new cogeneration system (Neighboring CoGeneration system: NCG system). The key concept of this system is to install a heat storage unit for the hot water supply, floor heating, and bath heating in each house, and to connect the heat storage units by a single‐loop hot water pipe. The system leads to time leveling of the total heat supply and reduced installation costs. Furthermore, it is expected that the cogeneration can operate according to electrical demand because of the large heat storage capacity of the system. In this study, a dynamic simulation model is developed to evaluate the performance and environmental load‐reduction effect of the NCG system for 50 households. The results show that the NCG system can supply sufficient heat for peak demand in winter and reduce annual CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions by 23% on average. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Introducing such information systems should be expected to enhance employee satisfaction if the systems work as expected. Based on previous studies of supply chain management (SCM) and using institution theory, and technology use and acceptance models, this study applies the lens of attitude and assimilation to explore employee behavior toward using SCM systems after implementation, as well as how employees' attitude and assimilation impact on the performance of the supply chain. Collecting data from employees in the relevant departments from selected companies through a survey and applying SEM in the analysis, the study finds that the employee's perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and the subjective norm (Theory of Reasoned Action) have a positive impact on their attitudes toward their use of the SCM systems. Furthermore, it was found that top management's positive beliefs and participation also have a positive impact on assimilation and SCM performance. Finally, it was found that attitudes toward the use of SCM systems impact upon information performance but not in other outcomes of SCM operations. Implications for research and practice are raised. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by adding to our understanding of the relationships among users' attitude, assimilation, and business performance at the post-adoption stage within the context of SCM systems. </jats:p>",

From the point of supply chain planning, the important issues are to find suitable and quality partners and to decide upon an appropriate production–distribution plan. In this study, hence, we address to develop a decision methodology for supply chain planning in multi-echelon non-balanced supply chain system, taking into account such four criteria as cost, quality, delivery and supplier relationship management and considering quantity discount and capacity constraints. The proposed methodology is based on the analytic network process and turbo particle swarm optimization (TPSO), to evaluate partners and to determine an optimal supply chain network pattern and production–distribution mode. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of the proposed TPSO algorithm, comparative numerical experiments are performed by TPSO, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Empirical analysis results demonstrate that TPSO can outperform PSO and GA in non-balanced supply chain planning problems. </jats:p>",

They were used in a deterministic HIV transmission model to estimate mixing patterns and HIV prevalence over the first 20 years of the epidemic (including reported condom use trends) and a subsequent 10-year intervention (10% absolute increase in condom use). Data collected from Bangalore for the evaluation of Avahan (the India AIDS initiative) on the mean reported frequency of sex acts per individual, role taken in anal sex and population sizes for each group were used to construct a mixing matrix. In method A, the PB group size was set to balance the total number of insertive and receptive acts, and receptive acts for each group were distributed among the three groups in proportion to the number of insertive acts offered. In method B, the proportion of receptive acts KH had with other KH was an additional input parameter, with remaining receptive acts distributed as in method A. The number and type of contacts for all groups were adjusted to achieve balancing. The model was run using 300 000 randomly sampled parameter sets drawn from the data and multiple fits were found to group-specific HIV prevalence data.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Model fits for method B had more assortative (like-with-like) mixing than method A, particularly for PB (median number of acts PB have with other PB: 48.5% (IQR 33.3–63.3%) in A, 63.3% (IQR 47.3–74.1%) in B), related to larger PB group sizes and PB taking the insertive role less often in B. Despite these differences, the fitted epidemic curves were very similar for all three groups across the two methods (Absrtact P1-S4.24 figure 1), as was the predicted intervention impact (relative reduction in MSM HIV prevalence after 10 years: A: 18.2% (95% CI 11.0 to 29.2%), B: 18.1% (10.6 to 29.7%)).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>The choice of method used to balance insertive and receptive contacts in an HIV transmission model affected the estimates for the amount of like-with-like mixing within different MSM groups, but the estimated impact of an intervention was robust to the method used.</jats:p><jats:fig id=\"fig1\"><jats:label>Abstract P1-S4.24 Figure 1</jats:label><jats:caption><jats:p>MSM.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"sextrans-2011-050108.168fig1\"/></jats:fig></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) has increased considerably in recent years and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. A major challenge is to maintain uninterrupted supplies of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and prevent stock outs. This article discusses issues around the management of ARVs and prevention of stock outs in Malawi, a low‐income country with a high HIV/AIDS burden, and a weak procurement and supply chain management system. This system for ARVs, paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and bypassing the government Central Medical Stores, is in place, using the United Nations Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF’s) procurement services. The system, managed by a handful of people who spend limited time on supply management, is characterized by a centrally coordinated quantification based on verified data from all national ART clinics, parallel procurement through UNICEF, and direct distribution to ART clinics. The model worked well in the first years of the ART programme with a single first‐line ARV regimen, but with more regimens becoming available (e.g., alternative first‐line, second‐line and paediatric regimens), it has become more difficult to administer. Managing supplies through a parallel system has the advantage that weaknesses in the national system have limited influence on the ARV procurement and supply chain management system. However, as the current system operates without a central warehouse and national buffer stock capacity, it diminishes the ability to prevent ARV stock outs. The process of ordering ARVs, from the time that estimates are made to the arrival of supplies in health facilities, takes approximately one year. Addressing the challenges involved in maintaining ARVs through an efficient procurement and supply chain management system that prevents ARV stock outs through the establishment of a dedicated procurement team, a central warehouse and/or national buffer stock is a priority.</jats:p>",
