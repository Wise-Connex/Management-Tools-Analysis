The issue of seasonality has been mostly ignored in studies estimating milk supply functions. In this paper milk supply functions which explicitly take account of seasonality are estimated for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Pre‐testing of monthly milk price and milk supply time‐series, using an extended HEGY test and an ADF test, indicated the presence of deterministic seasonality. Empirical milk supply models incorporating seasonal dummy variables to account for deterministic seasonality were estimated in the two regions of study. The results of these models were used to calculate the monthly producer milk price schedule required to encourage dairy farmers to produce an even monthly milk supply pattern. These calculations indicated that, in the long run, a peak‐to‐trough seasonal price differential of around 8 pence per litre would be required to produce an even pattern of milk supply in Scotland, and 11 pence per litre would be required in Northern Ireland.</jats:p>",

A theoretical model is developed to describe the effects of local blood perfusion and vascular geometry on the thermal equilibration in the carotid artery based on the blood flow measurements and the anatomical vascular geometry in the human neck. A theoretical approach is used to estimate the potential for cooling of blood in the carotid artery on its way to the brain by heat exchange with its countercurrent jugular vein and by the radial heat conduction loss to the cool neck surface. It is shown that the cooling of the arterial blood can be as much as 1.3 °C lower than the body core temperature, which is in agreement with previous experimental measurements of the temperature difference between the tympanic and body core temperatures. The model also evaluates the relative contributions of countercurrent heat exchange and radial heat conduction to selective brain cooling. It is found that these mechanisms are comparable with each other. Results of the present study will help provide a better understanding of the thermoregulation during hyperthermia. They can be used to guide the design of future experimental investigations of the mechanism of SBC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The US shipbuilding industry finds itself pressed on many sides by dwindling government and commercial ship orders. Without significant improvement in performance, the US shipbuilding industry will contract to the minimum that can sustain government and Jones Act commercial ship demand. There has been considerable benchmarking of the US shipbuilding with other shipbuilding countries and other US and foreign industries. In these studies, the improved management of the supply chains has been found to be an important way to improve performance. The 1996 21s' Century Agile Shipbuilding Strategies report identified improvement in the relationship between shipyards and their suppliers as one of the highest priorities. In the marine industry over 50% of the cost of the delivered product is for material and equipment. When significant turn-key subcontracting is used this can increase to 75%. Over the past two decades, most US shipbuilders acknowledged that their productivity was significantly lower than world class shipbuilders. More recently they have acknowledged a material cost differential of up to 33%. Clearly, the cost of material is one of the major sources of the lack of international competitiveness of the US marine industry. The performance of the US automotive and aerospace industries has improved significantly by focusing on and improving their supply chain management. Much of Boeing's and Chrysler's improvement has been attributed to successful change in this area. This paper describes the results of a project that analyzed supply chain management in the marine industry as a way to develop a set of best practices.</jats:p>",

It then estimates labour supply parameters using a model that controls for sample selection issues associated with the labour supply of married women.

The proposed method is composed of two hierarchical stages. At the outer stage, equipment capacities and utility maximum demands of the brewery’s energy supply plant are optimized together with values of control parameters of thermal storage tanks by the sequential linear programming method. At the inner stage, the equipment operation of the plant for given energy demands is simulated on the basis of control rules using LabVIEW. Both two stages are interconnected so as to be compatible with each other. Through a numerical study, it is investigated how equipment capacities, utility maximum demands, and control parameters of thermal storage tanks influence the long-term economics of the plant. From the results, it is ascertained that the long-term economics can be improved using the proposed method.</jats:p>",

A content analysis of ecotourism definitions revealed that ecotourism is a new form of nonconsumptive, educational, and romantic tourism to relatively undisturbed and undervisited areas of immense natural beauty, and cultural and historical importance for the purposes of understanding and appreciating the natural and sociocultural history of the host destination. The current view of ecotourism by the sample of tour operators reflects and confirms definitions of ecotourism found in existing literature. If the definitions provided by this sample of ecotour operators are to be considered representative of their business vision or mission statement, it is plausible to expect their business objectives and operational behavior to be congruent with their description of ecotourism. Whether or not their actual behavior will reflect their visions remains to be determined. </jats:p>",

Textural response to sediment supply is evaluated relative to a theoretical prediction of competent median grain size (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub><jats:sup>′</jats:sup>). We find that surface median grain size (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub>) varies inversely with sediment supply rate and systematically approaches the competent value (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub><jats:sup>′</jats:sup>) at low equilibrium transport rates. Furthermore, equilibrium transport rate is a power function of the difference between applied and critical shear stresses and is therefore a power function of the difference between competent and observed median grain sizes (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub><jats:sup>′</jats:sup> and <jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub>). Consequently, we propose that the difference between predicted and observed median grain sizes can be used to determine sediment supply rate in equilibrium channels. Our analysis framework collapses data from different studies toward a single relationship between sediment supply rate and surface grain size. While the approach appears promising, we caution that it has been tested only on a limited set of laboratory data and a narrow range of channel conditions.</jats:p>",

Biofiltration alone yielded significant reductions in dissolved organic carbon, colour, total trihalomethanes and chlorine demand. When ozonation preceded biofiltration, the increased proportion of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon allowed for significantly greater (p&amp;lt;0.05</jats:p>",

In any competitive market, decision makers need some help during negotiations involving other parties. Game Theory has been defined by W. F. Lucas as “a collection of mathematical models formulated to study decision‐making situations involving conflict and cooperation”, hence the aim of this work. This paper is in two parts: Part 1 will present a critical appraisal of the theoretic developments of the subject of Game Theory as described in the literature. This will ensure the communication of potential practical applications of the existing theory, expressed in simpler terms, to a wider electrical power engineering audience. Part 2, will expose the current international applications of Game Theory; their possible benefits and relevance of applying the theory to the electricity supply industry.</jats:p>",

Injection dissection studies were also carried out in eight specimens in which various vasculobiliary injuries encountered after cholecystectomy were simulated.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: The bile ducts possess an arterial plexus on their surface which is supplied from below by ascending marginal vessels derived from the postero‐superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. These marginal vessels end above in the right hepatic artery or its branches. The right and left hepatic ductal systems are supplied by the right and left hepatic arteries and their sectoral or segmental branches. The right and left hepatic arteries communicate freely via the hilar plate arterial plexus. This collateral system allows the blood supply to the right hepatic duct to be maintained after ligation of the right hepatic artery and interruption of the common hepatic duct or excision of the confluence.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: A knowledge of the blood supply of the normal biliary system and the collateral hilar plate arterial plexus forms the anatomical foundation for successful reconstructive surgery, not only in vasculobiliary injuries following cholecystectomy, but also for a wide range of hepatobiliary procedures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many of the anabolic effects of growth hormone (GH) are indirect, occurring through GH-stimulated production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) by the liver. As well as being regulated by GH, plasma IGF-I concentrations have been demonstrated to depend upon the level of dietary protein intake, with low protein diets being associated with reduced circulatory IGF-I levels. This inhibitory effect cannot be reversed by GH injection, suggesting that liver sensitivity to GH becomes impaired.To investigate the mechanisms through which protein supply affects GH sensitivity, primary cultures of ovine hepatocytes were grown in defined media, containing various proportions (0.2, 1.0 and 5.0) of jugular amino acid concentrations in fed sheep. Production of IGF-I by these cells was measured after 24 and 48 h in culture by radioimmunoassay. In the first 24-h period basal IGF-I production was the same in all defined media, and GH caused an approximately 2-fold increase in IGF-I release in cells grown in 1.0xor 5.0xamino acid media (P&lt;0.01). Although GH appeared to increase IGF-I release in this period for cells grown in 0.2xamino acid media, this effect was not statistically significant. In the period from 24-48 h in defined media, both basal and GH-stimulated IGF-I production was dependent on amino acid availability (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). Factorial analysis of variance demonstrated a strong positive interaction (P&lt;0.001) between the effects of amino acid availability and GH, such that GH increased IGF-I production by more than 2-fold in cells grown in 5.0xamino acid media (P&lt;0.01) but had no effect on production by cells grown in 1.0xor 0.2xamino acid media.Measurement of steady state concentrations of exon 1-derived IGF-I mRNAs using an RNase protection assay demonstrated that the observed effects on IGF-I peptide secretion were strongly associated with parallel effects at the RNA level.Incorporation of (35)S-methionine into cellular proteins over a 4-h period starting 20 h after transfer to defined culture media was not significantly reduced in 1.0xcompared with 5.0x amino acid media, although rates under both of these conditions were significantly higher than those seen in 0.2xamino acid media (P&lt;0.01). The lack of correspondence between the dose-dependent effects of amino acid supply on cellular protein synthesis and those on basal and GH-stimulated IGF-I production, suggests that amino acid supply modulates IGF-I production through selective mechanisms.Steady state levels of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) isoforms, liver-enriched activating protein (LAP) and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) were determined by Western blotting. When levels of LAP were expressed relative to LIP levels in the same extracts, a significant decrease in the LAP:LIP ratio was observed in response to amino acid limitation (P&lt;0.05).These data strengthen earlier arguments that synergistic interaction between the effects of amino acids and GH on hepatic IGF-I gene expression underlie nutrition-dependent changes in circulating IGF-I titres. The association between these effects and altered levels of C/EBPbeta isoforms suggests that CCAAT/enhancer mediated control of IGF-I gene expression may be involved in this phenomenon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Stacked channel sands from braided fluvial deposits have attracted interest as excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs because of their high porosity, high permeability, and large volume due to great thickness and lateral extent. Strata of this nature are commonly found in epicontinental-seaway depositional successions. Strata of the Yellow Sea (YS) continental margin compose an excellent modern analog of epicontinental-sea and foreland-basin depositional settings because of the YS’s very high sediment supply, shallow depth, and gentle gradient from the shelf edge to basin. Today, these conditions are rarely found on modern continental margins, but they were quite significant in ancient continental-margin stratigraphic successions. Therefore, a grid of approximately 5,024 km of high-resolution (&amp;lt;1 m) seismic-reflection and chirp-sonar data and cores were collected from the YS to begin to develop models of the spatial variability of reservoir facies that evolve in this type of system. These data have been processed, filtered at 300 to 2,000 Hz, and interpreted in a sequence stratigraphic framework. Seismic facies were objectively identified on the basis of reflection orientation, frequency, amplitude, and lateral continuity. These seismic facies are assumed to be related to the mode of sediment deposition and are further interpreted to be indicative of deposition of specific lithofacies within particular systems tracts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Pleistocene falling-stage/lowstand deposits identified on high-resolution seismic-reflection data and chirp-sonar data from the YS continental shelf (and epicontinental sea) consist of seismic facies with reflections that are chaotic or steeply inclined. These facies are located above an erosional unconformity (sequence boundary) that truncates underlying and laterally adjacent reflections. The great lateral extent of these falling-stage/lowstand deposits (nearly 400 km in the southern YS and 100 km in the northern YS) suggests deposition from a rapidly avulsing, braided fluvial depositional environment. The falling-stage facies are locally stacked on other channel sands and separated by thin transgressive systems (silty fine sand), which define prominent transgressive surfaces. Thickness of the channel-sand units is commonly 25 m. These channel sands are capped by organic-rich muds (as thick as ~2 to 10 m). Stratified silty mud deposits occur adjacent to the channel-sand packages. An early assessment of the horizontal and vertical distribution of seismic facies suggests that falling-stage braided fluvial deposits are prevalent in the southern end of the YS (reservoir rock that is relatively homogeneous, with very high lateral continuity, and a volume of ~1,400 km3). Highstand deposits (identified by downlapping, nearly flat lying, laterally continuous parallel reflections with moderate to high frequency) are more widespread both vertically and horizontally in the north, behind the Shantung-Laoyehling Massif. The Fukien-Reinan Massif is also apparent in the seismic records. Maps of the distribution of these falling-stage/lowstand deposits indicate that an important controlling influence on the distribution of these deposits is the paleogeographic location of preceding lowstand channels and the locations of the crystalline Shantung-Laoyehling Massif in the north and the crystalline Fukien-Reinan Massif in the south. The crystalline rocks serve as barriers to fluvial flow when they are exposed during sea-level lowstands, and they protect certain areas from fluvial reworking and erosion during lowstands. In these protected areas, settling of silt from suspension during sea-level highstands is the dominant depositional mechanism.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The high lateral continuity (along both strike and dip) of the falling-stage/lowstand reservoir facies of depositional systems such that of the YS (which ranges from 100 km updip to nearly 1,000 km downdip) is significantly different from that of many Gulf of Mexico systems (which commonly have a maximum lateral continuity of 50 km). In addition to the high continuity of reservoir facies, systems such as the YS also have a seal of fine-grained highstand deposits that lie over the fluvial facies. These highstand deposits are also laterally continuous (over 100 to 1,000 km) and contain a significant quantity of organic matter. They, therefore, also may serve as source rocks.</jats:p>",
