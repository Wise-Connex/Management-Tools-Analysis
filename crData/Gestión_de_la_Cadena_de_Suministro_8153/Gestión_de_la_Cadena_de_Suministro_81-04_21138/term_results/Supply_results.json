Adult Thoroughbreds had a greater capillary/fiber ratio in semitendinosus and pectoralis transversus than did other adult horses. Intermuscular differences in capillary/fiber ratio and the area per capillary within adults and young of each type of horse were negligible with one exception: the capillary/fiber ratio was less in the pectoralis transversus than in the semitendinosus of young non-Thoroughbreds.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>There was little between-type difference in capillary density in adult dog muscles, although the capillary/fiber ratio was greater in the semitendinosus of Greyhounds. Although the capillary/fiber ratio increases with growth, the area per capillary did not alter markedly. Cessation of training increased the area per capillary in the pectoralis transversus of Greyhounds. In all adult dogs, capillary/fiber ratios in the diaphragm were less than they were in the semitendinosus and the pectoralis transversus. In adult Greyhounds, this was compensated by a smaller area per capillary in the diaphragm. Seemingly, the ability for high speed running by the Thoroughbred and Greyhound was not associated with an enhanced potential blood supply to skeletal muscle.</jats:p>",

An explanation lies in the industry's relative youth and dynamic performance, strong post‐war capitalisation, inherent monopoly organisation and the issue of product differentiation expressed in peak/off‐peak pricing. Such matters pose particular problems in the Queensland market which is numerically small and areally dispersed. Examination of production and distribution economics reveals that Queensland fuel is presently not cheap and that some of the penalty derives from the strong capitalisation which the system is undergoing. Further pressures lie in the lack of scale economies and in financial policies of supply authorities such as spatial price equalisation. Many factors bear on future prices and predictions are difficult. Nevertheless Queensland's energy advantages should ensure that unless major change transforms the economic environment the price of electricity relative to that in other States falls during the next two decades.</jats:p>",
