      "abstract": "<jats:p>The year saw not only a sustained rise in total demand, by 3.5% to 2,871,000 requests but also marked the peak annual demand recorded. Both UK and foreign demand increased, the latter more than the former (1.6% and 11% respectively). Demand on the UK Urgent Action Service, a telephone request service for urgent requests, grew rapidly. The Division's Monograph Acquistions and Records System (MARS) expanded to 165,000 stock records. The Keyword Index to Serial Titles also grew both in size and coverage. The aquisitions programme was maintained despite unfavourable exchange rates. On‐line cataloguing of newly‐acquired books began early in 1984. Access to ‘grey literature’ was improved by the mounting of the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) database on BLAISE. A review of the Division's conservation and binding policies provided useful changes. The mini‐computer which processes all ART (Automatic Request Transmission) requests was linked to the British Telecom Packet Switch Stream network (PSS); 29% of all requests are now received by some form of automated means. Retrospective searches performed by MEDLARS increased markedly. A BL interdivisional Publications Sales Unit was set up at Boston Spa and the publications programme continued to be profitable. The Division continued discussions with publishers on electronic storage and document delivery. The latter part of the year saw the production of a divisonal plan as part of a wider British Library Strategic Plan.</jats:p>",

The model has been adapted to predict supply to a single root from a soil cylinder and compared with measured uptake by onions. A ‘supply index’ shows likely restrictions in the availability of exchangeable K and in the rate of supply of non‐exchangeable K resulting from diffusion limitations over a 4 week period for (i) aggregates covered with a dense roots system, and (ii) roots growing at known densities. For this period diffusion alone should not limit exchangeable K uptake in the field if the root density is at least 3.5 cm/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>: at 0.9 cm/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> about 50% may be unavailable. The supply rate of non‐exchangeable K increases with root density and may be important for high‐demanding crops in dry seasons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This review is based for the most part on conference proceedings. It begins with a look at recent developments in interlending in Australasia, with a comparison of interlending statistics, and papers from a resource‐sharing conference in New Zealand reporting Australian and New Zealand interlending practice. Unresolved attempts to define an interlending plan for Australia are discussed together with the present situation. Two delegates' papers at a conference in Western Australia report contrasting developments there. Turning to the UK, four papers from an interlending conference consider the current UK situation, financial aspects, the end user's view and future development of interlending. Finally, a world‐wide collection of ‘proceedings’ is reviewed, dealing with different interlending systems in the UK, FRG, GDR, USA, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, China and the European Communities' DOCDEL project, with particular reference to Patent information in Germany and the TRANSDOC project in France.</jats:p>",

Among the developments has been the conversion of rental units into condominiums and cooperatives. Concern has been expressed about the negative effect of these conversions on the supply of rental housing. What is often overlooked, however, is the positive effect on the supply of rental housing of the rapid increase in the number of rented condominium and cooperative units. Making use of published data, it is estimated that, during the 1970s, the increase in the number of rented condominium and cooperative units in the United States exceeded the number of converted rental units. There is considerable variation in the pattern, however, across areas of the country. </jats:p>",

The commonest use of microcomputers for ILL is for transmission of requests.

(2) Order: Any compilation of responses relevant to a topic is an order‐creating process. (3) Sufficient degree of order: The demands made on the degree of order increase as the size of the collection and/or the frequency of searches increases. (4) Representational predictability: The accuracy of any directed search for relevant texts (especially the recall ratio) depends on the predictability of the modes of expression for concepts and concept relations in the search file. (5) Representational fidelity: The accuracy of any directed search for relevant texts (especially the precision ratio) depends on the fidelity with which concepts and concept relations are expressed in the search file. The observance of these axioms assists in the design of information systems and imparts increased survival power to them. They are also helpful in the revision of existing systems that show signs of incipient weakness. Several useful principles, hitherto only intuitively conceived, receive axiomatic corroboration. This theory also contributes to the reconciliation of several opposing lines of thought that have hitherto appeared incompatible or even hostile to one another. Each of them is justifiable, but only under circumstances and requirements that are specific to the task to be solved by a particular information system.</jats:p>",

The diffusion coefficient for K was calculated from measurements of the tortuosity factor using <jats:sup>36</jats:sup>Cl, volumetric water content and buffer power. Release of K is in the order: suspensions &gt;2–3 mm &gt; 6–8 mm aggregates. A computer model incorporating diffusion analysis and release of K shows that in the aggregates the rapidly diffusing exchangeable K, K<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub>, is best measured by the extrapolated intercept of a desorption isotherm (24 h equilibration), and is 8–55% less than that extracted by NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>OAc leaching. Release of K within the aggregates (K<jats:sub>nex</jats:sub>, a fraction approximating to Talibudeen's peripheral K) is delayed until after about 95% of K<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub> has been depleted which takes 1–2 days. The effective release rate of K<jats:sub>nex</jats:sub> inside the aggregates is ∼ 17% less than in soil suspensions. Diffusion imposes only small limitations on the release from aggregates of K<jats:sub>nex</jats:sub>. This rate of release depends on the frequency of resin changes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Experiments were performed on chloralosed cats with ligated adrenals. The peripheral ends of the preganglionic sympathetic nerves to the colon were stimulated and colonic motility was monitored by a volumetric method. Electric nerve stimulation with various intensities elicited inhibitory motor responses and occasionally contractions. Hexa‐methonium and/or guanethidine blocked all inhibitory actions and revealed pure excitatory responses at high stimulation intensities. These colonic contractions were inhibited by atropine. However, atropine‐resistant contractions were sometimes observed, predominantly in the colorectal region. Thoracic sympathetic nerves affected the motility in the proximal colon only, while lumbar sympathetic nerves acted on both proximal and distal parts. Strength‐duration relationships and sensitivity to local heating suggest that the excitatory responses are due to an antidromic activation of thin, possibly afferent nerve fibres. Small doses of substance P injected close i.a. induced colonic contractions unchanged by hexamethonium and/or guanethidine but sensitive to atropine. The neurally‐induced colonic contractions are suggested to be due to an antidromic activation of thin sensory neurons which in the periphery release substance P, in turn activating cholinergic motor neurons, thus constituting an axon reflex arrangement. The possibility of a similar axon reflex mechanism, associated to thin afferents, activating adrenergic inhibitory neurons at the prevertebral ganglionic level is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the conference was not held to determine policy, certain issues emerged which should be of interest to all involved with the initiation of anti‐HTLV‐III testing. First, there was a consensus that an implementation period during which donors will not be notified of the test results is essential. During this period, test proficiency, data confidentiality safeguards, and positive donor counseling procedures can be established. Also, during this period alternative test sites can be established; this was considered a critical step to maintain the safety of the blood supply. Second, there was a perceived need for legislation to protect the confidentiality of sensitive test data, whether in the laboratory or as part of a deferral list system, from subpoena. Third, there was not agreement about whether inventory should be tested; donors who provided that inventory did not know it was to be tested, and might not have consented if the implications of testing had been known. But, inventory testing is clearly in the interest of the recipient. Finally, there was an awareness in the blood banking community of their new role in monitoring a public health menace, and a beginning acceptance of this role emerged.</jats:p>",
