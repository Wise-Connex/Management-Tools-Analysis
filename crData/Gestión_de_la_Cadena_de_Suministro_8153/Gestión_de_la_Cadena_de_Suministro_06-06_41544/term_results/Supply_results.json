It takes a dynamic perspective focusing on continuing processes of change in the degree of integration within and between networks. The three examples are based on more than 70 interviews over a long period of time of firms involved in the transportation, automotive and construction industries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The paper finds that the overlap between supply chains in terms of actors, resources and activities could seriously delay, hinder and increase costs to the process when changing the degree of integration in one chain. Therefore, supply chain myopia might lead to an increase in the total costs of a firm. Further, there is a trade‐off between the costs of integration in the focal chain and increasing costs arising from decreased integration in overlapping supply chains. Failure to consider the negative effects and the resistance caused by delays and dissolving relationships within overlapping supply chains can be detrimental. The overlap between chains can be both positive and negative, and can be reversed over time.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research is limited to three examples and the interaction between two supply chains in each case. Since interdependencies might exist between several supply chains, the effects of change could have implications for more than one other supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>When changing existing or developing supply chains for new businesses, firms need to take into consideration the effects and reactions of other chains.

Rather than competing “firm versus firm,” today's organizations are battling “supply chain versus supply chain.” Within this context, best value supply chains are emerging as a means to create competitive advantages and superior performance. While traditional supply chains often focus primarily on one key outcome such as speed or cost, best value supply chains excel along an array of uniquely integrated priorities—cost, quality, speed, and flexibility. We describe how key organizational theories help to distinguish traditional supply chains from best value supply chains. To provide a foundation for future inquiry, we offer theory‐based research questions that are focused on best value supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An experimental study of the influence of oil supply temperature and supply pressure on the performance of a 100mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ±90deg to the load line was carried out. The hydrodynamic pressure at the mid-plane of the bearing, temperature profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, bush torque, oil flow rate, and the position of the shaft were measured for variable operating conditions. Shaft rotational speed ranged from 1000 to 4000rpm and two different values of applied load were tested (2 and 10kN). The supply temperature ranged from 35 to 50°C, whereas the oil supply pressure range was 70 to 210kPa. Bearing performance is strongly dependent on the supply conditions. It was found that the existence of the downstream groove significantly affects the temperature profile at the oil-bush interface except for the low load, low feeding pressure cases, where the cooling effect of the upstream groove is significant. Feeding temperature has a strong effect on the minimum film thickness. The increase in maximum temperature is significantly lower than the corresponding increase in supply temperature. Increases in supply pressure lead to a significant rise in oil flow rate but have little effect on the maximum temperature and power-loss, except in the case of the lightly loaded bearing. Shaft temperature was found to be close to the bearing maximum temperature for low applied loads, being significantly smaller than this value for high loads. The mean shaft temperature is only significantly higher than the outlet temperature at high shaft speeds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the early 1990s, in France, the increase in water prices and the denunciation of public–private partnerships have encouraged the state, water companies and local authorities to enhance management transparency and develop their relationships with consumer groups. The opening to user representatives is challenging the French model of water supply management. These transformations are resulting in tensions between different representations of users as consumers or citizens. Between consumer and citizen, which representation is actually emerging and how is the user's status affected?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>At the national level, the state and consumer groups tend to develop a pro-consumerist policy involving reflection on price levels, the efficiency of utilities and consumer information. On the other hand, companies are trying to highlight the representation of the citizen concerned about the environment and water quality. At the local level, user status varies with context. The user can be perceived either as a simple consumer or as a citizen–consumer hybrid. The examples of Grenoble and Ardèche show that consumption issues can be open to debate about public choices, investment strategies or drinking water quality. This opening up of debate depends on local authorities' competence and communication strategies, consumer groups' agendas and specific local issues (e.g. resource scarcity, corruption).</jats:p>",

Under the drop-shipping arrangement, the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler’s. Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider the supply chain of a manufacturer who produces time-sensitive products that have a large variety, a short life cycle, and are sold in a very short selling season. The supply chain consists of multiple overseas plants and a domestic distribution center (DC). Retail orders are first processed at the plants and then shipped from the plants to the DC for distribution to domestic retailers. Due to variations in productivity and labor costs at different plants, the processing time and cost of an order are dependent on the plant to which it is assigned. We study the following static and deterministic order assignment and scheduling problem faced by the manufacturer before every selling season: Given a set of orders, determine which orders are to be assigned to each plant, find a schedule for processing the assigned orders at each plant, and find a schedule for shipping the completed orders from each plant to the DC, such that a certain performance measure is optimized. We consider four different performance measures, all of which take into account both delivery lead time and the total production and distribution cost. A problem corresponding to each performance measure is studied separately. We analyze the computational complexity of various cases of the problems by either proving that a problem is intractable or providing an efficient exact algorithm for the problem. We propose several fast heuristics for the intractable problems. We analyze the worst-case and asymptotic performance of the heuristics and also computationally evaluate their performance using randomly generated test instances. Our results show that the heuristics are capable of generating near-optimal solutions quickly. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Existing supply chain management practices consist primarily of static interactions between established partners. Global competition, shorter product life cycles and the emergence of Internet-mediated business solutions create an incentive for exploring more dynamic supply chain practices. The Supply Chain Trading Agent Competition (TAC SCM) was designed to explore approaches to dynamic supply chain trading. TAC SCM pits against one another trading agents developed by teams from around the world. This paper presents Carnegie Mellon University's 2005 TAC SCM entry, the CMieux supply chain trading agent. CMieux implements a novel approach to coordinating supply chain bidding, procurement and planning, with an emphasis on the ability to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. We present empirical results based on 200 games involving agents entered by 25 different teams during what can be seen as the most competitive phase of the 2005 tournament. Not only did CMieux perform among the top five agents, it significantly outperformed these agents in procurement while matching their bidding performance.</jats:p>",

In this study, we modified the existing CIAO model of the Ross Sea to include major aspects of iron chemistry and examined the processes governing the supply of iron to phytoplankton. We suggest that the melting of sea ice and ensuing stratification dictates the speciation and bioavailability of iron. Photoreduction is the key process governing the supply of bioavailable Fe to the resident phytoplankton of the Ross Sea. Access to organically complexed iron is of greater significance in strongly stratified waters dominated by diatoms than in weakly stratified waters dominated by <jats:italic>Phaeocystis antarctica.</jats:italic> Light may control phytoplankton taxonomic composition in the Ross Sea by impacting both photosynthetic performance and iron speciation. The efficiency with which iron fuels phytoplankton carbon incorporation is greater in seasonal ice zones than in permanently ice‐free waters. Therefore, changes in the physical structure of the Southern Ocean could impact iron bioavailability, independent of any change in iron supply.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of upstream sediment supply on the scour depth and shape. The experiments simulated conditions of a steady upstream sediment supply which had the same grain size composition as the sediment deposit placed on the bed of the flume. The geometric characteristics of three scour holes developed under conditions of steady flow discharge and steady upstream sediment supply were measured during 48 different tests. This provided a data set containing measurements of 144 scour holes. Three different sediment feed rates were used, and tests were also performed with clear water conditions. Geometric interference between sills was not observed. A natural river gravel with a limited grain size was used. The collected data were analyzed using nondimensional groups developed in previous clear water studies. It is shown that the imposed sediment transport does not require the introduction of new dimensionless parameters into existing scour depth and length prediction formula. The effects of sediment feed are shown to be incorporated in the existing dimensionless parameters. The new data set was used to recalibrate existing scour depth formula. The influence of jet erosion on scour geometry is also discussed. Inspection of the data indicates a possible two‐stage behavior, with the threshold between behaviors related to the ratio of the value of the morphological jump created at a scour hole and the flow specific energy at the bed sill.</jats:p>",

In order to achieve this, interviews were undertaken with CSR managers, factory managers and other experts, conducted in confidence and anonymously. Codes of conduct and associated inspections and audits are common practice but in most cases flawed. Labour issues and the rights of workers are generally seen as the most important aspect of CSR in the region. Benefits of CSR include risk reduction, staff recruitment and retention, cost savings and building good relationships with stakeholders. Obstacles include a lack of resources and skills, a lack of awareness of stakeholders' demands and inefficient production techniques. It is noted that larger firms are more able to overcome such obstacles, with clear adverse implications for smaller companies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider the case of a first-time interaction between a buyer and a supplier who is unreliable in delivery. The supplier declares her estimate of the ability to meet the order obligations, but the buyer may have a different estimate, which may be higher or lower than the supplier’s estimate. We derive the Nash bargaining solution and discuss the role of using a down-payment or nondelivery penalty in the contract. For the case of buyer overtrust, the down-payment contract maximizes channel profits when the supplier’s estimate is public information. If the supplier’s estimate is private information, a nonsymmetric contract is shown to be efficient and incentive compatible. For the case of buyer undertrust, the contract structure is quite different as both players choose not to include down-payments in the contract. When delivery estimates are public information, a nondelivery penalty contract is able to maximize channel profits if the buyer uses the supplier’s estimate in making the ordering decision. If estimates are private information, channel profits are maximized only if the true estimates of both players are not far part. We also discuss the effect of different risk profiles on the nature of the bargaining solution. In three extensions of the model, we consider the following variants of the basic problem. First, we analyze the effect of early versus late negotiation on the bargaining solution. Then, we study the case of endogenous supply reliability, and finally, for the case of repeated interactions, we discuss the impact of updating delivery estimates on the order quantity and negotiated prices of future orders. </jats:p>",

Drawing on Thompson [Thompson, J.D., 1967. Organizations in Action. McGraw‐Hill, New York], we argue that strong firms’ bargaining power use is tempered by the type of coordination different types of task interdependencies demand. We also investigate how both strong and weak members benefit from SCM. Whereas strong members reap most of the direct benefits, weak members can often gain by building switching costs with strong members, leveraging SCM outside the focal chain, and increasing survival chances.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

These three governments have pursued different ideologies in formulating policies to guide agricultural development. However, to date Ethiopia remains food insecure. Ethiopian agriculture is dominated by peasant farmers and 85 per cent of the population is rural. Rural poverty and, hence, food insecurity is intricately related to insufficient land and a lack of long‐term tenure security. The aggregate country level food security was assessed using various indicators for the periods of the three governments. The growth rates and the variability in the indicators suggest that Ethiopia is suffering from both chronic and transitory food insecurity.</jats:p>",

In FRIENDS, QCCs are connected as a network through distribution cables to realize a reliable power supply. In this paper, a method to find the optimal network configuration of FRIENDS is proposed. The method can minimize the sum of facility installation cost and operational cost (distribution loss) under the constraint that the expected power interruption cost is less than a predetermined endurable value. The solution algorithm is based on tabu search, and employs a sensitivity analysis to select efficient facilities to be installed or to eliminate constraint violations. In the algorithm, single and double faults of power distribution system are taken into account to calculate the power supply reliability or expected power interruption cost. Several numerical real‐world examples are shown to demonstrate the validity of the algorithm. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organic horticultural production systems often are characterized by the use of beneficial soil microorganisms because the application of soluble inorganic P or N fertilizers is not endorsed. Due to the limited supply of soluble nutrients in organic production systems, nutrient deficiency may limit plant growth and yield. The sole use of peat for pot-based cultures is also discouraged in organic production systems. Therefore, we have studied viable alternatives for highly soluble fertilizers and pure peat substrates using leek [<jats:italic>Allium ampeloprasum</jats:italic> L. var. <jats:italic>Porrum</jats:italic>] as a test plant. Plants were grown on peat-based substrates with different rates of compost additions, and with and without inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Inoculation with a commercial AM fungus inoculum resulted in colonization rates of up to 70% of total root length, whereas not inoculated plants remained free of root colonization. Mycorrhizal fungus colonization increased shoot Zn and K concentrations, but did not significantly affect shoot dry matter or shoot N and P concentrations. In contrast, compost addition increased plant growth, and also increased P and K concentrations in plants. We conclude that plants with high rates of mycorrhizal colonization can be obtained on peat-based substrates, but that under these conditions plants may not consistently benefit in growth from the mycorrhizal symbiosis. In contrast, additions of compost are a possible means to improve the substrate quality in organic horticultural production.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this manuscript is to explore the relationships between agrifood networks and social capital. There are some unique characteristics of agrifood chains that influence the formation of vertical ties or governance structures within the chain. The nature of interfirm dependency and product differentiation are important drivers in the type of transaction governance. Incomplete contracts are ubiquitous with supply chains and lead to distortions. The contractual distortions however can be mitigated through self-enforcing agreements. Social capital and the role of trust influence network ties. The pecuniary risks especially prevalent in agrifood chains may imply that managers prefer embedded ties and cohesive networks rather than the flexibility available from structural holes. </jats:p>",

Thirteen samples showing large variations in effective alkali requirement, pulp yield and O-stage efficiency and selectivity were selected for brightness reversion studies. These samples were bleached to 90-91% ISO by DEDD and DEDP sequences and their brightness stability and chemical characteristics determined. Heat reversion of the eucalyptus kraft pulps was strongly influenced by the wood supply, with brightness loss varying in the range of 2.1-3.6 and 0.8-1.7 %ISO for ODEDD and ODEDP bleached pulps, respectively. Pulps bleached by the ODEDP sequence showed reversion values 1.3-1.9 % ISO lower than those bleached by the ODEDD sequence. Pulp carbonyl content decreased by 35-40% during the final peroxide bleaching stage. Carbonyl and carboxyl groups correlated positively with brightness reversion, as did permanganate number and acid soluble lignin. Pulp final viscosity and metal and DCM extractives contents showed no significant correlation with brightness reversion. Pulping, oxygen delignification and ECF bleaching performances also showed no correlation with brightness reversion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study conflict and cooperation issues arising in a supply chain where a manufacturer makes products which are shipped to customers by a distributor. The manufacturer and the distributor each has an ideal schedule, determined by cost and capacity considerations. However, these two schedules are in general not well coordinated, which leads to poor overall performance. In this context, we study two practical problems. In both problems, the manufacturer focuses on minimizing unproductive time. The distributor minimizes customer cost measures in the first problem and minimizes inventory holding cost in the second problem. We first evaluate each party's conflict, which is the relative increase in cost that results from using the other party's optimal schedule. Since this conflict is often significant, we consider several practical scenarios about the level of cooperation between the manufacturer and the distributor. These scenarios define various scheduling problems for the manufacturer, the distributor, and the overall system. For each of these scheduling problems, we provide an algorithm. We demonstrate that the cost saving provided by cooperation between the decision makers is usually significant. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for how manufacturers and distributors negotiate, coordinate, and implement their supply chain schedules in practice. </jats:p>",

The ability of a strategy supply chain to engender cultural competitiveness, or joint entrepreneurship and learning aimed at filling market gaps, is a key path through which a strategic supply chain may become a competitive advantage. A balance of trust and power within the supply chain offsets uncertainty and risks associated with the behaviors underlying cultural competitiveness. Using a multi‐theoretic perspective, we discuss four strategies that firms use to balance a climate of trust and power in a strategic supply chain. Identifying an authority, generating a common supply chain identity, utilizing boundary spanning ties, and providing procedural and interactive justice are the strategies we discuss.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is an increased emphasis on making all costs transparent in supply chain management. Transportation costs should be appropriately incorporated into logistics decisions given that transportation costs can be almost 50% of the logistics cost. This study develops a buyer-supplier coordination model to facilitate frequent deliveries in small lot size in manufacturing supply chains. Two transportation cost functions that emulate reality and simultaneously provide a straightforward representation of actual freight rates are identified. Then, they are used to estimate transportation costs and deduce concrete models for truck-load (TL) and less-than-truck-load (LTL). The optimal order quantities of the two deduced models are equal. The solution of the truck-load model has a smaller number of deliveries per order and incurs high inventory cost, while the solution of the less-than-truck-load model has a larger number of deliveries per order and incurs high transportation cost. We propose a heuristic procedure to search the optimal number of deliveries per order in the interval bounded by these two solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed model can guarantee the accuracy and performance of the decision without adding undue complexity and effort to the decision process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 6016 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Current estimates are less than 5% of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials. Initiatives to address barriers to accrual (such as age, physician bias, etc) are ongoing. However, with more drugs in the pipeline and more clinical trials being conducted, demand for trial participants may be outpacing the current “supply”. Methods: The ClinicalTrials.gov database, maintained by National Institutes of Health was selected for review on the basis that it is proposed to be the mandated repository for clinical trials information. Over a 2 month period, the database was mined for all active, US recruiting, phase I, I/II, II, and III trials in breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Results: There were 290 breast, 212 lung, and 177 prostate cancer trials with the prespecified criteria. The number of patients needed to complete these trials is 151,311 (breast), 33,498 (lung), and 53,181 (prostate). These represent 19.4% to 71.6% of the American Cancer Society incidence estimates of the studied tumors. NCI, industry, and academia sponsored, either solely or in collaborations, 42.1%, 26.5%, and 45.6% of trials, respectively. Majority of studies were phase II (51%), with 11.5% phase I, and 15.6% phase III. Remaining studies were either combined phase I/II studies or not specified. Significant percentage of trials involved pts with advanced/metastatic disease (54% breast, 51.4% lung, and 44.6% prostate). Conclusions: Although many studies have anticipated enrollment period over several years, the number of trial participants needed to complete these studies is quite daunting. Our results are likely under-estimates as not all studies currently enrolling patients may be included in this registry, and not all studies in the database specified the recruitment goal. Although not all trial participants are drawn from the incidence numbers, it is clear that given the current trial participation rate, demand has outpaced the supply. The medical community has the ethical responsibility to ensure sufficient patient enrollment for clinical trials. In addition to addressing accrual barriers, the authors encourage the establishment of a task force including academia, government, and industry to systematically evaluate and prioritize the types of trials being conducted. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Knowledge of the major nutrient requirements of dairy cows has increased substantially during the past decades. Little is known, however, about the importance of the roles played by B vitamins. Since most of those vitamins act as essential cofactors in energy, protein and lipid metabolism, it is likely that as milk yield increases, the demand for these cofactors also increases. The supply of B vitamins from dietary sources and synthesis by the ruminal microflora is generally sufficient to avoid deficiency symptoms, but could be insufficient for optimizing metabolic efficiency, production, composition and the nutritional quality of milk in high-producing dairy cows. Results from recent experiments show how the supply of three B vitamins — folic acid, biotin and vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> — affects major metabolic pathways. Supplementary biotin has frequently been reported to increase milk yield but has a limited effect on milk composition. Folic acid supplements have been found to increase milk and milk protein yields in multiparous cows without affecting dry matter intake when vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> supply was adequate. An insufficient vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> supply blocked those effects but they can be restored through vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> supplementation. Supplemental vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> and biotin increased milk and milk protein yields without changing dry matter intake. Vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> utilization by tissues increased in cows fed supplementary folic acid simultaneously; plasma glucose also increased in these cows but plasma biotin decreased. From these findings, it appears that, in high-producing dairy cows, especially in early lactation, the strong competition for nutrients that occurs between gluconeogenesis, methylneogenesis and protein synthesis increases the amount of folic acid, vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> and biotin required to maintain metabolic efficiency, especially when the nutrient supply is limited. These observations emphasize the need to review the paradigm according to which B-vitamin supply by ruminal microflora cannot be limiting in dairy cow. Key words: Dairy cow, B vitamins, folic acid, vitamin B<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>, biotin, lactation, metabolism </jats:p>",

The interdependence structure of the alliance may contribute to this problem. Viewing managed supply chains as a form of social dilemma also identifies solutions that may be implemented unilaterally by individual firms or jointly by the alliance to maintain the “indispensable virtue” of high trust that allows supply chains to effectively create added value.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

With nearly 3,885 square-kilometers of forestland, the importance of fostering forest management that is compatible with water quality is paramount, yet challenging, given that approximately 90 percent of the system’s forestland is privately owned. The objective of this study was to evaluate voluntary best management practices implementation by nonindustrial private forestland owners in New York City’s water supply system. The theoretical constructs of the innovation-decision process model were tested for covariance using data collected from owners and their forestland in New York City’s water supply system. Path analysis indicated that certain types of knowledge predict an owner’s attitude formation or decision to use best management practices, but attitude formation does not always predict their decision. In addition, analysis of variance demonstrated that the implementation of best management practices does not always depend on a nonindustrial private forestland owner’s decision. This empirical result stimulates questions regarding the systemic variables at play in the transition from decision to implementation of forestry practices.</jats:p>",

Concentrations of nitrate and ammonium were monitored on a daily basis and held relatively constant by continuous, automatic additions of stock solutions. Pea plants accumulated the most total dry mass (DM) and total N when supplied with the combination of nitrate plus ammonium but had the lowest nodule DM and percentage of nitrogen derived from the atmosphere. Whole-plant nodulation (nodules per plant) and DM-specific nodulation (nodules·g<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> root DM) were 2.3- and 2.4-fold greater, respectively, in pea plants receiving NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> at 0.5 mmol·L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> than in those supplied with NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> at 0.5 mmol·L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. The nodulation responses of plants receiving NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> at 0.25 mmol·L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> plus NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> at 0.25 mmol·L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> were more similar to those of plants receiving only nitrate than only ammonium, indicating that when both forms of mineral N are available to plants, nitrate has a predominant effect on the nodulation response. Assessment of the stage of development of nodule primordia and nodules during the time course of the experiments indicated that nitrate not only decreased the degree of nodule initiation but also the rate at which those nodules developed. Microscopic observations indicated that the more negative effects of the nitrate treatment on DM-specific nodulation as compared with the ammonium treatment were consistent on both the primary and lateral roots. Quantification of nodulation and tertiary root development on lateral roots indicated that the stimulating effects of ammonium were specific to nodulation; the effects on tertiary root development were different. The study demonstrates for the first time that when both forms of mineral N are available at equal concentrations, the nodulation response in pea is influenced more by nitrate than by ammonium and that the effects of nitrate and ammonium on tertiary root initiation and development are unlike those on nodulation. </jats:p>",

Six scenarios have been defined, analysing three policy strategies in two different contexts of energy supply—A, generally accepted energy supply forecast and B, worst-case energy supply forecast (scarcity of energy). Policies include: business as usual; investment in infrastructure and technology; and a demand regulation based approach involving changes in taxation and tolls. The paper assesses the impact and robustness of each policy against assumptions about future oil supply/demand. Our results demonstrate three key issues. First, scarcity of oil will accelerate the development and take-up of alternative fuel technologies; second, investment in alternative technologies alone will alleviate the impact of local emissions and reduce energy consumption per kilometre travelled but will only reduce yearly carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions after a time lag of about 15 years; so that, third, some form of regulation of demand will be necessary to reduce total emissions and externalities caused by congestion. Research is required to define the necessary level of regulation in combination with technology investments. However, we suggest that a policy involving improvements in infrastructure coupled with investments in fuel technology and differentiated fuel taxes will be required in the future.</jats:p>",

Pigs weaned at 28·7±3·45 days of age (no. =49) were individually housed in an environmentally controlled room and assigned to one of seven dietary treatments; a 3×2 factorial combination of dietary protein content (130, 180 and 230 g crude protein (CP) per kg) and main protein source (DSMP and SOYA), plus an additional control containing 230 g CP per kg, DSMP and in-food AGPs (ZnO, CuSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>and avilamycin). Individual food intake, faecal score (FS), cleanliness score (CS) and health score (HS) were taken daily, and live weight and faecal samples were taken on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 14. All animals were slaughtered on day 14 to examine variables describing aspects of gastro-intestinal health. Increasing CP content and the removal of AGPs both led to a significant increase in faecal fluidity and contamination although there was no effect on HS. There was no effect of DSMP inclusion on FS, CS or HS. Increasing CP content led to an increase (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·05) in the number of coliforms in faecal and proximal colon (PC) samples taken at slaughter and a decrease (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·01) in the lactobacilli to coliform ratio (L:C) in the PC.

The inclusion of AGPs increased ADFI (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·05) and ADG (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·05) but had no effect on FCR over the whole trial period. The results indicate that in the absence of AGPs both growth performance and the risk of PWED increased as protein supply was increased. The increased risk of PWED was associated with an increased fluidity of faeces, a reduction in the L:C ratio and an increase in intestinal pH. Consequently, it is important to balance the trade-off between maximizing performance and minimising the risk of PWED through manipulating protein supply, particularly in an environment where AGPs are no longer permitted.</jats:p>",

We develop optimal control policies to balance backlog costs against hiring and firing personnel costs'assuming shared backlog information—under both centralized and decentralized control. We examine when there is sufficient economic incentive for two completely decentralized stages to begin: (1) to share backlog information without centralizing control, or (2) to completely centralize control. These switching points are determined by the relative service and personnel costs of the two stages. From these results, we show that decentralizing control in many cases does not materially worsen performance, so long as information is shared.

The research has been successful in exploring issues affecting buyer—supplier relationships. A methodology for aligning supply chains by taking into account human issues has been proposed. The methodology consists of a relationship framework that is used for studying buyer—supplier relationships on a macro-level based on the levels of satisfaction that the entities have with each other. Since high levels of dissatisfaction lead to various change—inducing transactions or game-like behaviour between the entities, the framework identifies the status of the relationship, and can be used to gauge what is going to happen to it, once the transaction is over. The concepts of transactional analysis and the tools associated with it, namely drama triangle analysis and structural modelling, are useful in studying the dynamics of the transactions from the human perspective and also from a psychological perspective. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the negotiations on the Australia–US free trade agreement (AUSFTA), the US dairy industry vigorously opposed opening the US market to imports of Australian dairy products on the grounds that the US industry would be devastated. Subsequently, the agreement signed in February 2004 made an exception for dairy, providing for only limited quota expansion and no free trade, even at the end of the long implementation period. This paper presents a simulation model of world dairy markets, represented by supply and demand equations for fat and non‐fat components of milk and manufactured dairy products. We use the model to analyse the effects on US milk markets of both a hypothetical agreement, allowing free bilateral trade in dairy products, and the actual AUSFTA. An important contribution to the literature is the derivation of explicit supply and demand relationships for milk components. The components model allows an analysis of long‐term production, consumption, and trade patterns that is not tied to specific, fungible products. Simulations indicate that increased imports from Australia resulting from bilateral trade liberalisation would have resulted in small reductions in US milk prices and production. The much smaller increases in Australian access to the US market under the actual AUSFTA will have even smaller, almost negligible, impacts.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on task allocation in the open supply chain environment. The aim is to develop a task allocation method for autonomous and self-interested agents, which have incomplete information about the open environment. The proposed mechanism is based on an automatic negotiation approach, which is used to allocate tasks by negotiating among the manager-to-bidder and bidder-to-bidder. The modification of contract net protocol (CNP) for manager-bidder and the protocol of the stochastic offer are introduced, and the relevant negotiation algorithms are also presented. The proposed method is a dynamic method for task allocation, which is applicable to the open environment without a central authority and permits some degree of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration is useful in dispatching new tasks or handling resource failures. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, one of the most important phenomena observed in the later stages of sepsis is an increased dependence of tissue O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>utilization on the convective O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>supply. This “pathological supply dependency” is associated with organ failure and poor clinical outcomes. Here, a detailed theoretical model of capillary-to-tissue O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>transport during sepsis is used to examine the origins of abnormal supply dependency. With use of three-dimensional arrays of capillaries with heterogeneous spacing and blood flow, steady-state O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>transport is simulated numerically during reductions in the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>supply. Increased supply dependency is shown to occur in sepsis for hypoxic (decreased hemoglobin O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>saturation) and stagnant (decreased blood flow) hypoxia. For stagnant hypoxia, a reduction in FCD with decreasing blood flow is necessary to obtain the observed increase in supply dependency. Our results imply that supply dependency observed under normal conditions does not have its origin at the level of individual capillaries. In sepsis, however, diffusion limitation and shunting of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>by individual capillaries occur to a degree that is dependent on the heterogeneity of septic injury and the arrangement of capillary networks. Thus heterogeneous stoppage of individual capillaries is a likely factor in pathological supply dependency.</jats:p>",
