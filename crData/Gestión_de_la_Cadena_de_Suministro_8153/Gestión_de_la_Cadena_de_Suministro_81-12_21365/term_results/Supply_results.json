The model has been extensively and successfully applied, but its linear programming component is computationally burdensome. In this paper we report computational results from experiments to reduce solution time through decomposition. The model is decomposed into two capacitated pure networks: a supply side, whose units of flow are Btus of coal; and a demand side, whose units of flow are megawatts of electrical generation capacity. The method used for integrating these components is a market equilibration (“cobweb”) algorithm. The mechanism is not generally convergent, but it produces an excellent starting basis for completion by standard linear programming methods. Order of magnitude solution time reductions have been achieved by the combined procedure. A new decomposition algorithm for linear programs is presented. The method is motivated by the present application, but has not been implemented. </jats:p>",

Many of the techniques have been used in the treatment of diseases or injuries such as broken bones or sprains, but an element in this practice is the speed with which the injury is treated and rehabilitated. The literature is diffused throughout the biomedical and biological science fields. As this is a growing specialty, it opens a challenge and an opportunity for the health science librarian. Availability of the literature is enhanced by on-line access to computerised bibliographic material and data such as MEDLINE; Toxicology Data Bank; Biosis Previews (Biological Abstracts/Bioresearch Index); Excerpta Medica; AVLINE; CATLINE; Health Planning and Administration and their corresponding reviews.</jats:p><jats:p>The 1980 Olympics have increased the number of reviews and discussions in the literature. This paper is a review of the demand and supply for sports medicine information in the English language in Purdue University. Emphasis is given to the physical, social, and psychological rehabilitation of the athlete patient and the impact on the medical librarian in the provision of information demanded by the sports medicine specialist. Computerised access to the literature sources is discussed as an introduction to their use in this field.</jats:p>",

The announcement effect is interpreted as a policy anticipation effect. That is, an unanticipated increase in the money supply leads to an increase in interest rates in anticipation of future tightening by the Federal Reserve. Estimates of this effect with proxies for the unanticipated change constructed from a survey of money supply forecasts and an ARIMA model indicate that: (a) financial markets respond very quickly to the announcement; and (b) the response was largest when policymakers emphasized the importance of the monetary aggregates.</jats:p>",
