Notably, non‐commercial organizations have been lauded as potential facilitators of improvements in labor standards through their capability to influence supply chain actors. Through an analysis of 45 semi‐structured interviews across three cases, this research provides rich evidence of non‐commercial organizations' contribution to governance linked to the persistence of labor exploitation. The findings reveal that the constraining factors of change capabilities of non‐commercial organizations are (1) recognition of their limitations to enact improvements when their organizations are positioned in a heterogeneous supply chain context, (2) lack of a level playing field that provides a fair competitive environment to improve labor standards, and (3) labor deregulation. Similarly, the complex situation faced by non‐commercial organizations created dilemmas that hindered progress in addressing labor exploitation. Governance inertia is an overarching issue that circumscribes the ambitions of non‐commercial organizations to enhance labor standards. This research emphasizes the issues and challenges that constrain these uniquely placed organizations in facilitating positive change in global apparel supply chains.</jats:p>",

It is focused on the root causes, effects, and aftermath of supply chain disruptions; the potential solutions to counter these problems are also evaluation by this process.\r\nFindings: The study points out that the traditional risk management approaches are not enough, and suggests implementing the techniques such as mapping of the supply chain, supplier diversification and investment in digital technologies like block chain, cloud computing and cyber security. These approaches aid in boosting the supply chain resilience by providing transparency, enabling backup inventory management, and improving collaboration and efficiency within the supply chain operations.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study complements the existing body of knowledge by offering a detailed overview of risk management strategies that can be implemented for the purpose of supply chain resilience. It provides with concrete suggestions on issues of diversity, the use of new technologies, and of coordination to strengthen the chains of supply against disruptions. Furthermore, the research calls for policy intervention to enable the utilization of the above-discussed strategies and increase supply chain resilience at a broader level as well.</jats:p>"

This article explores attempts to ensure security of supply in three sectors: semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical raw materials. The analysis contrasts the measures taken in each sector in order to highlight commonalities and explain differences in approach and impact. This comparison of the EU's three principal policies for mitigating supply chain disruption shows the EU has equipped itself with more policy tools in the area of critical raw materials. The argument put forward to explain this prioritisation is that the weaponisation of critical raw materials has already taken place and risks stoking a political backlash against the EU green deal. Consequently, the evidence shows how the EU's geoeconomic hedging marks a move away from an overriding commitment to free markets as part of the postwar liberal international order. Rather, the EU is experimenting with market‐directing mechanisms involving state aid, stockpiling and regulatory interventions in the name of security of supply. This change illustrates not just the fraying of the liberal international trade order but also the part that the EU is playing in this transformation.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, in the era of economic crises, growing number of warlike conflicts, vulnerable global supply chains, climate change - this is not that obvious anymore. As an aftermath of all recent changes, it common to talk about decentralised generation, energy communities, microgrids, demand management. The energy industry is still one of the biggest emitters in its never-ending contest to cope with steadily growing energy hunger of the world. In this context energy industry does its best to behave on a responsible manner and exploits all possible non-fossil, non or reduced emitting, renewable primer energy resources to decrease – or keep the level at least – of the emission of greenhouse gases. In this study our aim is to demonstrate the possible positive impact of an energy source, not yet utilised to its full potential, the biogas. We analyse under what economic, social, regulatory environment can grow up to its potential and what are the preconditions of feasibility.</jats:p>"

Such as opportunism, “free riding” and data leakage affect supply chain development. Thus, many manufacturing firms are adopting supply chain relationship governance (SCRG) as a strategic to enhance performance. Using data collected from a survey of 295 manufacturing firms, this paper confirms the influence of SCRG on supply chain performance (SCP). The mediating effect of supply chain integration (SCI) and the moderating effect of digital capabilities (DCs) are explored. The results show that SCRG has a beneficial effect on SCP. SCI plays a partial mediating role in SCRG and SCP. DCs positively moderate the relationship between SCRG and SCI. This study is one of the first to explore the role of DCs in the relationship between supply chain partners and the impact on performance. It provides fresh perspectives and real-world evidence for determining the importance of SCRG strategies.</p>",

Investing in digital supply chain technologies boosts end-to-end visibility, mitigates risk, and improves the resilience of supply chains. Many disruptive technologies are currently changing the business landscape in Africa. However, Africa has traditionally been an adopter rather than a pioneer of technologies for business development. Although there has been an increase in the use of blockchain technology in various industries, there is still a challenge of understanding how the technology can be applied in the South African rail supply chain context. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how managers perceive the technology and how this understanding affects the decision to use the technology in the rail freight Container Corridor. A gap exists between the understanding, organizational support and benefits of the technology and its application within the corridor.  A case study approach was utilized to collect primary data obtained through a structured self-administered survey questionnaire. The main findings of the study were that the understanding of blockchain influenced managers perceptions and willingness to adopt the technology. While the railway operator was committed to implementing blockchain, other operational constraints and inefficiencies still present on the corridor were impediments to further investigation. Furthermore, potential benefits and challenges, costs and resources required as well as the impact on current operations and workings were highlighted by management as important decision-making factors.  The study provides valuable insights into disruptive technologies applications within the transport supply chains. It substantiates the significance of how managers view blockchain as a technology to address various challenges as well as enhance operations within the South African freight rail sector.</jats:p>",

Using signaling theory, this research develops and tests a model that examines how a firm's intentionality and motive behind irresponsible environmental sourcing practices can signal a product's environmental characteristics to consumers. The findings suggest that consumers tend to view products as more environmentally harmful when they learn that a firm intentionally sources from irresponsible suppliers. Likewise, consumers are more likely to react unfavorably to a firm's products when a firm prioritizes profit motives over responsible sourcing practices. This research also offers insight into how a firm's corrective response strategy (e.g., mandatory vs. voluntary environmental supplier actions) could mitigate the adverse impact of the firm's environmentally irresponsible sourcing practices on consumer perceptions of environmental risk. The findings indicate that a firm's mandatory corrective actions targeted to its suppliers are more likely to be effective, whereas voluntary actions were found to be ineffective. Two experiments were conducted to test the study's hypotheses. Managerial and societal implications are also discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In our increasingly interconnected world, responsible business operation has become a normal, critical part of doing business for virtually all industries. Consumers, investors, and other company stakeholders are demanding businesses take responsibility for their current and future impacts on people and the environment. When assessing the role corporations play in a more sustainable future, many turn their focus to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that help define and measure sustainable business. Given the wide variety of topics encompassed in ESG, companies often identify which are material, or prioritised by company stakeholders. Quantitative and qualitative information for material ESG topics is often reported using a standard or framework such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures; Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board; the Global Reporting Initiative and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), along with other region-specific standards. One reporting challenge includes extending ESG strategies and data collection to a company’s value chain. By including ESG-related requirements in service contracts or pre-qualification metrics, expectations can be clearly communicated and data aggregation becomes simpler. Engaging with vendors on the importance of material topics and providing educational tools and opportunities is necessary for accurate data collection. Benchmarking companies against their peers allows organisations to make informed decisions to continue or halt business relationships. Every company’s approach to ESG will look different, but protecting the business’s reputation and customer expectations is critical to continuous operations. Outcomes: understanding different components of ESG. Recognition of the types of reporting disclosure frameworks. Best practices with contractors and suppliers.</jats:p>"

To provide managers with adequate decision-making support, it is crucial to understand the underlying planning processes along the entire supply chain. Recent events have shown that supply chain managers face various problems, from facilitating a transition to more sustainable food systems to securing food security by strengthening resilience. At the same time, an ever-growing population further exacerbates existing problems. This chapter explores the importance and complexity of planning processes in agri-food supply chains by briefly highlighting relevant building blocks for designing planning tools and by providing a comprehensive review on key planning elements, e.g. forecasting, production, and inventory planning.

A mathematical model describing the non-stationary modes of operation of DHW system heaters under the conditions of implementation of this scheme is constructed and investigated. Calculations were carried out using this model, including numerical simulation on a computer using the Monte Carlo method. It is established that in this case, a decrease in the average heat transfer coefficient of the heater of the DHW system due to fluctuations in the flow of mains water following the daily change in water consumption at the DHW can be neglected, since this decrease lies within the usual error of engineering calculation, despite the fact that this coefficient depends on the flow in a nonlinear way, and its growth during the period of increased water intake for DHW does not fully compensate for the decrease during the reduction of water consumption. At the same time, it is proved that with a characteristic number of heat transfer units in a DHW system heater referred to the heated stream, the total amount of heat transferred can decrease quite noticeably, by an amount of 10 to 12 percent; however, with a rational choice of the heater size, such a decrease is within the limits allowed by the applied factors of margin when setting determination of the heat exchange surface.</jats:p>"

This war caused an increase in energy, commodity, and food prices as well as increased inflation in many countries. In this study, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on Turkey's imports, exports, and supply chains were revealed through literature review. Extreme increases in commodity prices due to the war damaged the purchasing power of households.

The empirical findings widen the context of SCC literature to include SAEs from emerging economies in sub-Saharan Africa. The empirical findings enrich the understanding of how SAEs can manage their SCCs to develop and use specific capabilities that positively impact SCP. The uniqueness of this article rests in the proposed model and new empirical knowledge, which extends the scope of the relational and capability-based views and SCC literature to include innovation capacity, BPA, and SCP of SAEs in emerging markets. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Known for their environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and quiet operation, electric buses come forward as ideal public transportation solutions for urban areas. On the other hand, their limited driving range, depending on their battery capacities, hinders their wider adoption. Implementing the opportunity charging strategy can serve as a solution to address this inherent challenge of electric buses. This strategy allows buses to charge at bus stops using wireless chargers during the dwell time. However, it introduces another challenge, known as the Charging Infrastructure Location Problem (CILP), which involves optimizing the charger locations on transit networks. Several studies have approached CILP, adopting the opportunity charging strategy. Nevertheless, these studies either evaluate energy levels concerning bus routes or assume predetermined charging durations at stops. However, it is a fact that each electric bus operating on the same route is supplied a different amount of energy due to the total number of passengers boarding and alighting throughout the entire operating period. Furthermore, each bus consumes different amounts of energy due to its schedule throughout the operation period. This study develops an optimization model to minimize the charging infrastructure investment cost in an electric bus network under dynamic supply and demand. The model assesses the energy level of each bus individually by calculating the recharging duration at each stop for each bus depending on the number of boarding and alighting passengers and taking into account the impact of time-dependent link travel times on energy consumption. The developed optimization model is tested on a small-scale network. The results demonstrate that when the energy level of each bus is assessed individually, notable differences exist in the energy levels among buses operating on the same route. Additionally, solving the model more realistically using charging durations obtained from passenger boarding/alighting numbers instead of predetermined charging duration leads to significant increases in the charging infrastructure investment cost. </jats:p>",

The Quetta Valley of Pakistan was investigated regarding its groundwater quality sustainability based on integrated approaches of hydrochemistry, geographic information system, and multivariate statistics. A total of 29 groundwater samples were collected from monitoring wells to get insights into the hydrochemical suitability of groundwater for sustainable irrigation and drinking utilization. The results indicate groundwater is mainly featured by the hydrochemical facies of HCO3·Cl-Ca. Groundwater hydrochemical composition is dominantly governed by the dissolution of carbonates and silicate minerals in combination with positive cation exchange in the valley. Principal component analysis reveals a significant influence of geogenic factors on groundwater chemistry, further supported by PHREEQC simulation that detects a supersaturation of calcite, dolomite, and sulphate minerals in the aquifer. The irrigation water quality index divides groundwater in the study area into three zones, which signify low restriction and no restriction, except for a severe restriction in the southwestern part of the valley. Groundwater is generally suitable for irrigation across the valley. The entropy-weighted water quality index classifies groundwater as excellent and good quality for drinking. This study can provide crucial insights for authorities on groundwater suitability in Quetta Valley and similar regions worldwide.</jats:p>",

This development, together with growing environmental and social concerns, requires enhanced management, planning, and information systems to ensure that individual processes and actors at different points in the supply chain work efficiently to meet increasingly demanding customer expectations. Measurement of the performance of entire supply chains is an important issue because it allows for ‘tracking and tracing’ of efficacy and efficiency failures and leads to more informed decision-making with regard to end-to-end supply chain design. However, the choice of appropriate supply chain performance indicators is complicated due to the multiple inputs and outputs in the system. This chapter reviews how agri-food supply chain performance measurement has evolved. It provides an overview of performance metrics and indicators and relevant trade-offs and discusses several methods and techniques that can be used to measure agri-food supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The conversion process is complex and requires huge financial and human resources investments. Because such resources are always limited and cannot be adequately provided at once, phased conversion is encouraged. However, there are challenges with this approach in terms of which areas should be prioritized during the conversion process so that the water supply situation for the unconverted areas is not aggravated. This article uses a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to identify the criteria for prioritising areas to be converted during phased conversion to continuous water supply from a water utility perspective. The Lusaka Water Supply and Sanitation Company is used as a case study. Results show that the financial sustainability of the utility company is the major criterion for selecting an area to be prioritized. In countries like Zambia where tariff structures are such that industries subsidise domestic water consumption and the affluent subsidise water consumed by the poor, prioritising financial sustainability entails giving priority to areas where high revenues are expected. This is synonymous with giving priority to the affluent or the middle-class areas with high densities of water consumers.</jats:p>",

Moreover, define a Pareto Improvement (PI) strategy as one that benefits both manufacturers and retailers. Therefore, uniform pricing is a PI when the unit cost is high and the efficiency is low; personalized pricing is a PI when the unit cost is low and the efficiency is low or high; otherwise, there is no PI.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This study is the first that investigates how the retailer develops CPA to implement personalized pricing on a comprehensive spectrum, which can provide practical insights for retailers with different efficiencies.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Traditional methods on numerous occasions fail to comprehensively understand the nature of this field, thus resulting in inefficiencies within the Sri Lankan apparel supply chain. The research answers this problem through the identification and development of the context-specific methods that are effective for enhanced demand forecasting in the apparel supply chain. The project explores the use of deep learning, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and their combinations with other models (CNN, ARIMA, BPNN) to develop a demand forecasting application. Experiments with six models identified a CNN-LSTM architecture as the optimal solution, achieving the lowest MAE of 2.9710, MAPE of 24.6802, MSE of 85.0358, and RMSE of 9.2215. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were employed to optimize and validate the chosen model.</p>"

The questionnaire focused on assessing blockchain adoption rates, interoperability standards, stakeholder collaboration, regulatory support, cost considerations, and perceived impacts on supply chain transparency.Findings: The findings reveal high levels of blockchain adoption among surveyed companies, with strong positive correlations observed between blockchain adoption and interoperability standards, stakeholder collaboration, and regulatory support. However, challenges such as cost considerations and potential trade-offs between interoperability and transparency were also identified. Overall, blockchain technology shows promise in improving supply chain transparency in Italy.Research Limitations/Implications: This study is limited by its focus on a specific geographical context (Italy) and the use of self-reported data. Future research could explore the dynamics of blockchain adoption in other regions and employ objective measures to assess supply chain transparency.Practical Implications: The findings offer practical insights for businesses and policymakers aiming to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency.Social Implications: Blockchain adoption has the potential to foster greater trust and accountability within supply chains, benefiting various stakeholders including consumers, producers, and regulators.Originality/Value: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on blockchain technology in supply chain management, particularly within the Italian context, by providing empirical evidence on its adoption and impact on transparency.Limitations: Despite the robust methodology employed, limitations include the reliance on self-reported data and the exclusion of qualitative insights.</jats:p>"

This study evaluates the footprint of reuse on small water supply systems in rural areas, where raw water quality does not meet the drinking water standards and complicated treatment is needed. Individual facilities for reuse of potential rainwater, light gray, gray and domestic wastewater in the households could lead to a decrease in non-potable tap water use up to 60% and a decrease of households' annual expenses for water supply up to 93 €/household. The installation of individual facilities for common reuse of rainwater and gray wastewater requires the highest investment costs, but the option`s operational costs are between 15% and 20% lower than all other options considered. The Drinking Water Treatment Plant capacity reduction due to Integrated Water Resource Management measures implementation enables from 48% up to 58% saving in the total operational costs for drinking water supply in the settlement. The shortest payback period and best economic impact of reuse for small scale water supply systems is observed if rainwater and gray wastewater are reused together.</jats:p>",

Freight logistics within Africa is even more complex given the limited logistics infrastructure, varied regulations between countries, poor security and the high cost of transport. The purpose of this paper is to explore the status of academic literature on freight logistics in Africa and examine the potential of advanced information technologies in enhancing the logistics sector. The paper utilised the scoping literature review technique to select relevant documents. The freight logistics sector in Africa can be termed as struggling, it is among the least efficient globally. The lack of valid data on the various logistics components makes it difficult for stakeholders to plan for efficiency and effectiveness.  The need for country specific technologies to address its unique challenges is emphasized. The smooth flow of goods across countries can only be achieved through collaboration among countries and investments in logistics infrastructure as well as technology. The study underscores the need for data-driven decision-making, context-specific technologies, and collaboration to improve Africa's freight logistics. The current study has explored the freight logistics literature focusing on Africa, not only to unearth the challenges, but also propose likely solutions. While the current study is limited to published literature, further research should empirically explore impactful technologies, compare countries' situations, and involve policymakers for comprehensive solutions.</jats:p>",

This qualitative research investigates the multifaceted impacts of ethical sourcing, drawing insights from interviews with key stakeholders in the renewable energy sector. The study reveals that ethical sourcing enhances supply chain transparency, traceability, and resilience by mitigating risks associated with unethical practices such as labor exploitation and environmental degradation. Fair trade initiatives contribute to economic stability and reduce price volatility by ensuring fair compensation for producers and workers, fostering long-term relationships, and reinvesting premiums into community development projects. Sustainable sourcing practices align with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products, reduce the demand for virgin resources, and promote regulatory compliance and incentives, thereby stabilizing costs and reducing environmental impact. Socially responsible companies that prioritize fair labor practices and community support experience fewer disruptions and benefit from a more stable and productive workforce. Entrepreneurship and emotional intelligence among leaders drive the adoption and successful implementation of ethical sourcing practices, enhancing brand reputation, consumer trust, and market competitiveness. Despite challenges, such as higher implementation costs and supplier resistance, the long-term benefits of ethical sourcing outweigh the initial costs and contribute to sustainable supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the uncertainty of world economic development, market demands are stochastic and the supply quantities of suppliers in the supply chain are always flexible, so a mixed wholesale-option-contract (abbreviated as a mixed contract) is one of the good ways for commodity distributors to cope with flexible supply. For a contract farming supply chain composed of a distributor and two suppliers under random demand and yield, we propose the new mixed contracts with flexible supply for the players to make better procurement and inventory decisions. Therefore, with decentralized decision making with a wholesale price contract and centralized decision making as benchmarks for comparison, the advantages of mixed contracts were demonstrated in this paper. The expected profit function under each transaction mode was proved to be concave and the optimal orders or production quantities were obtained and compared. Theoretical derivation and numerical examples were carried out and the main conclusions are as follows. First, the distributor’s total order quantities are the largest under centralized decision making, then the second largest under mixed contracts, then the least under wholesale price contracts. Second, for the dealer under mixed contracts, within the feasible range, the smaller the option price (or option exercise price) is, the greater the dealer’s profit is. Third, with increasing initial order quantity, the gap between the dealer’s profits under different option prices (or option exercise prices) narrows, and eventually tends to the same point. For both the suppliers as a whole, a mixed contract is better than the wholesale price one. Fourth, when the prices of the option contract change within a reasonable range (they may not be too small or too large), the profits of both the dealer and suppliers under a mixed contract are not only higher than those under the wholesale price contract, but also higher than those under centralized decision making. Finally, policies and suggestions (such as full investigation, explicitly defining the process of contracts, establishing real-time supervision and information sharing mechanisms, and so on) were put forward to improve the accuracy of supply and demand forecasting, better implement mixed contracts under flexible supply, and strengthen reforms about agricultural supply side.</jats:p>"

Following this perspective, it takes stock of the latest food security outcomes in Asia with a focus on food utilisation (i.e. undernourishment), followed by a discussion of the key driving factors along the lines of food availability, physical food access and economic food access. These include challenges from climate change, as well as supply-chain disruptions from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine. Moving forward, other regions globally can take a page from the various ways by which Asian countries (and its sub-regions) have been working to address food security challenges, building on four examples cited such as China’s state-led upstream interventions; India’s digitalisation of public distribution; Singapore’s state supported agri-food tech ecosystem; and private sector-led digitalisation in Southeast Asia.</jats:p>",

The primary aim of this study is to clarify the role played by the consent given by the data subject to the processing of personal data within the framework of these new-wave digital contracts. In particular, our focus lies on discerning the consequences of the withdrawal of consent on the contract itself. This subject requires a multidisciplinary approach. By using the historical, theoretical and descriptive method of scientific inquiry, we hope to provide a more precise understanding of the complex regulatory framework governing electronic commerce. The paper commences by explaining the socio-economic and regulatory context in which the processing of personal data influences contract law. In the first section of the paper, we underline the distinction between two manifestations of will: the contractual consent, understood as a prerequisite for the validity of a contract, and the GDPR consent, representing an agreement to the processing of personal data. Subsequently, we emphasize the role of GDPR consent in synallagmatic contracts for the supply of digital content and services whereas the third section deals with the effects of GDPR consent withdrawal on the digital contract. Following our research, we concluded that there is a symbiotic relationship between the two legal forms of consent, despite their different nature. It is certain that the extensive processing of data, often referred to as ‘Big Data’, which has been prevalent for at least a decade, claims the need to protect the consumer of digital content and services beyond the non-patrimonial nature of the fundamental rights regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</jats:p>"

In the available literature, combined role of agility and adaptability and their impact on SCP is poorly investigated. As a rapidly changing market environment requires the supply chains to be more responsive and flexible, supply chain agility and adaptability appear to be value-enhancing and contribute to its effectiveness. Following the resource-based views (RBV) and relational theory this study presents a model linking SIS capability, agility, and adaptability with SCP. A cross-sectional survey of 243 Indian auto component manufacturers was conducted to collect the data. The results reveal that SIS, agility, and adaptability are directly and significantly connected with SCP. This finding supports the prominently published studies. The main contribution of the study is unveiling the mediation effect of agility and adaptability on the SIS-SCP relationship. Results depict that agility and adaptability mediate the SIS-SCP relationship fully and partially respectively. The study also discusses the theoretical and managerial implications along with limitations and scope for future research.</p>"

Profound restructuring of supply chain, SC, is emerging regarding the sustainability impacts that is being placed in the top priorities of companies’ agenda. Besides, the international dimension of SC, as well as the complex partnership networks present great challenges to the paradigm of fully integrated SC. Following these motivations, a novel proposal was developed to help the decision-making process within an uncertain environment. The goal of the approach is to develop a planning framework to help SC managers to balance between environmental footprint, social responsibility, service level to customer and economic criteria. A mathematical formulation is proposed and the model applicability is shown through the solution of an industrial example. The practical implementation involves the development of a decision model framework (MILP formulation) to optimally manage performance indicators and to assure sustainability requirements. The impact of sustainable policies in the SC planning strategy is evaluated for different managing scenarios. These bring new insights concerning SC planning under uncertainty.</jats:p>"

With more attention paid to environmentally friendly products, there are greater challenges encountered by green supply chain management. In this study, a green supply chain network problem is analyzed, involving a manufacturer and a retailer. In addition to the construction of centralized and decentralized decision models, two cost-sharing contracts are adopted to reduce promotion costs for the retailer and improve the level of greenery in products. With the help of game theory, equilibrium decisions can be made by solving the models.

However, challenges such as greenwashing and limited transparency undermine the credibility and effectiveness of certification programs. Despite these challenges, certification initiatives drive incremental improvements in environmental performance and stakeholder engagement, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Multi-stakeholder collaboration and context-specific approaches are essential to address regional disparities and promote sector-wide transformation. Strategies for improvement include strengthening monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, integrating emerging technologies, and aligning certification standards with broader sustainability goals.

It emphasizes sustainable development for both society and enterprises, incorporating ecological and environmental protection design principles from raw material sourcing to waste material recycling, thereby achieving optimized environmental outcomes through enhanced cooperation within and between organizations. In essence, green supply chain management practices encompass green design, green procurement, green manufacturing, green packaging, green materials usage, and green recycling initiatives. The critical distinction between a green supply chain and a traditional one lies in the former's consideration not only of optimizing and coordinating the supply chain under conventional economic cost constraints but also recognizing the negative impacts of economic activities on the environment as significant factors warranting investigation. By embedding environmental awareness into supply chain management processes, it seeks to achieve a balanced approach that harmonizes the economy with environmental concerns.

By using a Negative Binomial regression model and data from West Virginia community water systems in 2020, we find that water systems that purchase their water from other water systems, have more educated and experienced operators, and serve high-income areas and a higher percentage of Native residents are expected to issue more BWNs. On the other hand, water systems that are small and serve a higher percentage of rural, educated, employed residents are expected to issue fewer BWNs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the theoretical challenges posed by cryptocurrencies to central bank monetary supply management. With the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, traditional monetary systems and financial regulatory frameworks face unprecedented disruptions. Through literature review and theoretical analysis, this study systematically examines the fundamental characteristics and operational mechanisms of cryptocurrencies, and their potential impact on monetary policy. The analysis delves into the decentralization of cryptocurrencies and its challenge to the central bank's monopoly on currency issuance. Additionally, it evaluates how the anonymity and cross-border liquidity of cryptocurrencies disrupt monetary policy transmission, particularly in controlling money supply and interest rates. The study also reviews the regulatory policies of various countries and regions, assessing their effectiveness and limitations. The conclusion highlights that cryptocurrency present multifaceted challenges to central bank monetary supply management, affecting the efficacy of monetary policy, financial stability, and the adaptability of regulatory frameworks. To address these challenges, central banks must innovate in policy tools and regulatory measures, and enhance international cooperation to manage cross-border financial risks posed by cryptocurrencies. This research provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the impact of cryptocurrencies on traditional monetary systems and offers valuable insights for policymakers.</jats:p>"

In this study, we investigate the value relevance of customer firms’ sales information to suppliers’ investors using a large sample of monthly sales disclosures from U.S. retailers. We find that within the narrow window of retailers’ monthly sales disclosures, suppliers’ abnormal stock returns are positively related to retailers’ sales growth in both same-store sales and store numbers. This finding suggests that sales information has spillover effects, or externalities, along the supply chain. We further conduct cross-sectional tests and find that the externalities of sales information vary with a supplier’s dependence on the retailer. We also develop a prediction model to separate the expected and unexpected components of retailers’ sales information and find that the unexpected component of sales growth is the primary source of externalities. Overall, this study provides new insights into the value relevance of sales disclosures.</jats:p>"

Since the introduction of electricity in the 19th century, the supply of energy was often organized through agreements between producers and consumers that set the terms of supply. In the 20th century, universal energy supply systems were created in many countries, where energy supply contracts became standard and regulated by the state. In connection with the development of technology and the growth of competition, the terms of contracts have become more diverse, including fixed and variable prices, terms of delivery and payment. With increased attention to the problems of climate change, conditions aimed at stimulating the use of renewable energy sources appeared in energy supply contracts. The author analyzed the current legislation that regulates the conclusion of these contracts and the system of their validity. A conclusion was made about the importance and necessity of high-quality and timely energy supply for the Ukrainian people. Attention was drawn to the need to create backup power supply mechanisms in case of emergency, electricity payments in conditions of limited access to energy resources, as well as additional security measures to ensure the continuous operation of the power grid and power plants in the event of military threats. It was concluded that in the context of Ukraine, which has a complex energy system and dependence on energy imports, energy supply contracts play an important role in ensuring the stability and development of the country's energy sector. Analysis of the energy supply contract shows constant changes in the interaction between suppliers and consumers of energy, reflecting changes in technology, economics and energy policies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy storage is a foundational clean energy technology that can enable transformative technologies and lower carbon emissions, especially when paired with renewable energy. However, clean energy transition technologies need completely different supply chains than our current fuel-based supply chains. These technologies will instead require a material-based supply chain that extracts and processes massive amounts of minerals, especially critical minerals, which are classified by how essential they are for the modern economy. In order to develop, operate, and optimize the new material-based supply chain, new decision-making frameworks and tools are needed to design and navigate this new supply chain and ensure we have the materials we need to build the energy system of tomorrow. This work creates a flexible mathematical optimization framework for critical mineral supply chain analysis that, once provided with exogenously supplied projections for parameters such as demand, cost, and carbon intensity, can provide an efficient analysis of a mineral or critical mineral supply chain. To illustrate the capability of the framework, this work also conducts a case study investigating the global lithium supply chain needed for energy storage technologies like electric vehicles (EVs). The case study model explores the investment and operational decisions that a global central planner would consider in order to meet projected lithium demand in one scenario where the objective is to minimize cost and another scenario where the objective is to minimize CO2 emissions. The case study shows there is a 6% cost premium to reduce CO2 emissions by 2%. Furthermore, the CO2 Objective scenario invested in recycling capacity to reduce emissions, while the Cost Objective scenario did not. Lastly, this case study shows that even with a deterministic model and a global central planner, asset utilization is not perfect, and there is a substantial tradeoff between cost and emissions. Therefore, this framework—when expanded to less-idealized scenarios, like those focused on individual countries or regions or scenarios that optimize other important evaluation metrics—would yield even more impactful insights. However, even in its simplest form, as presented in this work, the framework illustrates its power to model, optimize, and illustrate the material-based supply chains needed for the clean energy technologies of tomorrow.</jats:p>"

The integration of a supply chain into port management for the purposes of tourism that is sustainable balanced can be used as a model for planning sustainable port development for tourism purposes. However, there are scarcely any studies on this topic, while plenty focus on the general concepts involved. To fill this gap, this article presents a model of a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard for ports. The author proposes a new approach to planning port development and supply chain management for tourism, particularity to provide recommendations and further our understandings of the relationships involved in the Sustainable Balanced Scorecard from the stakeholder perspective, the learning and growth perspective, the internal process perspective, the financial perspective and the environmental perspective. Using these five perspectives, the literature review identifies 56 indicators of 15 factors that can be used in the model. Therefore, this research helps to enhance and develop sustainable and efficient conditions in tourism while reducing future risks. Moreover, the research enables stakeholders to gain an understanding of and knowledge about the sustainable development and management of ports and for tourism. The insights can be applied in policy and strategy development according to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to accommodate social movement, environmental risk and economic inequality.</jats:p>"

This article presents a multidimensional cost-function-based analysis of the EWM framework structured on three modules - environmental, economic, and social uncertainties - which contemplate the 3 pillars of sustainability in an e-waste recycling plant, including the production-delivery-utilization process. The framework incorporates material recovery from a single e-waste facility provisioning for chemical and mechanical recycling. Each module is ranked using independent Machine Learning (ML) protocols: a) Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and b) combined AHP and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From a long list of possible contributors, the model identifies and ranks two key sustainability contributors to the EWM supply chain: overall energy consumption and volume of carbon dioxide generated. Another key finding is a precise time window for policy resurrection, which for the data considered, happens to be 400-600 days from the start of operation. Another interesting outcome is the quality of prediction using a combination of AHP and PCA, which consistently produced better results than any of these ML methods individually implemented. Model outcomes have been verified using a case study to outline a future E-waste sustained roadmap.</jats:p>"

This view fails to capture the complex patterns of interdependencies that instead characterize modern supply chains, preventing managers from properly understanding the underlying structure of their supply chains and the design of the most effective coordination mechanisms. We investigate this issue through the theoretical lens of complex adaptive systems. The supply chain is conceptualized as a complex adaptive ecosystem where autonomous firms belonging to value chains originally separated coevolve over time by changing their individual behaviours while carrying out interdependent activities and interacting with each other, fostered by common goals. The archetypes of linear chains, networks, intertwined networks, closed-loop chains, and circular chains are conceptualized by means of different patterns of interdependencies, defined by the number and distribution of interdependent activities within the system. The presence of interdependencies limits the decision-making autonomy of the single firms and requires them working together through collaborative relationships. The latter in fact permit the mutual exchange of information for common benefits. A simple, yet insightful, agent-based model is then developed to investigate the effectiveness of three information-sharing mechanisms: those developing through vertical, horizontal, and lateral collaborative relationships, across the different supply chain structures. The generalized NKC fitness framework is adopted to model the complex patterns of interdependencies. The results of simulations permit us to draw theoretical and practical contributions.</jats:p>"

The issues of improving material planning (forecasting) are currently quite relevant applied tasks in business, and are also of interest in terms of developing the theory of logistics and supply chain management. Among the approaches to planning the need for inventory, a wide range of statistical theory methods are used in practice, among which two large groups can be distinguished, such as one-parameter time series analysis models for goods of stable and relatively stable demand, as well as correlation and regression models for chaotic consumption stocks. Most of the goods sold to end consumers have a seasonal component, which may not always be explicitly expressed in statistics. However, due to change of seasons, regular fluctuations in the values of consumption from the warehouse, around the average chronological or trend, may necessitate regular recalculation of the main parameters of inventory management models, such as maximum, insurance, threshold inventory levels, etc. In addition, sales statistics may contain fluctuations of a higher order if the stocks sold have life cycles of interest in goods on the market, which can also be attributed to periodic or quasi-periodic processes. One of the methods to formalize such cyclic processes can be trigonometric approximation or harmonic analysis, when the values of a time series are represented as terms of a Fourier series (harmonics) having corresponding amplitudes and phases. The article compares the effectiveness (accuracy) of forecasts of inventory requirements made using harmonic analysis and traditional time series extrapolation methods.</jats:p>",

The article investigates the spatio-temporal propagation of disruption effects in supply networks using shipment data from an international retailer during the year of 2021, marked by various disruptions in the global shipping industry. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the blockage of the Suez Canal caused significant disruptions, including congestion and temporary shutdowns of ports. The network effect of such disruptions is measured as network connectivity using node strength in a weighted graph. Analysis of the data reveals a decrease in mean traveling speed and an unexpected decrease in speed variation following the Suez Canal blockage. The impact of the typhoon in China, while notable, was less significant than that of port closures due to COVID-19, likely due to its shorter duration. Evaluation of the spatio-temporal spread indicates, that port shutdowns due to COVID affected some routes from Asia to Europe and Australia, while others remained unaffected, potentially due to company-specific factors or differing supply patterns in various destinations. Future research aims to extend the analysis to include hinterland transportation to distribution centers and stores, where clearer spatio-temporal patterns may emerge, potentially confirmed through tests for spatio-temporal autocorrelation.\n                    </jats:p>"

It is revealed that the weakening of the state’s control functions led to an increase in embezzlement and theft in trade and public catering enterprises. The combination of reduced trade turnover and the rise in abuses within the supply system resulted in severe food shortages. Supply disruptions affected workers, officials, evacuated populations, children, and medical institutions. Various abuses are discussed, including food ration card counterfeiting, different forms of self-supply, and instances of double provisioning. Attention is given to violations in accounting for population groups and inflated supply norms. It is established that combating abuses in the supply system was complicated by the involvement of enterprise leaders, shop workers, accountants, and representatives of auditing bodies in criminal activities. The conclusion is drawn that despite numerous violations, the supply system only minimally provided essential food items to the population of Bashkortostan with interruptions and not in full.</jats:p>"

Climate-change-induced drought affects not only the natural hydrology of the broad macroclimate but also those in the urban microclimates. The increasing frequency and duration of droughts are creating challenges for urban water utilities to convey water through distribution systems to customers reliably and consistently. This has led many urban areas like San Francisco, California, to search for unique alternative water supply projects to help bolster the drought resilience of the coupled human and natural water system. This paper focuses on applying the features of resilience (i.e., plan, adapt, absorb, and recover) through a drought resilience matrix to water supply alternatives to analyze how the addition of these projects would increase the overall water system’s drought resilience. San Francisco, California, was used as the case study to test the use of this matrix. Three portfolios (modifying existing supply, recycling, and desalination, as well as local approaches) were created and tested in the matrix. Each portfolio is composed of various alternative water supply projects that the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) is considering for implementation. Results concluded that the local approaches portfolio provided the most drought resilience, with the recycling and desalination portfolio providing the least resilience. The study approach and the presented findings will provide guidance to water utility professionals in supply planning to enhance drought resilience.</jats:p>"

A set system's disparity in its classical form has been shown to be bound in certain situations. Though they may not hold for other types of discrepancy, no mathematician has been able to produce an example that defies these limits as of yet. Due to the large number of set systems (kmn for m sets and n elements, each choosing one of k possible values), it is not viable to use traditional techniques, such as human reasoning or computer brute forcing, to identify the few set systems with a significant discrepancy. However, in a 2021 preprint, Adam Zsolt Wagner shows how the deep cross-entropy method—a popular Neural Network (NNs)-based Reinforcement-Learning (RL) technique—could effectively find examples that disprove open conjectures in two other combinatorial subfields: pattern avoidance and graph theory. Therefore, in light of these encouraging findings, we wondered if Wagner's method could help us find examples that defy the upper bound of discrepancy variations. To start answering this question, we examined whether Wagner's approach might be extended to find set systems that exhibit significant inconsistencies, either as classical or variant (prefix and fractional in our instance) systems. Our findings could help approximation algorithms, which employ discrepancy theory to tackle certain problems, as well as discrepancy theory itself.</jats:p>"

I study how increased local control affects housing production by exploiting a common electoral reform—changing from “at-large” to “ward” elections for town council. These reforms, which are not typically motivated by housing markets, shrink each representative’s constituency from the entire town to one ward. Results from a variety of difference-in-differences estimators show that this decentralization decreases housing units permitted by 20%, with similar effects on multi- and single-family permits. Effects are larger in whiter and higher-income towns.</jats:p>",

They show that this trade-off can be balanced by waiting a short amount of time before making matches: long enough to gather enough agents to make valuable matches but not so long that impatient agents are likely to leave. Intuitively, this balance depends on how long agents are willing to wait, on average, but the authors show that it also depends on the full distribution of the willingness to wait (i.e., not only mean, but also variance and higher moments play a role). Thus, approaches that only take into account the mean willingness to wait may perform quite poorly. Further, the authors develop an algorithm to rank matching priorities in order to achieve an optimized trade-off between speed and value of matches. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Benchmark models taught in undergraduate macro do not attribute any role for labor supply as an important determinant of macroeconomic outcomes. The first part of this paper documents three facts. First, differences in hours of work across OECD economies are large and imply large differences in GDP per capita. Second, there are large differences in the size of tax and transfer programs across countries, as proxied by differences in government revenues relative to the GDP. Third, these two outcomes are strongly negatively correlated. Taken together, these facts suggest an important role for labor supply in affecting macroeconomic outcomes. I conjecture that the reason why macro textbooks do not include a discussion of labor supply stems from a belief that labor supply elasticities are sufficiently small that even large differences in work incentives do not generate important macroeconomic effects. The second part of this paper argues that this belief is based on incorrect inference linking small elasticities for prime age male to small aggregate labor supply elasticities. The role of labor supply at the extensive margin plays a critical role in understanding this mistake in this inference.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Sales forecasting plays a crucial role in inventory optimization for retail stores, especially during special events such as promotions, advertisements, holiday season, weather, social and economic situations etc. These events drive significant changes in customer buying patterns. Some of these events are captured in the current forecasting models as part of trend, seasonality, and cyclicality. But many times, unexpected local events such as extreme weather conditions, riots, and regional events such as marathons, concerts have a significant impact on sales surges which are usually not captured in the sales forecast. This leads to inventory being out of stock and store managers placing last-minute manual orders. By accurately predicting these sales pattern changes, retailers can make informed decisions, ensuring optimal inventory levels and maximizing profits.\r\nMethodology: In this paper, a data-driven solution was discussed that leverages machine learning models to predict sales pattern changes and surges during local events in a specific geographical location. Web scraping can be used to gather data on local events from a range of online sources, including Google News, local news channels, and social media platforms. By extracting pertinent details about upcoming events, it is possible to compile a thorough database of local happenings.\r\nFindings: Data Analysis of historical sales data mapped to its local events can provide insights on key department-categories where there is a surge in sales. Machine learning models can be used to analyze, experiment and train historical sales data in conjunction with the events data.\r\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Machine learning models would be trained to capture the complex relationships between different local events and their impact on sales. Therefore the study recommends using the machine learning approaches specified to consider various factors, such as event type, location, duration, and historical sales patterns, our models can effectively predict sales fluctuations during specific events.</jats:p>"

Their nonlinear nature harms the operation of the lines, as the line voltage is distorted from a sine wave, which causes disturbances in the operation of other loads. This study proposes a method of active parallel compensation that can be realised using a power supply. The proposed device is a dual-function system: it supplies the load connected to its DC link, and operates as a parallel active filter. This kind of device, with a relatively low value of the rated output power, could be implemented in electrical systems to provide distributed compensation. The second novel aspect of this work is the use of a tunable inductive filter, which is included at the input of the power electronics controlled current source and forms a main part of the power supply. The use of this tunable inductive filter increases the frequency response of the current source, while at the same time, in the quasi-steady state of power supply operation, the pulse modulation component of the input current source remains at a minimum level. This paper discusses the structure of an electrical system with the proposed power supply and the rules of operation for the system, and presents test results based on both a simulation and a laboratory model of the system.</jats:p>"

Firstly, three cooperation strategy models were constructed for the battery supplier and the EV manufacturers, namely: Strategy N (neither the battery supplier nor the two manufacturers cooperate with each other); Strategy I (M1 cooperates with the battery supplier); and Strategy II (M2 cooperates with the battery supplier). Then, the Stackelberg solution method was used to obtain the optimal equilibrium decisions under the three strategic models. Finally, the effect of the preference coefficient of consumers for leasing EVs per unit on the optimal equilibrium decision was analyzed. We found that: (1) The wholesale price of batteries provided by the battery supplier to M1 is always greater than to M2. (2) Strategies I and II prompt M1 and M2 to reduce the unit and fixed rental prices of EVs to some extent, while intensifying the competition between the two manufacturers in terms of EV lease prices. (3) When the consumer preference coefficient (θ) for leasing EVs per unit provided by manufacturer M1 is relatively small, the cooperation alliance S2 and the supply chain achieve the maximum profit under Strategy II; however, while θ is large, M1, cooperative alliance S1, and the entire supply chain could benefit the most under Strategy I.</jats:p>"

Applying the water quality footprint method, we determined that 30 to 610 m<sup>3</sup> of virtual dilution water per electric car would be needed to reduce arsenic pollution below natural background levels. This single mine's water quality footprint constitutes up to 0.3 % of Morocco's annual water availability, concerning all electric cars produced annually with cobalt from this mine, and corresponds to the full annual capacity of one seawater desalination plant. This underscores the risk of problem shifting with climate-friendly technologies, prompts reflection on due diligence in supply chains under German and upcoming European legislation and highlights the shared responsibility of industry, society and politics.</p>"

First, the article examines improvements in London in the first decades of the 1900s. Then, it explores the water schemes of two organizations: the London County Council in the 1890s and the Metropolitan Water Board in the 1900s up to the 1910s. The LCC’s schemes were deeply entangled with the Fabian Society, of which Shaw was a lifelong member. Examining the LCC’s proposals for water municipalization, this article argues that Shaw imbued Pygmalion with social criticism. With his descriptions of the short supply of water in Eliza’s lodgings, which resulted in her unhygienic body and clothing, Shaw ironically dramatized the problematic boundaries of class and gender identity in a social order commonly regarded as natural and even genuine.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\"Supply Chain Management Practices and Firm Performances\" encompasses a critical nexus in contemporary business operations. This introductory passage seeks to elucidate the pivotal role supply chain management plays in enhancing organizational performance and competitiveness.  Supply chain management, as a strategic discipline, pertains to the orchestration of interconnected activities involved in the flow of goods, services, information, and finances from raw material suppliers to end consumers. It encompasses a spectrum of functions including procurement, production, logistics, distribution, and customer service.  At the heart of supply chain management lies the imperative of synchronization and integration. Firms that adeptly synchronize their supply chain activities achieve operational efficiencies, reduced costs, improved responsiveness, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the purpose of improve the sustainability of products sold in the EU, Digital Product Passports is a mandatory solution. These passports would systematically gather information about products, such as detailing the materials involved to aid recycling and remanufacturing efforts, or recording the emissions produced throughout the manufacturing process. The overall goal is the establishment of a circular economy in the EU. Current research on Digital Product Passports is focused on collating content for sector-specific applications. However, achieving sustainability goals through Digital Product Passports will require new methods and technical solutions for digital collaboration between supply chain participants, especially in the manufacturing sector. Collaborative work on Digital Product Passports requires trust and traceability in data and access management to ensure privacy over the data contained. One way to enable this securely and confidentially is through the use of blockchain technology, in which stored data cannot be concealed, which is key to the traceability of digital product data documentation. This paper therefore presents a concept for the implementation of generically applicable cross-industry blockchain-based digital product passports. To this end, generic supply chain processes have been abstracted and condensed into the architecture of smart contracts. Great attention is paid to the establishment of traceability as well as privacy through the selection of the blockchain technology Secret Network in combination with Gaia-X functionalities. An illustrative use case for digital product passports in manufacturing is used to  demonstrate the applicability of the presented concept. In this use case information about the digital nameplate and carbon footprint is exchanged securely and confidentially in a multi-tenant supply chain network based on the Industry 4.0 infomation model of the Asset Administration Shell. </jats:p>"

Great threats to the resilience of supply chains, which occur at time intervals, are labelled in literature as health crises. The appearance of diseases, due to their nature may cause epidemics and pandemics’, which can greatly endanger stability and lead to interruptions in supply chain processes. A major problem cited in literature concerning the specifics of such situations relates to the limited ability to predict both the causes and consequences of such actions. Due to that, it is difficult to manage crisis situations, and as a logical consequence, there are immeasurable negative effects. The aim of this paper is to examine the negative effects of various epidemics and pandemics on production in the automotive industry. The analyses were employed with the aim of defining the extent to which an epidemic and a pandemic disrupt production activities in supply chains. In addition, it is important to consider the characteristic of viruses, as well as the differences in the average values of production in the years when the crisis occurred. In order to analyse the hypotheses, the authors used Wilcoxon’s test to check the statistical significance of changes in production levels. To examine the significance of the difference in average changes in production for the duration of the epidemics and the pandemics, the authors used Friedman’s test in SPSS.</jats:p>"

However, inclusion of variable speed pumps (VSPs) in MILP pump scheduling frameworks has not been given adequate treatment. This article addresses this gap by describing a methodology for formulating and solving optimal pump scheduling problems with VSPs using MILP and piece-linear approximations of network components. The methodology proceeds in four steps: (a) WDN simulation with initial pump schedule(s), (b) approximation of network components, including VSP, using linear and piece-linear functions around the chosen operating points, (c) formulation of a fully parameterised mixed integer linear programme, and (d) solution of the optimisation problem and WDN simulation with optimal pump schedule(s). The methodology is coded in MATLAB/OCTAVE and Python and is publicly available on GitHub. It was applied to solve a pump scheduling problem on a two variable speed pump single-tank network that allows the reader to easily understand how the methodology works and how it is applied in practice. The results show that the formulation is robust and the optimiser is able to return a globally optimal solution for a range of operating points.</jats:p>",

Specifically, this study establishes an e-commerce closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an e-commerce platform, and divides the recycling model into recycling by the manufacturer or recycling by the platform. Considering two common sales models in e-commerce platforms: the resale model and agency model, combined with the recycling model, four different research scenarios are formed. We use backward induction to solve the Stackelberg game problem and explore the remanufacturing and channel strategies of the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform. The research results show that for the manufacturer, under the same recycling model, when consumers’ preference for remanufactured products and the sensitivity of recycling volume to recycling prices are low, he will prefer the resale model. Under the same sales model, the manufacturer always prefers the recycling model in which he is responsible for recycling. However, the choice of platform is contrary to that of the manufacturer. In the resale model, both the manufacturer and the platform will choose to recycle by themselves, which cannot achieve a win-win situation. Under the agency model, when consumers’ preference for remanufactured products is high and the sensitivity coefficient of recycling volume to recycling price is low, supply chain members can achieve a win-win situation, and the scope of the win-win situation decreases as the unit production cost of new products increases. In addition, rising consumer preference for remanufactured products will lead to lower consumer surplus.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Conventional traceability systems in Cambodian agriculture, such as Rubber Supply Chain Management (RSCM), often struggle to provide timely data and fair market prices, leading to mistrust among stakeholders, exploitation by intermediaries, and hindering progress towards ethical sourcing and sustainable practices. This research aims to showcase the potential of integrating blockchain technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and Differential Privacy (DP) methods to empower Cambodian rubber farmers. By enhancing transparency, facilitating fair pricing, and promoting sustainable methods in the rubber industry, this integrated approach leverages Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) to create a decentralized and secure system for tracking rubber from its source to the end consumer. Integration with IPFS ensures secure and easily accessible data storage, further enhancing the system’s reliability. Additionally, the implementation of differential privacy techniques safeguards confidential data during information sharing among farmers and supply chain stakeholders, minimizing potential privacy concerns. This comprehensive system encourages consumers to make ethical and sustainable alternative options by providing accessible information on harvesting methods, processing procedures, labor conditions, and environmental impacts. The potential benefits extend beyond Cambodia, serving as a model for other developing countries aiming to modernize and enhance the agricultural distribution networks. Our results show that transaction send rates (TPS) and throughput in systems with and without differential privacy grow with increased transaction volumes. However, the system without differential privacy achieves greater scalability and efficiency above a certain threshold. However, it offers a slightly reduced latency, reflecting a trade-off between privacy and performance efficiency in blockchain-based agricultural traceability systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Pharmaceutical supply chains involve multiple stakeholders at various stages, beginning with the API source, moving on to the medication manufacturer, packaging and distribution firms, administrative regulators, hospitals, pharmacies, and finally the patient. Because of the difficulty in tracking and ensuring authenticity, counterfeit drugs are more likely to penetrate the distribution system. Increasing counterfeit medicinal products in the markets are putting a potential threat to pharmaceutical supply chain and to life of innocent people. There is a need of technology that could provide privacy, trust, transparency, security, authorization, and authentication to the clients and show proof of origin of products. Due to significant qualities such as decentralisation, transparency, a trust-free environment, anonymity, and immutability, blockchain-based drug traceability provides a viable answer to this problem. Blockchain technology provides an efficient and cost-effective option for improving various drug traceability functions and procedures to assure appropriate identification. There are many other ways that blockchain is being used in the pharmaceutical industry, including the packaging and supply chain functions. This paper describes the challenges in pharmaceutical supply chain and how the blockchain combined with pharmaceutical supply chain can be a problem solver. We also provide a blockchain architectures for product traceability in the pharmaceutical supply chain system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Companies that are investing in blockchain technology to enhance supply chain transparency face challenges in fostering collaborations with others and deciding what information to share. Transparency over the actions of supply chain partners can improve operational decisions, but sharing own data on the blockchain can put firms at a competitive disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the resulting questions of when blockchain should be adopted in a supply chain and how it should be designed by analyzing two ways that it can enhance supply chain transparency: making the manufacturer’s sourcing cost transparent to the buyers (i.e., vertical cost transparency) and making the ordering status of buyers transparent to each other (i.e., horizontal order transparency). Given such transparency, firms can design a smart contract that automates transactions contingent on the revealed information and enables them to realize better equilibrium outcomes. We find that blockchain increases supply chain profit only when the manufacturer’s capacity is large and decreases supply chain profit otherwise. If the capacity is sufficiently large to eliminate the buyers’ competition, blockchain leads to a win–win–win and the incentives of all participants are naturally aligned. If the capacity is only moderately large, the manufacturer needs to compensate the buyers to facilitate a blockchain implementation. However, if the capacity is small, horizontal order transparency enabled by the blockchain mitigates the buyers’ overorder incentive to compete for the manufacturer’s capacity and increases double marginalization. For such cases, we show that a blockchain that only enables vertical cost transparency should (and can) still be adopted in a range of small capacity cases, and we propose an access control layer for the logistics data to implement such a blockchain. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: J.

However, there is no mention of the contract for the supply of energy and other resources through an attached network in the list of contractual obligations that do not correspond to the modern dynamics of contractual relations. Therefore, it is evident that the investigated contractual structure will remain in the updated version of the Civil Code of Ukraine as one of the types of purchase and sale agreements.\r\nThe application of general provisions on the contract of sale to the contract for the supply of energy and other resources through an attached network is fundamental for determining the legal nature of this contract and its civil regulation. The classification of the contract for the supply of energy and other resources through an attached network as contracts for the transfer of property, namely the contract of sale, is due to the fact that under this contract, goods are transferred from one party to another.\r\nHowever, the contract for the supply of energy and other resources through an attached network has several features that allow it to be identified as an independent type of purchase and sale agreement. Firstly, the subject matter of the contract is electrical or thermal energy, gas, or other resources. Secondly, the method of contract performance - continuous transfer of energy and other resources to the consumer is carried out only through the attached network. Thirdly, the transfer of energy resources entails a range of rights and obligations of the parties to the contract, which are not characteristic of other types of purchase and sale agreements.</jats:p>"

The focus on this document will be twofold: Firstly, the current critical lack of qualified deck and engineer officers and how this can be rectified. The lack of domestic training has recently been identified by both Maritime Industry Australia Ltd and Australian Resources &amp; Energy Employer Association as being at a crisis point. Secondly, the lack of an Australian strategic fleet (including a viable Australian International Shipping Register (AISR)) and the consequent vulnerability of our critical maritime export and import supply chains. We believe that both these theme items are mutually dependent and are in urgent need of the attention of both the wider energy export industry and Federal and State Governments.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates pricing decisions within a dual-channel green supply chain framework while considering the capital constraints faced by risk-averse manufacturer. Simultaneously, the impact of the degree of risk aversion, consumer green preferences, and channel preferences on the optimal decision-making process of green supply chain members is analyzed. We address the issue of financial constraints faced by manufacturer through bank loans and trade credit financing and compare the two cases. Our findings illustrate that trade credit financing outperforms bank loan financing in the dual-channel green supply chain. Moreover, pricing decisions under different models are influenced by consumer preferences and risk aversion. Specifically, the greenness of the product, wholesale price, and sale price exhibit negative correlations with manufacturers' risk aversion but positive correlations with consumer preferences.</jats:p>"

Setting by trial and error requires considerable time which could invite more labour-level exercise. This study addresses the issue of unequal water distribution to elevated service tanks (ESTs). It is possible to achieve an optimal valve loss coefficient, which ensures equal water supply to all ESTs. Throttle and control valves play a crucial role in regulating the flow rate and pressure of water. An optimization framework for the valve setting coefficient is proposed. The genetic algorithm is used as an optimization model and hydraulic simulation is performed using EPANET 2.0 software through its toolkits. The proposed model is applied to a hypothetical system and illustrated. The obtained valve setting coefficients make equitable distribution of water to all the ESTs.</jats:p>",

However, the empirical literature shows these investments have not been effective enough in supporting British working mothers; this becomes even more complex in a context where different sources of informal childcare are available. In this scenario, the UK appears as an ideal case study, since it is the country where mothers present the highest preference for informal kinds of childcare among the OECD members (OECD, 2016). We use data from the UK’s Family and Children Study to investigate the determinants of mothers’ preferences for formal childcare and labour supply, whilst also considering the availability of informal childcare. Our results highlight the positive influence, for British mothers, that the use of informal childcare has on their joint decision on labour supply and formal childcare choices. Furthermore, our results show that British married mothers conciliate formal and informal childcare arrangements as complements rather than substitutes.</p>"

The paper explores supply chain management concepts, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, and smart contracts in the context of their integration into supply chains to increase traceability, transparency, and accountability with faster processing times. After investigating these technologies’ applications and potential use cases, a framework for smart contract implementation for supply chain management is constructed. Potential data models and functions of a smart contract implementation improving supply chain management processes are discussed. After constructing a framework, the effects of the proposed system on supply chain processes are explained. The proposed framework increases the reliability of the supply chain history due to the usage of DLT (distributed ledger technology). It utilizes smart contracts to increase the manageability and traceability of the supply chain. The proposed framework also eliminates the SPoF (Single Point of Failure) vulnerabilities and external alteration of the transactional data. However, due to the ever-changing and variable nature of the supply chains, the proposed architecture might not be a one-size-fits-all solution, and tailor-made solutions might be necessary for different supply chain management implementations.</jats:p>"

Traditional approaches have predominantly concentrated on minimizing expenses and improving operational efficiency, often resulting in linear and compartmentalized processes that exhibit limited flexibility and responsiveness. Among the primary challenges are disruptions instigated by global occurrences, escalating consumer expectations for rapidity and customization, and the complexities associated with managing a diverse array of suppliers. Additionally, reliance on historical data for forecasting purposes may yield inaccurate predictions, exacerbating issues related to inventory management. Contemporary perspectives advocate for the adoption of integrated and agile systems that employ technological advancements, including sophisticated analytics and real-time data, to enhance decision-making and foster collaboration. By emphasizing sustainability and risk management, modern SCM frameworks aim to cultivate resilient supply chains capable of swiftly adapting to fluctuating market conditions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The traditional food supply chain is a complex network of interconnected entities whose function is to supply consumers with enough health-safe products, i.e. enough food with optimization of production and distribution. In the previous period, the traditional supply chain has faced numerous challenges and problems. Globalization, climate change, changes in living standards and consumer preferences, limited natural resources (agricultural land and water), growth in the amount of food and packaging waste, as well as food insecurity led to creation of numerous national and international regulations and agendas related to environmental protection. Those regulations and agendas influence various business philosophies, including the philosophy of food supply chain management. With its focus on optimizing production and distribution of food, the traditional supply chain cannot meet the international regulations' requirements. Because of that it was necessary to go in the direction of greening the activities of the traditional supply chain, i.e. in the direction of defining the concept of a green food supply chain. The concept of a green food supply chain represents an improved, wider concept of a traditional food supply chain that, apart from standard activities, agricultural production, processing and distribution of products, also includes additional activities such as green procurement, green product design and reverse logistics. Therefore, bearing in mind that in the future food should be produced and distributed in a way that pollutes the environment as little as possible, the aim of the research is an analysis of the importance of the green supply chain concept in food production and distribution. Considering the defined goal, the literature review method was used with a focus on the Scopus database. The results of the research indicated that due to the complexity and frequent changes of regulations in practice, the green supply chain concept is still not sufficiently applied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to fill the gap in existing research by examining the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain management, particularly its ability to retrospectively trace events in the chain. For example, in pharmaceuticals, blockchain automatically records information like expiration dates, reducing the need for human involvement. By implementing this backward technology, we've simplified processes for suppliers and manufacturers, allowing the system to identify defective or expired items autonomously, saving time and costs. Previously, the supply chain operated as a one-way system without return options, but now, with blockchain integration, relevant parties are informed about necessary replacements from the manufacturer's end.     Blockchain's integration into supply chain management is a significant advancement, offering unparalleled transparency, traceability, and security in logistics and distribution. This article explores how blockchain can revolutionize established supply chain practices, delving into applications like tracing goods from origin to destination, using smart contracts for automated agreements, and secure data exchange while protecting privacy. Case studies highlight advantages such as reduced expenses, risks, and improved compliance.     Blockchain, as a decentralized ledger system, provides instant, unchangeable record-keeping and cryptographic validation, instilling confidence among stakeholders. In supply chain management, this means identifiable product origins, better tracking, less fraud, and quicker dispute resolution. However, challenges like scalability, energy use, and network interoperability exist, underscoring the need for industry collaboration and standardization efforts</jats:p>"

It applies MRL management costs and operations to analyze and integrate with the academic literature on ESG frameworks and supply chain management. It concludes with three points: Environmental management issues affect the delivery of minerals downstream in the supply chain, and an EMS system should be applied to manage them dynamically. Community cooperation and employment equity issues affect the cooperation and operation of mining businesses upstream of the supply chain, so the Community Engagement and Development Program (CEDP) system should be adopted to maintain community communication. Non-transparent governance issues affect both upstream operations and shake downstream investors' confidence. The Governance Enhancement and Compliance Programme (GECP) system can enhance decision-making transparency and compliance with governance policies. This research bridges the gap in negative ESG impacts on the mining industry. It proposes three new systems that serve as a model for future company adoption to cater to ESG standards.</jats:p>"

Presently,\n  there is a concerted effort towards energy conservation. This\n  technical report focuses on the future development of the TPS-II\n  Permanent Magnet Trim Coil Power Supply for the correction magnet,\n  emphasizing a Bipole high-current correction magnet power\n  source. According to the prototype specifications, the maximum\n  output current is 20 A with an operating voltage of 48 V. This\n  augmentation increases the amplitude of the magnetic field\n  correction in the permanent magnet-associated Trim core, providing\n  greater flexibility in manufacturing the permanent magnet correction\n  coils. To design a power supply with high current and stability, the\n  system adopts the Danisense DP50-IP-B DC Current Transducers (DCCT)\n  as the current feedback component and Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor\n  Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) as power switches in a\n  full-bridge (H-bridge) configuration.

In the power\n  laboratory, a hardware prototype circuit was constructed, featuring\n  a 48 V input voltage, 20 A output current, a maximum power of\n  960W, and a current ripple component maintained within\n  100 μA. This experiment validates the control loop design of\n  the prototype, showcasing the ability to achieve rapid and stable\n  output current performance. Using a 1 V input reference signal for\n  small-signal testing, the bandwidth displayed a -3 dB bandwidth\n  of 8.51 kHz. Long-term current stability is within ± 10 ppm,\n  and interface compatibility with the existing TPS correction magnet\n  power source interface allows direct operation within the current\n  system.</jats:p>",

To address this issue, we developed a small, lightweight device that utilizes a photovoltaic power supply to eliminate the need for wires and allow for seamless monitoring of physical fitness signals. The device can be attached to a player's clothing or equipment, and the energy generated from the photovoltaic power supply is used to power the device and collect data. We conducted a pilot study with professional basketball players and found that our method provided accurate and reliable measurements of physical fitness signals.

We calibrate and simulate the model using the trend rise in relative skill supply in the U.S. over two decades starting in the early 1970s. The transitional dynamics of the model show (i) an initial slump and long-run rise in the relative wage of high-skill labour and (ii) a long-run rise in the relative level of unemployment of low-skill versus high-skill labour. An increase in the number of skilled individuals reduces hiring costs and increases the incentive for firms to engage in the costly adoption of a new GPT. Stronger labour market rigidity and higher worker bargaining power are shown to have similar effects on relative wages and unemployment: changes in relative wages are more pronounced, whereas the response of relative unemployment is muted. The exact opposite effects are found in the case of a higher degree of substitution between products.</jats:p>",

The prefabricated construction supply chain has gained prominence despite its complexity, unpredictability, and risk. In the event of an emergency or other disruption, the supply chain's stability and continuity are seriously jeopardized. Improving the resilience of prefabricated building supply chains can help enterprises quickly recover and maintain their stability and sustainable operation through methods such as resource restructuring, strategy optimization, and flexible organization in case of emergencies that may cause drastic changes in the supply chain. Using a thorough collection and arrangement of pertinent domestic and international literature, this article employs the literature analysis method as its primary research approach and methodically reviews the theoretical framework and research progress of the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain. On this basis, this study examined a number of additional variables that affect supply chain resilience, including logistics capability, production and research and development, adaptability, risk management, and informatization. Targeted optimization strategies and suggestions were also proposed. These accomplishments have a significant impact on improving the supply chains for prefabricated buildings' resilience and the sector's capacity to handle risks. To sum up, this research offers both theoretical backing and useful recommendations for enhancing the robustness of supply chains for prefabricated buildings, thereby contributing to the industry's growth.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In local and globalized markets, warehouses are crucial supply chain nodes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of warehousing on supply chain performance: A case of Inyange Industries Ltd. The goals were to evaluate how inventory management, warehouse capacity building, and material handling affects supply chain performance in Inyange Industries Ltd. This research experimented with three different theories: Just-in-time, Lean, and Triple-A supply chain. The population of this study were 105 staff members of Inyange Industries Ltd. Therefore, census was conducted because the population size is affordable and the researcher can be able to contact all the respondents. Quantitative data were analyzed using inferential research methodology in this study. Questionnaires were used to gather primary  data, which was then analyzed. Data analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and descriptive and inferential statistics were used to show the study's results. According to the research, supply chain performance is positively and significantly affected by both automated and manual material handling. Mechanical material handling, on the other hand, improves supply chain performance, but not much. Inyange Industries' supply chain performance is influenced by the material handling systems to the tune of 19.3%, as shown by the modified R2 value of 0.193.  According to the research, supply chain performance is positively and significantly affected by inventory counts, warehouse management systems, and inventory organization. A 0.967 adjusted R^2 value suggests that 96.7% of the variation in Inyange Industries' supply chain performance is explained by the inventory management techniques. According to the research, supply chain effectiveness is positively and significantly impacted by warehouse demand planning, design, and management. Warehouse capacity planning techniques at Inyange Industries account for 95.4% of the variation in supply chain performance, as shown by the modified R2 value of 0.954. The research concluded that material handling, inventory management, and warehouse capacity planning are all important warehouse management measures that significantly impact supply chain performance for the better. The methods used by Inyange Industries Ltd. for managing their warehouses have resulted in an improvement in supply chain performance of 87.2%.  The regression coefficients, supported by their t-test values and Beta coefficients, highlight both the significance and strength of relationships between independent and dependent variables. Material Handling demonstrated the greatest impact (β1=0.532, t=8.556, p=0.000), followed by Inventory Management (β2=0.379, t=6.147, p=0.000), and Warehouse Capacity Planning (β3=0.172, t=3.268, p=0.002), emphasizing their respective contributions to Supply Chain Performance of Inyange Industries Ltd.'s supply chain. This proved that material handling in warehouse management has a major influence on supply chain performance. Because the p-value was lower than 5%, we may say that the association is statistically significant. The research concluded that both automated and human material handling should get additional funding. To maximize efficiency in stock-taking as well. Previous studies have looked at a variety of organizational factors that affect performance of supply chains. To further understand how warehouse management strategies affect overall performance, more research is needed.</jats:p>"

It utilizes data from a global sample of 53 countries spanning the years 2000 to 2019. The findings from various levels of analysis reveal several key insights: first, Australia or Cameroon should allocate all their food resources to enhance the capacity utilization of their Food Supply Chains (FSC). Second, Ghana or New Zealand may concentrate 100% of their resources on improving the Responsiveness of their FSC. Third, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States should allocate 100% of their food resources to adjust resource allocation within their FSC. Fourth, for countries like Costa Rica and Canada, the allocation should be 19% to capacity utilization and 81% to resource allocation. Fifth, countries such as Cyprus, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and El Salvador should prioritize 12% of inputs for resilience and allocate the remaining 88% to resource allocation. Sixth, for countries like Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea, Serbia, Senegal, and Singapore, the allocation should be 28% of inputs to responsiveness, with the majority, 72%, directed to resource allocation. Sixth, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Ghana have better performance across critical variables. This study introduces an innovative framework that facilitates the interaction of agri‐food supply chains with various macroeconomic variables, including GDP, inflation, corruption, food security, and nutrition, opening new avenues for a holistic understanding of these systems.</jats:p>",

The second approach was dynamic management based on applying Real-Time Control (RTC) techniques to scenario SC1 and scenario SC2 denoted as RTC-1 and RTC-2, respectively. The dynamic management of the UCT dam with RTC-1 and RTC-2 approaches increase yield by 2.1 and 1.1 ml, respectively. Additionally, RTC-1 and RTC-2 approaches increase volumetric reliability by 5.3 and 2.5%, respectively, while maintaining the required level of service of a stormwater harvesting system. SC1 and SC2 results in water savings of up to 21.15 and 21.45 ZAR/kl, respectively, while RTC-1 and RTC-2 could save up to 19.35 and 19.45 ZAR/kl. Thus, static configurations results in water savings approximately 9% in comparison to RTC. In addition, static configurations harvested stormwater at a relatively lowest unit cost in comparison to RTC configurations. Notwithstanding this finding, the RTC system exhibits a great potential in reshaping the stormwater harvesting system to simultaneously deliver water conservation and stormwater management.</jats:p>",

This situation implies more electricity consumption and more challenges to railway operation stability. Therefore, this research suggests configuring wind energy integration with the current railway traction substations built on the current traction substation. The suggested setup consists of a converter that converts DC to DC with RBFN-based MPPT regulator wind energy source linked to a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a rectifier, and a conventional traction system. The proposed system is modelled and analyzed by utilizing a radial basis function network (RBFN) in this study. Three traction substations: Aysha, Adegla and Dewanle:-are the subject of the case study, which integrates wind energy with the railway electric power system working at 25 kV AC. For the Aysha wind farm, a MATLAB/Simulink simulation is run in order to confirm the suggested technology. The setup with or without MPPT was used in order to evaluate the results. The proposed system produces an average output of 260.3kW without MPPT and 289.3kW with MPPT controller at wind speed of 20m/sec. The simulation findings suggest that the RBFN-based control method performs better under diverse wind conditions and is more suited for wind energy integration with traction system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Efficiency in the supply chain has become very important for companies in the era of increasingly fierce business competition. This has encouraged some companies to start implementing the concept of collaboration between companies or commonly called horizontal cooperation. Horizontal cooperation is important because companies need to work together to manage complex supply chains. To manage production in a collaborative supply chain requires designing a cost-effective model. The design of this model is expected to optimise inventory costs to achieve common goals in horizontal cooperation. This model is a form of linear programme consisting of objective function and constraint function. The objective function is to minimise the inventory cost in a four-tier supply chain with horizontal cooperation on post-production final storage at the production level only. The model was tested with 3 suppliers, 3 materials, 3 factories, 4 products, 3 distributors, and 3 consumers. The model with horizontal cooperation resulted in a total inventory cost of 1,349,830. This amount is 8% lower than the total inventory cost without horizontal cooperation. Thus, horizontal cooperation in the supply chain drastically reduces inventory costs throughout the supply chain.</jats:p>"

A state-owned enterprise (SOE) is entrusted with the provision of electrical energy across Indonesia. The objective of this study is to identify and assess risk factors within the supply chain of primary distribution materials at SOE. The identification of risk factors was based on a comprehensive review of literature across various industrial sectors, further validated through consultations with senior managers at the company. For the assessment of these risks, the study employed the modified Decision Matrix Risk Assessment methodology, which involves evaluating risks based on their likelihood and impact. This evaluation was conducted through surveys distributed to 66 respondents, including planning managers, distribution managers, and commercial managers across all regional and distribution main units in Indonesia. Two risk categories with five sub-categories and a total of 27 risk factors were identified. Supply-related risks are the most significant compared to the other four sub-categories. Scarcity of raw materials, lack of capacity flexibility, and failure to make delivery requirements are in the top three rankings. This research can enrich the supply chain risk literature and provide valuable insights for utility managers in understanding supply chain risks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To regulate the growth of battery-based electric vehicles (BEVs) in Indonesia and mitigate their impact on the power grid&amp;#039;s supply-demand balance, the government can adjust BEV regulations and offer subsidies. The Jawa-Madura-Bali (Jamali) electrical system, being the largest in Indonesia [1], faces the challenge of accommodating the increasing number of vehicles [2]. Subsequent to analyzing Jamali&amp;#039;s electricity supply using data from the National Electricity Company (RUPTL) [3], simulations are constructed to model the grid&amp;#039;s demand side. Input variables such as Jamali&amp;#039;s population, internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicle populations, initial charging time (ICT), slow- and fast-charging ratios, and BEV charge load curves are simulated. Scenario variables like supply capacity growth speed, vehicle population growth speed, subsidy impact on EV attractiveness, ICT, and fast-charging ratio are subsequently simulated for 2024-2029. Four key simulation outcomes are identified: the best-case scenario (Scenario 1776), achieves the highest EV growth with minimal grid disruption, resulting in a 45.38% EV percentage in 2029 and requiring an annual allocation of 492 billion rupiah to match supply with demand. The worst outcome scenario leads to a 23.12% EV percentage, necessitating 47.566 billion rupiah for EV subsidies in 2029. Additionally, the most and least probable scenarios based on literature research are evaluated. This simulation and its results provide insights into EV growth&amp;#039;s impact on the grid&amp;#039;s balance in one presidential term from 2024 to 2029 [4], aiding the government in planning regulations and subsidies effectively. Improving the simulation&amp;#039;s accuracy depends on refining input variables over time.</jats:p>"

Notably, Beetaloo wells have exhibited initial production rates over 30 days (IP30), spanning from 1.1 to 5.2 mmcf/day, and there is an evident trend of increasing frac stages with each new well as operators continuously optimise stimulation. This research paper presents comprehensive Beetaloo modelling results, encompassing well type curves, a comparative analysis with the renowned Marcellus shale play in the United States (frequently used as a reference point for Beetaloo), production forecasts, economic assessments, and an examination of potential commercialisation pathways. Based on our modelling findings, Beetaloo’s estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) per well ranges from 7 to 14 bcf, with deeper wells into the Velkerri B Shale demonstrating relatively higher productivity. We anticipate that, with full-scale development, Beetaloo could attain peak production rates of 1 bcf/day, supported by a peak annual drilling rate averaging 50–60 wells. Overall, the Beetaloo Basin possesses the potential to recover close to 8 tcf of low reservoir CO2 gas, opening doors to the possibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reaching up to 4.5 mtpa and domestic gas supplies of around 94 mmcf/day, limited to the existing infrastructure capacity connecting to the east coast gas markets.</jats:p>"

BI tools enable business users to access different types of data — historical and current, third-party and in-house, as well as semi-structured data and unstructured data like social media. Users can analyze this information to gain insights into how the business is performing. According to CIO magazine: “Although business intelligence does not tell business users what to do or what will happen if they take a certain course, neither is BI only about generating reports. Rather, BI offers a way for people to examine data to understand trends and derive insights.” Organizations can use the insights gained from business intelligence and data analysis to improve business decisions, identify problems or issues, spot market trends, and find new revenue or business opportunities.  BI platforms traditionally rely on data warehouses for their baseline information. A data warehouse aggregates data from multiple data sources into one central system to support business analytics and reporting. Business intelligence software queries the warehouse and presents the results to the user in the form of reports, charts and maps. Data warehouses can include an online analytical processing (OLAP) engine to support multidimensional queries. “OLAP provides powerful technology for data discovery, facilitating business intelligence, complex analytic calculations and predictive analytics,” says IBM offering manager Doug Dailey in his data warehousing blog. “One of the main benefits of OLAP is the consistency of information and calculations it uses to drive data to improve product quality, customer interactions and process improvements.” Some newer business intelligence solutions can extract and ingest raw data directly using technology such as Hadoop, but data warehouses are still the data source of choice in many cases.</jats:p>"

Using a dynamic structural model, I find that incorporating time loss due to spousal care increases the insurance value of SSDI relative to its costs.

This framework guides decision-making, mitigates risks, and enhances overall supply chain resilience, contributing to a more sustainable and ethically responsible business landscape. The corporate shift towards sustainable supply chain management(SSCM) is manifested by the emerging literature documenting comprehensive changes in governance. A bibliometric-based systematic review of 128 Scopus-indexed documents (2014-2023) reveals four interconnected themes: SSCM, Sustainable Business &amp; Operations Management, Global value chains, and Supply chain risk management. Analysis highlights the critical role of governance mechanisms in driving positive social, ecological, and economic outcomes. Governance achieves this by establishing clear policies and standards for social and environmental responsibility and ensuring robust mechanisms for compliance and accountability.

Beer is one of the world’s most popular drinks and the most consumed alcoholic beverage. However, a widespread challenge with potential implications for human and animal health is the presence of physical, chemical, and/or microbiological contaminants in beer. Biogenic amines, heavy metals, mycotoxins, nitrosamines, pesticides, acrylamide, phthalates, bisphenols, microplastics, and, to a lesser extent, hydrocarbons (aliphatic chlorinated and polycyclic aromatic), carbonyls, furan-derivatives, polychlorinated biphenyls, and trihalomethanes are the main chemical pollutants found during the beer brewing process. Pollution sources include raw materials, technological process steps, the brewery environment, and packaging materials. Different chemical pollutants have been found during the beer brewing process, from barley to beer. Brewing steps such as steeping, kilning, mashing, boiling, fermentation, and clarification are critical in reducing the levels of many of these pollutants. As a result, their residual levels are usually below the maximum levels allowed by international regulations. Therefore, this work was aimed at assessing how chemical pollutants appear and evolve in the brewing process, according to research developed in the last few decades.</jats:p>"

In order to better implement the \"double reduction\", it is necessary to apply information technology teaching methods to promote educational reform. At the same time, deepening information technology teaching reform is also an effective measure to promote the common and balanced development of compulsory education. In the society where information technology teaching is constantly developing, information resources are everywhere. In the context of \"double reduction\", the study of effective supply strategies for high-quality information technology education resources is conducive to the realization of reducing burden, increasing efficiency, and improving the quality of education environment. On the basis of explaining how information technology education resources can empower the implementation of \"double reduction\", this study proposes effective supply strategies for information technology education resources from the perspectives of precise promotion of teaching resources and teaching services, hierarchical supply of after-school service resources, big data resources to assist school work, and transformation of service models for off campus institutions.</jats:p>"

Effective closed-loop supply chain management is very critical, which is related to the efficient utilization of resources, environmental responsibility, and the realization of economic benefits. In this paper, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used to model the decision-making and coordination mechanism of the closed-loop supply chain of power batteries in order to cope with the challenges in the management process, such as cost, quality, and technological progress. By constructing the MDP model for different supply chain participants, this paper investigates the optimization strategy of the supply chain and applies two solution methods: dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. The case study results show that the model can effectively identify optimized supply chain decisions, improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain, and coordinate the interests among parties. The contribution of this study is to provide a new modeling framework for power battery recycling and to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the method with empirical data. This study demonstrates that the Markov decision-making process can be a powerful tool for closed-loop supply chain management, promotes a deeper understanding of the complex decision-making environment of the supply chain, and provides a new solution path for decision-making and coordination in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Beyond household applications, diverse livelihood activities, including livestock management, gardening, crop cultivation, food processing, aquaculture, and fisheries, also rely on water. The assessment of customer satisfaction holds paramount significance in driving performance enhancements for service providers, even within government-owned entities offering critical services like water supply. This research aims to scrutinize the interplay between overall satisfaction with water services and its determinants, including satisfaction with water quality, and various parameters such as water supply hours, tap pressure, supplied water quantity, management responsiveness and communication, and water tariff. Anticipatedly, water supply hours, quantity, and quality are expected to exert a crucial influence on user satisfaction. Although users express a satisfaction level above neutral, it falls short of reaching a fully satisfactory level. Key contributors to user satisfaction involve aspects such as water supply hours, pressure, quantity, and quality, while complaints about water supply yield slightly lower satisfaction. Satisfaction with water service hours, quantity, and quality emerges as a driving force for overall satisfaction. The analysis reveals no significant association between overall satisfaction and demographic variables such as occupation, gender, age, education, and the main income source. However, a noteworthy association exists between satisfaction with water pressure and the water collection method, and a robust link is observed between satisfaction with water quality and respondents&amp;apos; water treatment practices. The provision for complaints is significantly associated with satisfaction regarding management responsiveness and communication. Multiple regression analysis underscores a positive relationship between overall satisfaction with water services and satisfaction with water quality and supply hours, indicating that higher satisfaction with these factors enhances overall satisfaction with water services.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>District heating will be important in achieving future climate goals. Possibilities of using waste heat from different sources, e.g. subways, hospitals, shops, data centers, rivers are often discussed. Many district heating companies face the challenge of sufficient coverage of connected consumers in a city or region. To expand the operating area, companies should initially attract objects which are close to heat networks to lower the connection costs. The research question is how to attract existing buildings under construction to the district heating system. The present work uses system dynamics modeling for studying the possibilities of the Riga district heat supply company to increase consumer network. Modeling is based on historical data of residential buildings. The results show that old buildings choose to connect to the district heat supply when these are being renovated, or the individual heat supply equipment is out of order. The older the buildings, the more likely these will be connected to the district heating, however this decision may take at least 70 years. Renovation increases the probability of connection to the district heating, so the impact of subsidies for renovation is important. Regulation that requires connection to the district heating as a priority choice in case of renovation is also important.</jats:p>"

In this context, the aim of the study is to explain blockchain technology in detail, to ensure that the technology is fully recognized, to create awareness on businesses by explaining its benefits with examples of use in supply chain and logistics activities, and to contribute to later researchers by identifying the gaps in the literature by analyzing the literature. As a result of the exploratory research, it was determined that blockchain technology contributes to the solution of many problems, especially reliability, cost, flexibility, delays, transparency, and low performance.   Considering the result of the literature analysis, it has been concluded that academic studies on blockchain technology in the field of supply chain and logistics are not sufficient, and the number of these studies should be increased in order for the technology to be learned and used by more businesses in the relevant field.</jats:p>"

The agricultural food supply chain is one of the research areas where these disruptive technologies can play a crucial role in automating business processes, providing real-time goods monitoring, and securing transactions. With the help of blockchain, smart contracts, and the IoT, a product’s health and environment can be monitored throughout the supply chain. In this study, we have critically examined the relevance of these technologies through various activities of the agriculture supply chain using the approach of Business Process Modeling (BPM). Agriculture is a big part of the economy of any country because it helps feed the entire population. It connects and communicates with all of the related industries. If the agriculture base is strong, it is generally regarded as a socially and politically stable society. Many modern farms make use of cutting-edge technology and sciatic and technological ideas. The maximization of the profits relies on some farmers’ vegetables and fruits with chemicals. Chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and other compounds are used in several plants and fruits.</jats:p>"

The traditional teaching model, while serving its purpose, has limitations that hinder the holistic development of students in this domain. To address these limitations, an innovative teaching approach that breaks the mold of conventional methods is proposed. Central to this model is the integration of online and offline learning environments. This blend ensures that students have access to a wealth of resources and materials, both inside and outside the classroom. It also promotes flexibility in learning, allowing students to learn at their own pace and explore areas of interest. Moreover, the proposed model harmoniously combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Theory courses are complemented with hands-on experiments and practical projects, providing students with an opportunity to apply what they have learned in real-world scenarios. This approach not only enhances the retention of knowledge, but also fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The multi-dimensional interactive teaching model proposed in this paper aims to ignite students' interest in power supply and distribution, enhance their practical and innovative abilities, and ultimately support the cultivation of high-quality electrical engineering talents. It represents a significant step forward in the reform of teaching methodologies and holds promise for improving the overall quality and effectiveness of power supply and distribution courses.</jats:p>"

Although fentanyl contamination in cocaine has gained significant attention, the converse—cocaine-adulterated fentanyl—has been largely overlooked despite its health implications. The rise in concurrent cocaine and fentanyl overdose deaths could be attributed to various factors, from intentional polysubstance use to unintentional adulterations. Cocaine-related health issues may amplify the problem. Four potential pathways for the increased risk of overdose with cocaine-adulterated opioids include enhanced drug reinforcement, potential overdose risk with switching drug samples, altered metabolism of medications used for opioid use disorder, and increased myocardial demand juxtaposed with opioid-induced respiratory depression. With these risks, the importance of drug testing becomes paramount in the unregulated drug market. As polysubstance use overdoses surge, there is an urgent need to understand how drug supplies are changing in order to effectively identify appropriate harm reduction strategies. Specifically, further research is needed evaluating complications of low-level cocaine exposure with chronic/persistent opioid use. The hazards associated with cocaine-adulterated fentanyl emphasize the significance of understanding not only fentanyl’s presence in cocaine but also cocaine’s role in the fentanyl supply.</jats:p>",

However, conventional blockchains often limit scalability due to limited storage. Moreover, blockchain has loopholes; for example, it is not able to prove the validity of the data prior to being stored in the blockchain, which leads to fake data being added to the blockchain. As a result, it causes an issue of data provenance. Motivated by this, the proposed framework incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to enhance the efficiency of the medicine supply chain data. The proposed framework integrated machine learning (ML) and blockchain, where ML classifies the valid and invalid data of the medicine supply chain, whereas blockchain stores only valid data and maintains its security and privacy. This identification helps the blockchain to verify medicine supply chain data before adding it to the blockchain. Additionally, we employed an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) that saves medicine supply chain data and computes its hash to offer decentralized storage. Further, this hash data is stored on a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, which requires minimal storage instead of storing an entire large file. This minimal storage optimizes the process of data storage and retrieval in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, which enhances the scalability of the proposed framework. Finally, the result of the proposed framework is assessed in two phases: ML and blockchain, wherein the ML model's performance is measured by statistical measures and the blockchain‐based result is assessed using several performance parameters such as throughput is around (618 transactions per second), latency (0.12 s), response time (11 s) and data rate (282 Mbps).</jats:p>",

Studies have shown that: Whichever decision-making subject has the fairness concern behavior does not affect the supplier as a higher profit maker; information on market demand also needs to be taken into account when considering the impact of the level of fairness concern on profits of the decision maker. When suppliers misjudge market demand, wholesale price increases are slowed if sellers have equity concerns, and sellers may engage in retaliatory behavior if equity demands are not met. In addition, low carbon demand is profitable for suppliers in supplier-led supply chains regardless of market demand, and low carbon sales efforts are not necessarily profitable for retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The development of new energy vehicles is an important path to promote the realization of the dual carbon target. However, the complex and changeable external macro environment, large capital investment required in the early stage of new energy vehicle projects, and unstable returns resulting in high financial risks for new energy vehicle enterprises. Furthermore, factors such as information asymmetry, moral hazard and the uncertainty of the external macro environment make the dynamic characteristics of financial risk transmission between enterprises in the new energy vehicle supply chain more prominent. Existing studies on risk transmission have mainly focuses on theoretical exploration and qualitative research, while the quantitative research is lacking. This study empirically analyzed the financial risk transmission effect between the new energy vehicles chain enterprises based on the GARCH–time-varying copula–CoVaR model. It selected 8 upstream enterprises, 2 midstream enterprises and 8 downstream enterprises; constructed 36 financial risk transmission chains, and selected the stock returns of sample companies from 2017 to 2021 as research data. The results indicated that: (1) the financial risk between upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain of new energy vehicles had a bidirectional conduction effect, and the conduction effect was heterogeneous; (2) compared with midstream and downstream enterprises, financial risk was more conductive between upstream and midstream enterprises; and (3) the financial risk transmission effect between enterprises had time-varying characteristics, which affected by the external macro environment and the degree of cooperation between enterprises.</p>"

Building upon this, an improved SEIRS risk propagation model is developed, and the basic reproduction number is calculated to simulate the risk propagation within the fresh e-commerce supply chain.

To address the insufficient flexibility of multi-energy coupling in the integrated energy system and the overall strategic demand of low-carbon development, a multi-storage integrated energy system architecture that includes electric storage, heat storage and hydrogen storage is established. Then, according to the system status factors, such as energy cost, response characteristics and energy storage status, a hierarchical energy supply control strategy focusing on the energy supply priority of energy storage units is proposed. NSGA-Ⅱ-MOABC is created as the optimization algorithm to meet the demand of multi-energy coupling energy supply in the integrated energy system. Next, considering the system operational cost and carbon emission cost as the optimization goal, a comprehensive energy optimization scheduling model of multi-storage combined hierarchical energy supply is constructed. Based on the simulation example, the scheduling results of the multi-storage combined system are obtained, through comparative analysis, the addition of hydrogen storage can effectively improve the flexibility of system scheduling. Then, taking several scenarios as simulation examples, the hierarchical energy supply strategy can effectively reduce the system operation cost and carbon emission cost, and it also has a certain role in realizing the local consumption of renewable energy.</p>"

However, research on the metabolic characteristics of the PET industry across different countries, particularly regarding the entire life cycle supply chain of PET, remains insufficient, significantly hindering progress in addressing plastic pollution worldwide. This study employs the Life Cycle Assessment-Material Flow Analysis (LCA-MFA) method to comprehensively analyze the environmental impacts of PET plastics, with a focus on the processes from production to disposal in 12 regions (covering 41 countries) in 2020. By constructing 13 scenarios and analyzing the development trajectory of PET plastics from 2020 to 2030, this study provides scientific evidence and specific strategies for waste reduction and emission reduction measures in the PET industry. Overall, in 2020, the 12 regions (41 countries) consumed 7297.7 kilotons (kt) of virgin PET resin and 1189.4 kt of recycled PET resin; 23% of plastic waste was manufactured into recycled PET materials, 42% went to landfills, and 35% was incinerated. In 2020, the entire PET plastic supply chain emitted approximately 534.6 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, with production emissions accounting for 46.1%, manufacturing stage emissions accounting for 44.7%, and waste treatment stage emissions accounting for 9.2%. Research indicates that under a scenario of controlled demand, resource efficiency improvement and emission reduction are the most effective, potentially reducing carbon emissions by up to 40%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern requirements necessitate the establishment of sustainable transportation systems, considering the substantial growth in transportation activities over recent years, which is expected to continue. Companies are facing the challenge of modeling their system transport to align with green principles. Sustainable transport relied on involving diverse stakeholders, particularly scientific research, in the development of this field. In light of this, maintaining sustainable transport quality involves conducting thorough investigations into an innovative study focusing on an uncertain interval programming model for a multi-stage, multi-objective, multi-product transportation challenge within budget constraints and safety measures in a green supply chain. Human languages often contain imperfect or unknown information, inherently lacking certainty; achieving precision in describing existing states or future outcomes is frequently unattainable. In probability theory, sufficient historical information is crucial for estimating probability distributions; while in fuzzy theory, determining a reliable membership function proves challenging; hence, there is often a hesitant estimation of the degree of belief in the occurrence of each condition. Addressing such uncertainties, the theory of uncertain intervals proves highly valuable. Given these considerations, the elements of the specified problem are recognized as uncertain intervals. To manage this lack of assurance, a fusion of interval theory and methods from uncertain programming is used to formulate two distinct models: an expected value model and a chance-constrained model. The equivalent deterministic models are then formulated and solved utilizing Weighted Sum Method, fuzzy programming, and goal programming. Following this, a numerical example is utilized to assess the model’s performance, and the results obtained are compared. Finally, the document concludes with a sensitivity analysis and outlines future directions.</jats:p>",

Based on this, this paper proposes an EVSC risk research framework with combined weights and an improved matter-element extension model: (i) Firstly, the EVSC evaluation index system is constructed from the six stages of supply chain planning, sales, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, after-sales, and external risks. (ii) The subjective and objective weights are calculated by the decision laboratory method and entropy weight method, respectively, and then the minimum deviation method is used for a combined design to overcome the defects of a single method. (iii) An improved matter-element extension model (MEEM) is constructed by introducing asymmetric proximity degree and risk bias. (iv) The model is applied to a case study and its feasibility and superiority are verified through sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. The final results show that the method and framework proposed in this paper are in line with EVSC risk assessment standards and superior to other models, which can help EVSC managers to identify potential risks, formulate appropriate risk prevention measures, promote the stable development of electric vehicles, and provide a reference for the development of energy and environment.</jats:p>"

The DMPS provides a stable and precise\n  magnetic field for the storage ring operation. Appropriate wiring\n  methods are employed to minimize magnetic field interference across\n  the entire TPS area to meet the demands of high-energy output and\n  overcome the challenges of operating at high currents. The target\n  energy is set at 850 V and 750 A, utilizing a single-pole\n  switching voltage regulator as a high-precision constant current\n  source output structure. The system incorporates a closed control\n  loop that uses the Direct Current Current Transducer (DCCT) to\n  provide current signal feedback to the system. FPGA\n  (Field-Programmable Gate Array) calculates PID\n  (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) compensation values, generating a\n  2.1 kHz pulse width modulation (PWM) signal to regulate the output\n  current. At the same time, insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)\n  modules are switching components. However, even after several years\n  of practical operation, the stability and performance of the DMPS in\n  the storage ring still require improvements. To enhance long-term\n  output current stability and address peripheral issues, the current\n  TPS utilizes the Beam Orbit Feedback (FOFB) system to suppress and\n  fine-tune the magnetic field and compensate for the impact of\n  temperature drift on the DMPS's output current. This improvement\n  ensures a more stable circulation of the photon beam within the\n  storage ring. By optimizing the temperature control circuit of the\n  main control card, the long-term output current stability has been\n  successfully enhanced to within ± 10 ppm. Simultaneously, the\n  FOFB system reduces uncertainties in adjusting the X-axis beam\n  position, improving beam stability and quality.

This study aimed to determine the utilization of the electronic logistic management information system (e-LMIS) in public health facilities and its implications for the medicine supply chain. A mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods was used. The study was conducted in 106 healthcare providers from 35 public health facilities in Singida District. Six key informants were interviewed in a qualitative method.  Of 106 participants, (62.3%) said they were somehow competent in e-LMIS utilization. In in-depth interviews, respondents underscored the system&amp;#039;s utility for tracking stock levels, procurements, and managing orders. Staff shortage and lack of customized training were mentioned as major challenges, hindering efficiency in managing drug supplies. This study highlighted the positive impact of e-LMIS on various aspects of the medicine supply chain, including the timely submission of orders and enhanced inventory management. Sustained management support and regular utilization of the e-LMIS system are crucial for building and maintaining competence among healthcare providers, thereby optimizing the medicine supply chain and ultimately improving healthcare delivery.</jats:p>"

The vendor governs the manufacturing process to serve the demand of the buyer. When the vendor supplies the demanded lot after the production of items, it is also considered that the delivery lots have some defective items that follow an S-shape learning curve. After receiving the lot, the buyer inspects the whole lot, and the buyer classifies the whole lot into two categories: one is the defective-quality items and the other is the imperfect-quality items. The buyer returns the defective-quality items to the seller after a screening process, for which a warranty cost is included. During the transportation of the items, a lot of carbon units are emitted from the transportation, damaging the quality of the environment. The seller includes carbon emission costs to achieve sustainability as per considerations. A one-time discrete investment is also included for the minimizing of the setup cost of the seller for the next cycles. We developed models for the scenario of the separate decision and for the integrated decision of the players (seller/buyer) under the model’s consideration. Our aim is to jointly optimize the integrated total fuzzy cost under a cloudy fuzzy environment sustained by the seller and buyer. Numerical examples, sensitivity, analysis limitations, future scope and conclusions have been provided for the justification of the proposed model, and the impact of the input parameters on the decision variables and integrated total fuzzy cost for the supply chain are provided for the validity and robustness of this proposed model. The effect of learning in a cloudy fuzzy environment was positive for this proposed model.</jats:p>"

The effects on financial markets are evident, not only around changes in monetary policy or Fed’s announcements but also, indirectly, around macroeconomic data releases, political events, international issues, and the “news”. The impact of inflation surprises on financial markets has an enormous effect over the past years, due to the high liquidity, low investment, and weak economic growth of the real sector of the economy. Investors, analysts, forecasters, economists, and policymakers have a keen interest in understanding how monetary policy and conditions in financial markets (Wall Street) affect economic activity (Main Street). To test this issue empirically, we can compare the current level of the central bank’s policy rate (federal funds rate) by using an augmenting reaction function and with a hypothetical neutral or expected or optimal interest rate. If the federal funds rate is excessively below its neutral (optimal) level, this indicates that monetary policy is ineffective, and it is the one that has caused the bubbles in the markets and the inflation. According to many estimates, this is lately, since 2008, the case for the U.S. economy.</jats:p>",

The distributed ledger technology known as blockchain, which has just lately gained prominence, has a excess of uses in many different industries, most notably supply chain management. Theoretically, blockchain is a dispersed, independent system that makes storage of information secure. Blockchain based approaches may address the limitations of conventional transparency systems. The recently developed distributed ledger technology known as blockchain is becoming more and more well-liked due to its amazing applications across a wide range of industries, most notably supply chain management. A revolutionary change in managing supply chains has been sparked by the introduction of blockchain- based technology, specifically to the manufacturing industry. This chapter explores the manner in which the use of blockchain technology can improve transparency in the complex network of interconnected processes that comprise up the supply chain for manufacturing. Provided to the book “Futuristic Technology for Sustainable Manufacturing”, “Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency in Manufacturing” examines the various ways that blockchain is changing the way that supply chain operate. This section underlines the reception of blockchain innovation as a spine for inventory network the board with the target to accomplish responsibility, straightforwardness, and biological practical as we travel through the not-so-distant eventual fate of assembling. The part likewise talks about the hopeful way that blockchain innovation offers, introducing another period of efficiency and moral conduct in the assembling area. The section covers the ordinary use of blockchain in assembling, and showing how savvy contracts empower genuine - time perceivability, cut down on interferences and lessen blunders. Additionally, it digs into the capability of blockchain innovation in ensuring adherence to supportability models, subsequently supporting the focal idea of feasible assembling.</jats:p>",

Then the localisation methods of educational concepts and practical operations are sorted out, and the construction of the localised teaching model of Orff music pedagogy is introduced. Finally, this paper describes the big data analysis of the localised teaching model in terms of cluster trend analysis and determining the number of clusters analysis. The results show that the Chinese music pedagogy of Orff is realised on the basis of improving students' music knowledge and achieving their all-round development. The experimental data effectively improved the speed and accuracy of the big data analysis algorithm. This study is significant for the localised music education system in China.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain learning (SCL), which is reflected in organizational learning, referring to the learning between organizations in the supply chain, carries the promise to enable sustainable competitive advantages. Many large multinational companies, such as IKEA, Nestle, and Microsoft, have therefore integrated supply chain knowledge management and continuous learning into their corporate strategies. While there is evidence in extant research about a positive correlation between both the subjective attitude and learning ability of supply chain members and their performance improvement, areas where insight is still missing pertain to the relationship between supply chain members’ subjective psychological factors, and their relationship network structures. This is a serious omission, since these dimensions likely play a key role in the dynamics underlying SCL. In order to alleviate this void, we consider a multi-tier SCL network and develop a model in which a supply chain member’s attraction is weighted based on its previous learning experience. The game mechanism underlying SCL captured in this experience-weighted attraction (EWA) model is then tested using a simulation study of IKEA China’s multi-tier supply chain network for its sustainable cotton initiative. The results suggest that learning costs can be reduced and learning spillover befits can be increased by the provision of rewards to network member companies and better communication. In addition, the perception of and preference for SCL by suppliers can be influenced by initiating sustainable advocacy and providing knowledge and technology training, as well as fostering a range of subjective factors we investigate in our study, such as the strategic attractiveness the decline ratio due to forgetting, the attractiveness improvement ratio due to preferences, and the response sensitivity to strategies. The findings offer insight into the influence mechanisms of the supply chain network structure and subjective attitude about SCL, which are especially applicable to large, multinational enterprises.</jats:p>"

We document that the government’s land planning constraint impacts consumption and social welfare through the land price and final output, causing resource misallocation losses in aggregate investment and output. Quantitatively, the optimal upper limit of industrial land supply is about 40% to achieve the maximum social welfare. This paper stresses the necessity of revitalizing China’s land market, and simultaneously speeding up the marketization of collectively operated construction land.</jats:p>",

The area has a civil engineering problem concerning the unknown location of the water supply buried pipe in a road which might destructed during excavation works for maintenance operations. The geophysical surface self-potential method is chosen to find the pipe's location and depth. For acquiring data grid self-potential 20 and 22 points measurements were taken around the suspected location of the pipe within non-streaming water and streaming water in the pipe conditions respectively. Additional two survey lines of gradient configuration of 28 m length away of 3.5 m from the suspected buried pipeline carried out in the two conditions also. The grid self-potential points are rendered into observed, regional, and residual contour maps using surfer software 8. The interpreted self-potential gridded points in non-streaming water pipe conditions yielded positive anomalies in the observed map but the streaming water produced dominantly negative anomalies map. The residual self-potential maps in the two conditions showed positive and negative anomalies, all anomalies in the self-potential maps were spread along the center line of the maps where the suspected buried water supply pipe is extended, the residual maps showed it more clearly. To constrain the location of the buried water supply pipe second horizontal derivative technique upon the residual self-potential maps was applied and the constructed maps revealed accurately the anomalies aroused from the buried pipe spread over the center line. The gradient surveyed line profiles indicated that the self-potential signals submit to potential field theory formulations. The curve anomaly analysis of the survey line across the suspected buried pipe in the streaming water condition determined the depth of the buried pipe as 1.4 m.</jats:p>",

Since 2000, Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant number of business closures, which has consequently impeded the adoption of green supply chain practices. The study was guided by the objectives that included investigating the need to implement green supply chain management, examining implementation success factors that promote green supply chain management, and identifying the challenges faced in promoting green supply chain management. Interpretivism research philosophy and descriptive research design were adopted in this study. A specific population was drawn from 150 employees of selected Zimbabwean logistic companies. Non-probability sampling methods were adopted in this study. The findings on climate concern as the need for green supply chain implementation show that 10% strongly disagree with that view, 35% were neutral, and the other 30% strongly agreed. Findings on green manufacturing technology practice as one of the success factors that promote green supply chain management showed that 15% strongly disagreed with the view, 30% were neutral, and the other 30% strongly agreed. The findings on regulatory challenges faced in promoting green supply chain management show that 10% strongly disagree with that view, 35% were neutral, while the other 30% strongly agreed. This study demonstrates that green supply chain management is crucial for environmental protection, mitigating pollution, and addressing climate-related challenges. It recommends that organizations and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe develop various strategies to enhance the implementation of green supply chain practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The application of the logistic approach in the material and technical support of an energy supply company is considered using the example of joint-stock company \"Kharkivoblenergo\". Timely, high-quality, and complete material and technical support of productions are particularly important in times of war, as challenges such as the search for alternative sources of production supply, the shortage of goods produced by countries under sanctions, damage, or complete destruction of raw material productions within the country's territory, and the necessity of regular deliveries under shelling and destruction of logistic chains have emerged. Therefore, the use of a logistic approach in managing the material and technical support of energy supply companies with the formation of practical conclusions and recommendations that will be useful for the energy infrastructure of Ukraine in the conditions of Russian aggression is relevant. The purpose of the article is to apply a logistic approach in the activities of an energy supply company to determine the optimal location of a distribution warehouse, identify the largest suppliers and optimal structure of material and commodity values, and formulate recommendations to increase the efficiency of material and technical supply processes at the enterprise. The optimality of the location of the distribution warehouse of the company using the method of determining the center of gravity is assessed. It is found that the location of the current distribution warehouse practically corresponds to the optimal calculated coordinates. Using ABC analysis, the distribution of purchase volumes by suppliers and the structure of material and commodity values purchased by the company in 2023 is investigated. The largest suppliers of the enterprise by the volume of turnover and the optimal structure of material and commodity values are determined. An algorithm for the interaction of divisions of the company regarding procurement and supply of material and commodity values is proposed, which includes the following stages: 1) planning the annual need for the purchase of material resources; 2) organization of the process of procurement of material resources; 3) planning the monthly need for the purchase of material resources; 4) procurement of material resources; 5) delivery to storage locations and prompt inventory. The following measures are recommended to increase the efficiency of material and technical supply processes at the company: 1) involvement of employees of financial and economic services at all stages of material and technical supply; 2) improving the quality of procurement planning by technical and commercial services, which are the main customers of material and commodity values; 3) expanding the list of counterparties to reduce risks of non-performance of contracts.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the integration of a hot water storage system, heated by a flat plate solar collector, into a hemispherical solar still. Placing the storage tank below the still's absorber enhances heat input and efficiently stores excess daytime thermal energy. Conducted in Bouismail from December 2022 to October 2023, the study yielded significant results: the modified solar still outperformed the conventional one, with production increases of 157% in winter and 207% in summer. Moreover, the modified still demonstrated remarkable efficiency improvement in summer, reaching 37.42% compared to 20.38% for the conventional still. The orientation of the fins within the storage tank, with respect to the hot water entrance orifice, significantly impacted water production, with alterations of the angle resulting in decreases of up to 25%. Increasing saltwater depth led to reduced distilled water output, with declines of up to 37.08% for the modified still. Economic analysis showed a slightly higher cost per liter of water produced by the modified still ($0.1897) compared to the simple one ($0.1446).</jats:p>",

To achieve this, it is necessary to examine the spatio-temporal aspects of wood ES potential, supply and demand. In this study, we analyse spatio-temporal patterns of wood ES supply and demand at continental, national and regional scales to identify areas of increasing and decreasing supply and demand levels in Europe. In addition, we present background information about the potential of European forests to provide wood ES and its relationship to supply and demand. Our results showed that the overall European wood supply and demand as well as the wood ES potential were characterised by increasing trends. Furthermore, this increase was also regional, particularly in central and northern Europe. This study demonstrates not only the significance of spatio-temporal data in ES mapping, but also the importance of considering a broader range of components of the ES cascade model when assessing change. Our research has shown that potential, supply and demand can all increase in the same area, but also that low supply and demand do not guarantee wood potential growth. In addition, we found that a broad scale assessment helps to identify more general patterns and trends, but analysing data at a more accurate scale provides more comprehensive insights for identifying areas that may require targeted action for sustainable forest management.</jats:p>"

The demand-supply imbalance in India sometimes results in an underdeveloped local fruit market. This chapter identifies mismatch between cultivators and consumers, suggesting action plan to improve alternative supply chains at a local level. These may foster local fruits supply chains connecting farmers to retailers. Considering local and indigenous fruits located in Maharashtra; 1000 households and ten food supply chain stakeholders were studied. Actors in the traditional fruit supply chain proposed strategies to cater to consumer preferences. Ten specialists in the food supply chain endorsed the findings and the fifteen measures that need to be changed between 2023 and 2030. By increasing the availability of local fruits on the market, this would assist growers and processors in making business plans for the future and in disclosing shifts in consumer preferences or market dynamics.</jats:p>",

The literature review examines the challenges facing rural agricultural supply chains in various regions, particularly in Ghana, Ethiopia, and the Philippines. The primary focus is on the detrimental effects of inadequate transportation infrastructure, including poorly maintained roads and limited access to transportation networks. These challenges contribute to high transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and reduced agricultural output. Moreover, the prevalence of pests, diseases, and natural disasters further exacerbates the vulnerabilities of these supply chains. Despite the significance of agricultural production as a source of livelihood and economic activity in these regions, the constraints imposed by transportation limitations hinder market access, increase input prices, and impede overall economic growth. Strategies to address these challenges must prioritize investments in transportation infrastructure, market information systems, and resilience-building measures against environmental risks. FMEA method is applied to assess and prioritise the agricultural supply chain risks. It is use to analysis the level of risks.

The investigation is based on a structural vector autoregression model, where the effects of global oil prices and global monetary policy are controlled for. Four alternative measures of inflation are used, including headline, core, food, and energy inflation. The empirical results show that disruptions in global supply chains are the main drivers of global inflation in the long run as the corresponding shocks explain the lion's share of volatilities in headline inflation (by 32%), core inflation (by 30%), and food inflation (by 22%), followed by oil price shocks and policy rate shocks. In comparison, energy inflation is explained the most by oil price shocks (by 55%) followed by supply chain shocks and policy rate shocks. Positive supply chain pressure and oil price shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on headline inflation even after five years, whereas positive policy rate shocks have negative and statistically significant effects on headline inflation in the long run. In contrast, positive shocks to geopolitical risk result in higher headline inflation only up to one year, with insignificant effects in the long run. Several policy implications follow.</jats:p>",

Then, a probabilistic production simulation method is proposed, which includes a typical-year scenario and extreme weather events. Meanwhile, an index system is proposed to qualify the power security level, which applies the loss of load expectation (LOLE) and time of loss of load expectation (TOLE) under different scenarios and other indices to reveal the long-term power security trend. Finally, the long-term power supply risks for the Yunnan provincial power system are analyzed using the proposed method, validating that the proposed method is capable of characterizing the influences of extreme weather on power security.

To control or mitigate this issue, ecological restoration interventions should prioritize the recovery of areas most vulnerable to these processes, such as springs. Conversely, wildfires cause damage to vegetation cover and hinder ecological restoration and/or natural regeneration processes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify - with the aid of Geographic Information Systems - the temporal and spatial likelihood of fire occurrences in spring recharge areas undergoing ecological restoration and contributing to hydroelectric reservoirs in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The findings indicated that the months with the highest probability of wildfire occurrences were August and September (accounting for 66% of cases), requiring increased attention to prevention efforts. Furthermore, locations most susceptible to fires (steeper slopes, more flammable vegetation, and higher anthropogenic use) should be treated as priorities for both prevention and ecological restoration actions</jats:p>"

A system dynamics model will be developed to understand the impact of the implementation of Industry 4.0 on supply chain parameters, and the identified drivers and barriers to technological change will be included. In addition to the empirical basis of this connection, a proposal was a theoretical framework for utilizing Industry 4.0 within the supply chain. The opportunities and new challenges for future supply chains were expected in Industry 4.0. This study analyzed various challenges in implementation and process and proposed a framework for effectively adapting and transferring the model of Industry 4.0 towards supply chains. The research aims to understand the challenges of integrating Industry 4.0 into their networks because it aims to examine the advantages of supply chain management. The implementation impact of Industry 4.0 on the supply chain performance can be analyzed using simulation analysis, and the driving causes and obstacles of this technological transition can be investigated. This connection is provided on an empirical basis. It is proposed that a new industrial conceptual framework be developed. Incorporate Industry 4.0 into your supply chain.</jats:p>",

This is commonly done by companies, both private and government-owned. Regional-Owned Enterprises in Water Supply as a company owned by the Regional Government has a dual role, namely providing public goods and generating profits. This research aims to analyze the influence of financial difficulties, service effectiveness, and operational efficiency on tax avoidance with capital intensity as a moderating variable in Regional-Owned Enterprises in Water Supply. This research uses quantitative methods with secondary data obtained using documentation data collection methods. The sample in this study was selected based on purposive sampling and resulted in 117 companies spanning the period 2019-2022. The data analysis technique in this research uses multiple linear regression analysis using the Eviews version 12 program with a significance level of 5%. The results of this study show that financial difficulties and service effectiveness have a significant negative effect on tax avoidance, but operational efficiency has an insignificant positive effect on tax avoidance. The aggressiveness of Regional-Owned Enterprises in Water Supply towards tax avoidance is not as high as other organizations that are completely profit-oriented. This is possible because human resources do not understand taxation. In addition, direct supervision by the Regional Government makes management more alert to violations of statutory regulations. Capital intensity can weaken the influence of financial difficulties on tax avoidance and strengthen the influence of operational efficiency on tax avoidance. The greater the number of company fixed assets, the greater the depreciation expense, management can choose the depreciation method that is most profitable for the company.</jats:p>"

Yet, how the fundamental structure of the merged supply base changes after the M&amp;A and how the structural changes affect the performance are largely unknown. Building upon the strategy‐structure‐performance framework, this study investigates dual roles of supply base structural changes in M&amp;A events, namely, as an outcome and as a moderator to post‐M&amp;A performance. In particular, we examine how the size and the country diversity of the merged supply base change after M&amp;As, as well as how these structural changes affect the merged firm's operational performance. We conduct a difference‐in‐differences analysis by comparing firms that engaged in M&amp;A events (treatment group) with those comparable firms that did not engage in any M&amp;A events (control group). The results show that the merged firms tend to reduce the size of their supply bases after M&amp;As. In addition, our results demonstrate that both supply base consolidation (i.e., reducing the number of suppliers) and country diversification (i.e., spreading suppliers across multiple countries) improve the merged firms’ post‐M&amp;A operational performance, an effect that becomes stronger for horizontal M&amp;As. We also explore how the type of M&amp;As (i.e., horizontal vs. nonhorizontal), industry relatedness between the two merging firms, and the purposes of M&amp;As affect the post‐M&amp;A structural changes to the supply bases. This study helps inform supply managers the important roles of supply base in M&amp;As to enhance post‐M&amp;A operational performance or to limit the synergies when not properly done.</jats:p>"

Based on social learning theory, we explore how SCTL impacts SCR via an ambidextrous business model and the moderating role of paradox cognition. We employ hierarchical regression analysis to verify the hypotheses with data from 317 Chinese firms. The results show that SCTL has a positive impact on proactive and reactive SCR, and the ambidextrous business model mediates this relationship. Furthermore, paradox cognition strengthens the effect of SCTL on the ambidextrous business model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sustainable Governance of supply chains has become essential for businesses trying to balance economic success and ecological and ethical imperatives in an era of increased environmental awareness and social responsibility. Many stakeholders are pressuring companies to integrate sustainability into their supply chains as environmental degradation and social inequality worsen. Therefore, it is essential to include non-traditional supply chain stakeholders, such as competitors and non-governmental organizations, in supply chain operations to produce an SSCG. This comprehensive literature review synthesizes and examines the current body of information on stakeholder prospects, responsibilities, and measuring quality performance in sustainable supply chain governance. Therefore, this study's primary objective is to clearly show how SSC practices are related to stakeholder roles and responsibilities. A thorough literature examination was conducted, and 40 peer-reviewed journal publications from 2019 to 2023 were included. In this work, expectations, as stated in scholarly literature, are methodically categorized, and any gaps are reviewed critically. A reasonable explanation for stakeholders' discontent with the sustainability performance measurement and evaluation methods used nowadays is that, as the literature review demonstrates, stakeholder expectations have yet to be considered. The findings indicate that many external and internal supply chain stakeholders drive, enable, or check the application of sustainable supply chain Governance techniques.While governments and non-governmental organizations are essential drivers of sustainable supply chain Governance techniques, research can also help with their implementation. Furthermore, proactive interaction with external supply chain stakeholders improves organizational learning by boosting understanding and awareness of sustainability and developing knowledge.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, the author examines in detail one of the types of sales contract - the energy supply contract, which in the late 20th - early 21st centuries is a necessary element of the life of society, a mandatory condition for the development of the economy, since the supply of energy resources to one degree or another requires all physical and entities. Over the past ten years, Ukrainian civil legislation, which regulates contractual relations, in particular relations in the field of energy supply, has radically changed. In the Civil Code of Ukraine, a whole group of articles regulating relations related to the conclusion, execution and termination of contracts in the field of energy supply appeared. The legal norms governing the relationship between electricity suppliers and its consumers have undergone radical changes. The relationship between the owner of energy and the organizations that transport it (electricity and heat networks) is being built in a fundamentally new way. Today, the question of whether energy is a thing and whether it can be the object of property rights is problematic and debatable. To what type is the contract according to which the power plant (as a supplier) undertakes to provide the consumer with electric energy? Can such an activity be considered contractual, since the power plant undertakes to carry out the work, the necessary delivery of energy to the consumer, or is it still another activity? In the article, the author considered the rules for concluding an energy supply contract and the features of a universal service provider. Particular attention is paid to the supplier of the «Last Event», the powers and duties of such an entity are disclosed. The author concludes that the contract for the supply of electric energy to the consumer can be considered both as a public contract and as a connection contract. The basic requirements for the electricity supplier from the consumer, the legality of its activity, the possibility of switching to a new supplier are indicated. Special features of the energy supply contract include: provision of energy through the connected network; availability of consumer energy metering devices; the right of the counterparty (energy supply organization) under the energy supply contract to supervise the technical condition of the consumer’s current receivers in order to ensure safety and reliable energy supply.</jats:p>"

The findings revealed that risk prevention practice was found to be positive and significant, indicating that it has a direct effect on Mafuru-Kimambira water supply project performance, risk transfer was also found to be positive and significant, indicating that it has a direct impact on Mafuru-Kimambira water supply project performance and risk control was found to be positive and significant, indicating that it has a direct impact on project performance. The study emphasize how crucial risk management techniques are to improving the efficiency of water supply initiatives like the Mafuru-Kimambira Water Supply Project. The study recommends that policymakers should contemplate formulating and executing regulations that promote the application of risk prevention, risk transfer, and risk control techniques in project management. These policies might include directives requiring the application of these techniques in project planning and execution, incentives for projects that exhibit excellent risk management, and training courses for project managers on risk management techniques. By ensuring that water supply projects are carried out successfully, these policies may contribute to increased water security and socioeconomic growth.</jats:p>"

It reveals that examining the three problems of location, inventory and pricing in an integrated and simultaneous manner can be the best approach to optimize the supply chain (SC) and increase the profitability of its companies. The investigated three-level SC distribution network model includes one supplier, several distribution centers (DCs), and several customers. The model is structured in form of a mixed integer nonlinear programming to maximize the long-term average profit of the distribution network. It considers constraints of inventory capacity along with continuous review inventory policy in each open DC. For its DCs’ retail price determination, two competing pricing approaches of higher than and lower than the average price of competitors have been used. The approach has been investigated on several potential DCs and customers and its numerical results show that retail price from the DCs to the customers is dependent on the average price of the market and its fluctuations. The major finding of this research is the fact that the type of demand function can have a substantial effect on the obtained results in the location-inventory-pricing model and greatly influence the amount of the profit of each company.

While GPOs create savings for hospitals through lowered prices and reduced administrative burden, critics allege that these supply chain intermediaries reduce competition, particularly if GPOs concentrate purchasing from larger, dominant manufacturers. Using a mixed-methods design, we studied whether GPOs influence hospital purchasing behavior and explored the contracting mechanisms used by GPOs. Focusing on 4 high-cost biologic molecules that face competition from generic-like biosimilars between 2015 and 2019, we found that biosimilar uptake was 16%–23% higher among Traditional Medicare patients in hospitals associated with 2 of the 3 top GPOs as compared with smaller GPOs. The increase in biosimilar use was driven by single biosimilar brands that varied by GPO. Based on qualitative interviews, these 2 GPOs used more aggressive contracting strategies to steer member hospitals to specific biosimilar brands. To date, the use of GPOs and these aggressive contracting strategies appear to have increased biosimilar use, suggesting savings for payers and patients. However, single-source GPO contracting could inhibit competition or create shortages in the long term. Transparency on GPO practices and pricing strategies is needed for further GPO evaluations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of e-commerce has significantly impacted consumer shopping habits, resulting in profit loss for traditional supply chains. In response to intense competition, numerous companies have transitioned their business models to embrace dual-channel configurations, seeking to captivate customers and increase their market share. Nonetheless, research on decentralized dual-channel supply chain configurations is scarce and predominantly concentrates on single-period pricing. This paper addresses this gap by employing Stackelberg’s game theory to investigate the multi-periodic pricing and remanufacturing decisions within a decentralized dual-channel supply chain with reverse logistics, specialized in the manufacturing and sales of pharmaceutical products. Moreover, this work considers that the online channel pays a sales commission to the pharmacy in return for the provided after-sales services, aiming to incorporate the aspect of sharing revenues. A mathematical formulation is proposed in a multi-periodic environment allowing us to simultaneously maximize the total profits of the manufacturer, the pharmacy and the online channel, by optimizing the pricing and remanufacturing strategies. Numerical analyses examine the customer purchasing preference’s effect on the demand and pricing decisions of each channel, the impact of the collection cost on the optimal remanufacturing strategy, and assess the break-even point of the total profits generated in both channels according to the sales commission. This study’s novelty lies in employing Stackelberg’s game theory to develop a mathematical formulation for the multi-periodic pricing and remanufacturing problem within a decentralized dual-channel supply chain, incorporating a sales commission between both distributors.</jats:p>"

To this end, relevant pieces of evidence are systematically gathered from a sample of 101 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles at the intersection of AM technology and supply chain management.This information is then analyzed and synthesized to holistically map the features of AM technology adoption that enhance SCA. As a result, 42 features of AM technology adoption are identified that enhance thirteen different dimensions of SCA. The derived map explicitly indicates which features of AM technology adoption enhance which dimensions of SCA. Hence, this map can be used as a strategic tool by managers and policymakers who wish to explore different ways of enhancing SCA via AM technology adoption. This would, in turn, enable the adopting firm to deal with erratic business environments and dynamic supply chains in an agile manner, and therefore gain a competitive advantage. Moreover, based on the identified “white space” in the derived map, multiple questions are put forward that form a research agenda for future research.</jats:p>",

This research aims to study the combined effects of soil matric and osmotic potential stresses on tomato root water uptake. Plants were grown in pot and field experiments in loamy-clay soils and were irrigated with three different irrigation water qualities: 0, 3.5, and 7 dS/m. The Hydrus-1D model was used to simulate the combined dynamics of subsurface soil water and salts. Successful calibration and validation of the model against measured water and salt profiles enabled the examination of the combined effects of osmotic and matric potential stresses on root water uptake. Relative yields, indirectly estimated from actual and potential transpiration, indicated that the multiplicative stress response model effectively simulated measured yields and the impact of saline water irrigation on crop yields. The gradual salinization of the root zone further evidenced this effect. The scenario considering a temperature increase of 2&amp;deg;C had no significant impact on crop yields in the pot and field experiments.</jats:p>"

The results reveal that enhancing supply chain transparency can decrease crash risk, specifically by mitigating tax avoidance and earnings management. Moreover, the analysis suggests that this risk-reduction effect is more prominent in companies where managers are more incentivized to hide negative information and investors possess superior abilities to acquire information. Interestingly, supplier transparency is more influential in mitigating crash risk than customer transparency.

Both supervisors and employees make judgments about the value of incentives in terms of effort required or expended. Recent research on incentive types investigates employee effort in response to tangible and cash rewards under the premise that they may be valued differently by employees. We extend this research by investigating whether supervisors and employees make different effort‐related decisions in response to tangible and cash rewards. Specifically, relying on construal‐level theory, we predict that supervisors will favor tangible rewards relative to cash more than employees will. We conduct a lab experiment where we ask participants to take the role of either supervisor or employee. We manipulate the reward type (tangible or cash) and measure how much work supervisors demand and employees are willing to provide to obtain the reward. As predicted, we find that the tangible rewards, relative to cash, increase supervisors' target setting significantly more than employee effort levels. Our results offer implications for real‐world incentive compensation design.</jats:p>",

It focuses on comparing and contrasting the impacts of transformational and transactional leadership on green supply chain management (GSCM) and the overall sustainable performance of the company. Using a quantitative approach, the author conducted surveys among employees and managers and utilized structural equation modeling to analyze the model. The findings indicate that transformational leadership significantly impacts GSCM practices and sustainable organizational performance (OSP). However, the association between transactional leadership and GSCM is relatively weak. Additionally, it is observed that GSCM positively contributes to OSP. The results emphasize the importance of upper-level management involvement in green initiatives, particularly GSCM, to enhance the company’s environmental performance and ensure its long-term sustainability.</jats:p>"

By establishing a mathematical model for the simulation research, this study examines the start–stop priority sequence of the gas tri-supply subsystem and the heat pump subsystem under the ice storage priority strategy in winter and summer and proposes corresponding optimization solutions. By comparing the annual operating energy consumption of the system, we conclude that the gas tri-supply composite system has good economic efficiency and peak-shaving capability, indicating that regional gas tri-supply composite systems have great application potential in the future.

In Ukraine, the requirements for energy consumption in buildings are regulated by the Law \"On Energy Efficiency of Buildings\" through the relevant energy efficiency classes[2]. The issue of improving the energy efficiency of these facilities is a global challenge at the global level. In particular, the 2019 UN Climate Summit set a goal to achieve zero energy consumption in new buildings by 2030 and the same level in existing buildings by 2050. The use of renewable energy sources is an absolute and necessary component of achieving these goals. In addition, it should be understood that the share of renewable energy will grow steadily, in particular in household facilities. Over time, every building will be powered by renewable energy in one way or another. A review of the literature on the design of energy-efficient buildings in terms of engineering systems design revealed a low level of coverage of issues related to the design and design of power supply schemes for buildings with RES[3-7]. The article presents existing circuit solutions for the integration of RES (solar photovoltaic generation) into the building power supply system, in particular, a building power supply system with a grid-tie inverter and power optimizers, a building power supply system with microinverters, a building power supply system with twin microinverters and a prefabricated combined switchboard, a building power supply system with a backup power source, a power supply scheme with redundancy and a smart controller. A variety of schematic solutions for the power supply system allows you to choose the one that will meet a single or a set of criteria: the location of the panels by the cardinal points (one side or several); redundancy; cost; \"intelligence\" of the system.</jats:p>"

Due to the wide range of uncertainties and the unfavorable environmental effects associated with current linear business models, this global network is vulnerable to disruptions. Strengthening the resilience of SPvESCs is crucial for addressing any disturbances. This requires identifying the key enablers of resilience in SPvESCs, an area that has been understudied in the existing literature. An enabler is an aspect that facilitates the achievement of a goal by another aspect. This research contributes to the existing literature by systematically investigating the enablers for SPvESCs to achieve resilience. Thus, the objective of this analysis is to identify enablers that have the potential to enhance the resilience of SPvESCs in Türkiye. This was done by applying the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) in conjunction with a review of the current literature. Neutrosophic (N)-DEMATEL was then utilized to determine the relationships between the identified enablers. Finally, the results were validated using N-DELPHI. The results revealed that sensing and seizing new business models, adaptability to changes in novel energy generation and information technologies, and business contingency plans for natural and man-made disasters were the most influential enablers. The findings provide implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to help ensure improved resilience in SPvESCs.</jats:p>"

The issue has emerged once again during the recent international armed conflict in Ukraine, in which states not participating in the conflict have disregarded, among other things, the customary prohibition to supply weapons to either belligerent by supplying weapons to Ukraine – that is, the state victim of armed aggression – despite the deadlock in the Security Council. These acts of unilateral unneutral support have not been characterized by the supplying states as being pursuant to exceptions to the law of neutrality or by Russia or other states as being violations of it. This raises the question whether the law of neutrality still bears relevance whenever an act of aggression occurs. In the uncertainty as to the legal regime applicable in this case, the Ukrainian conflict offers an important instance of state practice that might help shed light on the applicability of the customary prohibition to supply weapons, as well as of the law of neutrality in general, when the international conflict is initiated by an act of aggression.</jats:p>",

The subsidy policies for prefabricated construction enterprises can influence their strategies to promote the development of prefabricated construction. The paper considers a two-echelon prefabricated construction supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an assembler, aiming to investigate pricing and the assembly rate strategies and coordination under different subsidy objects. The findings demonstrate that subsidy policies can increase the assembly rate. When the government subsidizes the manufacturer, the wholesale price decreases with the subsidy rate, while subsidizing the assembler, the wholesale price does not change. The impacts of subsidy policies on the retail price depend on price sensitivity and the consumer preference for the prefabricated construction market. When the subsidy rates are equivalent, the profit of supply chain with subsidizing the assembler is greater than that with subsidizing the manufacturer. Finally, the paper proposes the revenue-cost sharing contract to coordinate prefabricated construction supply chain with government subsidies. A numerical study is carried out to verify conclusions, and illustrates that a certain range of subsidy affects positively prefabricated construction enterprises by adjusting the retail price and increasing the assembly rate.</jats:p>"

Despite these challenges, a notable research gap emerges due to the limited exploration of adoption factors specific to the Indian agricultural context. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive investigation is initiated to delve into the nuanced dynamics of blockchain technology adoption in the Indian agricultural supply chain. The primary aim of this study is to provide insights into these adoption dynamics, employing a three-stage methodology. Starting with an extensive literature review to identify key adoption factors, the study then distributed a well-crafted questionnaire to 200 respondents, yielding 150 complete and analyzable responses. The chosen methodologies, including a one-sample t-test and exploratory factor analysis, allow for a quantitative assessment of the significance of various factors. The study's findings reveal crucial dimensions influencing blockchain adoption, such as perceived benefits, ease of use, trust, efficiency, ethical considerations, data security, integrity, regulatory compliance, and collaboration and stakeholder engagement, providing a comprehensive understanding of the adoption landscape. In conclusion, this research significantly contributes to comprehending the nuanced adoption dynamics of blockchain technology in the Indian agricultural supply chain, supported by a substantial sample size and robust methodological choices. The implications extend to stakeholders navigating the evolving agricultural supply chain, offering valuable insights for future research, policy considerations, and practical strategies, with a central focus on fostering transparency, efficiency, and ethical standards to address global agricultural supply chain challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",

The research utilised a systematic review methodology to comprehensively analyse inventory management strategies for cost reduction in supply chains, employing key search terms across databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. A total of 50 journals were initially identified, followed by a rigorous screening process based on pre-defined criteria, including 23 relevant published articles written in English. Examining global supply chain dynamics and sector-specific challenges in local inventory management, the review proposes three key strategies: Just-in-Time (JIT) and lean inventory practices, advanced analytics and predictive modelling, and collaborative supply chain partnerships. Drawing on empirical evidence and sector-specific examples, the review demonstrates the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating costs and enhancing overall supply chain efficiency. The policy implications underscore aligning business practices with proposed strategies, offering policymakers insights for formulating guidelines and incentives. Contributions to knowledge include a comprehensive framework for businesses to navigate contemporary supply chain challenges. At the same time, suggestions for further studies advocate for deeper explorations into emerging technologies and regional variations to refine and expand inventory management strategies.</jats:p>"

Interventionist forms of industrial policy have made a comeback among liberal economies. Coordinated economies now make use of market-driven strategies. This paper argues that the new generation of industrial strategies is shaped by the industrial development challenges that policymakers face at the sectoral level. It proposes a new theoretical framework that distinguishes between the policy orientation (targeted or open-ended) and the central agents driving financial and technological decision-making (governments or firms). We show that the choice of strategy is shaped by the level of uncertainty and the position of the domestic industry in global supply chains, that is, whether global supply chains are emerging or mature and whether the domestic industry is an entrant or incumbent.</jats:p>",

Kuantitas ini perlu mendapatkan perhatian dalam pengelolaannya. Sumber Daya Manusia (SDM) pengelola sampah menjadi titik kunci dalam mengatasi problematika menumpuknya sampah tersebut, sehingga perlu upaya pemberdayaan. Penelitian ini bertujuan menggambarkan dan menganalisis pemberdayaan masyarakat sebagai kunci pengembangan kapasitas SDM pengelola sampah dalam optimalisasi edukasi Green Supply Chain Management di Kota Semarang. Adapun komponen pengembangan kapasitas menurut Potter &amp; Brough (2004) digunakan dalam menganalisis fenomena ini, meliputi: Personal capacity, Facility capacity, Structural capacity, dan Role capacity. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan deskriptif. Penelitian dilakukan dengan wawancara, observasi, dan studi dokumen. Penelitian ini juga didukung dengan data kuantitatif yang bersumber dari kuesioner yang disebar ke elemen masyarakat di Kota Semarang. Penentuan informan menggunakan purposive sampling. Uji keabsahan data menggunakan triangulasi sumber dan metode. Analisis data menggunakan model analisis interaktif yang dikemukakan Miles, Huberman &amp; Sadana (2014). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan kapasitas masyarakat dalam pengelolaan sampah masih belum optimal, dari pemilahan sampah menurut jenisnya, pemahaman prinsip pengelolaan sampah, dan belum memadainya fasilitas pengelolaan sampah terpilah di permukiman warga. Selain itu, kapasitas masyarakat belum didukung organisasi lokal yang memadai, kurangnya forum-forum yang membahas mengenai isu pengelolaan sampah, serta lemahnya sanksi terhadap pembuang sampah sembarangan. Kedepannya, pemberdayaan masyarakat dalam pengelolaan sampah perlu diperkuat dengan pendirian berbagai macam fasilitas pengelolaan sampah berbasis masyarakat.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Green supply chain management is critical for driving sustainable development and addressing escalating environmental challenges faced by companies. However, due to the multidimensionality of cost–benefit analysis and the intricacies of supply chain operations, strategic decision-making regarding green supply chains is inherently complex. This paper proposes a green supply chain optimization framework based on a two-stage heuristic algorithm. First, anchored in the interests of intermediary core enterprises, this work integrates upstream procurement and transportation of products with downstream logistics and distribution. In this aspect, a three-tier green complex supply chain model incorporating economic and environmental factors is developed to consider carbon emissions, product non-conformance rates, delay rates, and transportation costs. The overarching goal is to comprehensively optimize the trade-off between supply chain costs and carbon emissions. Subsequently, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is devised to solve the model by combining the cuckoo search algorithm with the brainstorming optimization algorithm. Specifically, an adaptive crossover–mutation operator is introduced to enhance the search performance of the brainstorming optimization algorithm, which caters to both global and local search perspectives. Experimental results and comparison studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well within the modeling and optimization of the green supply chain. The proposed method facilitates the efficient determination of ordering strategies and transportation plans within tight deadlines, thereby offering valuable support to decision-makers in central enterprises for supply chain management, ultimately maximizing their benefits.</jats:p>"

Biodiversitas 25: 2086-2092. One frequently utilized reptile is the Javan spitting cobra (Naja sputatrix). Apart from Indonesia, countries that utilize cobras are China and India. One form of actual utilization for the community's economy from cobra utilization is the cobra satay business. The high economic potential threatens the cobra population in the wild. Moreover, trade in the supply chain can have a negative impact ecologically and economically, so it is necessary to approach the supply chain of the cobra business to understand the cobra supply chain, considering the roles of participants, distribution processes, the number and specifications of cobras utilized, the source of cobras, and the incurred losses within the supply chain. This research was conducted using the snowball sampling method, with in-depth interviews. Interviews with vendor were conducted at their shops in Jakarta, and interviews with agent and collector were conducted at their homes in Karawang. It enabled the identification of the supply chain of the cobra satay business consisting of vendor in Jakarta and collectors, agents, and hunters in Karawang. The data collected were the number, specifications, and prices of each supply chain link, as well as the form of cobra utilization from traders. An estimated ±1,560 cobras are used in the cobra satay business annually, with a minimum total length of 70 cm for the cobras. The results showed that the percentage of dead cobras in the supply chain was 5%-35%, which resulted in a reduction in income of Rp25,000 - Rp125,000 for agents, Rp40,000 - Rp240,000 for collector, and Rp200,000 - Rp2,000,000 for vendor.</jats:p>"

The identification of the degree of non‐competitive behavior is based on the derived mark‐down and mark‐up models using the latest developments in stochastic frontier methodology. The estimated models reveal some degree of non‐competitive behavior in the input as well as in the output processing market. However, in consideration of the results on the supply chain governance during the study period, we argue that the establishment of an Interbranch Organization (IBO) could create fairly stable long‐term food supply chain relationships benefitting all IBO members and in particular farmers despite the significant change in concentration levels in the Italian tomato processing sector after 2015.</jats:p>",

Methods: In this case study, we gathered real-life data about a traditional manufacturing orthopedic shoe SC and developed future scenarios in which AM is introduced at various points and with different degrees of penetration in the SC. Results: Presently, AM can only replace traditional manufacturing of tools and shoe components at a higher total cost. However, with maturing technology, the complete AM production of orthopedic shoes is expected to become feasible. Theoretically, that could disrupt existing SCs, eliminating 70% of the SC steps, improving SC lead time by 90%, and altering SC relations. However, certain thresholds currently prevent disruption. Specifically, the AM of complete orthopedic shoes has to become possible, manufacturing prices have to drop, and traditional craftsmanship has to be integrated into the digital product design. Conclusions: A framework for transition pathways, including directions for future research, is formed. Findings provide valuable insights for scholars and decision makers in the patient-specific products industry, health insurance providers, and healthcare policy makers to be better prepared by adjusting SC designs, relationships, and remuneration programs while AM technology develops towards maturity.</jats:p>"

This cleaner production concept has been proven to be cost-effective, result-oriented, environment-savvy and provides the organizations a cutting edge over their counterparts. However, there is a lack of awareness about cleaner production practices in Iraq while the current study analyzed one of the most important factories in Iraq for sugar production to understand the factors required for successful application of cleaner production strategy and the challenges to be expected. In this study, the researchers followed an exploratory research approach. For this study, a questionnaire was designed, validated and distributed randomly among 700 potential respondents working in various departments of the organization under study. Out of the total responses, 482 responses were considered and SEM-PLS analysis was conducted. The cleaner production strategies were applied through nine dimensions and the relationship between the performance of the factory and sustainable supply chain was found to be prominent. With a few limitations such as the choice of a single factory, weak relationship between the variables identified from hypothesis testing, the study is a first-of-its-kind in this domain, especially in dealing with sugar refineries. Based on the outcomes, policy recommendations were made to the decision makers and the government. It can be concluded that the application of modern technologies and effective resource management can help in achieving the goal of the study.</jats:p>",

Surprisingly, fat catabolism as well as glucose levels decreased in the second half of the night. Data from radar observations showed that the number of birds aloft, their mean height above ground and vertical flight speed decreased after midnight. Together with the findings from atmospheric pressure-loggers put on three species, this shows that nocturnal migrants migrating over continental Europe descend slowly during about 1.5 h before final landfall at night, which results in 11–30% energy savings according to current flight models.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We suggest that this slow descent reduces energy demands to an extent which is noticeable in the plasma concentration of lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolites.

Against this background, this study proposes a two-pronged parallel food bank supply chain innovation program aimed at solving the problem of expired food waste. Offline, we work with merchants to collect and distribute expired food to the public free of charge, and online, we continuously update social media to popularize expired food and develop a small program that allows the public to communicate directly with merchants and make appointments to collect expired food. The project measured the impact of the program and the satisfaction of the public through questionnaires and interviews with the audience. Through the program, 93% of the sample surveyed changed their attitude towards expired food from negative to positive; 82% gained more knowledge about expired food; and 92% were very satisfied with the program. According to social media statistics, over 10,000 media views were recorded during the program, achieving a more successful online popularization effect. In the future, our project will continue to distribute and establish cooperation with more merchants, in order to protect the environment and sustainable development of the road steadily and far.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Microalgae have considerable potential as a renewable feedstock for biochemical and bioethanol production that can be employed in processes associated with carbon capture. Large-scale microalgae cultivations are often non-axenic and are often cohabited by bacteria. A better understanding of the influence of cohabiting bacteria on microalgae productivity is required to develop sustainable synthetic co-culture processes at scale. Nutrient limitation is a frequently employed strategy in algal cultivations to accumulate energy reserves, such as lipids and carbohydrates. Here, a non-axenic culture of an estuarine green microalga, Chlorella vulgaris CCAP 211/21A, was studied under nutrient replete and deplete conditions to assess how changes in nutrient supply influenced the cohabiting bacterial population and its association with intracellular carbohydrate accumulations in the alga. Nutrient limitation resulted in a maximum carbohydrate yield of 47%, which was 74% higher than that in nutrient replete conditions. However, the latter condition elicited a 2-fold higher carbohydrate productivity. Three cohabiting bacterial isolates were cultivable from the three culture conditions tested. These isolates were identified using the 16S rRNA gene sequence to belong to Halomonas sp. and Muricauda sp. The composition of the bacterial population varied significantly between the growth conditions and time points. In all cases and at all time points, the dominant species was Halomonas isolates. Nutrient depletion resulted in an apparent loss of Muricauda sp. This finding demonstrates that nutrient supply can be used to control cohabiting bacterial populations in algal cultures, which will enable the development of synthetic co-culture strategies for improving algae productivity.</jats:p>"

The research proposes a theoretical model tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) and a multigroup analysis to understand the moderating role of information sharing. Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 312 key respondents from Portuguese buying firms that perceived greenwashing practices in their suppliers. Results indicate that greenwashing negatively affects green supply chain integration, while green supply chain integration enhances sustainability performance. This effect is stronger when information-sharing pressure is higher. The study underscores the importance of actively addressing greenwashing to improve green supply chain integration, especially when sustainability is the desired outcome. The research’s novelty lies in its contributions to building sustainable companies through green supply chain integration, trust, and partner communication.</jats:p>"

The study employed descriptive and analytical methods of data analysis to achieve the objectives of the inquiry. Findings showed that the study area suffered from inadequate water supply and poor locations of the sources of water: The study also revealed that the microbiological quality of the water sources used was unsafe, poor and not acceptable for human consumption. In addition, many man- days-hours were wasted in search of water. It is therefore recommended that the government should make the rural water supply and the maintenance of water quality a priority in its policy formulation.</jats:p>"

It concludes there are a range of regulatory approaches utilised to achieve improvements but to be effective they require politically supported interventions and better orchestration at global and national levels. Whether, as recent literature suggests, the 2022 amendment adding WHS to the International Labour Organization’s Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights is able to serve as a catalyst for this remains to be seen. Without such support and the political will to drive interventions, however, the analysis suggests that the current operational weaknesses of regulatory approaches to supporting WHS in GSCs are unlikely to be remedied. </jats:p>"

In humans, cobalamin deficiency can lead to pernicious anaemia as well as gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. In contrast to marine ecosystems, there is a great paucity of information on the role of soils and terrestrial plants in the supply of cobalt and cobalamin to microorganisms and animals. The content of cobalt cations in most soils is usually sufficient to maintain growth, and the density of cobalamin-producing soil prokaryotes is high in comparison to water bodies. The cobalt content of most soils is usually sufficient in comparison with water, and the density of cobalamin-producing soil prokaryotes is high. Therefore, terrestrial plants are an important cobalt source for cobalamin-producing rumen and gut prokaryotes. The major source of cobalamin for most other animals is the meat of ruminants as well as other animal-derived products, bacteria in insects, and coprophagy, e.g., by rodents. In addition, faecal deposits, and fertilizers as well as soil bacteria add to the cobalamin supply. However, those archaea and bacteria that do not produce cobalamin obtain this coenzyme or its analogues from the environment. Therefore, presence or absence of cobalamin-producing species in soil affects the whole soil microbiome. However, our knowledge concerning microbial producers and consumers of cobalamin in soils is still limited, despite some recent advances. The main reasons are a low cobalamin content in soils and challenging methods of determination. In this regard, advanced analytical knowledge and technical equipment are required, which are usually unavailable in soil laboratories. This review provides relevant methodological information on sample homogenization, extraction, concentration, and purification as well as analysis of cobalamin.</jats:p>",

The statement of the problem revolves around determining water quality using various indices including Permeability Index (PI), Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), Water Quality Index (WQI), Sodium Percentage (Na%), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's Water Quality Index (CCME WQI), Magnesium Hazard (MH), Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI), and Kelly Index (KR). Additionally, statistical methods were utilized to establish correlations between these indices and chemical elements. The working method involved investigating hydrochemical parameters in Wadi Righ's groundwater and analyzing 52 samples. The results indicate that water quality, as assessed by the water quality indices, was categorized as very poor and unsuitable overall, with lower quality observed particularly in the central and southern regions. However, groundwater demonstrated excellence and suitability for irrigation purposes. Qualitatively, the findings suggest that there are significant relationships among irrigation suitability indices, as indicated by Pearson correlation analysis. These relationships stem from shared inputs and hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater. This analysis reinforces the quantitative findings and provides insights into the underlying factors influencing groundwater quality and suitability for irrigation in the Wadi Righ region.</jats:p>",

Across four error‐correction specifications, and supported by an instrumental variables approach, we find the estimated elasticity of new housing supply to prices of +0.9 in the baseline, while that of costs is larger in magnitude (−1.9). We present evidence that responsiveness to prices rose after the 1980s, then fell in the 2000s, before rising again and also that elasticities vary at the county level.</jats:p>",

The study primarily relies on a literature review and an impact pathway to conduct a systematic analysis to identify the potential effects of the LkSG on smallholder cocoa farmers. The findings indicate that some, but not all of the risks addressed by the LkSG align with those faced by smallholder cocoa farmers and their families. Additionally, the research also reveals weaknesses, particularly in managing environmental risks, which the LkSG does not adequately cover. Our findings show that in the short- and medium-term, the LkSG has no potential effects on smallholder cocoa farmers. Furthermore, the potential positive impacts of the law on smallholder cocoa farmers will take a long time to realize, as the LkSG considers primarily tier-1 suppliers. Companies in Germany might reassess their supply chains to strive for an LkSG-risk-free supply chain, which could in the long term have sustained impacts on smallholder cocoa farmers. However, we recommend a comprehensive risk analysis of the cocoa supply chain to enhance the human rights of cocoa farmers.</jats:p>"

Several issues have been reported drastically related to various organizations that fail to provide quality medicines on time. There has been a consistent increase in cases where the treatment, as well as exempted drugs, were supplied due to the unavailability of proper traceability of the supply chain. Several parties are involved in the supply and have similar interests that may defer the adequate shareability of the drugs. The existing system for managing the drug supply chain suffers from several backlogs. The loss of information, unavailability of resources to track the proper medicinal storage, transparency of information sharing between various stakeholders and sequential access. The applicability of the decentralized model emerging from the blockchain can apply to one of the perfect solutions in this case. The drug traceability chain can be deployed to a Ledger-based blockchain that may result in decentralized information. Continuous supply from the Internet of Things (IoT) based devices might be handy as the middleware for providing a trustworthy, safe, and proper transaction-oriented system. The data integrity, along with the provenance resulting from the IoT-connected devices, is an effective solution towards managing the supply chain and drug traceability. This study presents a model that can provide a token-based blockchain that will help provide a cost-efficient and secure system for a reliable drug supply chain.</jats:p>"

The theoretical foundation for the evolution of supply chain finance and the optimal utilization of internal and external resources can be attributed to the resource-based view. Building upon this view, we propose establishing a framework for the relationship between supply chain finance, intangible assets, and long-term investors. However, it is crucial to note that, under the predominant shareholding structure of long-term investors, the value and safeguarding of intangible assets may not be effectively enhanced. This can have ramifications on the investment decisions and interest protection of long-term investors as well as hinder the competitiveness of enterprises and the efficacy of supply chain finance. Leveraging it allows for the extraction of value from intangible assets and attracts the support of long-term investors, thereby aiding enterprises in risk reduction, fostering innovation and technological advancement, and ultimately achieving sustained development. Our proposed model serves as a valuable reference for relevant enterprises and individuals seeking to utilize supply chain finance, particularly for entrepreneurs and innovative companies.</jats:p>"

This paper describes the development of a multiple input supply based modified SEPIC DC–DC Converter for efficient management of DC microgrid that is powered by two DC sources. Here Multi-Input SEPIC converter offers both versatility in handling output voltage ranges and efficiency in power flow, even under challenging operating conditions like lower duty cycle values. These features contribute to the converter's effectiveness in managing power within a DC microgrid. In this configuration, the DC sources can supply energy to the load together or separately, depending on how the power switches operate. The detailed working states with equivalent circuit diagrams and theoretical waveforms, under steady-state conditions, are shown along with the current direction equations. This paper also demonstrates the typical analysis of large-signal, small-signal, steady-state modeling techniques and detailed design equations. The proposed configuration is validated through the conceptual examination using theoretical and comprehensive MATLAB simulation results. Detailed performance analysis has been done for different cases with various duty ratios. Finally, to show the competitiveness, the multi-input SEPIC topology is compared with similar recent converters.</jats:p>"

International trade is the exchange of goods, services, or other factors of production across national borders. One example of international trade is exports and imports. Export and import activities have a close relationship with demand and supply. In this study, we will examine one of the important aspects of international trade, namely imports. Indonesia, as a country that has a wide coastline and a large water area, still needs to import salt from other countries to meet the salt needs in Indonesia itself. Therefore, research will be conducted on salt imports in Indonesia as influenced by Gross Domestic Product, US Dollar Exchange Rate, and Money Supply. In this study, there is a period of twenty years, from 2003 to 2022. The number of observations in this study is eighty because there are four variables with a research data period of twenty years. The objectives of this study are 1) to analyze the effect of GDP, the US Dollar Exchange Rate, and the Amount of Money in Circulation simultaneously on Salt imports in Indonesia in 2003–2022, 2) to analyze the effect of GDP, the US Dollar Exchange Rate, and the Amount of Money in Circulation partially on Salt imports in Indonesia in 2003–2022, and 3) to find out the variables that have the most dominant influence on Salt Imports in Indonesia in 2003–2022. The results of this study show that GDP and the amount of money in circulation have a positive effect on salt imports in Indonesia in 2003–2022, and the US dollar exchange rate has a negative effect on salt imports in Indonesia. Gross Domestic Product has the most dominant influence on the Salt Import variable, among other variables.</jats:p>"

For e-tendering (β= 0.297, t = 4.252, p=0.000 &lt; 0.05). Similarly, e-auction shows a positive effect (β= 0.216, t = 3.054, p = 0.003&lt; 0.05). E-purchasing and e-invoicing also have positive effects, contributing to the performance of KIPHARMA-Rwanda, (β= 0.244, t = 2.422, p = 0.018&lt; 0.05) and (β= 0.247, t = 2.530, p = 0.013&lt; 0.05) respectively. These results indicates that the adoption of e-procurement practices, including e-tendering, e-auction, e-purchasing, and e-invoicing, is associated with positive effects on the performance of KIPHARMA-Rwanda. All p-values are statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05, reinforcing the strong relationships. KIPHARMA-Rwanda should focus on enhancing skills related to e-tendering processes, ensuring that all stakeholders are well-equipped to leverage the system effectively. Keywords: E-procurement, E-tendering, E- invoicing, E-purchasing, E-auction and Performance.</jats:p>"

Prior research primarily explored risk management within specific fuel industry units supplied by a single source. This study represents a novel approach, delving into dual-source fuel strategies and engaging various supply chain stakeholders to identify and mitigate operational risks accordingly. The research findings demonstrate that stakeholders can reduce risks through integrated planning and collaboration among business units, with government support further reducing inter-unit risks. This study’s main contribution is establishing a basis for future research in eco-friendly fuel supply chains, specifically examining the long-term viability of blending petrofuel with biofuel. This extends risk analysis to supply chain networks involving multiple business units. Moreover, this research emphasizes the significance of case studies covering end-to-end product flows in fuel blend supply, encompassing various supply chain functions. Additionally, it investigates stakeholder perceptions of operational risks associated with different business unit types, addressing potential domino effects. It highlights the importance of information technology in risk reduction through collaborative information exchange within the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer in which the manufacturer faces a random production disruption risk. The manufacturer replenishes the unproduced items to fulfil the retailer’s order from the secondary market at a higher price. To attract more customers, this paper considers a customer’s demand dependent on product selling price, stock level, and freshness level of the fresh items. Furthermore, this paper considers preservation technology investment (PTI) to mitigate the deterioration rate of the items and carbon tax regulation to curb down carbon emissions revealed from the supply chain activities. The Stackelberg game approach with a leader–follower relationship is used considering the manufacturer as a leader and the retailer as a follower. Several theorems are developed to illustrate the concavity of the profit function and to find out the optimal solutions in which the objective is to maximize the manufacturer’s total profit subject to the minimum total cost that the retailer is willing to incur. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed models and the obtained results are compared for with and without carbon tax policy. Finally, sensitivity analysis with some key managerial insights is given to demonstrate the model. The results show that a product’s freshness level influences consumers’ decision to buy more, and that’s why the freshness level is an important competitive tool to increase sales as well as the supply chain’s total profit.</jats:p>",

They can handle environmental damages (e.g., waste) and related social impacts. Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are forward and reverse supply chain networks that have gained popularity in recent years. Recovery options such as reusing, remanufacturing and recycling can be considered in CLSCs. Methods: This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of CLSC journal papers published between 2020 and the present. This study examines and synthesizes 54 papers from major publications in this area, covering a wide range of themes and approaches. This paper aims to respond to the following key questions: (i) What are the current trends and challenges in CLSC research, and how have they evolved since previous literature review papers? (ii) What key variables and objectives have been studied in recent CLSC research, and how have they been operationalized? (iii) What are the gaps and limitations in current CLSC research? To our knowledge, other literature review papers in this field have covered older papers, and recent papers have been ignored in them. Another research contribution of this paper is the taxonomy of it. Results: This review article highlights some developing themes and research gaps in the CLSC literature and makes recommendations for further study.

For this, seven parameters (rainfall, geology, slopes, drainage density, land use and land cover, lineament density, and soil) known to influence the availability of groundwater were considered. The results obtained show that the Eastern part of the basin holds the largest quantities of groundwater. The produced map shows that this region includes high and very high GWPZs (yield &amp;gt; 6 l/s). It is essentially characterized by abundant rainfall (on average 135–136 and 131–134 mm), low slopes, significant drainage and lineament densities, and significant forest cover. On the other hand, the opposite region (west), which includes the low and very low GWPZs, is characterized by less abundant precipitation (on average 121–125 and 125–128 mm), significant slopes, lower drainage and lineament densities, and greater impervious areas. With a success rate of 80%, confidence deserves to be placed in the GWPZs map produced. It can be considered in water supply projects in this basin. Such work has never been done in this basin before.</jats:p>",

However, they are facing various risks and organizational challenges that hinder their efficiency. To ensure long‐term sustainability, this study identifies the key risks and introduces a prioritization model for risk management in CSC strategies proposing a framework for the risk evaluation based on the set of criteria and prioritization model using a combination of three multicriteria decision‐making (MCDM) methods. The model applies fuzzy Delphi‐based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method to determine the criteria weights and fuzzy axial distance‐based aggregated measurement (ADAM) method for ranking the alternatives. The findings of this study allow for the identification of the most important risks associated with CSC enabling stakeholders to allocate resources strategically and focus efforts on crucial areas. Results highlight that the most important risks are supply chain complexity, resource availability, and quality and technological challenges. The most important contributions are the identification of the most relevant risks that threaten the resilience and sustainability of CSCs, the establishment of the framework for their evaluation, and the development of a novel hybrid MCDM model for their ranking. These contributions are also the main theoretical implications of the study. On a practical level, it enables organizations to strategically manage risks, standardize risk assessment, and improve their competitive advantage by enhancing resilience, reducing disruptions, and lowering operational costs.</jats:p>",

There is a common perception, nevertheless, that not many businesses have fully realised its potential. In order to determine best practices and evaluate the state of supply chain collaboration, a research was conducted. Design, procedure, and strategy CEOs of supply chains offered advice on working together. A conceptual model characterising the behaviour, culture, and interpersonal relationships linked to productive collaboration was created using survey data, in-person interviews, and an analysis of the literature on collaboration Results. The increase of efficiency, effectiveness, and market positioning for the enterprises of the responders are positive results associated to collaboration. Research constraints and implications Although the limited sample size is a drawback, it is counterbalanced by the calibre of the respondent pool and their level of training and experience. Getting feedback from only one partner in the cooperative partnerships is another drawback. It would be possible to ascertain how collaboration-related interactions and variables evolve over time by creating a longitudinal research. Consequences for practice A \"blurring of lines\" between organisations was highlighted by a number of respondents in contrast to a \"us vs. them\" mentality.  This was conveyed in several ways, including by recognising the agreements as co-owned, treating them as a single unit, and reorienting the attention to the greatest possible compromise. Even though many of the respondents said that benefits are not given out equally, they acknowledged that they benefit enough from the cooperative agreements to make them worthwhile. Uniqueness and worth Many of today's leading firms are mentioned in real-world practical experiences.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture, the mainstay of rural India, provides livelihoods to 70% of the rural populace. However, it is beleaguered by supply chain inefficiencies, leading to losses of up to 5.99% in cereals and a whopping 60% yield loss for farmers. The prevailing supply chains are often shrouded in obscurity, with a scant 6% of businesses having complete visibility. This lack of transparency culminates in inefficient processes and potential delays in order fulfilment, engendering customer dissatisfaction and financial losses. The emergence of blockchain technology, however, offers a beacon of hope. Blockchain provides a transparent platform where all stakeholders can access and verify the movement of goods. This transparency not only bolsters customer trust but also enhances their satisfaction levels. Moreover, blockchain technology optimises inventory management and logistics, thereby reducing waste and boosting productivity. These enhancements translate into substantial cost savings. The advent of blockchain could revolutionise agricultural supply chains in India. By providing a transparent and efficient system for tracking the movement of goods, blockchain could eliminate many of the current inefficiencies. This would not only lead to increased profits for farmers but also ensure that consumers have access to fresh and high-quality produce. Furthermore, the use of blockchain could also promote sustainable farming practices by making it easier to track and verify the use of environmentally friendly methods. In conclusion, blockchain technology has the potential to transform the agricultural sector in India, making it more efficient, transparent, and sustainable.

While existing research focuses on cyber threats, a significant gap exists in addressing physical and cyber risks. The current research focuses on cyber threats, but more attention needs to be paid to addressing physical and cyber risks. This paper proposes a new risk assessment framework that considers both physical and cyber threats quantitatively and qualitatively and helps safeguard the AM supply chain. The framework identifies, analyses, and prioritises potential threats based on their characteristics. It also considers the trustworthiness of data and the frequency of reported threats to estimate the likelihood of each threat. The risks are then prioritised based on a combined impact-likelihood score. The framework has been validated on the standard benchmark MITRE CVEs dataset and has proven effective in identifying critical vulnerabilities. This approach empowers manufacturers to proactively deal with security concerns and navigate the complexities of the rapidly evolving AM landscape.</jats:p>",

This research aims to determine the supporting and inhibiting factors for implementing supply management at the herbal HPAI halal mart in Sambas Regency. In this research, qualitative research was used. The data collection technique is carried out by means of interviews, then analyzed through data reduction, classifying the data, presenting the data and finally drawing conclusions. The data sources in this research consist of 2, namely primary data and secondary data. One of the supporting factors for carrying out herbal medicine supply management in Sambas Regency can involve operational efficiency, product quality and good marketing strategies. Meanwhile, inhibiting factors may include raw material supply instability, regulatory changes, or logistical constraints. The external supporting factor is that many people know the quality of HPAI products, so they are easy to sell because the prices are affordable. The internal inhibiting factor is not having its own way or rules to handle orders for lots of herbal products by consumers and delays in delivery of goods. These delays are due to an overload of goods to be sent by the expedition.</jats:p>"

According to whether the fabric manufacturer (FM) invests in quality or not and whether the garment manufacturer (GM) or garment retailer (GR) is willing to share the costs or not, five game models are constructed to investigate the impact of different members’ cost sharing on the optimal decisions and profits. By conducting a theoretical and numerical analysis, we find that: (1) The GM’s or GR’s cost sharing plays a positive effect on the quality improvement, as for whose cost sharing performs better in improving the quality depending on the proportion of cost sharing, and the quality improvement is highest with both members share the costs simultaneously. (2) The FM receives the highest profit when both members share the costs simultaneously, however, whose cost sharing is more profitable for the FM is also related to the proportion of cost sharing; in short, the FM always benefits from the cost sharing, no matter one member does this or two members do this. (3) The GM (GR) gains the highest profit when only the GR (GM) shares the costs, and the results indicate that if one member has shared the costs, whether the other member engaging in cost sharing could benefit the former depending on their proportions. Specifically, when the GM (GR) chooses to share the costs and the proportion is relatively low, the GR(GM) joining in cost sharing is beneficial to the former; otherwise, is harmful.</jats:p>"

This was done on a case study about Matlou and Letsokoane inhabitants were chosen as a setting for the study. A mixed method approach was used for the study combining structured questionnaires and open-ended interviews. The findings of the study have showed that there is poor water supply to two affected rural communities by the Polokwane local municipality . Amongst contributing factors the increase in population growth in that area is a major problem as well as residents tampering with infrastructure , theft and no interventions by political representatives when there is no water. This has resulted in inadequate provision of clean water resources . Water supply Value chain model has been proposed emanating from the findings of the research study to be implemented by the Polokwane local municipality to curb the problem of water supply to the rural communities. Lessons that can be learned from this study include the following: consultation with the communities through ward councilors which include educational aspect such as preservation of water as a source of human life, providing a compelling case for concertizing the community with an attempt to reduce illegal activities as cited in the study regarding the steeling of water taps.</jats:p>"

Traditional optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the complex and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based zero-trust supply chain security framework integrated with deep reinforcement learning (SAC-rainbow) to address these challenges. The SAC-rainbow framework leverages the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) algorithm with prioritized experience replay for inventory optimization and a blockchain-based zero-trust mechanism for secure supply chain management. The SAC-rainbow algorithm learns adaptive policies under demand uncertainty, while the blockchain architecture ensures secure, transparent, and traceable record-keeping and automated execution of supply chain transactions. An experiment using real-world supply chain data demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of reward maximization, inventory stability, and security metrics. The SAC-rainbow framework offers a promising solution for addressing the challenges of modern supply chains by leveraging blockchain, deep reinforcement learning, and zero-trust security principles. This research paves the way for developing secure, transparent, and efficient supply chain management systems in the face of growing complexity and security risks.</jats:p>"

In South Africa, one of the main threats to water supply is the proliferation of woody invasive alien plants which significantly reduce stream flow and water yields. We used existing spatial data and estimates of the impact of woody invasive plants on flows and water yields and on restoration costs to analyse the viability of investing in ecological infrastructure at the scale of major water supply areas. The analysis involved comparison of the costs and effects on water yields of catchment restoration with those of planned built infrastructure interventions designed to meet increasing water demands in the medium to long term. The cost-effectiveness analysis used the unit reference value as a measure of comparison, which is based on the discounted flows of costs and water supplied over a defined time. Restoration could supply 24% of the combined yield of planned built infrastructure interventions by 2050, and is not only cost-effective but has the added advantage of a range of co-benefits delivered by improving ecosystem health. This finding suggests that investing in ecological infrastructure should be considered ahead of new built-infrastructure projects.</jats:p>"

Land degradation, groundwater quality reduction and ecosystem instability are the consequences of agricultural development without considering sustainability indicators. This article aims to investigate the use of variable relationship analysis and Bayesian network methods to analyze and investigate the relationship between irrigation in agriculture and the sustainability of the groundwater ecosystem. Descriptive statistics of agriculture including cultivation pattern, time, precipitation, irrigation, and land slope were analyzed and combined with the simulated characteristics of groundwater including specific yield, hydraulic conductivity and hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients. Five crops of wheat, barley, paddy, alfalfa, and potato were studied to evaluate the effect of plants on the pattern of nitrate release due to irrigation and fertilization in agriculture. The results showed that managing the amount of fertilizer and the volume of irrigation can positively affect the nitrate distribution pattern in the groundwater even in a short period of time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study deals with the prediction of recurring failures in water supply networks, a complex and costly task, but essential for the effective maintenance of these vital infrastructures. Using historical failure data provided by Companhia de Água e Esgotos da Paraíba (CAGEPA), the research focuses on predicting the time until the next failure at specific points in the network. The authors divided the failures into two categories: Occurrences of New Faults (ONFs) and Recurrences of Faults (RFs). To perform the predictions, they used predictive models based on machine learning, more specifically on MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) neural networks. The investigation unveiled that through the analysis of historical failure data and the consideration of variables including altitude, number of failures on the same street, and days between failures, it is possible to achieve an accuracy greater than 80% in predicting failures within a 90-day interval. This demonstrates the feasibility of using fault history to predict future water supply outages with significant accuracy. These forecasts allow water utilities to plan and optimize their maintenance, minimizing inconvenience and losses. The article contributes significantly to the field of water infrastructure management by proposing the applicability of a data-driven approach in diverse urban settings and across various types of infrastructure networks, including those pertaining to energy or communication. These conclusions underscore the paramount importance of systematic data collection and analysis in both averting failures and optimizing the allocation of resources within water utilities.</jats:p>"

This is because the problem of determining which facilities within a supply chain echelon should cost-effectively supply products to facilities in the next echelon is usually encountered by supply chain managers and analysts. In this paper, a linear programming model for supply chain routing and facility location optimization has been proposed. The model can be solved using the PuLP optimization library implemented in Python programming language. The model has been applied to a small dairy products supply chain to determine the most cost-effective routes for products in the supply chain. The optimization results proffered the optimal contribution of each factory warehouse to each distribution warehouse in order to satisfy distribution warehouse demand while minimizing costs. The results of the study indicated that the model is efficient in solving the routing and facility location optimization problem usually encountered in supply chain management. Therefore, this study will aid supply chain analysts and managers in determining the most cost-effective route for distributing products between echelons or stages of supply chains under study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A supply chain management (SCM) method must include information sharing as a vital component in order to improve supply chain performance and boost an organisation’s strategic advantage. Since, due to a lack of trust concern over information leakage, and security breaches by nefarious individuals or groups, several organisations are hesitant to share information with their supply chain partners. This work presents a new supply chain management-based secure data transmission method. By using blockchain-based data storage, it is assumed that the manufacturers, suppliers, and customers would transfer data that must be kept private during transmission. As a consequence, this paper aims to provide an improved association rule mining with a data sanitisation scheme with an improved Apriori algorithm used in the proposed data sanitisation process. In particular, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) will generate keys by considering the objective relying on the value of the preservation ratio, false rule generation, hiding failure, and degree of modification. The weights are adjusted via a novel Minkowski distance-based Namib beetle optimisation (MDNBO) technique, which also improves the performance of the LSTM model. The reverse process of encryption occurs when encrypted data are restored at the receiving end. By contrasting it with the old methods with regard to security as well, the proposed protected data in SCM with blockchain technology will be proved to be efficient. </jats:p>",

The purpose is to determine the manufacturer’s optimal production, shipping, carbon reduction investment, and the retailer’s replenishment under the equilibrium for different carbon emission policy combinations. To develop the production inventory models, this study first develops the total profit and carbon emission functions of the supply chain members, respectively, and then obtains the optimal solutions and total profits of the manufacturer and the retailer under different carbon emission policy combinations through the mathematical analysis method. Further, this study used several numerical examples to solve and compare the proposed models. The results of numerical analysis show that regardless of the increase in carbon price or carbon tax, the manufacturer and retailer will adjust their decisions to reduce carbon emissions. Specifically, an increase in the carbon price contributes to an increase in the total profit of manufacturers, while an increase in the carbon tax reduces the total profit of manufacturers. This study also explores a sensitivity analysis on the main parameters and has yielded meaningful management insights. For instance, in cases where low-carbonization strategies are required, the manufacturer or retailer can effectively reduce the carbon emissions resulting from production or purchasing activities, thereby significantly reducing overall carbon emissions. It is believed that the results of this study can provide enterprises/supply chains with reference to their respective production, transportation, carbon reduction investment, and inventory decisions under carbon emission policies, as well as information on partner selection and how to adjust decisions under environmental changes.</jats:p>"

If the agent wins the bid, the supply is used to meet the buyer’s demand. Methodology/results: The trade agent’s single-period, single-product problem is a new type of newsvendor problem. We analyze the agent’s optimal bid for a seller with yield uncertainty. We show that the bid outcome distribution needs to satisfy an easy-to-check condition but no conditions on the yield distribution are needed for a unique optimal bid to exist. We also show that the expected sales-to-supply ratio that measures scarcity affects the optimal bid. We investigate the monotonicity of the optimal bid with respect to economic parameters, demand, and distributions of bid outcome and yield. The agent’s problem with multiple sellers is also a novel newsvendor network problem. For the two-seller case, we show when diversification is optimal for the agent. We show that working with both sellers may not always be optimal despite the opportunity for risk pooling and bidding only at the unreliable seller may be optimal even when the other seller is reliable. Managerial implications: We make the following recommendations for the agent: (i) bid at a seller only when the expected sales-to-supply ratio for a seller is higher than the critical ratio, considering the agent’s cost of underage and overage, (ii) increase the bid if the bid outcome distribution increases in the reversed hazard rate order, and (iii) increase or decrease the bid depending on the demand-to-supply ratio when a seller’s expected yield increases. Inclusion of additional sellers lowers the optimal bids across the seller network, but it may not be optimal to bid at all sellers. For the two-seller problem, whether to diversify is a decision easily made by computing the expected benefit of bidding at each seller. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2023.0190 . </jats:p>",

However, there is a lack of comprehensive data regarding the supply of rehabilitation health workers in Saudi Arabia. Aims: To determine the need for, and supply of, rehabilitation workforce, and investigate the relationship between rehabilitation workforce supply and rehabilitation needs in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This cross-sectional study measured the ratio of physiotherapists and occupational therapists per 10000 population. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health, family health survey and census data of the General Authority for Statistics and published literature. To assess the need for rehabilitation services, we computed a composite disability index based on 3 variables: count of individuals with physical disabilities, those with chronic diseases, and those aged &gt; 65 years. Determinants of the supply potential were population size, rural population percentage, and physician supply. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and simple linear regression. Results: The ratios of physiotherapists and occupational therapists working at the Ministry of Health facilities were 0.69 and 0.03 per 10 000 population, respectively. Overall rehabilitation health workforce ratio was 0.73 per 10 000. Supply varied across regions, from 0.4 for Riyadh to 2.5 for Al Jouf. Nine regions exceeded the overall ratio. Rehabilitation need index ranged from 0.144 in Najran to 0.212 in Aseer. No significant associations were found between rehabilitation workforce supply on one hand, and need and other potential determinants on the other hand. Conclusion: The rehabilitation workforce supply in Saudi Arabia surpassed the regional and global averages, but was lower than the average for high-income countries. Workforce distribution varied by region across the country and was not related to need. It is important to consider the need for rehabilitation services and context-specific factors when determining the optimal size and distribution of the rehabilitation health workforce in Saudi Arabia.</jats:p>",

In this work, the sunlight source is utilized for the Photovoltaic (PV) standalone network. The merits of sunlight sources are very optimal human resources needed, unlimited natural sources, plus easy operation. However, the solar power resource is nonlinear fashion. As a result, the operating point of the sunlight network fluctuates concerning sunlight intensity. So, in this article, the Modified Grey Wolf Methodology with Adaptive Fuzzy Logic Controller (MGWM-AFLC) is introduced to maintain the operating point of the sunlight system at the global power point position of the PV array. This controller traces the MPP with very low fluctuations in the PV-produced voltage. The advantages of this proposed method arefewer sensing devices required, less difficulty in development, more useful for rapid changes inthe sunlight temperatures, simpler to realize operation, greater economic growth, plus highly useful for household applications. The sunlight set-up generation voltage is lowwhich is improved by introducing the new Wide Power Rating High Voltage DC-DC Boost Converter (WPRHVBC). The features of this WPRHV converter are low voltage strain on semiconductor devices, few passive elements are enough to develop the circuit, plus easy understanding.</jats:p>"

This project adopted two approaches to establish a standardized capacity development process for small-town water supplies. The first approach, the Management Model, consists of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and business planning. The second approach, termed the Support Model, entails a comprehensive system for training, monitoring, and evaluating water supply management. Throughout the project, a total of 31 SOPs pertaining to operation, maintenance, and facility rehabilitation manuals were developed. Moreover, four courses consisting of training, basic and on-site training, and interactive workshops were conducted. Consequently, the data deficiency rate reduced significantly by 61%, while 87% of water samples met water quality standards. In contrast, the operating ratio and water production rates improved by 17 and 29%, respectively. The materials produced from these models are expected to contribute to small-town water supply systems beyond the pilot sites. This is due to the versatility of the model for future applications. Although the project was effectively implemented, continuous support for small-town water supply by the Government of Nepal is needed for future sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The development of predictive approaches to estimate supplier delivery risks has become vital for companies that rely heavily on outsourcing practices and lean management strategies in the era of the shortage economy. However, the literature that presents studies proposing the development of such approaches is still in its infancy, and several gaps have been found. In particular, most of the current studies present approaches that can only estimate whether suppliers will be late or not. Moreover, even if autocorrelation in data has been widely considered in demand forecasting, it has been neglected in supplier delivery risk predictions. Finally, current approaches struggle to consider macroeconomic data as input and rely mostly on machine learning models, while deep learning ones have rarely been investigated. The main contribution of this study is thus to propose a new approach that for the first time simultaneously adopts a deep learning model able to capture autocorrelation in data and integrates several macroeconomic indicators as input. Furthermore, as a second contribution, the performance of the proposed approach has been investigated in a real automotive case study and compared with those studies resulting from approaches that adopt traditional statistical models and models that do not consider macroeconomic indicators as additional inputs. The results highlight the capabilities of the proposed approach to provide good forecasts and outperform benchmarks for most of the considered predictions. Furthermore, the results provide evidence of the importance of considering macroeconomic indicators as additional input.</jats:p>"

The results show that the accuracy of this assessment algorithm is improved by 22.18% compared with the traditional assessment algorithm. Therefore, it is theoretically feasible to use the improved SVM to analyse the application effect of multimedia teaching mode in foreign language translation teaching.

The utilisation of agricultural waste for bioenergy production has acquired significant attention due to its potential to mitigate environmental impacts and provide renewable energy sources. However, the major obstacle to producing bioenergy is managing the supply chain while considering economic, environmental, and social factors in an optimal way. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the management of agriculture waste supply chains, specifically related to the use of modelling and optimisation techniques for planning. The first section describes different stages of the supply chain and various technologies for converting biomass to bioenergy. This is followed by a synopsis of the literature reviewed based on decision levels, objective functions, modelling methodologies, and optimisation approaches. Finally, the review highlights limitations and gaps in current research and the areas with potential for further exploration.</jats:p>"

Thereafter, this study proposes four strategies for moving from the loss-incurring current business model to a networked SBM for mitigating losses.

Food safety, authenticity, and sustainability are major issues that the food industry must deal with. These issues can have a big impact on customer confidence and safety. In order to properly handle these issues, traditional supply chain systems frequently lack the traceability and transparency features that are required. But blockchain technology provides a decentralized, immutable database that safely and transparently records transactions, which is a promising option. This study investigates the theoretical underpinnings and real-world uses of blockchain technology while conducting a critical analysis of the state of the food industry's supply chain using secondary data from published academic articles. It assesses the effect of blockchain technology on improving transparency and traceability in food supply chains by combining findings from other academic publications, taking into account elements like data integrity, information sharing, and stakeholder participation. This thesis emphasizes how blockchain technology has the possibility to revolutionize supply chain transparency and traceability in the food business. Through the utilization of blockchain's intrinsic characteristics, such decentralization and cryptographic security, stakeholders can augment consumer trust, alleviate hazards, and cultivate increased accountability along the food supply chain</jats:p>"

However, there is still a lack of systematic analysis regarding the legal consequences of well-known human rights scandals involving supply chains. To address this gap, the article conducted a quantitative review of various cases, examining elements such as the sectors involved, the locations of the abuses, and the parties engaged as plaintiffs. Notably, these plaintiffs range from victims in the Global South to companies questioning fines imposed upon them. Subsequently, a qualitative review was performed, involving an in-depth examination of 15 selected cases spanning more than five jurisdictions. A variety of litigation strategies was identified, including some consumers claims often overlooked by the literature. In terms of legal outcomes, only two cases held the lead company liable on the merits, both in Brazil. Most cases, particularly in the Global North courts, failed on procedural grounds due to factors such as statute of limitations, lack of traceability, and insufficient evidence.

We conducted a scoping review of literature using the Arksey and O’Malley [2005] framework to summarize and disseminate the results of available evidence in relation to TB commodities supply chain performance in the WHO African Region. We searched three electronic databases complemented by google search using relevant terms and identified 1,586 sources. Twenty-five studies published between 2009 and 2023 met the eligibility criteria, inclusive of 21 peer reviewed publications and four reports. The strengths we found included the existence of pooled procurement mechanisms [PPM], availability of funding through external sources, existence of logistics management information systems [LMIS] and integration of PSM systems into primary health care. The main challenge was frequent stock outs which mainly affected medicines for treating TB in children and those for preventing TB. Stock outs were found to follow a poverty gradient and pervasively inequitable since they disproportionately affected structurally disadvantaged populations and communities. Countries that rely on domestic mechanisms for procurement tend to be more vulnerable to stock outs due to inadequate and unpredictable financing, delayed disbursements of funds, longer procurement lead times and poor supplier management. We concluded that stock outs remain one of the foremost challenges to ending TB by 2030. We recommend leveraging existing performance-enhancing platforms such as PPMs, including utilization of such mechanisms by countries that utilize domestic resources to procure commodities. We recommend the design of people centric supply chains that are sensitive to the differentiated needs of the population to ensure that composite improvements in PSM performance do not mask underlying disparities. Context-relevant research is needed to inform future strategies for improving PSM performance.</jats:p>"

The literature review contextualizes the state of the art in studies related to the application of blockchain technology to lean manufacturing processes, as well as identifies research gaps in this field. Besides, this study models and simulates an architecture based on both the Hyperledger Fabric network and a virtual machine in the cloud environment, assessing its applicability and performance in the industrial supply chain. The analysis addresses lean aspects identified as research gaps, including integration of stakeholders in the collaborative production of customized products, conditions of flexibility and adaptability to demand variations, coordinated relationship of networks involving small and medium-sized enterprises, and behavior of various players acting simultaneously and consensually. The proposed model reveals a decentralized and nonlinear information sharing concept that demonstrates a logic of simultaneous participation of all players involved in the supply chain. The low costs and processing times identified in the simulation indicate the robustness of the system even in transactions involving a large number of companies and a large amount of data. This architecture offers an integration solution between stakeholders to support operational processes, providing insights for researchers and specialists in the adoption of innovative, reliable and inclusive information technologies for companies of different sizes or levels of development, with a focus on lean manufacturing, reduction in resource consumption and cost reduction. The developed model, which combines blockchain and cloud computing technologies applied to stages of lean production systems, presents a differentiated solution on the planning of integrated production systems, indicating the differential in this work. </jats:p>",

Based on the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which theorizes that a language's structure may affect how its speakers think, prior studies have established that using the future tense to describe future events increases one's mental distance from the future, reducing a person's concern about it. Building upon this foundation, we hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries are likely to be better prepared for future volatility in demand for their products and therefore carry higher inventory to avoid potential stockouts. We also hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries are more apprehensive about long-term relationships with their customers and hence extend longer credit terms to them. Finally, we hypothesize that firms in weak future-time reference countries have longer operating and cash conversion cycles due to carrying higher levels of inventory and extending longer credit terms to customers. The empirical results using a large global sample of 193,625 firm-year observations from 45 countries support our hypotheses. In terms of economic significance, on average, the cash conversion cycle of firms in weak future-time reference countries is ∼ 11% longer than that of firms in strong future-time reference countries. We also find that the effect of language is dominant over the influence of traditional cultural dimensions. Together, the results suggest that time encoding in the language of a firm is a determining factor in its supply chain operations. </jats:p>"

In Korea, IoT (Internet of Things)-based smart sensors are installed to reduce these leaks, and a large amount of data is collected. In this study, to solve the data uncertainty and verification of the model's field applicability, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, which is based on boosting, was selected. This choice was made through hyperparameter optimization using leak detection data obtained from leak detection sensors, as well as data refined through on-site leak detection. The area under the curve_receiver operating characteristic value for each leak class using the XGB model was 0.9955 for class 0, 0.9956 for class 1, and 0.9985 for class 2. In addition, the partial dependence plot of 120 Hz, which has the highest variable importance, was derived from analyzing the influence of the leak detection and classification model on the amount of leak vibration change at 120 Hz. Therefore, it is expectged the suggested methods can be used to build a GIS-based monitoring system for real-time leak detection by linking the developed model and the location of the leak detection sensor.</jats:p>",

Plants of the Vaccinium genus both from natural stands and commercial plantations may suffer from phosphorus deficiency, so they need to have a number of adaptations that allow them to efficiently extract phosphorus. This review addresses the following issues in relation to plants of the Vaccinium genus: sources of phosphorus for plants; the release of phosphate ions from soil components; the transport of phosphate ions into plants; and the importance of mycorrhiza in supplying phosphorus to plants. Thus, we sought to draw researchers’ attention to sources and routes of phosphorus supply of plants of the Vaccinium genus and its unexplored aspects.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the promising directions for further development of the methodology for investigating and ensuring the reliability of energy systems is the consideration of integrated energy systems. This is caused by the need for the adequate reflection of their joint operation. Previously, the authors proposed several methodological approaches based on \"node,\" \"system,\" and \"evaluation\" to assess the adequacy of an electric power system when this is operating jointly with a gas supply system. In that case, the focus was made only on high-pressure gas supply systems (simplified calculation). This work aims to consider not only the high-pressure gas systems, but also to take into account the influence of lowpressure gas systems (refined calculation) on the adequacy of electric power system. This approach appears to be more technologically advanced and corresponds to the real conditions of the functioning of integrated power systems. The studies were carried out using the “node” approach, its reference calculation being the most accurate one. The methods applied in the research are probability theory and mathematical statistics: a particular theorem on the repetition of experiments (Bernoulli's trial), calculation of probability distribution series, theorems of addition and multiplication of probabilities. A comparative analysis of reference calculations of the electric power system adequacy was carried out for simplified and refined connection schemes in the gas system (two cases were considered: a highly reliable low-pressure gas system and a low-reliability one). The calculations were performed on an illustrative example of a power system. Assessment of the load supply reliability in integrated systems must factor in the process features of the systems at issue, the block diagram of their connections, as well as the accuracy of the results obtained and the complexity of searching and preparing initial data for the corresponding research model.</jats:p>"

Information regarding research designs, year of publications, publication authors, and findings of each study were documented. Out of the obtainable preliminary 70 studies extracted from the selected databases, only 44 research papers were accepted to meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria delineated for this study, where 45 % of papers were published between 2020–2021. Five different technological research areas were addressed in this scoping review. The major technology areas were AI and the IoT, followed by Data analytics and Big data IoT, and last but not least, Blockchain technology. The main obstacles to applying technology to SCM include change management, human reception/acceptance of these technologies, technical knowledge of the workforce already in place, and the significant costs associated with implementing these solutions. Leveraging technology improves customer happiness, reduces errors, and increases organizational responsiveness. Less crucial but still important are the difficulties in locating qualified workers and the possibility that technology will surpass human performance.

This review explores the principles of circular economy and their integration into global supply chain strategies. The transition from a linear 'take-make-dispose' model to a circular model focused on resource recovery, reuse, and regeneration is driving a paradigm shift in how businesses operate and manage their supply chains. Key principles of circular economy, including designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems, are examined in the context of supply chain management. Strategies for implementing circular economy principles across various stages of the supply chain, from product design and manufacturing to distribution, consumption, and end-of-life management, are discussed. The review highlights the benefits of adopting circular economy principles in supply chain strategies, including reduced resource consumption, waste reduction, cost savings, and enhanced resilience to external shocks. Case studies and examples from diverse industries illustrate successful implementation of circular economy principles in supply chain management, demonstrating tangible environmental, social, and economic benefits. Challenges and barriers to the adoption of circular economy principles in global supply chains are also addressed, including regulatory hurdles, technological limitations, and cultural barriers. Strategies for overcoming these challenges and promoting a circular mindset among stakeholders are explored, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, innovation, and cross-sector partnerships. The integration of circular economy principles into global supply chain strategies offers significant opportunities for sustainable growth, resilience, and value creation. By embracing the principles of circularity, businesses can unlock new sources of competitive advantage while contributing to the transition towards a more sustainable and regenerative economy.\r\nKeywords: Circular Economy, Supply Chain, Sustainability, Integration, Challenges, Opportunities.</jats:p>"

To take into account both the interests of integrated energy services (IES) providers and the current power market rules in China, targeting at low-carbon energy consumption, a balancing service mode for integrated energy services providers is created herein based on the idea of balancing multiple interests of regional integrated energy services providers. It aims to break down the market barriers and address the tricky problem that the integrated energy services industry fails to establish a sophisticated industrial system under the original mode. Combining the integrated energy services with the auxiliary market of power balance, the paper analyzes the characteristics of energy flow within the system, and puts forward the optimization scheme of regional integrated energy balancing services under the low-carbon background. The objective is solved by Mayfly algorithm and compared for analysis, and the results show that the optimal daily operating cost is 2632.59 yuan and the daily carbon emission is 3869.90 kg under the typical industrial scenario. The examples provided here show that the optimization plan for integrated energy balancing services can reduce carbon emissions from the park-level integrated energy system and boost the revenue for integrated energy service providers. It provides theoretical support for the green transformation of energy enterprises and promotes the healthy development of the global integrated energy industry.</jats:p>"

The current approach to pipe management for water utilities in Sweden is mainly reactive; leaks are repaired when detected, sometimes with large costs if the leakage is extensive and critical. With this study, we want to focus on proactive pipe network management by using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to estimate the probability of leakage in water pipes. The ANN model was trained on leaks that occurred over 10 years. A comparison with leaks reported after the training shows that the model succeeds in identifying groups of pipes with a higher leakage frequency. Evaluation of both new and historical leaks in four different water pipe networks in Sweden showed that a higher prediction value from the ANN model was linked to a higher occurrence of leakage. This indicates that the ANN model succeeds in identifying some of the combinations of attributes that lead to leakage. An evaluation of the input attributes in the ANN model found that the most important attributes for leakage prediction were pipe material, pipe age, adjacent problems on the pipe stretch, pipe length and pipe dimension.</jats:p>",

As global industries increasingly demand sustainability and streamlined operations, IoT emerges as a key enabler, providing unprecedented visibility and control. This paper synthesizes findings from a broad range of literature, including case studies and empirical research, to assess the impact of IoT on supply chain dynamics. The analysis reveals that IoT facilitates real-time tracking of goods and data flow, significantly increasing transparency across all supply chain tiers. This enhanced visibility aids in proactive decision-making, compliance with regulatory standards, and adherence to sustainability criteria. Additionally, the integration of IoT is shown to streamline operations, reduce costs, and elevate customer satisfaction through more reliable and responsive service delivery. The paper concludes that while the adoption of IoT drives considerable improvements in supply chain management, it also introduces challenges such as the need for substantial infrastructure investment and ongoing concerns regarding data security and privacy. Recommendations for practitioners include adopting a phased IoT integration strategy and prioritizing robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard sensitive information. This review provides a comprehensive overview of IoT's capabilities and outlines strategic approaches to harness its full potential for transforming supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

In this study, we used the results of routine everyday analyses (EC, T, pH, ORP, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and bacteria) supplemented by experimental data from a one-year sampling campaign assessing the main cations and anions and stable isotopes δ2H and δ18O. Through these data, the statistical significance of the differences between the concentrations of the basic water quality parameters among different WSS locations was determined, together with the water retention time in the system. The results indicate minor changes in water chemical composition within the observed WSS, remaining below the prescribed Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for human consumption. However, factors such as water retention time, CaCO3 deposition, pH fluctuations, and bacterial growth may influence its suitability, which necessitates further investigation into potential risks affecting water quality.</jats:p>"

We address in depth how the 5VL diagnostics built upon 2VL, 3VL, and 4VL—two-valued diagnostics, three-valued logistics, and four-valued diagnostics. Logic (5VL) assigns five state values to the range of signal value changes, and these states are completely operational ({4}), incomplete ({3}), critical efficiency ({2}), and pre-fault efficiency ({1}). For the identical ranges of diagnostic signal values, all three of the applied state valence logics interpret failure as changes outside of their permitted ranges. Diagnostic procedures made use of an AI-based DIAG 2 system. This article’s goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the DIAG 2 intelligent diagnostic system, including its architecture, algorithm, and inference rules. Diagnosis with the DIAG 2 system is based on a well-established technique for comparing diagnostic signal vectors with reference signal vectors. A differential vector metric is born out of this examination of vectors. The input cells of the neural network implement the challenge of signal analysis and comparison. It is then possible to classify the object components’ states in the neural network’s output cells. Based on the condition of the object’s constituent parts, this approach can signal whether those parts are working, broken, or urgently require replacement.</jats:p>"

Various reasons for short‐termism have been identified, including undervaluing long‐term earnings, increased financial obstacles associated with longer investment horizons, and the adoption of financial control systems to meet investors’ demands for quarterly earnings reports. As a result, firms may opt for suboptimal short‐term investment projects while neglecting potentially valuable long‐term initiatives. Most research has focused on large corporates, which constitute a small fraction of the economy and involve multiple stakeholders. There is a significant knowledge gap regarding small owner‐managed firms that rely primarily on internal financing and bank debt for investment. Our study fills this gap by analysing a comprehensive UK finance and investment decision‐making survey of 1501 firms across all classes. The survey reveals that investment appraisal relies on a ‘payback’ period. We find that 58.8% of firms choose a payback period of 3 years or less, with shorter payback periods more prominent among the smallest firms. This suggests that financial frictions impact the investment behaviour of the smallest firms, while shareholder‐driven short‐termism influences the largest firms but only in relation to research and development projects.</jats:p>",

Beginning with historical trade paths like the Silk Road and maritime routes of exploration, we examine how these ancient arteries laid the foundation for today's interconnected global economy.  With the advent of modern transportation and technology, traditional trade routes have evolved into complex networks spanning air, land, and sea. These new highways of commerce facilitate the seamless movement of goods and services across continents, shaping the dynamics of international trade.  Crucially, this paper explores the symbiotic relationship between world trade routes and supply chains in the contemporary era. It elucidates how the efficiency and reliability of trade routes directly influence the agility and resilience of supply chains, impacting industries ranging from manufacturing to retail.  Moreover, we analyse the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging trends such as e-commerce, sustainability, and geopolitical shifts, and their implications for global trade routes and supply chain management.  By understanding the historical context and contemporary significance of world trade routes, businesses and policymakers can navigate the complexities of the modern global economy more effectively, fostering sustainable growth and prosperity for all stakeholders.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Maternal mortality rates in the United States are higher than any other developed country in the world. Most postpartum maternal deaths are directly related to adverse cardiovascular events and often occur in mothers who have had a healthy pregnancy. Although pregnancy is recognized as a cardiovascular stress test for the pregnant patient, understanding of how the longitudinal and dynamic cardiovascular adaptations during pregnancy contribute to augmented risk of cardiovascular complications through the postpartum period remains poorly understood. We propose that pregnancy-induced adaptations in the coronary circulation contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, especially during the puerperium period (1-60 days following delivery). Accordingly, this study tested the hypothesis that the balance between coronary blood flow and myocardial metabolism is compromised in the puerperium heart. Experiments were performed in anesthetized, open-chest control nulliparous (control) and primiparous (postpartum) swine during the puerperium period (35-45 days post-delivery). Systemic and coronary hemodynamic responses were assessed under baseline conditions and in response to continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine (1 – 30 μg/kg/min). Under baseline conditions, blood pressure averaged 107 ± 6 mmHg in both control and postpartum swine and was unaffected by dobutamine administration (P = 0.94). Heart rate increased from 77 ± 6 to 165 ± 9 beats/min in response to dobutamine in control swine vs. 52 ± 3 to 139 ± 13 beats/min in postpartum swine (P = 0.53). Coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen delivery were significantly diminished by ~60 ± 8% at rest in postpartum swine, which is consistent with reduced myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). The relationship between coronary blood flow and heart rate (P &lt; 0.0001) or MVO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (P = 0.0002) showed a marked parallel downward shift in postpartum swine at rest and in response to dobutamine infusion. This reduction in myocardial perfusion was associated with significant reductions in myocardial lactate uptake at rest in postpartum vs. control (0.34 μmol/min/g vs. 0.08 μmol/min/g, P = 0.02). Dobutamine increased myocardial lactate uptake in control by ~47 ± 3% with little change in the postpartum group. Together, these results suggest an ineffective matching of myocardial oxygen supply to metabolism in postpartum swine. This imbalance is consistent with increased incidence of myocardial ischemia and cardiac deaths in postpartum puerperium period. </jats:p><jats:p> This work was supported by AHA.23PRE101281, NIH R01 HL158723. </jats:p><jats:p> This is the full abstract presented at the American Physiology Summit 2024 meeting and is only available in HTML format.

Water samples were collected in nineteen (54.3%) outbreaks (in three after chlorination) with a mean time lag of 5 days (range: 1–20 days) from the first cases. A pathogen in clinical samples was identified in 20 (57.1%) outbreaks and, in 1 (6.25%), the same microorganism was isolated in both clinical and water samples. Conclusions: delays in reporting and the heterogeneity of investigations depict that the surveillance of WGDOs and response practices should be strengthened, and operational procedures should be standardised.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Unmanned aerial systems offer a cost-effective and reproducible method for monitoring natural resources in expansive areas. But the transferability of developed models, which are often based on single snapshots, is rarely tested. This is particularly relevant in rangelands where forage resources are inherently patchy in space and time, which may limit model transfer. Here, we investigated the accuracy of drone-based models in estimating key proxies of forage provision across two land tenure systems and between two periods of the growing season in semi-arid rangelands. We tested case-specific models and a landscape model, with the expectation that the landscape model performs better than the case-specific models as it captures the highest variability expected in the rangeland system. The landscape model did achieve the lowest error when predicting herbaceous biomass and predicted land cover with better or similar accuracy to the case-specific models. This reinforces the importance of incorporating the widest variation of conditions in predictive models. This study contributes to understanding model transferability in drier rangeland systems characterized by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. By advancing the integration of drone technology for accurate monitoring of such dynamic ecosystems, this research contributes to sustainable rangeland management practices.</jats:p>"

Conversely, wildfires cause damage to vegetation cover and hinder ecological restoration and/or natural regeneration processes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify - with the aid of Geographic Information Systems - the temporal and spatial likelihood of fire occurrences in spring recharge areas undergoing ecological restoration and contributing to hydroelectric reservoirs in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The findings indicated that the months with the highest probability of wildfire occurrences were August and September (accounting for 66% of cases), requiring increased attention to prevention efforts. Furthermore, locations most susceptible to fires (steeper slopes, more flammable vegetation, and higher anthropogenic use) should be treated as priorities for both prevention and ecological restoration actions.</jats:p>"

However, the field of supply chain management lacks a standardized measure to assess the competencies required for successful supply chain operations. This article aims to fill this gap by introducing the concept of Supply Chain Quotient (SCQ) as a novel measure of supply chain competence. The SCQ framework expands beyond traditional intelligence and emotional factors, considering the unique skills and characteristics required in the complex world of supply chains. Drawing from existing literature on supply chain management, human resources, and cognitive psychology, this research explores the key dimensions and components that comprise the SCQ. The paper also examines potential methodologies and approaches for assessing and quantifying the SCQ, including self-assessment tools, case studies, and behavioral assessments. By introducing the SCQ, this research contributes to the understanding and evaluation of supply chain competence, providing organizations with a framework to identify, develop, and leverage talent in their supply chain functions. Additionally, it opens avenues for future research and practical applications to enhance supply chain performance and improve overall organizational outcomes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For more than a century, circulatory physiologists have been working on their field by cultivating their own knowledge and creating a framework of their own principles. Separatism in science, however, has a bad prognosis because the laws of nature are the same in all disciplines. After the misguided development in this period, there is an urgent need to reorganise the Theory of Microcirculation. I. LAW AND ORDER IN THE THEORY OF MIKROZIRKULATION: It is important to know that in fluid mechanics one cannot simply write equations as one pleases. There is „law and order“ in science, especially in this sense that the laws of nature and the peculiarities of fluid mechanics must be observed in the theory of microcirculation in tissue also. When one writes an equation, that equation belongs only to a specific tissue model and, conversely, to a specific tissue model belongs 100% to a single equation specific to that model. In this context, the Starling equation only applies to interstitials with infinite compliance. II. METHOD: A porous tube like the blood capillary must be calculated correctly by approximating the capillary length slice by slice by \"finite elements\" to an equivalent circuit diagram. III. RESULTS: The results are surprising because a) In the closed interstitium the porous capillary automatically finds an equilibrium for different values of blood pressure (P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub>-P<jats:sub>CV</jats:sub>) over the whole capillary b) The pressure at the capillary beginning P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub>, the pressure at the capillary end P<jats:sub>CV</jats:sub>, the capillary conductance K<jats:sub>f</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub> and the colloid osmotic pressure difference Δπ=COP give a new relationship for the local flow through the capillary wall J<jats:sub>v</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>: J<jats:sub>v</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>=M<jats:sub>f</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>(P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub> -P<jats:sub>CV</jats:sub>)+Σ n<jats:sub>j</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>.Δπ<jats:sub>j</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>. (j=1 to N) (1) In this equation, the interstitial hydraulic pressure P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>=IFP is missing because it is derived from the pressure P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub> and P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> is not an active parameter. However, P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> is reduced by the amount COP=Δπ. In the state of equilibrium the second summand results to zero, so that the local current J<jats:sub>v</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub> through the capillary wall is independent of the COP=Δπ: J<jats:sub>v</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>=M<jats:sub>f</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>(P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub>-P<jats:sub>CV</jats:sub>), (2) P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>=N<jats:sub>f</jats:sub><jats:sub>μ</jats:sub>(P<jats:sub>CA</jats:sub>-P<jats:sub>CV</jats:sub>)-Δπ. (3) IV. CONCLUSIONS: The colloid osmotic pressure of the blood COP does not appear in the tissues as an opponent of the blood pressure, rather the COP supports the supply of the cells. In the lungs, COP enables respiration; in the whole body, the COP effect against the development of oedema is of extraordinary importance. Since the early days of circulatory physiology 125 years ago, circulatory physiologists have believed that this function of COP is possible because, according to Starling's equation, COP as an opponent of blood pressure Pc would reduce filtration into the interstitium. However, COP also enables these effects as an opponent of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). To understand this, it is first important to understand the situation with IFP. The IFP is a passive parameter and arises from the summative effect of the blood pressure Pc and the COP=(πc-πi), see equation (3). According to the definition Pressure= Force / Area, (4) there is no independent force in the interstitium that could cause spontaneous IFP. In the previous theory of microcirculation, the wrong tissue approximation was used, the wrong equation was calculated, and there was an irrational idea of how interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) arises and how it must be measured. They also used the wrong method to determine CFC. How could one arrive at a correct result in this case? The damage that the Starling teaching has done in 125 years cannot be overlooked. </jats:p><jats:p> No Fundings. </jats:p><jats:p> This is the full abstract presented at the American Physiology Summit 2024 meeting and is only available in HTML format.

This study examines whether the  interest rate, exchange rates, external debt and money supply can curb inflation in Nigeria.  The proxy measures of the variables under study, such as; 3-month deposit rate (ITR3), naira\\1 Us dollar exchange (EXR), government external debt (ETD), money supply (MS) and consumer price index (CPI) data used cover the period from January 1981 to December 2022. Statistical tools such as; order of integration, the Johansen co-integration test, vector error correction (VEC) model, and residual diagnostic test were adopted. The result shows that the variables except ITR3 are integrated order one and ITR3 is stationary in its normal level. The Johansen co-integration test indicates the existence of one co-integrating equation significant at 0.05 level. The estimates of the VEC model specify that of all the explanatory variables considered only 3-month deposit rate has a strong impact on inflation both in the short-run and long-run, while exchange rate has a weak effect on inflation. However, this result can form a basis to re-assess the monetary policy rate in order to control inflation in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

Each Australian gas market has followed a different trajectory, with the west being defined by large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, a relatively small domestic market, and a long-standing domestic gas reservation that historically ensured the domestic market was oversupplied and prices remained low. The east coast market instead relied for decades on supply from the Cooper and Gippsland basins which only supplied the domestic market, with both now in decline. The establishment of LNG export capacity in Queensland connected the east coast market to international markets for the first time and was followed by bans and moratoriums on gas development in some jurisdictions. Notwithstanding their very different history, both markets now face potential domestic supply shortages within a decade, and both have experienced government intervention in the past 12 months. Government’s stated aims are to lower prices, ensure ongoing investment in supply, reduce emissions, and continue LNG exports. This paper examines forecast supply and demand, the impact of government intervention, net zero policies and the importance of maintaining Australia’s export reputation as a reliable supplier.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In rural areas, there is a question of heat supply to objects for various purposes that are located in areas remote from the infrastructure. The problem of using renewable energy sources and reducing CO₂ emissions is also relevant. Such objects with decentralized heat supply can be individual residential buildings, administrative, sports, cultural facilities, as well as greenhouses, livestock complexes, and storage facilities for agricultural products. To increase the efficiency of using solar heating, it is advisable to use heat accumulators. When using decentralized heat supply, seasonal heat accumulators provide greater efficiency and autonomy. A way to increase efficiency in such systems is to use nanofluids (propylene glycol/ethylene glycol-based nanofluid) as the heat carrier. These heat carriers are non-Newtonian fluids. Most industrially important heat carriers circulating in the round channels of soil accumulators at sufficiently high shear rates demonstrate high elasticity. In recent years, the processes of unsteady flow of elastic-viscous liquids in pipes and round channels of ground heat accumulators, which are caused by the action of various factors: time-varying pressure gradient, movement of layers, their general action, etc., have been intensively studied. The non-isothermal flow of an elastic-viscous fluid under the action of a pulsed pressure gradient in a round channel of a ground heat accumulator is considered. The rheological model is a nonlinear integral model with a memory function, which depends on the invariants of the strain rate tensor. Unsteady flow is considered and comprehensively studied; a system of equations is established that describes the flow of liquid with the specified rheological equation in the gap between two coaxial cylinders. The numerical analysis showed that the rheological and thermophysical properties of the fluid have a significant impact on the development of the pressure flow of an elastic-viscous fluid in a round channel.</jats:p>",

Рассматривается группа аэропортов, оснащенная багажными системами одного производителя, планирующего снабжать их запасными частями на стадии эксплуатации. Один из аэропортов группы должен выполнять функции пассажирского пересадочного узла (хаба) для хабообразующей авиакомпании, планирующей организацию массовых трансферных перевозок между аэропортами группы. Предлагается создание эшелонированной системы обеспечения запасными частями, предусматривающей наличие складов на уровнях производителя, узлового аэропорта и остальных (периферийных) аэропортов, и использование комбинированной стратегии поставок запасных частей, предполагающей периодические поставки со склада производителя на склады аэропортов, оперативные поставки со склада узлового на склады периферийных аэропортов и, при возникновении дефицита, экстренные поставки на склад узлового аэропорта.

It is proposed to create a layered system of spare parts provision, which provides for the availability of warehouses at the manufacturer's, hub airport and other (peripheral) airports, and to use a combined strategy of spare parts supplies, which implies periodic supplies from the manufacturer's warehouse to airport warehouses, prompt supplies from the hub warehouse to peripheral airport warehouses and, in case of shortage, urgent supplies to the hub airport's warehouse. The aim is to determine the volume of spare parts periodic deliveries optimal by criterion of minimum costs of production, storage and stock replenishment. Part of the initial data is not fully defined, which corresponds to the design phase of the system, and is given in the form of fuzzy numbers. The results of the model examples testify to the validity of the considered statement of the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed spare parts supply system.</jats:p>"

While disruptions are rare, they can have catastrophic long-term economic or societal repercussions, and the recovery processes can be lengthy. These can tremendously affect the SC and make it vulnerable, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of these concerns has prompted the demand for improved disruption management by developing resilient, agile, and adaptive SC. The aim of this study is to introduce an assessment framework for prioritizing and evaluating the determinants to supply chain resilience (SCR). To analyze the empirical data, fuzzy criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (fuzzy CRITIC) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) have been incorporated. Fuzzy CRITIC method was used to identify the critical determinants and fuzzy TOPSIS method was applied for determining relative ranking of some real-world companies. Finally, by developing propositions an interpretive triple helix framework was proposed to achieve SCR. This research stands out for its originality in both methodology and implications. By introducing the novel combination of Fuzzy CRITIC and Fuzzy TOPSIS in the assessment of determinants to SCR and applying these determinants with the help of interpretive triple helix framework to establish a resilient SC, this study offers a unique and valuable contribution to the field of SCR. The key findings suggest that ‘Responsiveness’ followed by ‘Managerial coordination and information integration’ are the most significant determinant to achieve SCR. The outcome of this work can assist the managers to achieve SCR with improved agility and adaptivity.</jats:p>"

The main aim of this study is to enhance comprehension of the diverse factors that influence beef supply and demand within Indonesia’s beef production system. The disparity between beef consumption and beef production in Indonesia has been acknowledged as contributing to the nation’s reliance on beef imports, impacting food security inside the country. The per capita beef consumption in Indonesia remains relatively low compared to the global average. Indonesia has achieved a level of beef self-sufficiency amounting to 71%. However, the Indonesian government has set a goal of attaining a 90% fulfillment of domestic production to satisfy the increasing demand of the people adequately. This research utilizes a qualitative system dynamics methodology to examine the impacts of pricing, cow population, and beef production technology in Indonesia by applying causal loop and stock-flow diagrams. The findings of this study will offer significant insights to assist the government in understanding the causal relationships between several factors related to the improvement of beef production policies in Indonesia.</jats:p>",

PPP, risk management, and stakeholders have tight linkages conceptually and through framework. This research aims to map the necessary stakeholders involved in non-regional water supply provision with a risk-based approach to mitigate the risks arising from them. The methodology used in this research is a mixed method using risk identification analysis and stakeholder mapping and identification. The result shows that there are 10 stakeholders in the non-regional PPP water projects, which are split into 3 categories those are key stakeholders, supporting stakeholders, and participating stakeholders. Each stakeholder has the potential to trigger risk in a non-regional PPP water project that sums up to 10 risks. Through this authoritative approach and the relevant support, stakeholders can mitigate the risks that exist in non-regional PPP water projects.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, relying solely on the measurement of China’s overall food security status through total grain output is inherently biased and neglects to capture the comprehensive nature of food security. This study adopts a food supply and demand balance perspective and constructs an evaluation indicator system for food security based on indicators such as grain yield per unit area, <jats:italic>per capita</jats:italic> grain possession, grain inventory, and inventory ratio. The weight of each indicator in the food security system is calculated using the entropy value method, and a comprehensive evaluation of China’s food security level from 1980 to 2017 is conducted. The study revealed that China’s food supply and demand exhibited a discernible upward trajectory in development. Notably, the food supply demonstrated greater volatility, whereas the food demand remained relatively stable but experienced incremental growth. Between approximately 1985 and 1993, China’s food supply and demand subsystem briefly experienced a state of mild imbalance, followed by a state of moderate imbalance around 2003. These imbalances were primarily attributed to insufficient effective food supply. In terms of the equilibrium between supply and demand in the context of food security, China’s food supply and demand exhibit a predominantly balanced condition with a slight surplus, wherein the adequacy of food supply significantly influences food security. Furthermore, the provision of policy support serves as a robust assurance for food security, and China’s existing policy framework for food security demonstrates a constructive impact.</jats:p>"

In a dual-channel green supply chain (DCGSC), customers experience products at offline stores and buy them online (free-riding). Often imprecise cognitive biases (“fairness concern” and “overconfidence”) are observed among the supply chain (SC) members. With these facts, this study introduces the free-riding and above cognitive biases in a DCGSC with a manufacturer selling a green product through own online and offline retail channels and examines their effects. A centralized and four decentralized models (for green and nongreen products) are formulated depending upon channel members’ cognitive biases individually and jointly with and without free-riding. The fuzzy objectives and constraints are made deterministic using expectation and possibility measures, respectively. Models are solved and illustrated numerically. The results indicate that free-riding is harmful and beneficial to retailer and manufacturer, respectively. Manufacturer’s overconfidence enhances the retailer’s profit but decreases or increases own profit depending upon the salvage value. Retailer’s fairness concern is catastrophic for manufacturer but beneficial for her. Product greening increases manufacturer’s profit than the carbon tax regulation for lower emissions. In addition to above observations, for maximum profit, management should not go for greening beyond an optimum level. </jats:p>",

An open-ended survey questions were used to determine how IT technology affects pharmaceutical logistics and supply chain using non-probability sampling, logistics managers' LinkedIn accounts were selected for the sample, irrespective of the organization's size, location, or gender.  SPSS statistical tools were used to analyse the data. It was found that the integration of IT tools and systems has emerged as a crucial enabler in this process. By harnessing the power of data analytics, IoT (Internet of Things), and automation, pharmaceutical companies can gain real-time insights into their supply chains. This, in turn, allows them to develop agile responses to changing market dynamics and customer expectations. Such strategic decisions, driven by IT, enable businesses to adapt quickly, reorganize their operations, and offer value-added services tailored to the specific needs of the market. Moreover, the creative application of IT solutions facilitates efficient inventory management, demand forecasting, and tracking of pharmaceutical products from manufacturing facilities to end consumers results also show that companies may simply increase the pace of the supply chain with the aid of innovative chances in major choices and judgments. </jats:p>"

First, it aims to examine how IPs act as triggers of GIs in different aspects of business and reciprocal impact these innovations have on CSCP and GSCP. This study contributes to existing literature by exploring the significance of BDAC as a moderator in GIs–GSCP relationship, providing new understandings about technology relating issues on sustainable business practices. The researchers used partial least squares‐structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM) to validate the constructs and hypotheses in a survey of 322 executives from different industries in India. The findings indicate that IP is a significant driver of business to GI, which in turn makes a considerable contribution to the establishment and improvement of GSCP. The study also exposed the differential moderation of BDAC on different types of GIs influencing GSCP. The fact that GSCP is instrumental in influencing the development of CSCP illustrates the integrated nature of sustainability practices in the supply chain domain. The empirical evidence provided by this study contributes to the literate of institutional theory especially as it relates to sustainability. It also enhances the existing knowledge by clarifying the sophisticated effect of big data analytics on GSCPs. This comprehensive approach gives a deeper view, especially in the manufacturing sector, which helps to develop more specific strategies of supply chain sustainability advancement.</jats:p>",

The problem faced by Alvian MSMEs today is supply chain activities and production that are usually late so that products experience a decrease in buying interest from customers. To overcome these problems, MSMEs mitigate risks in supply chain and production activities using the HOR (House Of Risk) Method. Based on Hor phase 1, 12 risk events and risk agents were obtained. The identification results show that  the highest risk agent is low-quality raw materials (A9). This risk agent has the highest value because it can cause risk events in the form of poor quality or defects (E9). In HOR phase 2, 6 priorities were obtained for risk mitigation to prevent system failure (PA3), implementing preventive maintenance routines is a top priority. With an ETDk value of 10386, PA3 mitigation measures can reduce risk factors such as manufacturing defects, misconceptions of customer specifications, and quality testing problems, improper maintenance, overuse, system failure, technical problems with printing machines, staff or management failures, no routine monitoring of machine checks (A11,A8,A4,A5,A7).</jats:p>"

Through water management and water quality models, a series of simulations were conducted, introducing variations in the outflows of the Loriguilla reservoir to evaluate the effects of different environmental flow scenarios on water quality, particularly at the location of the intake for the water supply to Valencia. Three environmental flow scenarios were analyzed, alongside an alternative management scenario, considering their implications on water quality and reliability of water demand. The findings of this paper, particularly the nitrate (NO3−) concentration evolution, highlight the influence of minimum e-flow and e-flow regimes on water quality within the basin. These results suggest that while modifying the current flow regime can lead to some improvements in nitrate concentrations at the Valencia supply intake point, the primary cause of high nitrate concentrations is attributed to irrigation return flow and the pre-existing contamination of the aquifer. This analysis offers valuable insights into the complexities of water quality management in regulated basins, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to address the diverse factors influencing water quality and demand supply reliability.</jats:p>"

With MRT's history of industry grounding, the supply chain field offers a strong fit for the development of MRT, but arguably this potential has been underexploited by supply chain management (SCM) researchers. Several conceptual articles have encouraged greater use of MRT and offered important tips, but no step‐by‐step demonstrations appear in the literature. Such a demonstration could guide supply chain scholars seeking to better implement MRT as well as lead other scholars to start pursuing MRT. In this article, we develop a five‐step process and apply it using an MRT (i.e., warm glow theory) and a series of experiments. The experiments focus on how local businesses might shape demand in their favor during societal crises. We discuss how the results inform local businesses and the crisis context but may have limited generalizability to other organizations and normal conditions. Overall, we describe and explain a systematic and viable approach, albeit not the only viable approach, for using MRT to advance SCM research.</jats:p>",

We study how the operational dynamics of SCs influence the efficacy of key resilience capabilities, specifically flexibility and visibility. Utilizing a system dynamics simulation model, we analyze the contingency effects within Finnish grocery SCs, examining how the operational tempo—characterized by lead times, inventory buffers, information updating—affects the efficiency of resilience strategies in response to diverse disruption scenarios. Our model, informed by real-world disruption events and responses, reveals distinct preferences for resilience capabilities based on SC operational dynamics. For fast-moving SCs, flexibility in ramping up capacity emerges as paramount, whereas for slower SCs, enhanced visibility becomes crucial. We contribute to the contingent Resource-Based View (RBV) on SC resilience by proposing that responsiveness is important moderator of flexibility and visibility as resilience capabilities. We highlight the importance of prevention of phantom ordering through improved visibility and caution against destocking following sudden demand declines. By aligning operational dynamics with tailored resilience strategies, our research offers actionable insights for SC managers aiming to navigate future disruptions more effectively.</jats:p>"

In the PCSC, untimely (early or late) delivery of prefabs can lead to project time and cost overruns. To mitigate this challenge, the building contractor requires the logistics provider to reduce the shipping time variability, which is termed the SLTH strategy. While this benefits the building contractor, it also puts more investment and operational pressures on the logistics provider. To solve this conflict, we introduce a coordination mechanism which involves two terms: an SLTH level related cost term is charged by the logistics provider to the building contractor, and a constant transfer term is adopted to fairly allocate the system surplus. Three decentralized models are investigated: <jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., two Stackelberg game models with alternative decision-making sequences and an equal power model. Further comparative analysis and numerical studies reveal that our proposed coordination mechanism increases the SLTH level and ensures a win–win situation.

In Malaysia, the Energy Commission has conducted biannual reviews of fuel and other generation costs. Any cost savings or increases identified during these reviews will be passed on to customers in the form of rebates or surcharges. Meanwhile, if an increment in the ICPT price signal can be provided to electricity providers and consumers, early preparation for operation budgeting can be realised, and energy management program development can be properly prepared. Due to this reason, this study proposes ICPT price forecasting for the electricity market in Peninsular Malaysia that will benefit the stakeholders. The study aims to construct an ICPT-related baseline model for the peninsular generation data by employing three forecasting methods. The forecasting performance is analysed using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). In light of our findings, the ARIMA method is one of the most accurate forecasting methods for fuel prices compared to the moving average (MA) and LSSVM methods. The observed price differences between the ARIMA and LSSVM models for ICPT are minimal. The ICPT price for July–December 2022 and January–June 2023 is MYR 0.21/kWh for the ARIMA and MYR 0.18/kWh for LSSVM, which are close to the actual TNB’s ICPT tariff. As for forecasting, the ICPT price is expected to drop in the next announcement. The findings of this study may have a positive impact on the sustainability of the energy sector in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

The findings showed that farmer carbon supply was elastic at intermediate prices ($20–50/Mg), but inelastic at low ($10–20/Mg) and high ($50–70/Mg) price levels. While perceived co‐benefits play significant roles in promoting participation at low‐price levels, variables such as age, education, farm size, and soil quality are more likely to influence producers' choices at intermediate‐ and high‐price levels. To enhance farmers' support for carbon programs, measures should be taken to improve benefit, while reducing cost and uncertainty.</jats:p>",

As the digital age has given new connotations to supply chain integration, the impact of supply chain integration on the quality of internal controls in manufacturing companies is becoming increasingly significant. The influence of digital-intelligent supply chain integration on the internal control quality of manufacturing businesses is examined theoretically in this paper using the literature analysis approach, and a corresponding improvement route is proposed. The study finds that supply chain integration using digital intelligence technology affects the quality of internal control of manufacturing enterprises in three aspects: information integration, operation integration, and organizational integration. The study's conclusion offers manufacturing companies theoretical direction on how to strengthen internal control through supply chain integration, which is crucial for their ability to transform, upgrade, and become more competitive in the age of digital intelligence.</jats:p>"

VMI involves suppliers taking an active role in managing customer inventory levels and fostering real-time communication and data sharing. The Inventory Routing Problem addresses the challenge of optimizing delivery routes while simultaneously managing inventory levels. The benefits of implementing VMI in IRP include improved demand forecasting, reduced stockouts and overstock situations, and optimized routing and transportation. The study applies a method that strategically integrates Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) into the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) framework, utilizing real-time data sharing and optimized routing algorithms to enhance supply chain efficiency. This approach is evaluated through research findings highlighting its benefits and implementation challenges. Thus, we discuss the potential advantages and challenges associated with this integration. While VMI in IRP offers substantial benefits, data security, cultural shifts, and IT system integration must be addressed for successful implementation. This article provides insights into the promising synergy between VMI and IRP, offering organizations a competitive edge in the dynamic supply chain management landscape.</jats:p>"

In a rapidly changing environment, gaining a competitive edge is imperative. However, the exploration of the essential factors enabling resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects has been lacking. This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying the enabling factors for resilient and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). To achieve this, a survey was conducted among Egyptian engineers, involving 32 factors derived from an extensive literature review on RSSCM. The data collected were categorised into four groups, namely Organisational Knowledge and Competence, Risk Management and Security, Collaboration and Communication, and Planning Efficiency and Timing, using brainstorming techniques. Subsequently, the data were analysed utilising a novel hybrid assessment approach that combines evaluation of alternatives and ranking, employing the compromise solution-fuzzy synthetic evaluation methodology, for the first time, offering a unique approach to assessing and prioritising these categories. The findings reveal that ‘Planning Efficiency and Timing’ emerged as the highest-performing category, whereas ‘Collaboration and Communication’ performed the worth. Furthermore, our results indicate that brainstorming enabled the grouping of the enablers into four distinct categories, providing a structured framework for understanding and organising them. The integration of MARCOS and FSE offered a robust decision-making approach, proposing a resilient and comprehensive decision-support system capable of tackling intricate real-world issues. This research outcome offers building administrators valuable insights for comparing different supply chains, considering how supply chain characteristics influence resilience and risk exposure in building SCs.</jats:p>"

The cost of supply often represents a significant proportion of the total value of the resource. However, there is limited insight into the current supply costs of wastes, residues and by-products. This includes straw, which is the most important agricultural by-product in Germany.

We also consider storage costs and opportunity costs associated with nutrient replacement and conduct sensitivity analyses to measure their impact. To validate our calculations, we compare them with actual straw prices. To establish a reliable cost monitoring system, we propose an approach to assess the quality of input data.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Result</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>In 2011, the regional supply costs for straw varied from 45.72 EUR/Mg[FM] to 92.92 EUR/Mg[FM], showing a wide range. Over the years, the German average supply cost for straw increased from 56.78 EUR/Mg[FM] in 2010 to 58.79 EUR/Mg[FM] in 2020, with a peak of 61.24 EUR/Mg[FM] in 2018. This suggests that the temporal impact on mass-specific costs is relatively moderate compared to the spatial distribution of supply costs. The sensitivity analysis highlights storage time and costs, straw yield and wage levels as the main drivers of supply costs. Doubling the storage period from 3 to 6 months increases total costs by 20%. On average, the costs explain 75% of the straw price across all federal states, depending on annual price and cost levels. The quality assessment of input data shows that currently 68% of the data cannot be automatically extracted for continuous monitoring.

A total of 260 responses were collected from those who participated in the survey. Statistically, exploratory factor analysis, Varimax factorial rotation, KMO, CFI, TLI and RSMA tests were used. The results show that BSC was not a significant predictor of CS; however, the BSC variable is a significant predictor of the dimensions of the CS variable. In these circumstances the BSC model assumes the role of evaluator of the management strategies developed in ACES and improver of the predictor level of CS and its dimensions. \r\n \r\n \r\nReceived: 1 December 2023 / Accepted: 7 April 2024 / Published: 5 May 2024</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The topics of green human resource management (GHRM) and green supply chain management (GSCM) have gained significant popularity within the fields of HRM and operations management, respectively. Scholars in various fields have been making progress in exploring the contributions of GSCM and GHRM towards the development of sustainable firms. However, it is worth noting that integrating these two cutting-edge topics has been significantly delayed, mostly due to a substantial gap in the integration of SCM and HRM. The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive framework that combines and enhances the interaction between these two elements, as well as to suggest a research agenda for further exploration of this integration. This study employs the ability-motivation-opportunity theory framework to examine the influence of GHRM, GSCM, and environmental strategy on firm performance. The researchers employed a structural equation model to examine the hypotheses, utilizing a sample of 640 survey questionnaires obtained from manufacturing firms. The findings indicate that there is a positive relationship between GHRM and firm performance. Additionally, the findings indicate that GSCM serves as a positive and significant mediator in the association between GHRM and firm performance. Ultimately, the study’s results and ramifications are revealed to serve as valuable policy tools for various entities such as manufacturing firms, administrations, and other relevant parties of supply chain.\n \nReceived: 18 November 2023| Revised: 20 March 2024 | Accepted: 16 April 2024\n \nConflicts of Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nThe data that support this work are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Government intervention plays an indispensable role in the development of the elderly care service supply chain (ECSSC). However, no research has focused on the optimal decision-making of the ECSSC considering government intervention under different channel power structures. This study establishes a three-stage ECSSC model, including the government sector, elderly care service provider and elderly care service integrator, while considering different government intervention measures and channel power structures. The service-level elasticity coefficient is defined as an uncertain variable, that can affect service demand and ESI service costs. This study explores the optimal decisions and market performance of the government and ECSSC under different channel power structures and government intervention, providing guidance for the ECSSC development and government decision-making. The results show that, first, government intervention is beneficial for the ECSSC, customers, and social welfare. Compared with the subsidy and service-level regulation scenario, only the former is beneficial for the supply chain, social welfare, and unit customer expenditure, but at the cost of lower service level and higher government expenditure. Second, different channel power structures do not affect service level, social welfare, and unit customer expenditure. However, the ESI-dominated structure favors ECSSC development. Third, the setting of the reward-penalty factor should not be too high, as, in this case, supply chain members, customers, and social welfare will benefit from the increased expected value of service level elasticity. At last, managerial insights are presented.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, food losses produce approximately 8% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study develops a food loss estimation tool to assess how improved access to the cold chain could impact food loss and its associated GHG emissions for seven food types in seven regions. This study estimates that poor cold chain infrastructure could be responsible for up to 620 million metric tons (Mmt) of food loss, responsible for 1.8 GtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-eq annually. Utilizing fully optimized cold chains could save over 100 Mmt of fruit and vegetable loss in South &amp; Southeast Asia and over 700 Mmt CO2-eq in Sub-Saharan Africa. Developing more localized, less industrialized (‘farm-to-table’) food supply chains in both industrialized and non-industrialized contexts may save greater quantities of food than optimized cold chains. Utilizing localized supply chains could save over 250 Mmt of roots and tubers globally (over 100 Mmt more savings than those of an optimized cold chain) and reduce GHG emissions from meat losses in industrialized regions by over 300 Mmt CO2-eq. Due to the differences in the environmental intensity of food types, cold chain investments that prioritize reducing overall food losses will have very different outcomes than those that prioritize reducing GHG emissions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nervousness is thought to be a source of confusion, instability, or uncertainty in SC systems due to disruptions and frequent changes in decisions. Nervousness persists even with consistent SCs, which arise from planning flexibility in response to changes, where responsiveness and customer satisfaction balance. Although the term “nervousness” is well known, to our knowledge no prior research has examined and explored supply chain nervousness strategies (SCNSs). This research explores supply chain nervousness strategies, factors, reduction methods, and recent trends in the supply chain’s relationship with nervousness. The main purpose of this research is to determine the comprehensive and relevant nervousness strategies in the supply chains, especially in light of the unprecedented development and change in business, economics, and technology and the fierce competition. SCN strategies are introduced in a developed model to designate SCN measurements and indicators, mitigation strategies and stages, and management strategies. The fuzzy PROMETHEE method is employed to rank the strategies based on their importance and order of implementation. The suggested method for managing nervousness is then presented with a numerical case, along with the results. The research outcomes indicate that the top five strategies for managing nervousness include planning continuity, utilizing technology, managing nervousness, improving the SC cyber system, and managing supplies. The findings assist decision makers, practitioners, and managers in focusing on SC improvement, resilience, and sustainability.</jats:p>"

The life and health of people is the most important asset of any nation. The population of Russia has been steadily decreasing in recent decades due to natural and migration decline. In the Far Eastern Federal District (FEFD), the demographic situation is especially acute: over the last three decades, the population has decreased by 22,3 %. The main reason is the rapid decline in the standard of living of the population. In turn, the demographic situation is significantly influenced by housing conditions, the level of food supply and the quality of nutrition. The population of the Far Eastern regions eats irrationally: people compensate for the energy and nutrients not received in protein foods and vegetable and melon products by excessive consumption of baked goods, pasta and cereals. This diet contributes to an increase in morbidity and a reduction in life expectancy. These problems are especially acute in regions with high poverty, low living standards and low social productivity. The most problematic in terms of the standard of living of the population are the Jewish Autonomous Region, the Trans-Baikal Region and the Republic of Buryatia: the median per capita cash income of residents of these regions allows them to buy no more than 4 minimum sets of food per month (in Russia as a whole – 5,7 sets), housing conditions are the worst in the Far Eastern Federal District. To improve the quality of food supply and living standards of the population in the regions, it was proposed to strengthen the social responsibility of the state and take comprehensive measures to increase real cash incomes; development of social entrepreneurship and social partnership; restoration and development of production in the regions of necessary products - milk, eggs, melons and vegetables. This will require significant investment in the rural economy of the Far Eastern regions to ensure growth in production volumes and development of human capital.</jats:p>",

This study was carried out in two steps: the realization of the analytical calculation of a helical wind turbine power output which then informed the design and construction of the rotor blades. The paper particularly aimed to address its use as the electricity supply for residential properties or any other places with less ideal economy conditions. The uncomplicated and highly accessible mechanism using basic materials is to give people to have a viable option on their own electricity production. The world is increasingly going green in its energy use. Wind power is a green renewable source of energy that can compete effectively with fossil fuel as a generator of power in the electricity market. For this effective competition, the production cost must be comparable to that of fossil fuels or other sources of energy. The initial capital investment in wind power goes to machine and the supporting infrastructure. Any factors that lead to decrease in cost of energy such as turbine design, construction and operation are key to making wind power competitive as an alternative source of energy.</jats:p>"

The article investigates the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and implications of its implementation for the energy systems of countries with high carbon footprint.\nObjectives. The aim is to create a forecast of changes in the balance of the country's energy supply system, considering the gradual introduction of the CBAM with a decrease in the number of free permits for non-payment of declared emissions, and an increase in the coverage of emissions.\nMethods. The study employs methods of statistical analysis.\nResults. The study established that the introduction of the CBAM creates economic threats for exporting countries with a high carbon footprint. A national emissions trading system is a means of combating it. The paper shows that with the forecast price of carbon permits obtained on the basis of time series extrapolation, the introduction of a system of emission quotas will reduce losses in GDP and the total energy capacity of the country's energy system.\nConclusions. The establishment of the system of emission quotas is a complex and lengthy process that requires the development and testing of economic and financial mechanisms.</jats:p>",

To cater to this trend, we establish a platform supply chain model by considering a manufacturer with capital constraints that invests in a green production program. Then, it can sell green products via the reselling or the agency channel on a platform and finance from a bank, the platform, or both. In this context, we examine the choices of financial strategies and selling channels from the perspectives of both parties, as well as the corresponding environmental benefit and social welfare. Our findings show that the manufacturer prefers bank financing in most cases when the bank's interest rate is smaller than that offered by the platform. However, in the reselling channel, the manufacturer may choose platform financing even if its interest rate is higher. The platform tends to provide the agency channel when the commission rate is within a reasonable range. It is possible to realize the highest environmental benefit and social welfare in specific regions where both parties agree on the financing and selling modes to maximize their profits. When the manufacturer has only partial access to bank financing, it can choose mixed financing. However, the manufacturer cannot always treat mixed financing as a complete replacement of bank financing.</jats:p>",

Pressure on utilities to promote social assistance programs in addition to an efficient service has risen toward providing water as affordable as possible. This study shows the positive impact of efficient services on families' water affordability by analyzing the new Brazilian water loss goals and the potential effect of water loss reduction on total expenses reported in the Brazilian utilities' National Water and Sanitation Information System. The total service cost for water and sanitation (before and after the aforementioned goals) was then translated to average tariff per cubic meter and affordability ratios. The potential water volume saved in physical losses can reach up to 16.6% of the water consumed in the country, and although the impact on water affordability was timid, the positive results indicate utilities have an important role in assuring water and sanitation for all, and regulators must be involved toward taking a deep look at local conditions.</jats:p>",

A similar situation occurs with groups of companies which maintain their original brands but have centralized their manufacturing operations. This leads to the same kind of product being manufactured in different plants or under different brand names. In the context of a methodology for the redesign of supply chains, this tool evaluates the synergistic manufacturing in the chains and the minimum costs. The presented linear programs analyse how a better assignment of products to plants can be achieved in terms of costs, according to the resources used, while simultaneously improving the synergistic indicators. Two optimization models are proposed: the first, to obtain the best configuration at a given time, and the second, to manage the manufacturing of car models during several years. The case study is set in the automotive sector, using data from a group of companies with several brands. The application shows that the various plants have common resources, and synergies are feasible. This is justified after evaluating the costs, according to the resources needed. The new assignment of car models to plants takes these synergies into account and the new resource requirements are defined, also considering synergies. In the case study the best decisions in cost for some synergy levels in 10 years are determined. The results show that good synergy levels can be achieved with acceptable increases in costs.</jats:p>"

Risk reduction is implemented throughout the supply chain of SME that manufacture character pillows, doormats, floor mattresses, and scouring pads. This company's supply chain has various issues, including variations in client demand, volatility in the number of products produced, and the company's failure to effectively oversee the supply chain, which results in decreased quality and decreased customer satisfaction. The goal of this study is to use the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach to mitigate supply chain risk and develop solutions to minimize or eliminate supply chain risk with the highest RPN and risk score. The risk mitigation approach was employed in this study, with three stages: risk identification, evaluation, and risk analysis, as well as establishing a risk mitigation strategy. The FMEA approach of risk mitigation yielded the three highest RPN (Risk Priority Number) values of the 31 supply chain concerns. These three dangers are inaccuracies in the number of products produced, consumer complaints against companies, and rapid changes in production orders. Our findings theoretically highlight the risks that arise in SME supply chain operations, such as planning, sourcing, manufacturing, delivery, and return. Meanwhile, organizations can use the research findings to coordinate their supply chain plans.</jats:p>"

The aim of the work was development, analysis and identification of conditions to improve the energy efficiency of the proposed combined system which provides increased generation capacity for decentralised heat supply. The proposed approach allowed solving the problem of improving energy and environmental performance in a two-stage scheme of heat generators with the regulation of the temperature of the used heat carrier to a rational value using the heat pump technology, consistent with the standard temperature schedule. The most important result of the analytical study of the combined decentralised heat supply system is the established generalised dependence for determining the actual conversion factor in the heat pump operation. It makes it possible to qualitatively analyse the dependence of the energy efficiency of the heat supply system on temperature changes of characteristic low-potential sources, the ratio of water flows and their distribution for municipal, domestic and industrial-technological needs. The results of the analytical study of the improved heat supply system create a basis for its development taking into account the characteristic conditions of decentralised heat supply and operating modes of municipal and industrial-technological enterprises. </jats:p>",

The outbreak can be considered a health crisis, but due to the measures taken to control the spread of the virus, it also exposed the global medical supply chain’s vulnerability. Formal authorities struggling to restore the supply chain caused serious problems in the crisis response as the supply of vital medical equipment was scrutinized. However, unexpected allies including social entrepreneurial initiatives provided bottom-up solutions to restore the broken supply chain. This paper seeks to bring attention to how social entrepreneurs respond to a crisis alongside the formal crisis governance system and generate resources related to product development and logistics. By presenting a case study about how Refugee Company’s “Mondmaskerfabriek” (Face Mask Factory) engaged with the cross-border dimension of the COVID-19 crisis, we show how a social enterprise was able to establish a supply chain and domestically produce personal protection equipment. As the article shows, both crisis management scholars and policy makers should pay more attention to the potential of social entrepreneurial activities during crisis.</jats:p>",

For example, ecoinvent only provides rest‐of‐world and European datasets for photovoltaic panel production, consuming the same global consumption mix of photovoltaic cells. Global or continental activities and trade limit the use of existing country activities, such as electricity production, and the accuracy and granularity of LCA results. We addressed this issue by disaggregating ecoinvent's global and continental unit processes to the country level and by regionalizing trade using country‐sector‐specific consumption mixes of product origins from the multiregional input–output table EXIOBASE. This produced a consistently regionalized ecoinvent at country level. Comparing the climate change impacts of 195,708 non‐market datasets in our regionalized ecoinvent with reference datasets in ecoinvent reveals manufacturing sectors as the most affected. The study of photovoltaic panel production shows that the differences in climate change impacts are mainly due to the different country‐specific suppliers of components and their electricity mixes, which are lost in the aggregated original data. The water consumption impacts of wheat production show the country differences only when regionalized CFs are applied, indicating that regionalized biosphere and technosphere flow amounts are needed for better results. The mapping quality between ecoinvent and EXIOBASE and inconsistent market definitions were discussed along with further limitations. Our study highlights the potential of incorporating better trade information and regional disaggregation in LCI databases to improve the LCA outcomes.</jats:p>",

This underscores the importance of continued support and investment in this sector. We were also impressed by the fact that Ethiopia has become a major player in the global flower market. The country's export-oriented approach has enabled it to compete with other top flower-producing countries, such as Kenya and Ecuador. This not only showcases Ethiopia's potential and capabilities in the flower industry, but also serves as a source of pride for the country. The study also highlighted some of the challenges faced by the Holeta flower farm, such as access to market information. This is a crucial aspect that can greatly affect sales volume and profitability. Therefore, it is essential for stakeholders to collaborate and develop strategies to improve access to market information, which will ultimately benefit the entire industry. Furthermore, the study identified several determinants that significantly influence sales volume, including the sex and education level of employees, product type, competition, and farm size. This information can be used by the Holeta flower farm and other industry players to better understand their market and make informed decisions to improve sales and profitability. We appreciated the use of both primary and secondary data in this study, as well as the thorough analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. The inclusion of tables, figures, and STATA software also made the findings more comprehensible and reliable.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Groundwater plays a key role in meeting water demands, supplying over 40 % of irrigation water globally, with this role likely to grow as water demands and surface water variability increase. A better understanding of the future role of groundwater in meeting sectoral demands requires an integrated hydro-economic evaluation of its cost and availability. Yet substantial gaps remain in our knowledge and modeling capabilities related to groundwater availability, feasible locations for extraction, extractable volumes, and associated extraction costs, which are essential for large-scale analyses of integrated human-water systems scenarios, particularly at the global scale. To address these needs, we developed Superwell, a physics-based groundwater extraction and cost accounting model that operates at 0.5° (≈50x50 km) gridded spatial resolution with global coverage. The model produces location-specific groundwater supply-cost curves that provide the levelized cost to access different quantities of available groundwater. The inputs to Superwell include recent high-resolution hydrogeologic datasets of permeability, porosity, aquifer thickness, depth to water table, and hydrogeological complexity zones. It also accounts for well capital and maintenance costs, and the energy costs required to lift water to the surface. The model employs a Theis-based scheme coupled with an amortization-based cost accounting formulation to simulate groundwater extraction and quantify the cost of groundwater pumping. The result is a spatiotemporally flexible, physically-realistic, economics-based model that produces groundwater supply-cost curves. We show examples of these supply-cost curves and the insights that can be derived from them across a set of scenarios designed to explore model outcomes. The supply-cost curves produced by the model show that most nonrenewable groundwater in storage globally is extractable at costs lower than 0.23 USD/m3, while half of the volume remains extractable at under 0.138 USD/m3. We also demonstrate and discuss examples of how these cost curves could be used by linking Superwell’s outputs with other models to explore coupled human-environmental systems challenges, such as water resources planning and management, or broader analyses of multi-sectoral feedbacks.\n                        </jats:p>"

This study contributes to the academic understanding of the role of supply chain decisions in real estate profitability, providing a foundation for further research in the field. 3 hypotheses linking tactical, operational and strategic supply chain decisions with overall business performance were formulated. A multiple regression model was estimated using 362 questionnaire observations collected from Kurdistan real estate companies’ supply chain managers, project managers, procurement officers, and executives involved in decision-making processes in Erbil. The findings demonstrated that tactical, operational and strategic supply chain decisions positively impact overall business performance. Of paramount importance are the findings denoting that tactical supply chain decisions insignificantly enhance overall business performance because of their short-term nature. The study concludes that understanding and effectively implementing tactical supply chain decisions can lead to a direct and significant impact on overall business profitability. To optimize tactical supply chain decisions to positively impact overall business profitability and ensure a competitive edge in the market, real estate managers can strategies encompassing the application of data-driven decision making, integrated supply chain planning, optimize inventory management, vendor and supplier collaboration, streamlined procurement processes, and efficient transportation and logistics methods.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the Pareto solution sets at various model periods are investigated. In addition, the model examined the effect of dynamic government adjustments on carbon emission limitations. The paper conducts an analysis of the fundamental factors contributing to system instability and evaluates the influence of various factors on the model's stability. At the same time, we also discussed the influence of government adjustment strategy on retail decision‐making and stability. The results highlight that the instability of the system is mainly caused by the adjustment strategy of the market leader, whereby the system becomes increasingly unstable as the market leader's position becomes stronger.

Introduction of obstetric High-dependency unit (HDU) has been described as an effective strategy to bridge this gap in resource-restricted settings.\r\n \r\nObjective: To describe the clinical characteristic and maternal outcomes of obstetric patients admitted to the first obstetric HDU in Ethiopia.\r\nStudy Design:  This was a descriptive study on clinical characteristics and maternal outcomes of obstetric patients admitted to obstetric HDU over one year (October 2021 to September 2022) at St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College (Ethiopia). Data were collected retrospectively through reviewing patients’ medical records using a data extraction format with KOBO collect tool. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23 and simple descriptive statistics were employed. Proportions and percentages were used to present the results.\r\nResults:  After excluding 18 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria, a total of 355 obstetric patients who were admitted to an obstetric HDU were included in the final analysis.  Among these all-obstetric patients admitted to obstetric HDU, pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia (82/355, 23.1%) and postpartum hemorrhage (66/355, 18.6%) were the most frequent reasons for admission to the HDU whereas cardiac disease constituted 14.1% (50/355) of the indication for admissions to the unit.\r\nMajority (318/355, 89.6%) from the study participants were transferred to other wards with improvement, while 37(7.9%) deteriorated with 9(2.53%) of them died. Septic shock (6/9, 66.6%) and DIC (2/9, 22.2%) were the leading causes of death in the HDU.\r\nConclusion:  Findings of our study demonstrate that opening HDU in a low-income setting is feasible and results in favorable maternal outcomes. Introduction of obstetric HDU in low-income settings is an effective intervention to reduce severe maternal morbidity and mortality associated with low ICU-bed capacity in those settings. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impaired water quality in Mediterranean climate reservoirs is mainly associated with eutrophication and internal nutrient loading. To improve water quality in hypereutrophic Hodges Reservoir, California, United States, a hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS), using pure oxygen gas, was implemented in 2020. This study encompasses 3 years of pre-oxygenation data (2017–2019) and 2 years of post-oxygenation data (2020–2021) to understand the cycling of nutrients, metals, and mercury in the reservoir. During the wet year of 2017, mildly reduced conditions lasted until mid-summer in the enlarged reservoir. Nutrients and metals were seen in the hypolimnion including ammonia (~2 mg-N/L), manganese (~0.5 mg/L), phosphate (~0.5 mg-P/L), and sulfide (~10 mg/L). Production of methylmercury (MeHg), an important bioaccumulative toxin, was favored from April to June with a hypolimnetic accumulation rate of around 200 ng/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>·d. In contrast, the dry year of 2018 exhibited higher hypolimnetic concentrations of ammonia (~4 mg-N/L), manganese (~1 mg/L), phosphate (&amp;gt;0.5 mg-P/L), and sulfide (&amp;gt;15 mg/L). The rapid onset of highly reduced conditions in 2018 corresponded with low MeHg hypolimnetic accumulation (~50 ng/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>·d). It seems that mildly reduced conditions were associated with higher MeHg accumulation, while sulfidic, reduced conditions impaired inorganic mercury bioavailability for MeHg production and/or promoted microbial demethylation. Sulfide also appeared to act as a sink for iron via FeS precipitation, and potentially for manganese via MnS precipitation or manganese coprecipitation with FeS. Mass flux estimates for 2017–2019 indicate that much of the nutrients that accumulated in the hypolimnion moved via turbulent diffusion into the epilimnion at loading rates far exceeding thresholds predicting eutrophic conditions. After oxygenation in 2020–2021, the reservoir water column was highly oxidized but showed a lack of thermal stratification, suggesting reservoir operations in combination with HOS implementation inadvertently mixed the water column in this relatively shallow reservoir. Post-oxygenation, concentrations of ammonia, phosphate, manganese, and mercury in bottom waters all decreased, likely in response to oxidized conditions. Oxygenated bottom waters exhibited elevated nitrate, a byproduct of ammonia nitrification, and iron, a byproduct of FeS oxidation, indicating a lake-wide response to oxygenation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pamijahan District in Bogor Regency, West Java, is known as one of the main sources of milk supply for dairy cows in the region. Dairy cow's milk is a product that has high and stable demand and selling value. Supply Chain Management (SCM) at Sapi Juara Farm in Pamijahan District involves the distribution of dairy cow's milk which includes product flow, information and finance. This study aims to understand the SCM of dairy milk at Sapi Juara Farm, including product flow, information and finance, as well as efficiency as measured through marketing margin and farmer's share. This research uses quantitative descriptive methods with primary data obtained from interviews. The results of the analysis show that there is a flow of dairy milk products, a flow of information from farmers to various actors in the supply chain, and a flow of funds that includes costs and profits from nine distribution channels that influence the performance of the supply chain based on the payment system. From the analysis of the profit share value, it can be seen that the SCM for dairy cow milk in Pamijahan District is running efficiently. It is hoped that SCM in Pamijahan District can be more efficient to avoid losses at each stage or link in the chain and stabilize milk prices in the market, while improving the welfare of farmers, especially at Sapi Juara Farm.</jats:p>"

Here, aluminum-modified hydroxyapatite (Al-HAP) was prepared by a homogeneous hydrothermal co-precipitation method. The physicochemical properties of the Al-HAP surface were characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, BET, and zeta potential, and the adsorption performances were evaluated. It showed that Al-HAP has a larger specific surface area (121.97 m2/g, which is 2.3 times larger than that of HAP), more surface-active hydroxyls and positively charged at pH less than 7, which indicate that Al-HAP is beneficial to the adsorption of negatively charged fluoride. Al-HAP had a higher fluoride adsorption capacity (56.44 mg/g) than that of HAP (28.36 mg/g), and not sensitive to the interference of coexisting ions except CO32-. Based on the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm experiments, the proposed two-stage kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm model can better describe the adsorption process. From the results of XPS and FT-IR, it indicated that the ion exchange between hydroxyl group on the surface and fluoride ions is the main driven force for the adsorption, and electrostatic adsorption is also helpful. The present study provides an improved HAP to effectively remove fluoride from water.</jats:p>",

In that process, it uses less electricity as an input compared to heat pumps with electrical compressors. Therefore, in some cases, it can be used to lift a lower temperature waste heat source to a higher temperature useful output with less electricity consumption. Absorption heat pumps are not very widely spread in district heating, mostly because there aren’t many suitable waste heat sources or conditions needed to run them. Tallinn has a district heating system with an annual generation of more than 2 TWh and a goal to make it an entirely carbon neutral district heating system by 2030. Tallinn has also started to develop a district cooling network, and by the end of 2023, the installed capacity was about 6 MW. District cooling capacity is estimated to grow to around 100 MW in 2030. This paper investigates different types of absorption heat pumps and the possibilities of integrating an  absorption heat pump to a district cooling plant with the purpose of using waste heat from the cooling plant for renewable heat generation, that can be used in district heating. Different technical aspects are examined to find a suitable production solution, are presented as results. From an economical point of view, the cost of heat to cover peaks with an absorption heat pump is calculated. The effect of reducing fossil fuel use in the Tallinn district heating network with an absorption heat pump is estimated.</jats:p>"

The characterization of these underground waters presents a bicarbonate-magnesian facies according to the diagram of Schöeller and Berkaloff; the representation of the data on the triangular Piper diagram shows that Boussir ground water has the magnesium bicarbonate facies. The calculation of the quality index (GWQI) shows that all samples taken from the boreholes belong to the good quality category. The long distance of diversion of this underground water and the quality of the materials used in the project under a dry desert climate made us carry out the process of monitoring and tracking the quality of the water from the well until it reaches the consumer. The results revealed that all the levels of the physic-chemical parameters do not exceed the WHO portability standards, except that a variation of certain values was observed at the level of the storage tank, this variation due to the mode of filling and the mixing of water in tubular form, without eliminating the effect of water stagnation. If we technically know how to produce high-quality drinking water, we cannot always ensure a safe and sustainable water supply of the same quality in distribution networks and reservoirs; it is from this principle that our article is based in order to reinforce the monitoring role.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology has emerged as an intriguing solution to address data integrity concerns. With its inherent properties, blockchain offers promising avenues for ensuring data integrity. However, some challenges need to be overcome, such as low throughput, high latency, and stability issues, which currently limit the practical implementation of blockchain-based solutions. we focus on a case study from the European SUNFISH project, which aims to develop a secure cloud federation platform for the public sector. We examine the specific data integrity requirements in cloud computing environments and identify the research questions that need to be addressed to implement blockchain-based databases effectively. We start by outlining the open research questions and the inherent difficulties associated with addressing them. Then, we propose a preliminary design for a blockchain-based database tailored to cloud computing environments. This design aims to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology while addressing the challenges unique to cloud computing. By addressing these research questions and proposing practical solutions, we aim to pave the way for the adoption of blockchain-based databases in cloud computing environments. This has the potential to enhance data integrity and security, ultimately benefiting organizations operating in the cloud.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nuclear fusion is understood as an energy reaction that does not emit greenhouse gases, and it has been considered as a long-term source of low-carbon electricity that is favourable to curtail rapid climate change. Fusion offers a pathway to resolve energy security and the unequal distribution of energy resources since seawater is its ultimate fuel source and a few grams of fuel can generate mega kilowatts of power. The development and testing of new materials and technologies are unceasing to achieve the net fusion energy through national and international collaboration as well as private partnerships. The ever-growing number of research works report various designs and magnet-based fusion devices, such as stellarators, lasers, and tokamaks. This article provides an overview on the utilization of nuclear energy as a clean energy source, as well as the strategies and progress towards establishing successful commercial fusion energy to the grid and transition to a reliable clean energy source. The overview focuses on the fusion nuclear development in five major countries, UK, US, China, Japan, and Russia. Identified technical and financial challenges are also described at the end of this article. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) has been an international reference program for fusion energy development and most developed countries with nuclear development capacity are aiming to complete their in-house fusion energy facilities in parallel to ITER. Many fusion programs are finishing the conceptual design and shifting into the phase of engineering design for the planned DEMO fusion facilities. The significant challenges were identified from the perspective of device efficiency and robustness, sustainable funding, and facility maintenance and safety, which must be addressed diligently to realize fusion energy as alternative clean energy that mitigates climate change and supports the goals of energy security.</jats:p>"

It is a guiding concept for building a world in which present and future generations may flourish. In the present era all the sectors are shifting towards sustainable development, including the tourism sector, which is another significant contributor towards country's economic development. This chapter deals with power generation using renewable energy for sustainability in tourist resorts and hotels. The adaptation of green energy or renewable energy by the government, businesses, and individuals is increasing for the transition to a more sustainable environment. This chapter is focused on the world heritage site ‘Nalanda', located near Rajgir, in the state of Bihar, which is a tourist destination and attracts a large number of tourists. Thus being a tourist destination, the hotels and resorts located nearby must adopt sustainable practices. Nowadays many tourists prefer those hotels and resorts that offer them a sustainable living. Bihar is a region with small hills, including the Rajgir hills in the centre, the Kaimur Range in the southwest, and the Shivalik Range in the north, which makes it suitable for wind turbine set up and the abundant availability of sunlight throughout the year makes it ideal for setting up of PV. A power plant is being developed in a village called Kulin the Nalanda district, using HOMER Pro software taking wind and solar as the sources for generation of electricity which can be supplied there through grid to the resorts and hotels.</jats:p>",

They involve a direct connection between local farmers and consumers, with minimal intermediaries involved. SFSCs have gained significant interest in recent years due to their potential to promote sustainable agriculture and support local communities. As a result, many governments, organisations, and individuals have been exploring ways to develop and promote these chains as a viable alternative to conventional food supply chains. However, it is still unclear how SFSCs products are perceived differently by producers and consumers: what makes SFSCs products more desirable? Starting from a European project (SmartChain), answers from twenty questionnaires from SFSCs actors across Europe were analysed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SFSCs products according to the producers. From their answers, 18 quality criteria referred to SFSCs products were obtained and then proposed to consumers through a second questionnaire. The second questionnaire aimed to better understand whether the producers&amp;amp;rsquo; points of view matched the consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; points of view. From the analysis of the results, it was possible to understand what criteria were considered quality attributes by producers and consumers. Organic production and the presence of both trained and vulnerable personnel were not particularly relevant to the quality perception of SFSCs products. The storage method, the assortment range, and the processing of the products were not evaluated as quality criteria. The consumers who were interviewed perceived the quality of a food product coming from an SFSC linked to the characteristics of the social context of the product. They associated products sold in SFSCs with non-processed food. Overall, such a survey can be considered a useful tool to deepen our knowledge about short food supply chains and offers several ideas for further studies and analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

Our model demonstrates its effectiveness through simulation experiments, showcasing its ability to dynamically adjust inventory thresholds based on daily forecasted demand, which significantly optimizes replenishment strategies. Notably, our model achieves a total cost reduction while maintaining a high service level of 0.761467 and reduces computational time to 82.32 s, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability. The innovation of this research lies in the application of the PCSO algorithm to dynamically manage inventory in real-time, aligning with sustainable inventory management practices.

Here we combine genetic dissection of neuronal circuit function, two-photon calcium imaging in Dm9 and inner photoreceptors, and immunohistochemical analysis to reveal novel insights into the functional role of Dm9 in early visual processing. Our experiments show that Dm9 receive input from all four types of inner photoreceptor R7p, R7y, R8p, and R8y. Histamine released from all types R7/R8 directly inhibits Dm9 via the histamine receptor Ort, and outweighs simultaneous histamine-independent excitation of Dm9 by UV-sensitive R7. Dm9 in turn provides inhibitory feedback to all R7/R8, which is sufficient for color-opponent processing in R7 but not R8. Color opponent processing in R8 requires additional synaptic inhibition by R7 of the same ommatidium via axo-axonal synapses and the second <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic> histamine receptor HisCl1. Notably, optogenetic inhibition of Dm9 prohibits color opponent processing in all types of R7/R8 and decreases intracellular calcium in photoreceptor terminals. The latter likely results from reduced release of excitatory glutamate from Dm9 and shifts overall photoreceptor sensitivity toward higher light intensities. In summary, our results underscore a key role of Dm9 in color opponent processing in <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic> and suggest a second role of Dm9 in regulating light adaptation in inner photoreceptors. These novel findings on Dm9 are indeed reminiscent of the versatile functions of horizontal cells in the vertebrate retina.</jats:p>"

It is crucial to identify the controllable factors influencing seawater intrusion, both natural and anthropogenic, in order to ensure water supply security. This study examined seawater intrusion characteristics using monitoring data from 1994 to 2019. Factors such as daily flow rate, duration of intrusion, water quality, and tidal level were analyzed to establish correlations and identify the primary influencing factors in the Yangtze River Estuary. The findings reveal that seawater intrusion in this area is most prevalent from November to April, peaking in February and March. The key controllable factors affecting chloride levels at the intake are the daily flow rate at Datong Station and the tidal range at Xuliujing Station. Additionally, the study proposes control methods to safeguard water supply, including providing daily flow rate values for flushing seawater intrusion at Datong Station under different tidal ranges and intrusion durations. These research results provide valuable guidance for the emergency operation of the Three Gorges-centered reservoir group against seawater intrusion.</jats:p>"

Over time, these pipelines may incur damage and leakage due to aging and changes in surrounding loads. Ruptures and leaks in pipelines can lead to water seepage through cracks, resulting in erosion of surrounding soil layers and the formation of underground cavities. The loss of support in the soil above these cavities can lead to structural instability and eventual ground collapse. Such collapses can disrupt urban transportation systems, leading to significant social and economic consequences. This study specifically investigates ground collapse phenomena resulting from damage to drainage pipelines in silty soil within the Yellow River flood area in Zhengzhou City.

So, for successful sandalwood plantation, it is important to study the host parasite interactions and role of external supply of water and nutrient, both theoretically and practically. To find out long-term host species for sandalwood, a randomized block design experiment was conducted to identify the suitability of host and effect of externally supplied nutrient medium on sandalwood planted with five selected host (Alternanthera sp., Azadirachata indica, Dalbergia sissoo, Melia dubia, and Aquilaria malaccensis) and without host species. After 180 days of establishment, morphological traits were recorded and noted that plant height, collar diameter and root length was higher in Dalbergia sissoo and Melia dubia as compared to other host species. Significant enhancement in morphological traits was recorded with external supply of Hoagland nutrient medium. Similarly, higher shoot biomass and root biomass were noted in Dalbergia sissoo and Melia dubia under control as well as with externally supplied nutrient medium. While, maximum haustorial connections were formed with Dalbergia sissoo over studied host species. On the other hand physiological trait such as chlorophyll content was abundant in sandalwood grown with Dalbergia sissoo. Physiological parameters such photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate were higher in sandalwood cultivated with Dalbergia sissoo. Macronutrient such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content was also higher in Dalbergia sissoo and Melia dubia. The results revealed that sandalwood could be grown successfully with Dalbergia sissoo and external supply of nutrients might enhance the growth and physiology of sandalwood.</jats:p>",

LTDH is especially applicable in energy-efficient buildings as the supply temperature for space heating can be reduced. However, urban areas consist of energetically refurbished and non-refurbished buildings. In these scenarios a LTDH network with a central heat pump (HP) and decentral booster units, such as a booster HP or electrical heater, can be a solution. This study investigates and compares the energetic performance and levelized cost of heat (LCOH) of eight concepts for refurbished and non-refurbished buildings for a district heating network in the city of Ghent, Belgium. The simulations consider supply temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 75 °C. Results show that the primary energy use is lowest when using booster HPs, for both refurbished buildings (402 MWh/year) and non-refurbished buildings (139.6 MWh/year). The LCOH, however, is lowest when booster units are not necessary as the LCOH is mainly driven by the high investment cost of the network and the booster units. This results in a LCOH of 213 €/MWh<jats:sub>th</jats:sub> for non-refurbished buildings at a network temperature of 75 °C and 297 €/MWh<jats:sub>th</jats:sub> for refurbished buildings at 55 °C.</jats:p>",

The study asked participants what motivates them through qualitative and quantitative techniques, the former subject to thematic content analysis. Further, there was discussion with stakeholders and observation. Stakeholders particularly included training providers in the industry. Vendors requested more help so they could sustain themselves and prosper in the industry. Food trucks were of interest because of the relatively casual labour that found a place during COVID-19, although the number of trucks had declined before the pandemic. The study found that food truckers are still highly motivated and eager to help shape Bangkok’s food truck industry going forward and, thereby, the urban landscape and economy of the city. Demotivating factors suggested by the participants themselves focused on murky city planning, which became a major element in the study.

The analysis of the storage of natural flow water reservoirs of the Crimean Peninsula over a long-term period showed that their inflow differed significantly between dry and high-water years. The feasibility of more efficient use of the watercourses during spring and summer floods of high-water periods was established by increasing the total available storage of the natural flow reservoirs of the Crimea.

For this purpose, based on data collected and organized on items to be included in the system related to the environment around Unmun Dam and Dongchang Stream, a comparative review of the policy status of other local governments and environmental facilities was conducted, and case analysis was conducted focusing on domestic and international cases. The local government's maintenance flow management plan for water supply in dam river management is, first, to manage the river flow in a stable manner throughout the year in order to perform the smooth function of the river, and second, to pump water to maintain the basic flow rate of the river. A reverse pumping method that sends water from downstream to upstream, and third, artificial supply of soil through flooding or flushing discharge to improve the environment of the river downstream of the dam were proposed. As a result, we tracked changes in the natural ecological environment of Dongchang Stream after the construction of Unmun Dam and proposed dam operation plans and flood control policies to derive implications such as ecological environment restoration, flood prevention measures in downstream areas, and local economy revitalization measures.</jats:p>",

Decisions are typically made based on information from computational simulations that are abstractions of reality and, therefore, embody uncertainty. This necessitates focusing on design space exploration to identify robust satisficing solution sets that are relatively insensitive to uncertainty. Current frameworks that support robust satisficing design space exploration are limited by their capability to support the efficient exploration of multilevel design spaces simultaneously. In this paper, we present the Framework for Robust Multilevel Co-Design Exploration (FRoMCoDE), a decision support framework that allows designers to (i) model decision problems across multiple levels and their interactions, (ii) consider uncertainties in the decision problems, and (iii) visualize and systematically carry out simultaneous exploration of multilevel design spaces, termed co-design exploration. In FRoMCoDE, we combine the coupled-compromise Decision Support Problem construct, where a combination of the Preemptive and Archimedean formulations is used, with robust design constructs and interpretable-Self-Organizing Maps (iSOM)-based visualization to facilitate robust co-design. We use a steel MSN problem with decisions made at two levels to test the framework. Using the problem, we demonstrate FRoMCoDE's efficacy in supporting designers in (i) modeling multilevel decision problems and their interactions, considering the uncertainties, and (ii) the efficient co-design exploration of multilevel design spaces. FRoMCoDE is generic and supports designers in the robust co-design exploration of multilevel systems.</jats:p>",

The pollution characteristics of heavy metals were also evaluated by combining the SWAT and simple output coefficient method. The results show that the pollutant load in Guanshan River Basin contributes significantly to the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Temporally, pollutant loads were primarily concentrated in the flood season, which had a significant positive correlation with precipitation, water yield, and sediments in the abundant period. Among them, sediments were the most important driving factor, followed by water yield. Spatially, pollutant loads were mainly concentrated downstream of the basin, where cultivated land is widespread. In this regard, it is suggested that the input of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and livestock manure in cultivated land should be controlled and soil erosion downstream of the basin should be prevented to mitigate nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metal pollution. This research offers a basis for the formulation and implementation of watershed management for the Danjiangkou Reservoir.</jats:p>",

Differing from the configuration with stationary fuel pipework, the fast-rotating shaft in the annulus would induce significant drag jeopardizing the fuel supply during engine acceleration. This study investigates the flow physics inside a micro turbojet engine ISFSS. Air–fuel two-phase flow is found in the slinger cavity and the shaft annulus, with main gas path air ingress into the ISFSS under disk pumping of the slinger, and the ingress is enhanced by introducing blades on the slinger disk. Results show that the axial flow drag in the shaft annulus is reduced as air being ingested in. Further investigation indicates that the best supplied fuel volume fraction is 0.8, and this can reduce the axial drag in the shaft annulus by ∼63%, compared with the single-phase fuel flow. Therefore, two-phase air–fuel mixture is proposed for the ISFSS drag reduction.</jats:p>",

Therefore, energy efficiency in buildings is of utmost importance. This study focuses on a chemical industrial park located along the Fujiang River and compares three heating and cooling supply schemes: the river water source heat pump system, which utilizes river water as the heat source and heat sink; the water cooling unit and boiler system, which uses water-cooled electric compression chillers for cooling and an oil-fired boiler system for heating; and the split air conditioning and gas water heater scheme, which relies on refrigerants such as fluorine-containing compounds for cooling and a gas water heater for heating. By calculating the energy consumption of the above three schemes and conducting a comparative analysis, it is found that the river water source heat pump system exhibits significantly higher energy efficiency throughout the year compared to the water cooling unit and boiler system and the split air conditioning and gas water heater scheme. This highlights the notable energy efficiency advantage of the river water source heat pump system.</jats:p>"

Design/methodology/approach: Baja California Sur (BCS) state was the study area. Information was gathered from a total of 380 sampled chain actors in asparagus, mango, strawberry, orange and tomato by survey and personal interviews. Tobit technique was applied to identify factors that influence FL percentage. Results: Data shows about 11.8% of asparagus is lost during harvesting and distribution, as well as 8.5% of strawberry, 26% of mango, 17.8% of oranges and 3.5% of tomatoes, representing 29.9% loss rate of marketed yield. Limitations on study/implications: This study did not classify commodities in the last steps of the supply chain. The five commodities used in the current study correspond to the more important agricultural produces in BCS, but given changing market, harvesting time and produce availability did not consider the waste of the supply chain. Findings/conclusions: Commodity, type of transportation and distribution, education, and human resources has been identified as influence factors in the volume of FL. This exploratory study fills the void in information in terms of its geographic scope and food group number, and farm owners willing to manage food losses for the purpose of obtaining bioactive compound.

The energy storage system can be the solution for both of securing the reserve power and improving grid resiliency. The authors have conducted demonstration project to validate the applicability of Redox Flow (RF) battery for securing the reserve power and improving grid resiliency. The results of the demonstration validated that the RF battery makes it possible to be used as reserve power and earn revenue through energy and ancillary market transactions during normal operations, in addition to providing power to blackout areas or the areas that outages are assumed, as an independent power source, during an emergency such as natural disasters and planned outages.</jats:p>",

The analysis of this research relies on a distinct dataset acquired from a survey conducted among the staff members. Researchers can more easily get quantitative measurements to analyze data on respondent variables. The operational sample comprises 137 participants. The study reveals that enhancing aspects related to the movement of goods and communication is crucial for improving the efficacy of HSCM. JKKM should ensure sufficient vehicle availability while simultaneously striving to minimize communication obstacles, such as limited network coverage.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main objective of this study is to investigate the supply of ecosystem services (ESs) within peri-urban watersheds (PUWs) across Greece, utilizing earth observation (EO) data and empirical models. To achieve these goals, several open-access geospatial datasets were utilized and processed within a GIS environment. Specifically, the supply of soil conservation and water retention services was assessed at the watershed scale. The results indicates that the supply soil conservation service withing the examined PUWs range from 44.41 t ha−1 y−1 to 441.33 t ha−1 y−1 with an average value of 161.99 t ha−1 y−1. Water retention services vary from 35.09 to 154.63 mm within the PUWs, with an average of 91.45 mm. Additionally, the variation in ES values across distinct altitudinal zones and ecosystem types provides useful insights for implementing protection and management measures. It is evident from the analysis that the soil conservation service gradually increases with elevation, with alpine and subalpine areas exhibiting the highest values. Moreover, mountainous and semi-mountainous regions demonstrate higher values compared to the estimated average soil conservation services of the entire study area. Furthermore, the provision of water retention services varies across different altitudinal zones. Specifically, the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas exhibit the highest values, followed by the subalpine and hilly regions, while lower values are observed in the lowland and alpine regions. The analysis also reveals distinct patterns in ecosystem services across various ecosystem types within the PUWs. Woodland and forest, along with heathland and shrubs, demonstrate higher values in terms of both soil conservation and water retention services. Our findings contribute to understanding the dynamics of ESs in PUWs, highlighting their significance for sustainable land management, and informing policy decisions aimed at preserving ecosystem health and resilience.</jats:p>"

By using blockchain, trusted logistics services enable participants to effectively record and track transactions during the logistics process. Current blockchain‐based LSC features distributed structure and data privacy requirements, hindering the supervision of logistics transactions. Leveraging emerging dual‐blockchain architecture to separate logistics transactions from supervision is a promising direction. However, the dual‐blockchain collaboration restricts supervision due to its cross‐chain privacy and efficiency. To address these issues, a logistics supply chain supervision scheme based on dual‐blockchain collaboration (DBC) is proposed. First, an independent supervision blockchain is constructed to balance the contradiction between distributed structure and supervision requirements. Second, two mechanisms are designed to enhance the privacy and performance of collaborative supervision. The hybrid access control mechanism enables fine‐grained supervision for different participants, and the aggregated transaction verification method supports efficient collaboration for logistics transactions. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate the feasibility of DBC in enhancing the security and supervision of logistics data on the dual‐blockchain architecture. Experimental results show that the cross‐chain supervision overhead of DBC is reduced to  of the baseline schemes.</jats:p>",

The pilot operation process included functional tests of digital substation equipment and systems with fault simulation. Examples of failures and issues in substation operation have been noted, a comparative assessment was made for failures of secondary systems resulting in the primary equipment shutdown for repairs. It was stated that in the long run digital substations can improve the reliability rates of the power supply to end users due to these systems being completely observable, diagnosable, and redundant. The use of self-diagnostic and mutually redundant systems enables the transition to the on-condition equipment maintenance.</jats:p>",

In this study, field-collected SCB particles were used as the experimental material, and wind tunnel experiments were conducted with different sand supplies, wind velocities, and SCB coverages to evaluate SCB wind erosion efficiency and vertical mass flux. The results showed that wind erosion efficiency decreased as SCB coverage increased. When the SCB coverage was above 40%, sand deposition processes occurred only under saturated sand flow, while sand transport remained unaffected by increases in SCB coverage under unsaturated sand flow. Under saturated flow, the highest concentrations of transported sand were found at 0–6 cm above the surface, and the main sand bed process was deposition. The sand bed process changed from aeolian erosion to deposition with increasing SCB coverage and tended to remain stable until the SCB coverage exceeded 40%. By contrast, under unsaturated sand flow, the sand bed process was primarily aeolian erosion, and the highest concentrations of transported sand were found at 0–4 cm above the surface. At high SCB coverage levels (more than 40%), a general balance between aeolian erosion and deposition processes was reached. In summary, increasing SCB coverage had a significant impact on surface wind erosion processes. Thus, SCBs can be used as a novel sand retention material.</jats:p>"

However, it is argued in this study that water use changes may cause idle water supply facilities and revenue losses, thereby challenging the sustainability of water supply systems in the context of climate change. A co-governance framework was established to inspire practical strategies of sustaining water supply systems by re-evaluating the long-term impacts of water demand changes. This framework adopts a broader view of water demand management by integrating the political, financial, and consumptive needs of the government, the market, and the users in the form of a collaborative strategy coupling both supply-side and demand-side solutions. The proposed framework was applied to the analysis of the sustainability of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project. It is found that the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is not a simple water supply infrastructure but rather a synthesis of supply-side and demand-side water management solutions. Actively releasing water for ecological and cultural purposes is suggested in this study to maintain the socio-ecological benefits of the project in the context of human water use decline. The economic cost of the water supply could be recovered by ongoing revenues that include not only the water fees charged to users but also the benefits gained from cooperative investment in broader water-related businesses by both the state-owned water transfer company and local governments in water-receiving areas. The proposed framework and strategies are valuable for other water utilities around the world, especially those challenged by reduced water demand caused by climate change, high water prices, and economic depression.\n                    </jats:p>"

The article proposes to integrate RSE into distribution power grids in the form of separate microgrid (MG), which is a key part of the transition to a power grid operating on the principles of SMART Grid. Local MGs, in addition to generation sources and consumers, also have the means to accumulate a certain amount of energy. To ensure the technical and economic efficiency, MGs are combined into an intelligent control system, which allows for more rational use of MG resources, efficient interaction with the distribution grid, and the use of active electricity consumers in the process of balancing the LEES mode. The paper proposes a hierarchical structure of the intellectual system of LEES. Thus structured, LEES with intelligent power grids can not lose RSE during the limitation of centralized power supply, but fully use their advantages together with energy storage systems for reliable power supply to consumers. Thanks to the intelligent system proposed in this paper, the LEES implements the principles of SMART Grid and functions as an informative energy system. The LEES formed in this way can operate as a balancing group within the ESS, performing the tasks of the distribution system operator depending on the voltage and power of its MG components. Since LEES are a part of the ESS, they operate under the conditions and according to the rules, without disrupting the functioning of the ESS, which currently provides a stable power supply. This applies to all modes of operation of LEES.</jats:p>"

In this study, we explore the design and implementation of a blockchain-based system that enables manufacturers, suppliers, and customers to collaborate seamlessly in tracking and verifying product information. The proposed system leverages blockchain’s inherent features, such as decentralization, tamper-resistance, and transparency, to reduce counterfeiting and build trust in the supply chain. We discuss the architecture and key components of the system, including the role of SQL databases and Metamask wallet integration. Additionally, we highlight the process flow, from manufacturers assigning unique serial numbers to customers verifying product authenticity through QR code scans. [1]  This research presents a comprehensive solution for supply chain management, offering potential applications beyond product tracking, including in banking, healthcare, and e-commerce. Blockchain innovations have acquired interest in the course of the most recent years. One of the most talked about issues is currency exchange, but its application is not limited only to Digital currency. so it has the potential to influence different business sectors. Blockchain technology has brought greater transparency and ease in large transactions. We can detect counterfeit goods using blockchain technology. The question that arises when buying any item in today’s world is whether it is fake or not. And the lack of these things has been shown a huge impact on economic progress. Therefore, in order to curb all counterfeit goods, it is important to bring transparency about the goods to the notice of the consumers. The growing presence of counterfeit and unsafe products in the world is a cause for concern and blockchain technology has taken the next step towards its complete annihilation.

Our key findings include the following: (1) “Choose-one-over-another” policies enhance positive network effects, increasing multi-homing on the demand side but reducing overall platform revenue. These policies also intensify negative network effects, leading to higher prices for supply-side users and thereby undermining the welfare of demand-side users. (2) After antitrust interventions, platforms adjust pricing dynamically, increasing for one side and decreasing for the other in response to changes in same-side network effects, which in turn influences multi-homing behaviors and revenue impacts differently before and after the enforcement of such policies. (3) Without exclusive selection mandates, platform pricing strategies tend to lower prices for supply-side users, especially under competitive pressures or weaker positive network effects, potentially increasing platform revenue and overall supply chain welfare under certain conditions. This study highlights the critical role of regulatory oversight in curbing monopolistic platform behaviors to protect user rights and ensure market health, offering strategic guidance for platform management amidst competitive and operational challenges.</jats:p>"

Various scenarios, such as combining solar photovoltaic (PV) with pumped hydro-energy storage (PHES), utilizing wind energy with PHES, and integrating a hybrid system of PV, wind, and PHES, have been evaluated based on diverse criteria, encompassing financial aspects and reliability. To achieve the results, meta-heuristics such as the Multiobjective Gray wolf optimization algorithm (MOGWO) and Multiobjective Grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) were applied using MATLAB software. Moreover, optimal component sizing has been investigated utilizing real-time assessment data and meteorological data from Gaita Sillasie, Ethiopia. Metaheuristic optimization techniques were employed to pinpoint the most favorable loss of power supply probability (LPSP) with the least cost of energy (COE) and total life cycle cost (TLCC) for the hybrid system, all while meeting operational requirements in various scenarios. The Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimization (MOGWO) technique outperformed the Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (MOGOA) in optimizing the problem, as suggested by the results. Furthermore, based on MOGWO findings, the hybrid solar PV-Wind-PHES system demonstrated the lowest COE (0.126€/kWh) and TLCC (€6,897,300), along with optimal satisfaction of the village's energy demand and LPSP value. In the PV-Wind-PHSS scenario, the TLCC and COE are 38%, 18%, 2%, and 1.5% lower than those for the Wind-PHS and PV-PHSS scenarios at LPSP 0%, according to MOGWO results. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the design and implementation of sustainable energy solutions for remote communities, paving the way for enhanced energy access and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

Implemented using an 8051 microcontroller, the system is linked to three switches representing each power source for simulation purposes. Upon detection of a switch release or deactivation, signifying the absence of that particular power source, the microcontroller promptly deactivates the corresponding relay driver. This relay driver then switches the relevant relay, facilitating seamless power continuity to the load if any switch is activated. A lamp or bulb serves as a demonstrative load powered by the primary source. In the event of a power outage, the system seamlessly transitions to the next available source, such as solar energy, and if required, to generator power.

However, there needs to be more knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in drinking water systems from water sources to household tap water. Herein, laser direct infrared spectroscopy is used to investigate the occurrence of microplastics in a typical drinking water plant with different water sources. Microplastic information is further used to understand microplastic fates during drinking water supply, including microplastic abundance, size, shape, and polymer type. Overall, the microplastic abundance in treated water ranges from 12.00 to 25.33 particles/L, higher than those in raw water (RW; 2.33–17.33 particles/L) and household water (HW; 8.00–19.67 particles/L), which shows that microplastics are not removed from RW. The main polymers in these microplastics are polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene. At the same time, the main microplastic shapes are fragments and fibers. Small-sized microplastics of 20–100 μm account for up to 76.74% and 79.30% of microplastics during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Additionally, more microplastics are detected in RW from rivers than those from reservoirs and lakes, and the microplastic abundance in the wet season is higher than that in the dry season. As expected, the potential ecological risk of microplastics in all waters is the I level, which is the lowest level. Most importantly, the annual microplastic intake of an adult via drinking water is 5063–18,301 microplastics, less than that reported in previous studies. These results provide valuable data on the fates of microplastics in drinking water supply systems from water sources to HW and promote authorities to update the treatment technologies for drinking water in the future to remove microplastics efficiently.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that GPCC had good performance at both monthly and annual scales, with high correlation coefficients and low error values. However, it tends to underestimate precipitation amounts in certain areas. Other products also exhibit satisfactory performance with moderate correlations with ground observations. Drought analysis indicates that GPCC outperforms other products in standardised precipitation index-6 calculations, while NASA POWER demonstrates inconsistencies with ground observations, particularly during the early 1980s and mid-2000s. In conclusion, GPCC is the most preferable GPP for precipitation and drought analysis in the Yobe State in Nigeria.</jats:p>",

It includes complex processes and long manufacturing cycles. In addition, the equipment’s supply chain management is extremely complex. Therefore, the development of a supply chain management knowledge graph is of significant strategic significance. It not only enhances the synergistic effect of the supply chain management but also upgrades the level of intelligent management. This paper proposes a distant supervision knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction method in the supply chain management of large equipment manufacturing, which achieves digital and structured management and efficient use of supply chain management knowledge in the industry. This paper presents an approach to extract entity-relation knowledge using limited samples. We achieve this by establishing a distant supervision model. Furthermore, we introduce a fusion gate mechanism and integrate ontology information, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to effectively discern sentence-level semantics. Subsequently, we promptly modify the weights of input features using the gate mechanism to strengthen the model’s resilience and address the issue of vector noise diffusion. Finally, an inter-bag sentence attention mechanism is introduced to integrate different sentence bag information at the sentence bag level, which achieves more accurate entity-relation knowledge extraction. The experimental results prove that compared with the latest distant supervision method, the accuracy of relation extraction is improved by 2.8%, and the AUC value is increased by 3.9%, effectively improving the quality of knowledge graph in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Evaluating their suitability and effectiveness for hydrogen ship piping remains critical. This study conducted numerical simulations to analyze insulation and phase-change impacts on the multiphase thermal flow of piping systems used for the Fuel Gas Supply System (FGSS) of hydrogen-fueled ships. The accuracy of the adopted phase-change model was validated against selected experimental cases of boiling phenomena, demonstrating agreement with experimental results. We applied the validated phase-change model to simulate multiphase thermal flow in an LH2 pipe and evaluated the thermal performance of insulation materials. The insulation material considered in this study is a composite insulation system with various filling materials. Specifically, we observed that the insulation performance was superior when utilizing a combination of vacuum insulation along with MLI Mylar nets. Additionally, we evaluated the safety within the pipe by comparing the amount of vapor generated inside with the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL). Our results indicate that a safety assessment of the insulation is necessary when no filling material is used. Quantitatively, we found that pipes with composite vacuum and MLI Mylar net insulation reduced vapor generation by 45% compared to vacuum-only insulation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed insulation method.</jats:p>"

Each of the coalition was made up of four transport providers and composed of four legs. Since this is a cooperative game scenario, Sharpley's value method of cost allocation was used to obtain the gains accrued to the grand coalition.

Aba, renowned for its bustling commercial activities in the southern part of Nigeria, faces challenges in the supply process due to the combined factors of water tank weight and size. This research explores the intricacies of supply chain management, aiming to identify risk assessment models and vulnerabilities, propose optimal scenarios, and recommend improved risk management strategies. Various methods such as risk factor identification, route time estimation, critical path analysis, cost-related risk assessment, comparison of logistic choices, decision tree analysis, and mitigation strategies were employed to determine the most efficient supply path and reduce costs. The analysis reveals that PATH 6 emerges as the most time-efficient route, with a critical path identified at 62 hours. From the result obtained by applying the developed paths to the supply chain mechanism of five major distributors of the company to observe the cost-effectiveness of each path between the budgeted cost, previous cost, and the cost of supplying the goods by following the developed path, which the budgeted cost and paths cost are closely related compared to the previous cost, for Global Chidozie Nzelu (G.C.N) Enterprise, the overall cost reduction from budgeted, actual, and total path costs stood at 7.89% and 9.44%, respectively.

The findings indicate the following: (1) Increases in the subsidy coefficient can increase product greenness and the overall profit in both subsidy strategies, which makes sense; (2) When direct sales channels become dominant, subsidizing the manufacturer proves superior to subsidizing the retailer in terms of promoting green quality and overall profit, which extends existing studies of government subsidy decisions. Furthermore, subsidizing the retailer may negatively affect the total supply chain profit; (3) Consistent with previous literature, intense competition between manufacturers and retailers is expected to enhance the overall profit of the supply chain; (4) Interestingly, customer preference for online channels does not influence product green quality under manufacturer subsidization strategies but exhibits a negative impact under retailer subsidization strategies. Finally, this research provides managerial implications for decision-makers and potential issues for future research.</jats:p>"

Digital supply chain twins have been proposed in order to provide decision makers with an effective and efficient tool to mitigate disruption impact. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning approach for disruption detection within a cognitive digital supply chain twin framework to enhance supply chain resilience. The proposed disruption detection module utilises a deep autoencoder neural network combined with a one-class support vector machine algorithm. In addition, long-short term memory neural network models are developed to identify the disrupted echelon and predict time-to-recovery from the disruption effect. The obtained information from the proposed approach will help decision-makers and supply chain practitioners make appropriate decisions aiming at minimizing negative impact of disruptive events based on real-time disruption detection data. The results demonstrate the trade-off between disruption detection model sensitivity, encountered delay in disruption detection, and false alarms. This approach has seldom been used in recent literature addressing this issue.</jats:p>",

Herein, a single-flow post-combustion oxygen lance (SF-PCL) with four primary holes and six secondary holes was designed to increase the oxygen supply intensity of a 60-ton converter in a steel plant. The attenuation and coalescence behaviors of supersonic jets for the conventional four-hole oxygen lance (COL) and the newly designed SF-PCL were studied by numerical simulation. And then, their metallurgical effects were verified by industrial practice. The simulation results indicated that the SF-PCL effectively suppresses the attenuation and coalescence of supersonic jets as well as simultaneously increases both the impact area and penetration depth.

US health insurers soared in profits during 2020, the first year of the Covid‐19 pandemic. The profit gains were unequal among segments. This research uses a supply chain/transaction costs economics (SC/TCE) model to find insights into the profitability differences. The SC/TCE model consists of three spheres of profitability determinants: health care characteristics, transactions costs differentials, and governance methods. Our univariate analyses combined with weighted regression results reveal that, for Medicaid, a significant increase in profitability was associated with a decrease in medical expenses, whereas the opposite is observed for the group and Medicare Advantage plans. Another finding is that transaction costs differentials led to significant increases in profitability for group and Medicare plans with opposite results for Medicaid plans. These results provide important practical implications for policymakers.</jats:p>",

The issue of land supply is characterized by practical chaos and has fallen into a theoretical research dilemma. Starting from two dimensions of heterogeneity—preferences and income—this study establishes an evolutionary game model of the limited rationality of local governments. It explores the behavioral evolution process of local governments in the context of industrial competition for land supply and its convergence trends. The research findings indicate that the land supply behavior of local governments is primarily determined by the degree of heterogeneity in preferences and income, as well as the level of compensation for losses to cooperative partners and the severity of penalties for non-cooperative behavior. If local governments’ preferences converge towards a certain threshold or if their income continually increases, they are more inclined towards cooperative behavior; otherwise, they tend to act non-cooperatively. If local governments’ revenues are heavily reliant on industrial transfers, they are more likely to engage in non-cooperative land supply behavior. This research offers theoretical insights and policy recommendations to enhance the optimal allocation of land resources in China.</jats:p>"

Findings revealed that supply chain risks within pig farm products are primarily attributed to the perishable nature of the goods, persisting from farm activity processes through distribution channels to final traders. Risk assessment highlighted that farms face the highest level of risk compared to traditional market retailers and supermarkets, with breeders carrying the greatest risk among distributors and retailers. Consequently, identified risks significantly impact production quantity and pork quality, categorizing them as critically important risks. The decline in production adversely affects the income of farmers and distributors/retailers, underscoring the high risk associated with farm-level production activities. In light of these findings, enhancing farm-level performance requires government intervention to regulate the pork supply chain in North Sulawesi.</jats:p>",

Encroachment spawns channel competition, potentially threatening the platform's profit, which in turn induces a series of countermeasures by the platform. Motivated by this trend, we develop a game‐theoretical model to explore the strategic and tactical interactions between a manufacturer and a platform, in which the manufacturer determines encroachment strategy and quality differentiation tactic, and the platform determines sales mode strategy and information sharing tactic. We find that the manufacturer is profitable and the platform is damaged from encroachment. Furthermore, the manufacturer's quality differentiation tactic can propel the platform to select reselling that indirectly enhances post‐encroachment profitability. In contrast, sales mode and information sharing can be mono or jointly utilized by the platform to counter encroachment. Significantly, we provide a novel inspection method to systematically analyze the cumulative performance of the platform's two countermeasures by introducing the <jats:italic>synergy effect</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>dysergy effect</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>mutual exclusivity effect</jats:italic>. Interestingly, we highlight that the performance of mono‐countermeasures may be even more effective than that of combined countermeasures to mitigate the platform's loss caused by encroachment. This finding enriches not only the analytic understanding of received wisdom about whether more countermeasures can invariably hold competition edges but also provides useful managerial guidelines for strategic interaction research. Moreover, the manufacturer's increased encroachment capabilities may promote the platform to shift from reselling to agency selling, which reveals that manufacturer encroachment may be a critical factor in the popularity of agency selling.</jats:p>",

The present study utilized data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies to investigate the impacts of grandparental childcare on the labor supply of mothers with children aged 0–6 years. The results of the Probit model and Tobit model indicated that grandparental childcare could significantly increase mother’s labor force participation rate and extend their weekly working hours. The relation of grandparental childcare to mothers’ labor force participation in one-child families was stronger compared with multi-child families. However, its relation to mothers’ working hours in one-child families was smaller than that in multi-child families. Furthermore, the effect of grandparental childcare on mothers’ labor supply was more pronounced when children were younger, particularly for those with children aged 0–2 years. The findings highlight the important role of grandparental childcare and have several implications for family support policies. </jats:p>",

Many policies incentivize working in old age as it can alleviate the challenges of the aging population. This study examines the impacts of the extended maternity leave reform in Vietnam on elderly labour market outcomes. As grandparents' childcare responsibility may be reduced by maternal childcare following the extended maternal leave, especially for elderly living with children smaller than 1 year old, the reform gives older adults or grandparents more flexibility to join the labour market. Using the difference‐in‐differences model, we find that older people in the treatment group are more likely to return to the labour market following the reform implementation. The effect is positive and most robust for the self‐employment group rather than waged employment and for males rather than females. Our study suggests that there is a need for a policy design to shift public finance into the healthcare and pension system.</jats:p>",

Yet, they provide different types of services with different prices, introducing a multitasking element to their labour‐supply decisions. We show that optimal behaviour generates a maximum earnings function in which earnings depend on prices and total hours worked. Estimation by limited‐information methods identifies a lower bound to the own‐price substitution effect of a price change. Full‐information methods identify the full response to incentives, including income effects. We illustrate these methods on a sample of specialist physicians working in Québec, Canada. Our results suggest that the own‐price substitution effects of a price change are both economically and statistically significant. Income effects are present but overridden when prices increase for individual services. In contrast, in the presence of broad‐based fee increases, the income effect dominates the substitution effect, which leads physicians to reduce their supply of services.</jats:p>",

Dynamic parameters of the EGC, including dynamic compressive strength, dynamic increase factor, and impact toughness, showed sensitivity to strain rates and increased with strain rate.

This gap persisted despite the recognition in Saudi Vision 2030 of logistics, specifically, supply chain management (SCM), as fundamental to the national development agenda, given that contemporary competitiveness lies in the efficacy of supply chains (SCs) rather than individual companies. Moreover, the achievement of economic progress hinges significantly on how well these accomplishments align with sustainability demands and obstacles. This paper aims to investigate the extent to which GTL fosters GRHM practices to enhance the maturity of GSCM performance in the pharmaceutical industry in the KSA. In other words, the research goal is to explain the variance of GSCM due to GHRM and GTL. Drawing upon the Resource-Based View (RBV) and the Ability–Motivation–Opportunity theory (AMO), GTL can enhance many aspects of GHRM, such as employee performance measurement, training content design, recruitment criteria, and green-based rewards policies, which positively influence GSCM practices. The methodology employed is deductive and translated into a questionnaire derived from a comprehensive review of the existing literature. This questionnaire was subsequently tested through the collection of 111 responses from pharmaceutical companies operating in the KSA. The results show the critical effects of GTL and GHRM on GSCM in this sector. The research provides fresh theoretical perspectives and actionable recommendations based on the outcomes. As for originality, this research explores the contribution of transformational leadership and green human resource management in enhancing SC sustainability. The research provides directions for future research to investigate the mediating or moderating impacts of other significant factors, such as green thinking or eco-friendly behaviour, on SCM sustainability. As for practical implications, this research came up with an in-depth understanding of SC managers and professionals regarding their practices related to sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Polymer materials currently used in drinking water supply practice consist of a polymer base and additional chemicals. During use, polymer materials release toxic chemicals, including additives and residual monomers. Even if all components of a mixture are present in quantities that do not individually cause the expected adverse effects, the population may be adversely affected by chronic exposure to low concentrations, which may act additively to produce greater cumulative toxicity. The article presents the results of a study of the biological effect of a mixture of chemical compounds migrating from materials intended for use in managing drinking water supply. \r\nMaterials and methods. The work examined extracts from four materials offered by various companies and manufacturing countries intended for use in drinking water supply. Experimental work was carried out on non-linear white rats (males) with an initial body weight of 180–200 g. In the experiment, five groups of animals of 10 pieces each were formed. The experiment lasted for 6 months. \r\nResults. As a result of a sanitary-toxicological study, there were obtained data proving the possibility of a negative effect of a mixture of organic compounds washed out from the materials of pipes used in drinking water supply on the body of warm-blooded animals. Under experimental conditions with prolonged exposure to a mixture of organic compounds, including those unstudied in terms of hygienic conditions, general toxic and mutagenic activity of extracts from the studied samples of polymeric materials was revealed. Despite the fact that materials belonging to the same group of polymers – polyethylenes – were chosen for the experiment, the biological effect of the extracts turned out to be multidirectional. \r\nLimitations. The study was conducted on a small sample of materials currently used in the practice of domestic and drinking water supply, and a limited set of indicators studied in a chronic experiment. It is necessary to conduct extensive research on other groups of polymers. \r\nConclusion. The toxic effect of a mixture of organic substances migrating from pipe materials on the body in a chronic experiment in animals was studied, \r\nand the possibility of developing long-term effects when consuming water based on extracts from polymeric materials was established.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to analyse the literature on prefabricated (prefab) houses and explore the concept of creating a digital prototype of a building based on Huoshenshan hospital using Autodesk Revit software. This hospital was constructed to treat Covid-19 patients in early 2020. The article describes the methodology of installing modular containers and assembly structures using BIM technologies for rapid construction. The results of this study showed that building object implementation depends directly on a proper model with a step-by-step mechanism for installation. Due to the supply of prefab structures at the construction site, both initial project cost and project time can be reduced. Prefab house technology demonstrated the high efficiency of using BIM technology in the assembly of Huoshenshan hospital, which was constructed in 10 days. The need for information modelling data exchange with modern technology and systems, which allows the team to become acquainted with the project before installation work starts at the construction site, is investigated. </jats:p>",

New legislation and regulation such as the Supply Chain Act, mandates companies to take responsibility for their actions as well as those of their supply chain collaborators. Meeting these requirements demands transparency. Digital technologies along the supply chain have the potential to collect diverse types of data and raise awareness for sustainability purposes. For example, data obtained from multiple supply chain participants can be used to estimate CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions or optimize resource utilization. Following guidelines for systematically reviewing a body of literature, this paper therefore investigates the distribution of digital technologies in supply chains for sustainability. Based on a collected corpus of 70 articles, we identify seven key digital technologies and indicate how they can be employed to contribute to economic, environmental, and social sustainability. The results show that (1) blockchain is the most used technology for sustainability within the supply chain and (2) the majority of articles on digital technologies in our corpus address the social dimension of sustainability. Our findings advance the understanding of how digitalization can transform supply chains into more sustainable entities and help practitioners decide which technology fits a certain sustainability dimension.</jats:p>",

In this study, we explored the operating mechanisms of supply chains utilizing three Stackelberg models, in the following ascending order of cooperation level: price only, marketing cost sharing, and cross-shareholding. Further, we investigated the impact of cooperation on prices, marketing efforts, and profits, and analyzed the strategic cooperation preferences of different supply chain members. The results show that the influence of the level of cooperation on the wholesale and selling price is nonlinear. Interestingly, increased levels of cooperation do not always result in better outcomes. The marketing cost-sharing strategy aggravates the marketing burden on retailers. In contrast, the cross-shareholding strategy not only increases the total marketing effort level, but also efficiently reduces the burden of marketing on retailers. Moreover, all cooperation strategies solely benefit manufacturers rather than retailers, and not all of them improve the supply chain’s performance. Finally, the cross-shareholding cooperation strategy only maximizes the consumer surplus and social welfare under certain conditions. Overall, our study describes the operational mechanisms of diverse cooperative strategies and provides managerial guidance for those seeking to enhance marketing efforts and economic and social performance using a cooperation strategy.</jats:p>"

The analysis was based on the results of a survey conducted in 2023 among 199 respondents – farmers in Poland. Selected social and demographic variables were analysed. For the demographic ones, there were used: gender, age, education of the farm manager, and number of members on the farm. In turn, the level of social capital characterising farmers was described by participation in continuing education, participation in organizations, cooperatives, associations, clubs, etc., and participation in events, concerts, festivals, etc.  A chi-square Pearson’s test of independence was used to compare two groups of farms in terms of the analysed variables. The strength of the relationships was measured using the V-Cramer convergence coefficient. Research revealed that among the social and demographic variables, gender and education were significant. Hence, among farms participating in the SFSCs, there were significantly more farms owned and managed by women and managers of those farms were better educated than managers of farms not participating in the SFSCs. Moreover higher level of social capital, particularly perceived through the involvement of farm owners or members of a household in lifelong education and membership in organisations, cooperatives, or associations was also a distinguishing feature of farms participating in the SFSCs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Researchers have been engaged in the study of high-ductility concrete (HDC) due to its excellent ductility and cracking control ability. This study combines the concepts of HDC and alkali-activated composites (AAC) to develop high-ductility alkali-activated composites (HDAAC) using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) powder. Experimental investigations were conducted to assess the compressive and tensile properties of HDAAC, focusing on the impact of varying PET powder content (0%, 15%, 30%, and 45%) and fly ash/slag ratios (FA/GGBS, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2). The results indicated that the compressive strength of HDAAC ranged from approximately 30 MPa to about 100 MPa, with the specimens maintaining good integrity after axial compression failure due to the bridging action of PE fibers. The replacement of quartz powder (QP) with PET powder slightly decreased the compressive strength and elastic modulus of HDAAC, albeit mitigating its brittleness under compression. An increase in GGBS content enhanced the compressive strength and elastic modulus of HDAAC due to the increased formation of the C-A-S-H reaction products, leading to reduced porosity and a denser microstructure. Under axial tension, HDAAC exhibited typical multiple-cracking behavior with significant pseudo-strain hardening. Increases in the PET content and FA/GGBS ratio resulted in finer cracks, indicating excellent crack control and deformation capabilities. The initial cracking strength, tensile strength, and ultimate tensile strain ranged from 3.0 MPa to 4.6 MPa, 4.2 MPa to 8.2 MPa, and 4.1% to 7.2%, respectively. Despite a decrease in the initial cracking strength and tensile strength with higher PET content, the ultimate tensile strain of HDAAC slightly increased. Observations under a scanning electron microscope revealed a distinct interfacial transition zone near the PET powder, leading to poor bonding with the alkali-activated matrix. In contrast, QP dissolved on the surface in highly alkaline environments, forming better interface properties. These variations in interface properties can be used to interpret the variations in the mechanical performance of HDAAC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The greenhouse effect has a negative impact on social and economic development. Analyzing the factors influencing industrial carbon emissions and accurately predicting the peak of industrial carbon emissions to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is therefore vital. The annual data from 2000 to 2022 were used to study the influencing factors of carbon emission and the path of carbon emission reduction. In this study, the gray correlation method and stepwise regression method were used to explore the effective factors that met the significance test and the STIRPAT expansion model was constructed to analyze the characteristics and influencing factors of industrial carbon emissions in the Sichuan-Chongqing region. Finally, the changing trend of regional industrial carbon emissions is predicted by scenario analysis and four development scenarios are set up, which show that (1) from 2000 to 2022, the change in total industrial carbon emissions in Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality presents an inverted U-shaped trend, reaching a phased peak in 2013 and 2014, respectively, then declining and then rising again after 2018. (2) Industrial scale foreign trade dependence and population are the effective factors of industrial carbon emission in Sichuan, and all have positive effects. Energy structure and per capita income are the effective factors in Chongqing, showing negative and positive effects, respectively. (3) Analysis of four scenarios shows that the time range of the industrial carbon peak in the Sichuan-Chongqing region is 2030–2035 and that its peak height ranges from 81.98 million tons to 87.64 million tons. Among them, the green development scenario is the most consistent path to achieve the carbon peak as soon as possible; in this case, industrial carbon emissions will peak in 2030, in line with the national target time, and the lowest peak level of 81.98 million tons. The suggestions in this paper are continuously optimizing the energy structure, adjusting the industrial scale, and accelerating scientific and technological progress to achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The respondents included stakeholders, such as growers, wholesalers, and retailers, with a sample size of 102 individuals. Data were collected through well-structured interview schedules tailored for each stakeholder group and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings reveal that Panjgur growers produced more than Kech. Regarding experience, 66.7% of Kech wholesalers had 6 to 15 years of experience, compared to 53% in Panjgur. Additionally, 33.4% of Kech wholesalers had over 15 years of experience, whereas this was true for 26.7% in Panjgur. Panjgur wholesalers spent more on purchasing date palms than those in Kech. Income-wise, about 13% of Kech wholesalers earned up to ten lakhs, with one-third of Panjgur wholesalers in this category. Meanwhile, 47% of Kech wholesalers earned between ten and thirty lakhs, compared to 40% in Panjgur. Retailers in Kech reported higher profits, with 84% earning more than 250,000 rupees, while 66.7% of Panjgur retailers earned over 250,000 rupees. There is a need to enhance stakeholders' production and marketing strategies. Specifically, growers should be equipped with modern technology to increase their profit margins and reduce fruit wastage.</jats:p>"

This study emphasises the coconut supply chain, particularly in the provinces of Riau, Indonesia, which are known for their most significant coconut production worldwide, where the coconut industry is one of the most substantial economic sectors. A systematic literature review using PRISMA was implemented to find the drivers and barriers in supply chain implementation, and a qualitative analysis was executed using in-depth interviews involving 17 selected respondents of coconut supply chain stakeholders. It was discovered that the stakeholders encountered 19 drivers and 15 barriers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Edible fungi have certain photo-sensitivity during the mushroom emergence stage, but there have been few relevant studies on the responses of Ganoderma lucidum to different light irradiation conditions. Ganoderma lucidum were planted in an environmentally controllable mushroom room with different light supply modes that were, respectively, continuous white light (CK), red light (R), green light (G), blue light (B), and intermittent red light (R-), green light (G-), and blue light (B-), with a total light intensity of 15 μmol·m−2·s−1 and a light/dark (L/D) period of 12 h/12 h for each treatment. The interval in intermittent light treatments was 30 min. The optimal light supply mode suitable for the growth of Ganoderma lucidum was explored by analyzing the characteristics, nutritional quality, and extracellular enzyme activity in mushrooms exposed to different light treatments. The results showed that red light (whether in continuous or intermittent supply modes) inhibited the fruiting body differentiation of Ganoderma lucidum, showing delayed differentiation or complete undifferentiation. The highest stipe length and pileus diameter of fruiting bodies were detected under G- treatment, which were, respectively, increased by 71.3% and 3.2% relative to the control. The highest weight of fruiting bodies was detected under G treatment, which was significantly increased by 21.4% compared to the control (p &lt; 0.05). Intermittent light mode seemed to be more conducive to the size development of the fruiting body, while continuous light mode was beneficial for increasing the weight. The highest contents of crude protein and total triterpenes in pileus were detected under G treatment (significantly 14.9% and 28.1% higher than the control, respectively), while that of the crude polysaccharide was detected under G- treatment (significantly 35.7% higher than the control) (p &lt; 0.05). The highest activities of extracellular enzymes such as cellulase, hemicellulase, laccase, lignin peroxidase, and amylase were detected in fruiting bodies subjected to G treatment, which were significantly increased by 11.9%~30.7% in the pileus and 9.5%~44.5% in the stipe. Green light might increase the weight and nutrient accumulation in the pileus of Ganoderma lucidum via up-regulating the extracellular enzyme activities. This study provides an effective light supply strategy for regulating the light environment in the industrial production of Ganoderma lucidum.</jats:p>"

This study considers China’s wooden furniture industry as its research object, constructing an evaluation index system of the digital economy and supply chain security of the wooden furniture industry. Then, it studies the impact of the digital economy on supply chain security through theoretical analysis and empirical methods using the two-way fixed model of provinces and time. The findings demonstrate that the digital economy effectively enhances the level of supply chain security in China’s wooden furniture industry, further validating the digital economy’s positive externality impact on the traditional real economy. The impact mechanism test shows that inventory turnover capacity is the focal point for the digital economy to improve the supply chain security of the wood furniture industry, specifying the starting point for that industry’s digital transformation. The heterogeneity findings show that the role of the digital economy in improving the wood furniture industry’s level of supply chain security is more significant in inland areas than in coastal areas. Additional analyses found a threshold effect of the digital economy’s impact on supply chain security, indicating its limitations. This study explores the impact of the digital economy on the real economy from a traditional manufacturing industry, enriching research on the positive externalities of the digital economy as well as providing a reference for traditional manufacturing industries, such as that of wooden furniture, to probe the embedding points of the digital economy and appropriate digital transformation.</jats:p>"

In peacetime, the formation of the price of compound feed was influenced by two main factors: the price of feed raw materials and the cost of feed additives. Thus, in 2020-2021, the market faced a significant increase in the price of compound feed, which was caused by the reduction in grain and sunflower production.\r\nWith the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the russian federation on the territory of Ukraine and war, the agricultural sector suffered huge losses. Due to the loss of territories, mining of farmlands, destruction of agricultural machinery, destruction of granaries, blocking of seaports and disruption of logistics chains, the fodder industry of Ukraine require large capital investments for its recovery. At the same time, a thoughtful use of the funds allocated for the reconstruction of Ukraine by the partner states after the victory will help reform the industry. In particular, stimulating the development of small and medium-sized enterprises will help reduce the influence of big business on the supply side of the national market of compound feed.</jats:p>"

Both the supplier and the e‐retailer are risk‐averse, and they have access to consumers through a common online platform. The online platform possesses the capability to introduce BT and can opt to introduce it to neither, one (DC or RC) or both channels. Game models for the four strategies are developed, and the corresponding equilibrium outcomes are obtained using backward induction. Our analysis reveals that when competition intensity is high and both perceived risk aversion level and BT's unit cost are low, the online platform prefers only DC with adopting BT. Otherwise, it prefers both channels with adopting BT. The supplier shares the same preference as the online platform for BT adoption strategy. Interestingly, the e‐retailer prefers only DC with adopting BT only when BT's unit cost is high; otherwise, she prefers solely RC with adopting BT. Furthermore, we enhance the basic model by modifying parameter configurations and the sequence game, and verify that our main findings in these extensions remain robust.</jats:p>",

In Ukraine, among other types of transport, air transport occupied a worthy place before the armed confrontation. Undoubtedly, the time will come and the further restoration of air transport in Ukraine is inevitable. Unmanned aerial vehicles, which have become indispensable components of reconnaissance operations, are also actively developing today. The main factor in ensuring the functioning of aviation enterprises is electricity supply. Undoubtedly, the power supply systems of aviation enterprises are made with double redundancy, however, as world and domestic experience shows, there is still a need to increase the level of reliability of the power supply systems of aviation enterprises. Therefore, the task of introducing additional generating capacities into the power supply systems of aviation enterprises remains relevant. The advantages of implementing the proposed power supply scheme for aviation enterprises using distributed sources of electrical energy are: the block structure of the system, which consists of typical electrotechnological devices, which makes it possible to relatively quickly provide electricity to responsible consumers of electrical energy, and makes it possible to increase generation capacity in the future. Meanwhile, today's promising ones are electric energy accumulators based on hydrogen technologies, among which fuel cells should be singled out. Not the last role is played by the safety of operating fuel cells in the conditions of aviation enterprises, which maintains aviation safety at a sufficient level. The article highlights the vision proposed by the authors regarding the reconfiguration of the existing power supply systems of aviation enterprises using sources of distributed generation. This approach should increase the safety of operation by accumulating systems on the reliability of power supply systems of aviation enterprises. The proposed power supply system using sources of distributed generation for operation in the conditions of aviation enterprises makes it possible for the power supply system of these enterprises to acquire new properties due to the modularity of generating units of sources of distributed generation of electric energy.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a wind power stochastic and extreme scenario generation method considering wind power–temperature correlations and carries out probabilistic supply–demand balance analysis based on it. Firstly, the influence of temperature on wind power output is analyzed via Pearson coefficient to obtain the correlation between wind power and temperature. Secondly, based on the historical wind power curve, a large number of wind power output scenarios are randomly generated while fully preserving its characteristics, and probabilistic supply–demand analysis is carried out. Thirdly, for the extreme case of continuous multi-day extreme heat without wind, extreme scenarios are selected from the generated scenarios for supply–demand balance analysis. Finally, a practical example in a province in central-eastern China is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the scenario generation method can effectively capture the historical wind power characteristics and can be better applied to the diversified supply and demand balance analysis to obtain more accurate analysis results.</jats:p>"

This study addresses the critical barriers hindering the adoption of blockchain technology (BT) in the Chinese FSC, recognizing the unique challenges posed by its intricacies. Through a comprehensive literature review, fourteen Critical Barrier Factors (CBFs) were identified, and a grey Delphi method was employed to distill this set. Five pivotal CBFs emerged, including \"Regulatory Compliance,\" \"Cost of Implementation,\" and \"Complex Supply Chain Network\". A subsequent grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) analysis revealed the causal relationships among these factors, categorizing them into effect and cause groups. \"Regulatory Compliance,\" \"Cost of Implementation,\" and \"Complex Supply Chain Network\" were identified as primary influencing factors demanding attention for effective BT integration in the FSC. The findings serve as a valuable resource for FSC stakeholders, assisting in prioritizing efforts to address these barriers. The discerned causal relationships provide guidance for managers in optimizing resource allocation. Ultimately, this research advocates for the adoption of blockchain technology in the fisheries supply chain to enhance overall performance and operational efficiency.</jats:p>"

In the conditions of the northern areas of the Krasnoyarsk Region, this is especially important. ASPPs make it possible to reduce the cost of electrical energy by saving fuel consumption and budgetary subsidies for its supply to remote areas of the region. The purpose of the study was to substantiate the areas of application of autonomous hybrid power plants for the regions of the Far North with the possibility of establishing a differentiated social tariff for household consumers. To achieve the goal, load coverage graphs were constructed for Vanavara settlement; the parameters of the ASPP were studied for the conditions of Vanavara settlement; simulation of the operating modes of the ASPP was carried out; calculation of the main technical and economic indicators of the use of ASPP for power supply to Vanavara settlement was carried out; recommendations were given on rational areas of application of ASPPs with the possibility of applying special tariffs for the electricity they produce. The authors of the paper carried out a technical and economic assessment of ASUE in the Vanavara settlement with a capacity of 10 MW, including a solar power plant with a capacity of 2,5 MW. It was established that the cost of electrical energy in the first option when powered by diesel power plants is 36,75 rubles/kW.h. In the second option, the cost depends on the time of year and is 32,7 rubles/kW.h in winter, 11.6 in spring, 6.05 in summer, and 12,2 rubles/kW.h in autumn, which makes it possible to establish a differential social tariff for household consumers based on a lower cost in the summer in the amount of 7–9 rubles/kW.h.</jats:p>",

There are, however, products that, despite their quality, present obstacles in their distribution and direct sale or leave little or no profit margin for producers. Understanding and improving the supply chain helps improve this situation. Honey producers in the country face this problem due to the presence of intermediaries and unfair competition from imported products of lower quality and price. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate the internal and external factors that affect the beekeeping supply chain in Jalisco to identify the type of strategies that contribute to overcoming current problems. To do this, a 5-stage methodology is applied: 1) definition of the research question; 2) design of measuring instruments and surveys; 3) application of instruments through the non-probabilistic snowball sampling technique; 4) data analysis; and 5) determination of relevance of the research. The results show the need to define appropriate production and marketing strategies to strengthen organizations and horizontally and vertically integrate the supply chain. Among the conclusions, the need to improve product income stands out through cooperation or configuration of short supply chains, creation of institutions and standardization of comprehensive hive management practices.</jats:p>"

This is the pattern behind the, so-called, circular supply chains. The effective adoption of this paradigm demands the supply chains actors to establish robust integration and relationships, so that waste and by‐products of an industry or industrial process become the raw materials for others. This circular network is defined as industrial symbiosis. Starting from a background on this topic, this working paper explores the potential of blockchain as enabling technology of Industry 4.0 to disseminate industrial symbiosis practices within the modern industrial scenario. A preliminary two-step framework, i.e., conceptual and operative, is presented including insights and win–win synergies showing the potential of blockchain technology in supporting informative flows of industrial symbiosis. Preliminary field experiences are suggested, along with existing limitations and perspectives on future research.</jats:p>",

However, their use carries an inherent risk of an immune-mediated adverse drug reaction. In this study, we describe the use of a novel pre-clinical human in vitro skin explant test for predicting skin sensitization and adverse immune reactions. The skin explant test was used to investigate the effects of therapeutic antibodies, which are known to cause a limited reaction in a small number of patients or more severe reactions. Material and Methods: Immune responses were determined by T cell proliferation and multiplex cytokine analysis, as well as histopathological analysis of skin damage (grades I–IV in increasing severity), predicting a negative (grade I) or positive (grade ≥ II) response for an adverse skin sensitization effect. Results: T cell proliferation responses were significantly increased in the positive group (p &lt; 0.004). Multiplex cytokine analysis showed significantly increased levels of IFNγ, TNFα, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-1β, and IL-4 in the positive response group compared with the negative response group (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.002, p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.04, p &lt; 0.006, and p &lt; 0.004, respectively). Conclusions: Overall, the skin explant test correctly predicted the clinical outcome of 13 out of 16 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with a correlation coefficient of 0.770 (p = 0.0001). This assay therefore provides a valuable pre-clinical test for predicting adverse immune reactions, including T cell proliferation and cytokine release, both associated with skin sensitization to monoclonal antibodies.</jats:p>"

Water samples were collected from 10 different sites during the premonsoon, monsoon, and postmonsoon seasons. The pH, EC, TDS, major ions, and trace metals were estimated using standard methods. The pH of water samples was slightly alkaline in a few sites. The concentration of all the major ions was below the permissible limit except for K+. The concentration of cations and anions in water was in the order of Ca2+ &amp;gt; Na+ &amp;gt;Mg2+ &amp;gt; K+ and HCO3− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; NO3− respectively. Piper's trilinear diagram revealed that water samples were of Mg-HCO3− and mixed type. A strong correlation of Cl– with other ions suggested precipitation dominance in the hydrogeochemistry of water. The concentration of all trace metals in water samples was above the permissible limit across the season. Although reservoir water was of excellent category as per EC and SAR, RSC remained above the limit across the season. PCA suggested that anthropogenic and geogenic processes regulate water quality in the reservoir. The present work provides a baseline for water quality management policy for the Hirakud reservoir as well as the command area.</jats:p>",

A significant weakness of LH2 is its high energy consumption during the hydrogen liquefaction process, thus the utilization of cold energy in LHCCLV can improve the economic performance and competitiveness of LH2. Because of the high energy storage density of LH2 and the relatively high efficiency of fuel cells, we find that cold energy can not meet the demand of LHCCLV. Therefore, we consider enlarging the cold energy by efforts including the para-ortho hydrogen conversion (POC), whose reverse reaction consumes an energy level exceeding 20% during the hydrogen liquefaction process. In this paper, numerical models of discharging hydrogen from the LH2 and subcooling hydrogen tank are established, and the influence of POC and other efforts on the supply of cold energy is analyzed. The changes in instantaneous and total cold energy supply under different working conditions are analyzed, and the important influence of POC and other efforts is confirmed. The beneficial effect of POC is quantified in the paper, especially for the cold energy supply. This paper provides an essential reference for the research and development of LHCCLV. Also, it guides the comprehensive utilization of cold energy in other situations to promote the improvement of the economy of hydrogen energy utilization routes in the form of LH2.</jats:p>",

Therefore, a new method of locating cable defects based on Gaussian narrow-band envelope signals and the S-transform is proposed in this paper. In this method, the wide-band cable transfer function is obtained by adjusting the parameters of the Gaussian narrow-band envelope signal because the Gaussian narrow-band envelope signal has a good frequency-adjusting ability and time–frequency characteristics. Then, the time–frequency of the cable signal is transformed by the generalized S-transform, and the time delay of the modular matrix of the transformation matrix is estimated by the generalized cross-correlation algorithm to complete the accurate detection of the cable defect’s location. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method can adaptively adjust the analysis time width according to the frequency change and provide intuitive time–frequency characteristics without cross-term interference. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are verified in MATLAB 2017_a by simulating a 40 m/10 kV medium-voltage power cable and submarine cable with a length of 32 km.</jats:p>"

Recent literature has manly focused on forecasting future EV demand and subsequent global battery and critical mineral requirements without modeling which countries will produce the EVs. The Model for International Electric Vehicle Trade (MONET) is a policy-scenario model that combines up-to-date EV demand forecasts, light-duty vehicle global trade flows under different scenarios, and battery characterization to estimate future EV production and battery requirements per country. Results indicate that future EV global trade will be characterized by trade within regional blocks, with contrasting results: North America will be a big producer that will still require imports to meet their demand, Europe will be a big trade region within itself, Japan and South Korea will be big exporters of EVs, and China’s production could go almost entirely to satisfy their domestic supply. Different scenarios show variability according to changes in global trade flows, which are affected by economic and geopolitical events. A major insight reflected in MONET is that an increase in demand for EVs in one country does not translate to a proportional increase in production in the same country. MONET helps to inform which countries will be major producers of EVs by vehicle size, and the amount of battery capacity they will need to secure. Future expansion of MONET includes critical materials estimations based on future battery chemistry development. </jats:p>",

The research aims to evaluate the system's efficiency and focuses on determining the optimal orientation of the solar panel during periods of cloudy weather, which significantly impact sunlight availability and ozone production. To achieve this, two optimization algorithms, namely the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) and the Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA), are employed to optimize the power output. The study is conducted in Algeria, where prevalent autumn cloud cover poses challenges for solar panel operation. By addressing these challenges and designing a high-performance photovoltaic-powered water treatment plant, the research contributes to sustainable water treatment technologies and offers promising solutions for underserved communities in need of water pumping and treatment systems. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing solar panel orientation in cloudy conditions and showcase the effectiveness of the GWO and COA algorithms in maximizing power output. By leveraging these optimization techniques, the proposed approach enhances the performance of the solar generator, ensuring efficient power production even during periods of reduced sunlight. This research not only addresses the specific case of a water treatment plant in a remote area but also has broader implications for the renewable energy sector. The study demonstrates the potential of utilizing solar energy in powering critical infrastructure, such as water treatment facilities, in areas where access to reliable electricity is limited. By fostering the adoption of sustainable energy solutions, this research contributes to the goal of achieving long-term environmental and social sustainability.</jats:p>"

The following conclusions were obtained: The overall precipitation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is reduced, and the number of rainy days is reduced. The frequency of extreme precipitation is generally reduced, but the spatial difference in the intensity of extreme precipitation is greater, which makes the occurrence of extreme precipitation more concentrated and more destructive. Extreme precipitation indicators showed relatively large fluctuations after 2000, especially in terms of extreme precipitation intensity. The frequency of extreme precipitation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is the highest in the main stream of the Yangtze River Basin and the Wujiang River Basin, the intensity of extreme precipitation is in the Jialing River and the Wujiang River Basin, and the accumulation of extreme precipitation is the highest in the Jialing River and the Wujiang River Basin, whereas the maximum value of the station extreme precipitation intensity and frequency is in the Minjiang River Basin.</jats:p>",

Doppler assessment of coronary artery blood flow was performed. As a reference vessel, we chose the anterior descending artery, which is the largest branch of the left coronary artery and has its own numerous branches providing blood supply to the main part of the functionally active left ventricle myocardium. We studied the following groups of patients, whose rehabilitation included balneotherapy with velvet antler products: 1) 48 subjects with stage 2 arterial hypertension and 2) 49 subjects with coronary artery disease after balloon angioplasty and coronary artery stenting. In addition to balneotherapy, group 1 received standard hypotensive therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers and thiazide diuretics, while group 2 was given indirect anticoagulants, beta blockers and new generation statins. Before and upon completing the treatment course, each patient’s peak blood flow velocity was measured, as well as blood flow integral in the proximal segment of the anterior descending artery. Results. After the balneotherapy course, most patients in both groups showed quiet and increased activation of high reactivity level. According to our observations, patients tolerated the treatment well. Initially, peak blood flow velocity and blood flow integral were recorded within the range of 28–45 cm/s (mean: 36.9 ± 4.4 cm/s) and 9–14 cm (mean: 11.00 ± 1.25 cm), respectively, without between-group differences. After the multimodality treatment that included balneotherapy with velvet antler products, these parameters were recorded within the range of 39–52 cm/s (mean: 45.7 ± 3.5 cm/s) and 11–16 cm (mean: 14.0 ± 1.3 cm), respectively, with no between-group differences either. The increase in peak blood flow velocity was statistically significant (p ˂ 0.001). Thus, balneotherapy using innovative velvet antler products combined with medication treatment and physical therapy, presumably, contributed to improving coronary blood circulation in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and arterial hypertension.</jats:p>",

Por ello, gestionar el recurso es un reto por los múltiples problemas que se suscitan. La metodología utilizada fue de corte cualitativo, en la que se revisó literatura sobre el tema y se diseñaron entrevistas semiestrucuturadas para aplicarse a 17 directores vinculados con la gestión del suministro de agua potable en la ciudad situados en el Sistema de Aguas de la Ciudad de México (Sacmex) y en las 16 alcaldías, tomando como base el modelo de Hooper. Los resultados y su discusión muestran que de las 10 categorías del modelo destaca la carencia presupuestal para el desempeño óptimo de la gestión, y las reformas necesarias en la normatividad hídrica que permita agilizar los procesos y fortalecer su evaluación y seguimiento. Considerando estas dos subcategorías se podrían mejorar en gran medida las demás: la toma de decisiones coordinada; la respuesta en la toma de decisiones; los objetivos, su cambio y finalización; el diseño organizacional; la formación y el desarrollo; la información e investigación; la responsabilidad y el seguimiento; y las funciones de los sectores público y privado. Sin embargo, se requiere voluntad política, una coordinación eficaz entre los principales involucrados y concientización por parte del sector social.

As the most influential climate prediction platform in the world, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides important data on predicted future climate change trends. Based on 10 models under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios, in this study, we obtained 0.5 × 0.5° data through down-scaling data processing and predicted future rainfall and temperature changes in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region of China. Combined with historical observed data of 198 meteorological stations in the region, the relationships between the predicted values of the model and the measured values were analyzed using the Taylor diagram method. The results show that (1) the future precipitation capacity assessed by the global climate system is generally higher than observed data; (2) for assessment of future temperatures, RCP8.5 shows a larger increase than RCP4.5; (3) for the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, our results show that the Atmospheric Chemistry Coupled Version of Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate-Earth System (MIROC-ESM-CHEM) model is more consistent with the evaluation of future precipitation capacity, the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2-Earth System(HadGEM2-ES) model is more consistent with the future RCP4.5 scenario temperature evaluation, and the MIROC-ESM-CHEM model is more consistent with the future RCP8.5 scenario temperature evaluation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The need for fresh water production is especially high in hot dry climates without any sources of drinking water but with an abundance of sea and underground water. The solution is water desalination with efficient solar-powered water treatment plants. This article proposes a new modification of a basin made of thin-finned corrugation with 43°-angle-inclined sides, equal to the region’s latitude, which provide strong heating. The experiments were carried out in the hot climate of Aktau city (43°49′ N, 51°1′ E). The study’s outcomes can be useful for regions with drinking water scarcity. To define the level of the corrugated basin’s efficiency, two versions (SS-1, SS-2) of experiments were carried out on a two-slope distiller, complete with two basins. In SS-1, basin-2 was heated by air. By 15:00, basin-2 had heated up to 98.5 °C, and the acrylic cover above had heated up to 101.6 °C, which led to its “deformation”. By 12.00 p.m., the temperature differentials between the glass (40.7 °C), the air–water mixture (57.3 °C), and basin-1 (61.1 °C) were 16.6 °C and 20.4 °C. This resulted from the wind speed increasing up to 5.9 m/s. The large temperature differential contributed to the condensate yield increasing from 0.128 kg at 11 o’clock to 0.293 kg at 12 o’clock. The throughput capability of basin-1 per day was equal to 2.094 kg. Basin-2’s input to the performance in SS-1 was only the thermal effect. In SS-2, basin-2 was used as a regular basin. The plexiglass temperature was lower than the temperatures of the water and basin-2. The temperature differential between the glass and air–water mixture at 10:00 a.m. was 20 °C; at 12:00 p.m. it was 30.6 °C; and a value of 30.6 °C was recorded at 3:00 p.m. The thermal differential between the glass and the air-water mixture provided the highest condensate yield of 1.114 kg at 3.00 p.m. The condensate yield from the basins in SS-2 was 8.72 kg, including 3.5 kg from basin-1, which is 1.7 times more than from basin-1 in SS-1. The experimental results are consistent with the equations coming from the models of Clark J.A. and Dunkle R.V. Tcondensation ≠ Tevaporation is an irreversible process. When the basins are heated, the heat is consumed; when the glass cools down, the heat is given off. Heat losses are minimized due to the “gap” and positive energy is provided. The still’s throughput capability can be made larger by increasing the basin’s area, reducing the water layer thickness, and regulating the flowrate of the desalinated water.</jats:p>"

The rice supply chain in Indonesia has many stakeholders from upstream to downstream, making it much more complex. The challenge is that many activities make it difficult to trace materials, process flows, and information flows. This condition resulted in an inefficient rice supply chain and no upstream and downstream transparency. This paper aims to provide a proposal for an integrated rice supply chain design based on blockchain technology so that it can increase added value and product competitiveness. Based on the study’s results, the rice supply chain comprises six main stakeholders: farmer groups, collecting traders, the milling industry, distributors, Bulog (National Logistics Agency), and retailers. This paper describes the blockchain technology design to be implemented in the rice supply chain. Blockchain technology has the advantage because the historical information recorded for each stakeholder can be distributed to other stakeholders so that the flow of information can be distributed to all stakeholders, making it more transparent. The application of distributed storage has resulted in blockchain technology having advantages in data storage and security.</jats:p>",

One important ecosystem service provided by such areas is water provisioning service, which has significant impacts on the surrounding ecosystems due to its flow characteristics. This study aimed to simulate water resources in Inner Mongolia and its surrounding watersheds in 2010 and 2015 using a simplified service path attribution networks (SPANs) model. The InVEST software was utilized to simulate water provisions, and five types of water consumption were used to calculate the total water consumption. Probability statistics with BBNs were utilized to classify variables influencing water provisioning services and calculate state probabilities under different levels of water provisioning services. The results indicated that the remaining water resources in Inner Mongolia were 3.85 × 10<jats:sup>10</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in 2010 and 1.92 × 10<jats:sup>10</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in 2015.

Inner Mongolia not only supplies water resources for its own needs but also supports the surrounding areas. Key variables influencing the amount of water‐provisioning services include precipitation, level of economic development, topography, and land use. This research highlights the considerable regional and transregional effects of water provisioning services provided by Inner Mongolia's ecological shelters by delineating the “supply‐flow‐demand” pathway, addressing the spatial correlation deficiency between supply and demand in the field of ecosystem service flow research. The findings of this study, focusing on a typical ecological shelter, can serve as a reference for future research in other similar shelters.</jats:p>",

To reduce environmental impact, all the grapes were treated following the integrated production practice (IPP) strategies. The adopted agronomic methods and the main physico-chemical parameters of the fresh fruits and musts were evaluated. A fully qualitative and quantitative characterization of the phenolic fraction of the pomace extracts was performed by HPLC-DAD after a post-winemaking process. Water and ethanol were utilized as green solvents in the extraction process. Additionally, the entire pomace post-winemaking process was carried out within the winery facilities to reduce energy loss and road transportation. The findings demonstrated that large amounts of beneficial polyphenols are present in pomace extracts, and that the type of grape used, agronomic practices, and winemaking method all influence the quantity and quality of the extracts.

Food fraud assessments are a widely accepted fraud mitigation and prevention activity undertaken to identify possible points of deception within a supply chain. This study aims to understand the food fraud vulnerability of post-harvest seafood supply chains in the UK and determine if there are differences according to commodity, supply chain node, business size and certification status. The SSAFE food fraud vulnerability assessment tool was used to assess 48 fraud factors relating to opportunities, motivations and controls. The analysis found seafood supply chains to have a medium vulnerability to food fraud, with the highest perceived vulnerability in technical opportunities. Certification status was a stronger determinant of vulnerability than any other factor, particularly in the level of controls, a factor that also indicated a higher perceived level of vulnerability in smaller companies and the food service industry. This paper also reviews historic food fraud trends in the sector to provide additional insights and the analysis indicates that certain areas of the supply chain, including uncertified prawn supply chains, salmon supply chains and food service companies, may be at higher risk of food fraud. This study conducts an in-depth examination of food fraud vulnerability relating to the UK and for seafood supply chains and contributes to a growing body of literature identifying areas of vulnerability and resilience to food related criminality within the global food system.</jats:p>"

Rumen degradation kinetics data on neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in buffaloes are lacking for most tropical forage species. This study evaluated the effect of forage species, family, and growing location on NDF concentration and in situ degradability of six tropical cereal and four legume fodder crops. The fodder crops were grown following uniform recommended agronomic practices at three different agroecological locations and harvested at the appropriate growth stage: cereals at booting and legumes at 50% flowering. Later, the dried ground forage samples were incubated in the four rumen-cannulated Nili-Ravi buffalo cows in a four × two × three split-plot design for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 96, and 168 h. The degradation fractions and degradability, expressed either on an NDF or dry matter basis, were considerably affected by forage family (cereal vs. legume) and growing locations and their interaction. Legume fodders degraded more rapidly but to a lesser extent than cereal fodders. The chemical components, notably the NDF, showed a significant but moderate negative relationship with the effective NDF degradability. Among studied fodders, the legumes had a significantly lower NDF concentration and subsequent degradability than the cereals. Although the cereals showed a slower rate of NDF degradation, their overall degradability was higher. The agro-climatic variability among three locations strongly impacted the NDF concentrations and fractions in the tropical forages. Effective NDF degradability was also correlated with the fodders’ NDF concentration, especially in cereals where the nature of the correlation was negative. In conclusion, the nutritional composition and NDF degradation parameters of the fodders were significantly affected by the species, family, and location of growth and their interactions. These results will help to improve agronomy and usage of these important fodder crops.</jats:p>"

Crucial for linking populations and infrastructure to system withdrawals, it supports the creation of a national public‐supply water‐use model, enhancing accuracy in estimating water use and distinguishing between publicly supplied and self‐supplied domestic water use. Integrating tabular water system data strengthens the national water‐use model by enabling tracking of withdrawal locations, source water, and water quality. Evaluated against U.S. Census‐derived population datasets, 16 state‐provided water service area datasets, and two national land use datasets, the study covers 22,849 community water systems, excluding most small systems serving fewer than 1000 people. Robust correlations between water service areas (WSAs) and satellite‐sourced urban and exurban land use types facilitate tracking changes over time. A comparison of state and national datasets for population and WSAs reveals discrepancies ranging from 5% to 73% in state‐level populations and 0% to 167% in state‐level WSAs. Significant differences can be attributed to the exclusion of sizable incorporated and unincorporated areas in the state‐based datasets. Additional comparisons of major metropolitan areas exhibit differences ranging from 2% to 56%.</jats:p>",

Use the game theory combination weighting-VIKOR method to quantify the resilience level, and use the kernel density analysis and Markov chain to explore the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and transition probability. The results show that (1) the resilience index of the composite system in the Huaihe River Basin shows an increasing trend, and the resilience level of the Anhui section is generally higher than that of the Shandong section. (2) The resilience level gradually evolved into the spatial distribution characteristics of high in the west and low in the east, high in the south and low in the north during the study period. (3) The resilience grade has strong robustness, and the probability of transferring to the higher grade is greater than that of transferring to the lower grade.</jats:p>",

Material flow analysis data was combined with environmental and socio-economic metrics to evaluate the sustainability of these supply chains for the modeled scenarios. Overall, the NextCycle scenario for these supply chains achieved a net 14% and 34% savings of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy impacts, when compared with their respective baseline values. Additionally, the NextCycle scenario showed a net gain in employment and wages, however, it showed a net loss of revenue generation outside of Michigan due to the avoided use of virgin resins in Michigan.</jats:p>"

To meet this objective, we reviewed the current regulations in Colombia, compared with international policies in countries such as Perú, Chile, and México; and made a detailed analysis of the beneficiary population through the current databases of the food bank of Bogotá. In conclusion, a viable proposal was obtained, which will later be implemented throughout the national territory by regulating the sale of unhealthy food in school stores, to take this strategy to an international scale, since the implementation of this strategy would not only promote healthier eating among beneficiaries but would also lay the foundations for a culture of self-care and wellness.</p>"

Traditionally, Ag‐alloying of CIS (ACIS) is grown on soda‐lime glass (SLG) at temperatures exceeding 500 °C, resulting in uncontrolled alkali diffusion from the substrate and variable photovoltaic properties. A substrate‐independent low‐bandgap ACIS growth process is introduced and the impact of controlled supplies of NaF and RbF alkali fluorides before and after absorber growth through precursor layers and post‐deposition treatments (PDT) are investigated. NaF and RbF precursor layers enhance carrier lifetimes and doping density, outperforming the previous SLG‐dependent strategy. Even small quantities of RbF significantly enhance device performance, while specific NaF amount during deposition are necessary to limit grain growth and achieve high doping densities and lifetimes. A certain density of grain boundaries appears crucial for high doping levels. Although subsequent NaF post‐deposition treatment (PDT) does not provide additional benefits with sufficient Na during growth, RbF‐PDT remains crucial. The best performance is achieved with a combination of NaF and RbF precursor layers along with RbF‐PDT, resulting in over 19% efficiency, 605 mV open‐circuit voltage (<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>OC</jats:sub>), 73% fill factor (FF), a carrier density of 3 × 10<jats:sup>16</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, and a 700 ns lifetime.

This study aims to tackle the significant concern of supplier selection disruptions in the Thai agri-food industry as a response to the aforementioned challenges. A novel supplier evaluation system, PROMETHEE II, is suggested; it combines the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with inferential statistical techniques. This investigation commences with the identification of critical indicators of risk in the sustainable supply chain via three phases of analysis and 315 surveys of management teams. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is utilized to ascertain six supply risk criteria and twenty-three sub-criteria. Following this, the parameters are prioritized by FAHP, whereas four prospective suppliers for an agricultural firm are assessed by PROMETHEE II. By integrating optimization techniques into sensitivity analysis, this hybrid approach improves supplier selection criteria by identifying dependable solutions that are customized to risk scenarios and business objectives. The iterative strategy enhances the resilience of the agri-food supply chain by enabling well-informed decision-making amidst evolving market dynamics and chain risks. In addition, this research helps agricultural and other sectors by providing a systematic approach to selecting low-risk suppliers and delineating critical supply chain risk factors. By bridging complexity and facilitating informed decision-making in supplier selection processes, the results of this study fill a significant void in the academic literature concerning sustainable supply chain risk management.</jats:p>"

With special focus on remote and underserved settings, we assessed the reach and bottlenecks of the Ethiopian VSCLS after the initiation of the last mile transition. We explored the perspectives of key stakeholders using a qualitative phenomenological study. More than 300 in-depth interviews and 22 focus group discussions were conducted. The study was sequentially implemented over two phases to understand the bottlenecks at national and regional (Phase I) and lower (Phase II) levels. After the transition, the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Service started supplying vaccines directly to health facilities, bypassing intermediaries. The transition reduced supply hiccups and enabled the health sector to focus on its core activities. However, in remote areas, achievements were modest, and health facilities have been receiving supplies indirectly through district health offices. By design, health posts collect vaccines from health centers, causing demotivation of health extension workers and frequent closure of health posts. Challenges of the VSCLS include artificial shortage due to ill forecasting and failure to request needs on time, lack of functional refrigerators secondary to scarcity of skilled technicians and spare parts, and absence of dependable backup power at health centers. Vaccine wastages owing to poor forecasts, negligence, and cold chain problems are common. The VSCLS has not yet sustainably embraced digital logistics solutions. The system is overstrained by frequent outbreak responses and introduction of new vaccines. We concluded that the transition has improved the VSCLS, but the reach remains suboptimal in remote areas.</jats:p>",

To explore the influence of natural wind on fire smoke movement in an extra-long highway tunnel based on the Taihang Mountain Tunnel, the distribution law of natural wind in the tunnel was obtained by on-site monitoring of the meteorological conditions at the tunnel site. A three-dimensional fire dynamics tunnel model considering an inclined shaft smoke exhaust was established, and the influence of natural wind on tunnel temperature distribution, smoke spread and smoke exhaust efficiency was studied. The results show that the natural wind speed of the Taihang Mountain Tunnel is mainly concentrated at 0~3 m/s. The main wind direction of the natural wind on the left tunnel is opposite to the driving direction, and the distribution probability of the main wind direction in each section is 81.27% and 72.15%, respectively. The main wind direction of the right tunnel is the same as the driving direction, and the distribution probability of the main wind direction in each section is 56.78%, 69.73%, 67.32% and 64.65%, respectively. The negative natural wind can inhibit the smoke spread downstream of the smoke exhaust port, but it is not conducive to the smoke exhaust. The positive natural wind promotes the smoke spread to the downstream of the smoke exhaust port, and the larger the natural wind speed, the longer the spread length. Natural wind reduces the smoke exhaust efficiency. For positive or negative natural wind with a guaranteed rate of 70%, the smoke exhaust efficiency is reduced by 27.76% and 15.59%, respectively, compared with the condition without natural wind. The research results can provide a useful reference for the design of fire smoke exhausts and smoke control schemes in extra-long highway tunnels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although the issue of embodied pollutants in China’s supply chains has garnered increasing attention, the dynamic changes occurring within them are unclear. Several existing studies analyze one-year or short-term data in supply chain. China’s overall CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions have risen from 41.1 Tg in 2000 to 60 Tg in 2020, so conducting long-term analyses can yield a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes across the entire supply chain from production to consumption. This study uses the environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIOA) and structural path analysis (SPA) methods to investigate the dynamic variation of China’s embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions in 20 industry sectors from 2000 to 2020, aiming to determine the key supply chain and key sectors. The results reveal that from the final demand perspective, consumption, investment and export drove 52.1%, 32%, and 15.9% of embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions in 2020. The sector with the highest embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions has changed from “Agriculture” in 2000 to “Construction” in 2010 to “Other service and activities” in 2020. The top listed supply chain path of embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions has also evolved (starting from production to consumption) from “Agriculture → Rural consumption” in 2000 to “Agriculture → Food and tobacco → Urban consumption” in 2010 to “Agriculture → Urban consumption” in 2020. Notably, the high-ranked path, “Agriculture → Food and tobacco → Rural consumption”, shows that the embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission flowing between agriculture and the food industry cannot be ignored. The supply chain path “Coal Mining → Nonmetal Mineral Products → Construction → Capital Formation” has risen from 17th in 2000 to 3rd in 2020. Thus, it is necessary to control CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from sectors upstream, which are predominantly influenced by the construction industry, and a coordinated effort between sectors is also required to effectively reduce emissions. By 2020, the CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions driven by urban consumption were 3.1 times that of rural consumption. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of China's supply chain over the past two decades. In particular, it suggests policy interventions by controlling critical supply chain paths and key sectors associated with embodied CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission, thereby facilitating the coordinated reduction of anthropogenic CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions.</jats:p>"

We base system sizing on a techno-economical optimization for the start of operation in 2030.

Trade-offs must be taken when choosing an energy system to supply the prospective off-grid telescope in Chile. We find high-renewable systems with some fossil generation as the better option regarding power reliability, mineral resource depletion, and water use, while inducing slightly higher greenhouse gas emissions than the 100% RES scenarios. As remote research facilities and off-grid settlements today are mainly supplied by fossil fuels, we expect to motivate more multifaceted decisions for implementing larger shares of RES for these areas. To advance the LCA community in the field of energy systems, we should strive to incorporate temporal and regional realities into our life cycle inventories. To ease the path for upcoming studies, we publish this work’s inventories as detailed activity level datasets.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

The utilization of UHF imaging as a new imaging technique for the 3D-in-vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model can facilitate new insights into tissue perfusion and survival. Therefore, human renal cystic tissue was grafted onto the CAM and examined using UHF ultrasound imaging. Due to the unprecedented resolution of UHF ultrasound, it was possible to visualize microvessels, their development, and the formation of anastomoses. This enabled the observation of anastomoses between human and chicken vessels only 12 h after transplantation. These observations were validated by 3D reconstructions from a light sheet microscopy image stack, indocyanine green angiography, and histological analysis. Contrary to the assumption that the nutrient supply of the human cystic tissue and the gas exchange happens through diffusion from CAM vessels, this study shows that the vasculature of the human cystic tissue is directly connected to the blood vessels of the CAM and perfusion is established within a short period. Therefore, this in-vivo model combined with UHF imaging appears to be the ideal platform for studying the effects of intravenously applied therapeutics to inhibit renal cyst growth.</jats:p>"

The remaining troughs were installed in communities and left under the protection and supervision of beekeepers. A camera-trap station was associated with each of the drinking troughs installed.\nResults: Ninety-one wildlife species that drink water from the artificial troughs have been identified, including 30 mammals, 53 birds, 5 reptiles, and three amphibians. Jaguars, tapirs, and other endangered species are some of the most frequent visitors to these sites, especially during the dry season.\nStudy Limitations/Implications: The use of artificial water troughs is an adequate alternative to guarantee water availability in the Calakmul region. The high diversity of species that constantly visit the drinking troughs during the dry season makes evident the functionality of the water supply strategy with artificial drinking troughs.\nFindings/Conclusions: The drinking troughs can be a tool for various objectives in the region. It arose from the need to respond to emergency climatological events (i.e., droughts), but it has been adapted to the regional needs and other activities. It has been considered a successful management strategy in the face of climate change.</jats:p>"

This study proposes to extend the analysis of relational drivers in the implementation of changes in practices beyond peer groups, by looking at their collective organization around territorialized supply chains involving other actors. More specifically, this paper proposes to study the role that this collective organization around territorial supply chains plays in the changes toward agroecological practices carried out on farms.The study of the individual farm trajectories as a chain of events is an approach that allows the understanding and analysis of changes in practices. As we are interested in coordination mechanisms based on interactions between actors as a driver for agroecological transition, we mobilize the framework and tools of social network analysis. In particular, in order to analyse the relational drivers in the trajectories of changes practices, we mobilize the relational chain approach through the method of quantified narratives. This approach allows us to understand changes in practices on farms as collective actions, through the study of relationships activated by farmers in order to have access to different types of resources during their trajectory. Thus, our work feeds the literature mobilizing the method of quantified narratives for the analysis of farm transition trajectories, which we modulate by focusing on the trajectory of a particular cropping system analysed through the agronomic and socio-economic principles of agroecology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight farmers who are members of a territorial organic wheat-flour- bread supply chain collective that includes a miller and a baker, all located in the plain of Limagne (Puy-de-Dôme, France). Following these interviews focused on their changes in wheat-growing practices, we identified five phases of agronomic and socio-economic coherence in their trajectories, that we evaluated through the prism of the agroecological principles. We then identified the relationships activated by the farmers to access the various resources needed to carry out the changes in practices during these different phases. Based on their trajectories, a typology of farms was created. This typology helps to understand the different roles played by farmers’ collectives developing territorial supply chains in the different types of farms, by analysing during which phases of the trajectory they intervene, to provide access to which resources, in articulation with which other actors. Although the interests for participation vary between the different types of farms, it appears that the farmers’ collective developing territorial supply chains systematically give access to commercial, cognitive, social and material resources. As a result, they favour access to strategic resources on the farms, making it possible to couple changes in agricultural practices and their economic valorisation. These resources contribute to a change in the farmers' posture during their trajectory, moving from a role of raw material producers to a role of co-designers of agroecological products.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">L'action collective entre agriculteurs est régulièrement présentée comme un levier pour la mise en oeuvre de changements de pratiques agroécologiques dans les exploitations agricoles. Cette étude propose d'ouvrir l'analyse des déterminants relationnels dans l'adoption de changements de pratiques au-delà des groupes de pairs en s'intéressant à leur organisation collective autour de filières territoriales faisant intervenir d'autres acteurs. Pour ce faire, la méthode des narrations quantifiées a été mobilisée dans le cadre d'entretiens semi-directifs menés auprès des 8 agriculteurs membres d'un collectif filière territoriale intégrant un meunier et un boulanger. L'analyse de ces trajectoires a permis la création d'une typologie des fermes favorisant la compréhension du rôle que joue le collectif filière territoriale dans les changements de pratiques menés par ses différents membres. Bien que les intérêts pour la participation au collectif varient entre les différents types de fermes, il ressort que le collectif donne systématiquement accès à des ressources tant commerciales, que cognitives, sociales et matérielles. De ce fait, le collectif favorise l'accès à des ressources stratégiques dans les exploitations agricoles permettant de coupler la mise en oeuvre de changements de pratiques agricoles et leur valorisation économique. Ces ressources contribuent à un changement de posture des agriculteurs au cours de leur trajectoire, passant d'un rôle d'exécutants producteurs de matières premières à un rôle de coconcepteurs de produits agroécologiques.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to determine the optimal nitrate dosage required in short-term cultivation to achieve substantial BAC production. A nitrate experiment using varied concentrations (0 to 6.5 mM) revealed optimal nitrate uptake at 0.5 mM in the first two days and at 3 and 5 mM in the last five days. Polyphenols and carbohydrates showed no differences between treatments, while soluble proteins peaked at 1.5 and 3 mM. Total mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) were highest in algae incubated at 5 and 6.5 mM, and the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the 5 mM, potentially related to the MAAs amount. Total carbon and sulfur did not differ between treatments, while nitrogen decreased at higher nitrate. This discovery highlights the nuanced role of nitrate in algal physiology, suggesting that biological and chemical responses to nitrate supplementation can optimize an organism’s health and its commercially significant bioactive potential. Furthermore, given its ability to absorb high doses of nitrate, this alga can be cultivated in eutrophic zones or even in out-/indoor tanks, becoming an excellent option for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and bioremediation.</jats:p>"

The increasing digitization of industrial systems demands efficient sensing and control methods, giving rise to soft sensors that have the potential to replace traditional physical sensors in order to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. This study explores the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) based soft sensor model in a water supply system to predict flow rates within the system. The soft sensor is centered on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural network model using Monte Carlo dropout to reduce uncertainty and improve estimation performance. Based on the results of this work, it is concluded that the proposed soft sensor (with Monte Carlo dropout) can predict flow rates more precisely, contributing to the reduction in water losses, as well as cost savings. This approach offers a valuable solution for minimizing water losses and ensuring the efficient use of this vital resource. Regarding the use of soft sensors based on LSTM neural networks with a careful choice of Monte Carlo dropout parameters, when compared to the multilayer perceptron model, the LSTM model with Monte Carlo dropout showed better mean absolute error, root mean square error, and coefficient of determination: 0.2450, 0.3121, and 0.996437 versus 0.2556, 0.3522, and 0.9954. Furthermore, this choice of Monte Carlo dropout parameters allowed us to achieve an LSTM network model capable of reducing uncertainty to 1.8290, keeping the error metrics also at low levels.</jats:p>"

In the work, a comparative analysis of the existing conceptual terminological apparatus related to the definitions of energy security and security of supply was carried out in order to establish the main differences. At the same time, assessment and control of the security of electricity supply, as integral indicators that make it possible to plan the activities of the single European energy market, have become fundamental issues for various countries. Assessment and control of the security of electricity supply in modern Ukraine is becoming an increasingly urgent task in connection with the connection of its unified energy system to the energy system of Europe and the need to ensure emergency-free parallel operation. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to form an idea of modern approaches to the assessment of the security of electricity supply in Ukraine and the EU countries, as well as to search for opportunities to improve the control system of security of supply. It was established that, apart from the prescriptive regulation of the basic principles of the formation of indicators, at the moment there are no unified approaches that would allow them to be used to create a national methodological base for a conscious and qualitative assessment of security of supply. Based on the results of the comparative analysis, the main ways by which the issue of security of supply assessment is considered have been identified. It has been proven that an important direction is the creation of a multi-level system of assessment and control of the security of electricity supply, as well as ensuring the control of the implementation of organizational measures aimed at improving the security of supply.

Mammary fat pads were five pairs (first cervical, second and third thoracic, fourth abdominal and fifth inguinal), bilaterally symmetrical, extending laterally and continuously with the subcutaneous fascia. The superficial cervical artery and vein primarily accomplished the blood vasculature of the first mammary fat pad, while the lateral thoracic and external thoracic arteries and veins supplied the second and third mammary fat pads. The superficial cervical vein (found parallel to the superficial cervical artery) drained into the external jugular vein. The lateral thoracic artery and external thoracic artery branched almost at the same level as the axillary artery (branch of subclavian artery), the latter being more medial in position. However, in some specimens, the branching of both arteries appeared to be at the same level, and their origins were indistinguishable. The lateral thoracic vein that was parallel to the lateral thoracic artery drained to the axillary vein close to the drainage of the external thoracic vein. The lateral thoracic, superficial caudal epigastric, iliolumbar and external thoracic arteries and veins vascularized the fourth mammary fat pad and displayed anastomosis among themselves. The iliolumbar vein (found parallel to the iliolumbar artery) drained into the inferior vena cava. The superficial caudal epigastric vein (found parallel to the superficial caudal epigastric artery (SCaEA)) drained into the femoral vein. Unlike humans, the internal thoracic artery and vein did not participate in the vasculature of mammary fat pads. The SCaEA and vein supplied blood and drained the fifth mammary fat pad. The anatomical continuity of the fourth and fifth mammary fat pads provided common drainage for both mammary fat pads. The BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice strains studied did not differ in topography and size of mammary fat pads. The vascular supply and drainage of the mammary fat pads also did not differ in the strains studied. Only minor variations could be noted in the small veins draining into the lateral thoracic vein. Lateral tributaries seen in the terminal end of the lateral thoracic vein were absent in the C57BL/6 mice.</jats:p>",

Subsequently, designs for three incentive mechanisms—the greenness reward, the R&amp;D effort reward, and the digital construction reward—are presented, and their long-term dynamic effects on the economic, environmental, and social benefits are compared and analyzed. Finally, the impacts of consumer green preference and the contribution of digital capability to the advancement of green innovation are explored. The findings show that all these incentives can boost economic, environmental, and social benefits while motivating the supplier. To achieve the best incentive effect, the reward coefficient should fall within a specific range. The digital construction reward mechanism is the most favourable in the initial stage, while the R&amp;D effort reward mechanism is the most appropriate in the long term.

Fermentation of wasted activated sludge (WAS) and novel nitrogen removal technologies based on partial nitrification (PN) have emerged as promising solutions to these issues. Recent studies have revealed an innovative strategy that integrates these two processes by supplementing fermentation liquid into activated sludge to induce PN. This review summarizes the research progress on PN establishment induced by the fermentation process. The microbiology and establishment methods of PN are briefly introduced, followed by a detailed discussion on the process, influencing factors, and product characteristics of WAS fermentation. The core section focuses on the side-stream and main-stream approaches of fermentation-induced PN, comparing their performance and application prospects. The potential mechanisms are explored, with an emphasis on the roles of free ammonia for the side-stream approach and the high tolerance of ammonium oxidizers to in-site fermentation stress for the main-stream approach. Finally, the limitations of the current research and future perspectives are discussed, highlighting the need for further investigation into microbial ecology, process optimization, and long-term stability. This review aims to provide insights into the synergistic integration of WAS fermentation and PN for sustainable and energy-efficient wastewater treatment.</jats:p>"

As such, the investigation of its property is essential. Based on the spatial structure of aquifers in the study area, the aquifers in the Cenozoic strata are divided into three groups. The multivariate statistical approaches are employed to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and hydro-chemical types, and hydrogeochemical inverse modeling is applied to further validate and elucidate the hydrogeochemical process and water–rock interaction. The results are as follows: (1) The hydro-chemical type of the upper aquifer is dominated by the K + Na-HCO3 type, while others have similar water quality types, which are dominated by the K + Na-Cl type and the K + Na-SO4 type. (2) The saturation index of anhydrite, gypsum, halite, and CO2(g) is below zero in three aquifers, indicating that they are unsaturated. While aragonite, calcite, and dolomite in the middle aquifer remain in the unsaturated–saturated state. (3) The cation exchange process accelerating the reduction of Ca2+ concentration and the increase of SO42− concentration occurs in three aquifers, and the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals occurs in most cases. This study supports the fundamental evidence for the hydrogeochemical processes and water resource utilization and has a certain practical significance.</jats:p>",

Given the severe water scarcity in the region and the significant use of intercropping as a cropping method, the development of rational irrigation scheduling is crucial. The objective of this work was to combine the ISAREG model with wheat–sunflower intercropping crops in order to enhance the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling in intercropping systems. This was achieved by changing and verifying crucial parameters for simulating irrigation patterns in intercropping. We conducted an assessment of nine irrigation schedules for a wheat–sunflower intercropping system in order to provide a range of irrigation scenarios that effectively fulfill the water requirements of the system. In light of this, we suggested implementing restrictions on the dates and volumes of irrigation based on the demand for agricultural irrigation. This approach aimed to establish irrigation schedules that are highly efficient and tailored to the specific crops in the area. As a result, we achieved a water use efficiency rate of 100%, saved 28.78% of water resources, optimized crop irrigation schedules, and enhanced crop economics by 6.7%. This study presents a novel and efficient method to optimize agricultural irrigation schedules, boost agricultural water use efficiency, and maximize crop yields in order to promote sustainable agricultural development.</jats:p>"

However, efficient eradication of bacterial biofilms remains a challenge. Herein, a self‐regulated phototheranostic nanosystem with single wavelength‐triggered photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) transformation and oxygen supply for multimodal synergistic therapy of bacterial biofilm infections is presented. This approach combines a eutectic mixture of natural phase‐change materials (PCMs) and an aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) phototheranostic agent TPA‐ICN to form colloidally stable nanopartcicles (i.e. AIE@PCM NPs). The reversible solid−liquid phase transition of PCMs facilitates the adaptive regulation of the aggregation states of TPA‐ICN, enabling a switch between the energy dissipation pathways for enhanced PDT in solid PCMs or enhanced PTT in liquid PCMs. Additionally, oxygen‐carrying thermoresponsive nanoparticles are also introduced to alleviate the hypoxic microenvironment of biofilms by releasing oxygen upon heating by AIE@PCM NPs with enhanced PTT. The nanosystem exhibits outstanding therapeutic efficacy against bacterial biofilms both in vitro and in vivo, with an antibacterial efficiency of 99.99%. This study utilizes a self‐regulated theranostic nanoplatform with adaptive PTT/PDT transformation via the phase transition of PCMs and heat‐triggered oxygen release, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial biofilm infections.</jats:p>",

To prevent damage caused by pipe explosions and dents, measures must be taken to reduce both overpressure and negative pressure during water hammer incidents. This study simulated hydraulic transients using the characteristic curve method and also considered the possible water column separation effect. Parameter optimization and joint scheme selection were conducted for protective measures on the compound air valve group, one-way surge tank, and two-way surge tank. The research identified that the combined protective effect of the slow-closed check valve, compound air valve group, and one-way surge tank is optimal, with low cost and simple operation management. This can be considered the optimal scheme for water hammer protection in the high-head and multi-undulation water conveyance system. The study of the main control points of the pipeline revealed a slight correlation between the maximum relative head differences among nodes. Two empirical formulas, verified under 12 operating conditions, can connect the 9 main nodes with an average relative error mostly ranging from 1 to 5%. The reference significance of the empirical formula for this type of engineering can be verified.</jats:p>",

Ghana Gas Limited uses an intricate Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system which is made up of several parts such as electromechanical components, PCB boards, and electrolytic capacitors. The majority of components have technical lifespans that are governed by usage, operational environment, and working conditions, such as electrical stress, working hours, and working cycles. Most of the time, these errors affect the integrity and power supply after manufacture. The issue is that it takes longer for the professionals who operate on this machine to recognize these flaws, which makes it difficult for them to predict errors quickly or anticipate the likelihood of faults happening in the system components at an early stage for effective corrective action to be performed. Support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees were used in this study to anticipate faults for technical data scheduling of uninterruptible power supply systems for Ghana Gas Limited in an efficient manner. Based on a comparative analysis using these two techniques, faults in Ghana Gas Limited's power supply system were predicted using a four-hour daily interval dataset on UPS recordings, including input voltage, battery voltage, battery current, and alarm, spanning from August 2017 to October 2023. The findings depicted that the support vector machine was more efficient in detecting the fault locations in the power supply system with an accuracy of 96.80%, recall of 99.80%, precision of 100 %, F1-score of 93.15%. The results from the error metrics also validate the measures in assessing the predictive ability of the model with MAE of 0.42%, MSE of 1.18%, RMSE of 4.45%, R2 of 99.97%, RMSLE of 0.036%, and MAPE of 0.21%.</jats:p>"

This paper describes a self-updating smart contract, which includes data validation, for tracing global supply chains using blockchains. Our proposal uses a machine learning model to detect anomalies on traceable data, which helps supply chain operators detect anomalous behavior at any point in the chain in real time. Hyperledger Caliper has been used to evaluate our proposal, and obtained a combined average throughput of 184 transactions per second and an average latency of 0.41 seconds, ensuring that our proposal does not negatively impact supply chain processes while improving supply chain management through data anomaly detection.</jats:p>"

This study adopts a predictor model based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to optimize the draft tube shape for micro-Francis turbines. The predictor model is formed on a dataset provided by numerical simulations, which are validated by lab tests. Specifically, numerical investigations are carried out in the shape of a draft tube to determine an optimal model. Additionally, the superiority of the RBFNN model in nonlinear optimization is verified by comparing it with other models under the same date sets. After that, the design parameters are optimized using RBFNN and sequential quadratic programming algorithm (SQPA). Finally, the turbine prototype is fabricated and tested on a lab test rig. The experimental results indicate that the numerical method adopted in this research is accurate enough for such a micro-Francis turbine performance prediction. Under the design conditions, the proposed micro-Francis turbine produces a power of 147 W with an efficiency of over 29%, which shows a considerable improvement compared to the initial prototype.</jats:p>"

Fatty acid oxidation is a metabolic pathway utilized by tumor cells that is crucial for malignant progression; however, its association with APC/C remains to be explored.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Cell cycle synchronization, immunoblotting, and propidium iodide staining were performed to investigate the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 C (CPT1C) expression manner. Proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to detect interactions between CPT1C and APC/C. Flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assays, cell-scratch assays, and transwell assays and xenograft transplantation assays were performed to investigate the role of CPT1C in tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor tissue microarray to evaluate the expression levels of CPT1C and explore its potential clinical value.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We identified CPT1C as a novel APC/C substrate. CPT1C protein levels exhibited cell cycle-dependent fluctuations, peaking at the G1/S boundary. Elevated CPT1C accelerated the G1/S transition, facilitating tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CPT1C enhanced fatty acid utilization, upregulated ATP levels, and decreased reactive oxygen species levels, thereby favoring cell survival in a harsh metabolic environment. Clinically, high CPT1C expression correlated with poor survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Overall, our results revealed a novel interplay between fatty acid utilization and cell cycle machinery in tumor cells. Additionally, CPT1C promoted tumor cell proliferation and survival by augmenting cellular ATP levels and preserving redox homeostasis, particularly under metabolic stress. Therefore, CPT1C could be an independent prognostic indicator in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

A simplified method is proposed for estimating the minimally justified price of selling electricity from thermal power plants (TPPs), renewable energy sources (RES) and new maneuverable natural gas capacities is proposed. It is shown that the price of electricity from RES and new maneuverable capacity has a decisive influence on the amount and fixed period of return on investment in construction, as well as on the capacity utilization factor (CUF), which depends on the mode of operation of the power plants. Comparative estimates of the CUF of different electricity generation sources are presented. It has been shown that the cost of electricity from RES, new peak and maneuverable capacity is significantly higher than the cost of electricity from thermal power plants during the payback period. It is proved that at present the reserve for the reduction of the power shortage and the load regulation is available only in the thermal generation, and the conditions for the possibility of its effective use are the maintenance of the proper technical condition of the pulverized coal boiler units and the sufficient fuel base. To ensure acceptable electricity prices, RES and new control capacity should be phased in, using existing TPPs and CHPs to balance both the weighted average price and the regulation of power system load modes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this research is to solve the complex long-distance and high-lift water supply engineering accident water hammer protection problem. Taking the Zhaojinzhuang water supply project as an example, based on the method of characteristics (MOC), the water hammer of the pumping station under the combined action of a water hammer relief valve, hydraulic-control butterfly valve, air vessel, air valve, and other water hammer protection measures is numerically simulated and calculated, and the effectiveness of the range method is analyzed, to ensure a waterproof hammer in pump stop accidents. The results show that the main factors affecting the effect of water hammer protection under the two-stage valve-closing parameters of the hydraulic-control butterfly valve are the fast-closing angle and the slow-closing time. The arrangement of the air vessel behind the pump can effectively increase the minimum water hammer pressure in the climbing section, and with the increase of the volume of the air vessel, the pump reverse speed and the maximum positive pressure increase slightly, but the overall water hammer protection effect is better. With the increase of the moment of inertia of the motor, the maximum positive pressure and minimum negative pressure of the pipeline still do not meet the requirements of the specification, and the modification cost is relatively large. The combination of the one-stage hydraulic-control butterfly valve, the air valve, the air vessel, and the water hammer relief valve can effectively reduce the volume of the air vessel. Under the optimal method, the maximum positive pressure head is 236.61 m, and the minimum negative pressure head is −3.18 m. Compared with the original method, the maximum positive pressure head is increased by 1.18%, the minimum negative pressure head is reduced by 95.78%, the maximum reverse speed of the pump is reduced by 100%, and the maximum reverse flow of the pump is reduced by 70.27%, meeting the requirements of water hammer protection. This is a safe and economical protection method.</jats:p>"

Against this background, the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (ESCD) has created a task force (TF) (i) to explore the current availability of PT substances in different member states, (ii) to highlight some of the unique characteristics of Type IV vs. other allergens and (iii) to suggest ways forward to promote and ensure availability of high‐quality patch testing substances for the diagnosis of Type IV allergies throughout Europe. The suggestions of the TF on how to improve the availability of PT allergens are supported by the ESCD, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology and intend to provide potential means to resolve the present medical crisis.</jats:p>",
