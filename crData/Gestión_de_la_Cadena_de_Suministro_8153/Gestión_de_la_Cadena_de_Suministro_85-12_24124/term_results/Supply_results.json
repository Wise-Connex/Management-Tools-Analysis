All differences indicated that puffins avoided gulls. Sites differing in gull numbers did not differ, however, in puffin fledging success or weights of fledged chicks. Chick weights and fledging success were low. The pattern of weight gain by chicks was irregular over the season, although consistent among sites for individual periods. These results imply that food usually was hard to find, although occasionally locally abundant. Pressures on puffin reproductive efforts due to variation in food supply and levels of kleptoparasitism do not appear to be additive; rather, low food availability decreases the effect of gull kleptoparasitism as well. </jats:p>",

Intact sporophytes of both species, and discs cut from<jats:italic>L. digitata</jats:italic>lamina tissue were maintained for several weeks in laboratory cultures under various nitrate, phosphate, temperature and daylength regimes. Substrate‐saturated uptake rates of approximately 24 μgN g dry weight<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>h<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>from 20 μM nitrate and 8 μgP g dry weight<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>h<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>from 10 μM phosphate were more than sufficient to account for internal nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation. Other nitrogen sources ‐ nitrite, ammonium and urea ‐ were also taken up, independently of each other, and supported growth.</jats:p><jats:p>During the late spring decline of ambient nutrient levels, when growth rates on the shore also decline markedly, enrichment with nitrate (15 μM) and phosphate (3μ) together prevented this decline and also maintained peak photosynthetic rates (net photosynthesis = 10.4 μlO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup>h<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>) which otherwise dropped to 4.5 μO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>cm<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup>h<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>over 47 days at ambient nutrient levels (0.5 μM nitrate and phosphate). Slow summer growth rates in June/July were enhanced to greater than spring peak values by combined nitrate (7.5 μM) and phosphate (1.8 μM) enrichment; neither was sufficient alone, although the individual nutrients were accumulated internally. A lesser, but significant enhancement was also achieved in September.</jats:p><jats:p>In midwinter, nutrient enhancement itself (10.5 μM nitrate and 3.0 μM phosphate) had a small effect on growth rates only if summer water temperature (15°C) was used, but the dramatic effect of an increased photoperiod (7.5 to 17.5 h) was in excess of that expected for the increased radiant energy available. This was found to be due, at least in<jats:italic>L. digitaia</jats:italic>discs, to the re‐establishment of a surface meristoderm in the dormant winter tissue; this was particularly active with high phosphate supply. Growth of the new lamina in January on the shore was much reduced if the old lamina was removed, although the time of initiation of new growth remained unchanged. In the laboratory, the old lamina was found to be a source of nitrogen for new lamina but not of fixed carbon or phosphorus. New lamina photosynthesis, manifest as mannitol accumulation, was directly proportional to phosphate supply up to at least 7.5 μM phosphate. Mannitol accumulation was then suppressed by a nitrate supply above 12 um, presumably by diversion of fixed carbon to other biosynthetic pathways.</jats:p>",

NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>was reduced in the leaf at a higher rate in the light than in the dark. The reduction was inhibited at the high concentrations calculated to exist in the mesophyll vacuoles, but reduction continued at a low rate, even when there was no supply from the incubation medium. Sixty‐four per cent of the NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>influx was turned into organic nitrogen, with the remaining NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>accumulating in both the light and the dark.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bird heads contain paired countercurrent heat exchangers, the ophthalmic retia, which function in brain temperature regulation. Blood, cooled by evaporation from the nasal and buccal mucosa and the ocular surfaces, flows to the venous side of each rete and there gains heat from arterial blood flowing countercurrent to it. The cooled arterial blood then flows to the brain. To ascertain whether characteristics of the blood reaching the cooling surfaces and the retia favor O2 and CO2 exchange, as well as heat exchange, we studied blood O2 affinity in relation to temperature (T) and CO2 tension (PCO2) in six pigeons (Columba livia). O2 tension (PO2) at half-saturation (P50, Torr) was measured at various combinations of T and PCO2 from 36 to 44 degrees C and 9 to 33 Torr. pH was uncontrolled. O2 half-saturation of hemoglobin (P50) varied according to P50 = 1.049T + 0.573PCO2–19.444. We propose that shifts in blood O2 affinity, associated with T and PCO2 at the mucosa and eyes and in the retia, would enhance the brain O2 supply by an exchange of O2 and CO2 between air and blood at moist cephalic surfaces, thereby augmenting O2 and reducing CO2 in the venous return to the retia and diffusion of O2 from veins to arteries in the retia. This mechanism might have particular importance at high altitude; we calculate that at 7,000 m above sea level both O2 saturation and PO2 could double in blood flowing from the retia to the brain. </jats:p>",
