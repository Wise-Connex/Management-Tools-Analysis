      "abstract": "<jats:p> A supply chain is a network of facilities that performs the functions of procurement of material, transformation of material to intermediate and finished products, and distribution of finished products to customers. Often, organizational barriers between these facilities exist, and information flows can be restricted such that complete centralized control of material flows in a supply chain may not be feasible or desirable. Consequently, most companies use decentralized control in managing the different facilities at a supply chain. In this paper, we describe what manufacturing managers at Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) see as the needs for model support in managing material flows in their supply chains. These needs motivate our initial development of such a model for supply chains that are not under complete centralized control. We report on our experiences of applying such a model in a new product development project of the DeskJet printer supply chain at HP. Finally, we discuss avenues to develop better models, as well as to fully exploit the power of such models in application. </jats:p>",

An oxygen supply method using this film was investigated for the purpose of reducing energy consumption for wastewater treatment. The oxygen transfer rate was measured for the cases with or without biofilm, which proved the high rate of oxygen transfer in the case with nitrifying biofilm which performed nitrification. When the Gas-permeable film with nitrifying biofilm was applied to the treatment of wastewater, denitrifying biofilm formed on the nitrifying biofilm, and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurred, resulting in the high rate of organic matter and T-N removal (7 gTOC/m2/d and 4 gT-N/m2/d, respectively). However, periodic sloughing of the denitrifying biofilm was needed to keep the oxygen transfer rate high. Energy consumption of the process using the film in the form of tubes was estimated to be less than 40% of that of the activated sludge process.</jats:p>",

Using contingent valuation techniques, we have measured the benefits and costs of different reliability levels in terms of water users' willingness to pay (WTP) for increases in reliability and in terms of their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation in the form of lower water bills for lower levels of reliability. Three cities in northern Colorado with diverse baseline levels of water supply reliability (Aurora, Boulder, and Longmont) are the study sites. Contrary to our hypothesis that water managers are unjustifiably risk averse, we find that water managers' preferences are consistent with customer WTP (WTA) values associated with the risk of water shortages and the system costs associated with reliability. Water managers in Boulder (high reliability) were willing to consider reductions in the level of system reliability while water managers in Aurora and Longmont (low reliability) favored the status quo or increased reliability. While these attitudes were sometimes contrary to a majority of customers' expressed interests in change, they were shown to be justified by comparison of supply system costs (savings) with aggregate WTP for additional reliability (WTA for less reliability).</jats:p>",

Therefore, administration of methionine sulphoximine was used to create a model of decreased arterial glutamine concentrations for 4 days. Glutamine consumption in portal-drained viscera and liver was measured after an overnight fast by determining fluxes and intracellular concentrations in normal rats, methionine sulphoximine-treated rats and pair-fed controls. Moreover, fluxes and intracellular concentrations of several other amino acids and ammonia and production of urea by the liver were determined concomitantly.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2. Methionine sulphoximine treatment for 4 days resulted in a 50% decrease in arterial glutamine concentration.

In the liver, glutamine consumption was reduced and ammonia uptake was increased, but urea synthesis was not changed.

Most specimens were injected with high grade India ink, cleared using a standard Spalteholz technique, and processed to delineate the extraosseous and intraosseous blood supply to include soft tissue dissection and coronal sectioning. Two additional specimens were injected with blue Mercox acrylic solution to further define the extraosseous vasculature. </jats:p><jats:p> The major extraosseous blood supply to the sesamoids is via the posterior tibial artery. This vessel then branches into the medial plantar artery which further divides upon entering the medial and lateral sesamoids in their proximal poles. Vessels in the peripheral soft tissues, although abundant, do not seem to penetrate the cortex of the sesamoids. </jats:p><jats:p> The intraosseous blood supply to the sesamoids seems to be threefold. Mainly, sesamoid arteries enter the lateral and medial sesamoids from the proximal aspect via a single vessel. This proximal vessel proceeds distally with a network of branching. Plantar, nonarticular vessels enter the sesamoids, constituting a second source of vascularity. Finally, small vessels also enter the sesamoids through medial and lateral capsular attachments. </jats:p><jats:p> Based on this study, a possible explanation for avascular necrosis and nonunion of sesamoids is proposed, and an optimal surgical approach is discussed. A medial operative approach avoiding the proximal pole of the sesamoids will preserve the main arterial source. The plantar surface of the sesamoids should also be avoided. Minimal dissection through the circumferential soft tissue vascular sleeve is recommended. </jats:p>",

Maximum dry matter yield was obtained at a soil exchangeable K concentration (K<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub>) of 114 mg/kg dry soil (45 μм-K in the soil solution). Grass well-supplied with K maintained an average concentration of<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>200 m м-K in the tissue water of whole shoots in spring, although individual measurements varied in the range 140–320 mм, depending largely on the soil water availability. These tissue concentrations were not exceeded in soils with K<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub>values up to 800 mg/kg. Yield was reduced by 60% on plots low in K (K<jats:sub>ex</jats:sub>in the range 60–90 mg/kg). The yield reductions were probably due to low turgor because tissue osmotic pressures were low and potassium concentrations in tissue water (which averaged 64 mм) were probably too high to disrupt the biochemical functions of K. The results suggest that there is no universal critical tissue water concentration for K in the biophysical role of turgor maintenance, as other cations and solutes are able to substitute for it. The ultimate determinant of turgor-dependent yield loss is tissue osmotic pressure. The critical tissue osmotic pressure in grass shoots in a typical season at Rothamsted was<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>400 mosm/kg. No universal critical osmotic pressure can be expected however, as this will depend on the availability of water and therefore on growing conditions.</jats:p>",

Driven now by the need to improve and maintain customer service levels, the management of water distribution is beginning to rely more on network analysis techniques. The combination of large, detailed models and easy‐to‐use software is moving network analysis into new areas of benefits in Severn Trent Water using the Stoner workstation service. By providing a simple, geographic interface with the user, the use of network simulation facilities has been increased tenfold in the company. In addition to the hydraulic benefits, Severn Trent Water has followed a lead from the US with water quality modelling, including nitrate blending, source water mixing and chlorine residual analysis.</jats:p>",

Oat cultivars, representing a wider germplasm collection, exhibited a stronger and partially different shoot and root response to applied N‐levels than barley cultivars. Cultivar‐fertilization interaction effects were significant for seminal and adventitious root variation. Genotypic specificity (plasticity) in root response, as revealed in some oat and barley cultivars with a deeper penetration and more vigorous root growth under the low N‐supply, was recognized to be a valuable adaptive characteristic for breeding plants on light‐textured soils.</jats:p>",

The discussion pertaining to the convergence of the numerical scheme and the computational error, shows that the strict convergence criteria applied to both velocities and pressure were successfully statisfied. The numerical model is applied in a parametric mode to the study of the velocities, the pressure patterns, and shear forces that characterize the flow in a square (α = 1), deep (α&gt;1), and shallow (α≪1) hydrostatic pocket. The effects of the variation of the location and angle of the hydrostatic jet are also investigated.</jats:p>",
