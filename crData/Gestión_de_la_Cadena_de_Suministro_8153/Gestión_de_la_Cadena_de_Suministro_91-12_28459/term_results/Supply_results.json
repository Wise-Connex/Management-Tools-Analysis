      "abstract": "<jats:p> A comment by Miller was published in the August 1989 issue of Environment and Planning A, which makes an intriguing comparison of a paper by Chen and Rose with one by myself. His comment concerns the uses of various terminologies in the literature on supply-driven and demand-driven input—output models and the claims to have defined terms such as ‘stability’, ‘joint stability’, and ‘consistency’. Further, generalizations are made on the basis of a specific set of aggregated data for the US economy to show that biproportional changes suggested in my theorem are unlikely to be observed in the real world. I will show that Miller adds no illumination to the issues of ‘stability’ or ‘consistency’, and that, in fact, his comment accomplishes nothing of import. His comment could also leave us with the impression that the USA is the only ‘real-world’ example worthy of comment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Neoclassical economists consider education to be one of the\n      key determinants of women entering the labour market. The higher the\n      level of education, the greater is women's participation in the labour\n      market. [Becker (1980); Mincer (1980)]. However, the structuralist\n      school does not look at it so simply. In their view there are many other\n      factors besides education which compel women to· sell their labour\n      power. [Benham (1980); Strober (1980)]. The principal factor compelling\n      women to sell their labour is income. Therefore, according to the\n      structuralist school the lower is women's household income, the greater\n      is their compulsion to enter the labour market. How does this square\n      with neoclassical theory? The structuralist school states that household\n      income is the primary determinant of women's sale of labour power.\n      Therefore, in a society divided by income groups lower income class\n      women will tend to sell their labour power more. However, within each\n      income group an increase in education will increase the supply of\n      women's labour and its returns. Due to inadequate data, relatively\n      little analytical work on this issue has been undertaken so the present\n      study is an attempt to explore why some married women are engaged in\n      earning activities, while some of them are not. Our sample consists of\n      ever-married women, because normally they are considered independent,\n      and their status is equal to their male partners. So they have\n      relatively more choice in entering the labour market compared to\n      unmarried women. A comparison of this kind will help us to identify the\n      factors besides education in determining women's supply of labour in the\n      market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fiscal deficit has assumed alarming proportions in\n      Pakistan; it was as large as 8.5 percent of the GDP in 1987-88. Though\n      it has fallen somewhat in recent years, yet it still is around 6.7\n      percent of GDP. While the fiscal deficit was expected to result in a\n      high rate of inflation and slow growth of output, Pakistan has sustained\n      a high growth rate of output with price stability. This makes Pakistan a\n      fascinating case study.l The impact of the fiscal deficit on monetary\n      expansion, growth of output and price stability in various countries has\n      been extensively analysed. For example, see Cline (1987); Collins and\n      Park (1989), Corbo (1985,1989); Corbo and de Melo (1989); Corbo and Nam\n      (1988); Dornbusch and de Pablo (1989); Easterly (1989); Edwards (1989);\n      Enders and Mattione (1984); Gil Diaz (1988); Haque (1987); Kim and Yun\n      (1988); Kormendi (1983); Modigliani and Sterling (1986); Nash (1988);\n      Ocampo (1987); Reisen and van Trotsenburg (1988); van Wijnbergen (1987)\n      and Yellen (1989). However, very little work is available on Pakistan.\n      The present study is an attempt to fill that important gap. By analysing\n      trends in the budgetary deficit and in the pattern of financing the\n      deficit, the present study explores their implications for the interest\n      rate structure, monetary expansion, and growth of the banking sector in\n      Pakistan. The paper is divided into four sections. Section I traces the\n      trends in the fiscal deficit over time. Patterns of financing the\n      deficit and implications for monetary expansion are analysed in Section\n      II. Section III examines the implications of changes in the rate\n      structure of interest for the growth of money supply and the banking\n      sector. Section IV presents the main conclusions of the\n      study.</jats:p>"

These models treat forests as aspatial entities and are unable to include economic and wildlife considerations in management design and calculation of wood supply. This paper presents and discusses the design and construction of a GIS-based (geographic information system) spatial wood supply model. The model uses geographic distribution of stand development types and stages and their change over time to control harvesting and calculate wood supply based on extraction economics ($/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) and wildlife habitat values (opening size and green-up). The paper points out that: a spatial model is capable of producing harvest schedules and forest performance indicators that reflect geographic context as well as condition of stands; a GIS database is more important in spatial modelling than GIS technology; harvest blocks are the basic geographic element in spatial modelling; a spatial model provides a truer assessment of wood supply; and stand topology makes it relatively easy to integrate wildlife and timber management.

It is assumed that demand for finished goods and the arrival process for raw material are stochastic. We calculate simultaneously the optimal production level, and the raw material order quantity which minimize the total expected cost subject to capacity and release level constraints. The results obtained by our model (the integrated model) show that the production level should be no larger than the production level obtained by solving the traditional (nonintegrated) models, and that major savings are obtained by solving the integrated model. We are also able to characterize and evaluate the cost of reliable supplies of raw material. In addition we solve the above problem in the presence of capacity constraints. A procedure which allocates capacity to different products is presented. </jats:p>",

Minica, Wierboon, Kristall, Felix, Optica and Alfred grown in the field in the Netherlands were irrigated to near field capacity, or water stressed, between the onset of flowering and the end of the growing season. Leaf water potential ( psi ), osmotic potential ( pi ) and turgor (P) were linearly related to leaf relative water content (RWC) with no significant differences between cultivars. At full turgor, pi hardly differed between water supply treatments, and the slopes of pi vs. RWC were not significantly different between treatments, indicating the absence of osmotic adjustment. Water supply did not affect the slope of P vs. RWC, and it was concluded that the faba bean cultivars lacked mechanisms to keep P high during water stress. Internode growth during flowering was 2-3 times greater in the well watered than in the stressed treatment. In greenhouse studies with cv. Minica, vegetative growth decreased linearly with decreasing P. Maximum stomatal conductance in the field decreased with psi from an estimated maximum level of 1.0 s/cm (at full turgidity and light intensity &gt;800 micro E/msuperscript 2 per s), following a negative exponential curve. It was concluded that vegetative (expansive) growth decreases faster with decreasing P or psi than the stomatal conductance (and most probably faster than the rate of photosynthesis). It is suggested that this result may help to explain the positive effect of mild water stress on reproductive growth in faba beans.

Nondiabetic and untreated diabetic control groups were used. Diabetes duration was 2 mo. There were two treated diabetic groups. A “prevention” group received 5 mg/kg prazosin for 2 mo from the induction of diabetes. A “reversal” group was untreated for the 1st mo and was given prazosin for the subsequent month. Conduction was measured in motor nerves supplying tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles and sensory saphenous nerve. Diabetes resulted in 15–29% reductions in conduction velocity (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In the prevention group, conduction deficits were minimal compared with untreated diabetes (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In the reversal group, motor conduction was also substantially improved, although sensory conduction was not significantly affected. In vitro measurement of sciatic nerve hypoxic resistance revealed a 49% increase in the time taken for compound action potential amplitude to reach half its initial value with diabetes (P &amp;lt; 0.01). This was largely prevented by prazosin treatment (P &amp;lt; 0.01), although treatment had a lesser effect in the reversal group. Treatment had no effect on nerve polyol levels or Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Functional improvements with prazosin were probably based on increased vasa nervorum perfusion. There was a 20% elevation of endoneurial capillary density (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in both prevention and reversal groups. We conclude that vascular factors play an important role in the etiology of experimental diabetic neuropathy, and functional changes may be corrected by chronic vasodilator treatment.</jats:p>",
