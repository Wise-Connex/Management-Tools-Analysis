      "abstract": "<jats:p>Authors' Note - This paper was prepared for the 1974 SPE-AIME Eastern Regional Meeting last fall. While events have overtaken some specific items included in the paper, we believe that our basic arguments remain valid. Consequently, our conclusions remain unaltered. For example, a tariff on crude oil and a tax on natural gas, along with decontrol of old oil and new gas prices, have been proposed by the Administration. Since these proposals deal primarily with the level of energy prices and the prices of individual fuels relative to each other, the framework that we have set forth lends itself to an analysis of the effects of those proposals. We specifically mention in the text that the outcome is not proposals. We specifically mention in the text that the outcome is not intended to be a forecast. Rather, it is intended to illustrate a method of assessment. We have not attempted, therefore, to include additional events, recent or prospective; we feel that an assessment of the effects of specific proposals is beyond the scope of our paper.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Most studies of U.S. energy markets are very narrow in scope. Traditionally, they focus on the demand for a fuel in a particular consuming sector or set of consuming sectors, on the supply of a particular fuel, or on the demand and supply for a particular fuel. Moreover, in studies that do treat supply and demand of energy in a comprehensive manner, the supply of particular fuels and the total demand for fuels typically are regarded as being more or less independent of price. Finally, developments in energy markets tend to be regarded either as being independent of general economic conditions or as being related to economic conditions in some simple mechanistic way.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper analyzes the U.S. energy and economic situation through 1985 with emphasis on the necessary interrelationships. The relationships considered are those between prices and quantity demanded for various fuels in each fuel-consuming sector, the quantity of various fuels supplied from domestic sources, oil imports, and economic conditions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An ideal approach to the problem would be to build a model incorporating these interrelationships and use it to simulate the effects of alternative fiscal and monetary policies, energy policies, and other world factors on the policies, energy policies, and other world factors on the energy and economic variables of interest. Attempts to do this are being made, but it clear how successful they will be.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A viable alternative is to use several more specialized models in a systematic fashion, taking care to insure consistency between variables in the various models. This approach has been used in this study. Use of the Data Resources, Inc., (DRI) Energy Policy Model allowed treatment of the relationships between economic activity, energy prices, and the quantity of energy demanded. Exogenous estimates of domestic oil and gas production were used to estimate the U.S. demand for oil imports. Some consequences of developments in energy markets for general economic conditions are also discussed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Projections Projections While the quantitative estimates reported in this paper must be regarded as indicative and should not be regarded as forecasts, the analysis has yielded several important insights. First, a continuation of the current energy prices, which are much higher than prices have been prices, which are much higher than prices have been historically, would be expected to result in significantly lower growth rates of the quantity of energy demanded during the next several years. A sharp decline from previous experience in the growth rate of the quantity of previous experience in the growth rate of the quantity of electricity demanded contributes importantly to this result in the simulations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 803</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Among these policies are welfare programs, income maintenance plans, and unemployment insurance. To date, questions of agricultural labor response to economic incentives have been analyzed by resorting to aggregate data and models, typically utilizing state or U.S. time series data. While this does provide needed information for analysis of some policies, aggregate data and models are deficient in isolating substitution and income effects. These are necessary for analysis of particular programs affecting only income or affecting the individual's budget constraint in a discontinuous way. In particular, aggregate models cannot approach the question of a backward bending supply curve, since aggregate data include not only variations in duration of employment but also variations in labor force participation.</jats:p>",

Two patients died suddenly six weeks after treadmill testing and prior to arteriography. The remaining fifteen were studied with coronary arteriography and all except one exhibited greater than or equal to 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The remaining patient demonstrated two 75% LAD stenoses in series. Five exhibited significant (greater than or equal 75%) narrowing of the main left coronary artery (MLCA) and thirteen of fifteen had significant stenosis of proximal LAD and circumflex arteries. The two patients without significant circumflex disease exhibited greater than or equal to 90% stenosis of the dominant right coronaryartery (RCA) circulation. Six of six patients had restoration of a normal blood pressure response following coronary bypass surgery, which also relieved angina and reversed ST-segment depression. Conditions essential for proper interpretation of this sign are discussed. If these conditions are met, then a fall in systolic pressure during treadmill-induced angina pectoris is a reliable sign of severe compromise of left ventricular blood supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two possible futures for the industrial world may be distinguished: (i) Large amounts of low-cost energy become available and the more energy-intensive methods for extracting resources from lower-grade deposits continue to sustain industrial expansion until either the environmental impact becomes unacceptable or ultimate limits, such as climate disruptions, put an end to such growth. (ii) The cost of nonrenewable energy resources continue to rise, but a fixed amount of energy from continuous sources may be utilized at constant cost. In this case a lower production level may be set by the amount of energy that is available from renewable sources, and society may thus have to be reshaped with energy economization in focus. If it is possible to choose between these two alternatives, the choice should be based on a discussion of the pros and cons of each one, and in particular on the desirability of having to process an increasing fraction of the earth's crust in search of raw materials in order to maintain growth as long as possible. However, the availability, of the first option is far from certain and it thus seems reasonable to plan for the second alternative.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>I have tried to propose such a plan for a small, homogeneous geographical region, namely Denmark. The ceiling on the consumption of energy from continuous sources is chosen in accordance with the criterion of not having to convert a major part of the land area to energy-collecting systems. The proposed annual average energy consumption of 19 gigawatts by the year 2050 corresponds to solar energy collecting panels (in use only 50 percent of the time) with an area of roughly 180 square kilometers and a windmill swept area of about 150 square kilometers. These (vertical) areas constitute less than 1 percent of the total land area.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The selection of solar or wind energy for different applications has been based on known technology and may be subject to adjustments. The project has been shown to be economically feasible according to estimates of the cost of various alternatives during the 25-year depreciation period adopted. However, the initial cost per energy unit produced is higher than that for most of the alternatives, so that action is not expected to be taken immediately as a result of purely private initiative. In a public economic evaluation, other factors must be considered in addition to the cost of energy per kilowatt-hour. At present, Denmark has over 10 percent of its labor force out of employment and a substantial deficit on its balance of payments, so that an early start on the solar and wind energy project, based on national industry, would have additional payoffs compared with energy systems based on imported technology or imported fuels. Several factories that are now being closed down as a result of the economic crisis could be adapted to the production of parts for solar or wind power systems, and the building industry, badly hit by unemployment, would receive legitimate work.</jats:p>",
