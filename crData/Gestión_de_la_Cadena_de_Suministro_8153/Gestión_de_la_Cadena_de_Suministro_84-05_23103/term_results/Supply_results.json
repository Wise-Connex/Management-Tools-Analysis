Concentrations of 29 VOCs in addition to five trihalomethanes and total organic carbon from 945 water supplies were measured. The five most frequently found compounds other than trihalomethanes were trichloroethylene, 1,1,1‐trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, cis‐ and/or trans‐1,2‐dichloroethylene, and 1,1‐dichloroethane. Approximately half of the samples were taken from a random list of water systems, which were subdivided into two sets of systems—those serving fewer than 10 000 persons and those serving more than 10 000 persons. The nonrandom samples were taken from systems selected by the states, using groundwater sources that were likely to show VOCs in drinking water. Large systems in the random sample had a significantly higher frequency of occurrence of VOC contamination than small systems and were also more likely to have higher levels of contamination.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two trials with 16 gilts of 35 kg and 16 gilts of 64 kg were made. Rations were prepared by mixing two basal feeds in different ratios. Four different energy levels were used in which energy was expressed as multiples of maintenance (M) requirement (treatments: 1 = 2.8 to 3.0 M; 2 = 2.4 to 2.6 M; 3 = 2.1 to 2.2 M; 4 = 1.8 to 1.9 M). Digestibility of energy was not influenced by treatment (mean 83.5%). Feed components (except protein) were better digested in pigs at a larger weight (e.g., energy 3.2 and crude fibre 5.7 percentage units). Rations of weight class 2 were based on a different ratio of the basal feeds than the rations of weight class 1. Metabolizable energy content of the ration was similar for the four diets (mean 12.4 kJ/g). After correcting for differences in feed composition the metabolizability tended to be slightly depressed at the high levels of energy intake. Protein gain was determined for each gilt. Protein and fat gains were calculated from the rate of gain and daily energy intake at the same amount of digestible protein intake. Protein gain was reduced at a level of energy intake below 2.5 M. Fat gain was influenced more by feeding level than protein gain. Fat gain was diminished when energy intake was reduced. (Abstract retrieved from CAB Abstracts by CABI’s permission)</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Absolute ethanol was used for renal ablation in 20 patients with carcinoma of the kidney. The procedure was followed by nephrectomy in 6 patients without metastases, all of whom are alive without evidence of recurrence 4 to 20 months after treatment. Fourteen patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease were embolized to palliate pain or hematuria without subsequent nephrectomy. Of these only 2 are alive, 4 and 18 months following the procedure. The technique for ethanol embolization is described and the use of occluding balloon catheters is recommended. No complications were encountered and the ‘postembolization syndrome’ was less marked as compared with a previous material of equal size where other methods of renal artery occlusion were employed. Microscopic examination in 10 of the infarcted kidneys showed extensive tumor necroses, sometimes with no evidence of viable tumor cells at all. Natural killer cell activity was determined before and 48 hours after renal artery occlusion in 7 patients, showing somewhat increased activity in 4. It is concluded that absolute ethanol is a safe, effective and easily administered agent for the infarction of renal tumors. </jats:p>",
