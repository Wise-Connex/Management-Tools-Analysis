There were probably springs at the Leto sanctuary on the west slope of the acropolis and more certainly at the sanctuary of the Nymphs on the east slope, although these do not now function, in summer at least, and perhaps never produced a great deal of water. A third sanctuary, much further down the east slope, also has a small spring, and was apparently devoted to Apollo. However, the only spring which nowadays produces water enough to contribute significantly to the supply of a substantial community lies some 500 m. west of the west gate and over 130 m. lower down, where it would be exposed to any attacking force.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Projection of timber supply is an important component of most timber management planning systems. One of the factors limiting the improvement of such systems is the difficulty involved in clearly understanding the context of timber supply projection within management of the forest as a whole. A simple decision structure is employed in this paper to illustrate this context. Management of the timber resource is described as a subproblem of managing the forest. A timber management plan is shown to be comprised of the answers to two intricately linked questions: (1) how much to harvest over time and (2) how to schedule a sequence of activities to support the desired rate of harvest. Each of these decision processes is described briefly and the role of timber supply modelling in providing answers is examined. Although the information presented in the paper is general, it represents an initial attempt at ordering perceptions of the timber management decision environment into a more understandable form. Key words: timber management planning, timber supply modelling. </jats:p>",

Yield and net N uptake by paper birch seedlings grown in standardized mixtures of quartz sand and forest floor organic matter, and separate incubation estimates of N mineralization and nitrification for the forest floors, were employed to evaluate potential N supply. Black spruce and floodplain white spruce forest floors supplied only one-fifth the amount of N taken up by seedlings growing in other forest floors. Incubation estimates showed these forest floors yielded 4 and 15 times less extractable N, respectively, than the more fertile birch forest floors. In comparison with earlier estimates of P supply from these same forest floors, the upland types showed greater deficiency of N whereas floodplain types showed greater deficiency of P in control of seedling yield. The latter condition is attributed to the highly calcareous nature of the floodplain mineral soil, the consequent potential for P fixation, and hence greater potential deficiency of the element compared with N in mineralizing forest floors. Nitrogen concentration of the forest floors was the best predictor of bioassay response. </jats:p>",

If penalty rates for such hours of work were reduced, any potential employment creation due to increased labour demand would depend in part on the labour supply response. We consider the rationale for penalty rates, changes in the labour force and in the length of working hours, and evidence on employee attitudes (including in-depth discussion groups that we have organized). It is concluded that changes since the introduction of penalty rates and the heterogeneity of employee preferences make the rigid structure of penalty rates inappropriate. Appropriate patterns of working time and associated compensation vary substantially among industries and occupations. </jats:p>",

Fifteen were suffering from generalized scleroderma with acrosclerosis (GS), and 16 from primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PR), and were compared to 13 healthy controls without cold sensitivity. Finger blood flow (FBF) was monitored by a laser Doppler flowmeter.</jats:p><jats:p>Resting blood flow values were significantly lower in patients compared to controls.</jats:p><jats:p>After two min of body cooling no difference could be observed in relative flow decrease between patients and controls or between PR and GS, but after 10 min of body cooling, relative flow decrease tended to be more pronounced in GS than in PR. Only in GS was the zero flow situation observed.</jats:p><jats:p>During the resting condition, skin vessel vasomotion was observed as rhythmical variations in the blood flow of 5–10 cycles per minute. These seemed to be preserved in patients and in chronically sympathectomized patients, and could not be abolished by nerve blockade of the finger. The influence from sympathetic vasomotor fibres on FBF could be observed during cooling as irregular coarse flow fluctuations. This was observed in both patients and controls but not in the chronically sympathectomized patients and disappeared after nerve blockade of the finger. Finger temperature was measured simultaneously during body cooling, but significant changes were observed only in normals and PR.</jats:p><jats:p>The conclusions were that (1) during body cooling, flow decrease in GS tends to be more pronounced than in PR, and only in GS could the zero flow situation be elicited; (2) influence on finger blood vessels from the sympathetic nervous system could be observed in both patients and control persons; (3) GS and PR patients seem to have preserved local vasomotion in cutaneous microvessels; (4) finger‐tip temperature in sclerotic skin is an imprecise blood flow indicator.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A study was conducted with six sheep equipped with rumen and duodenal re-entrant cannulae to investigate differences in duodenal amino acid supply with fresh and ensiled alfalfa. The experiment was conducted as a cross-over design with two 12-d periods consisting of an adaptation phase (5 d) followed by feces collection (5 d), and finally on day 12, 24 h continuous collection of duodenal digesta and sampling of rumen fluid. During the experiment the sheep were restricted on feed to 52 g DM d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>−0.75</jats:sup>. Analyses of the forages revealed extensive breakdown of threonine, lysine and other basic amino acids, and high degree of preservation of branched chain amino acids. Relative to the amount consumed, there was a net loss of amino acids at the duodenum with fresh alfalfa but a net gain with silage. The relationship between intake of individual essential amino acids and duodenal recovery was inconsistent. Duodenal recovery of total essential amino acids was 28% higher with fresh than with ensiled alfalfa, a difference which was most pronounced with threonine and lysine. Digestion of organic matter and fiber was unaffected (P &gt; 0.05) by ensiling of alfalfa. Estimates of ruminal pH were higher (P &lt; 0.05) for silage than fresh forage (6.9 vs. 6.7) but VFA concentrations were lower (P &lt; 0.05) for silage (52.1 vs. 64.1 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Rumen ammonia levels were similar for the two forages. The deficit in duodenal supply of essential amino acids with silage is discussed in relation to the problem of silage intake in ruminants. Key words: Alfalfa silage, duodenal amino acids, sheep, rumen digestion </jats:p>",
