The security of natural gas supply is paramount and rests with the suppliers and the consumers. This paper gives an overview of world natural gas supply and demand and examines the main supply problems. The most important non predictable variables in natural gas supply are the current world-wide gas price and the current political stability, particularly in regions with high reserves. Other important considerations are the cost of development / processing and transport of the natural gas to the market: this itself can be difficult to maintain confidence if pipelines pass through areas of political instability. Another problem is that many countries lack the infrastructure and the capital needs for the effective development of their natural gas industry. Unlike oil, the cost of transportation of natural gas is very high and at present surprisingly only about 16% of the total world production is traded internationally.</jats:p>",

Derives a model from the literature to link these aspects. Tests empirically major propositions from this model using data from 83 firms positioned at the top of the Turkish automotive industry supply chain. Establishes that companies with higher levels of AMT implementation collaborative more with their parts suppliers and companies are more successful in achieving their AMT implementation objectives if increased AMT implementation is coupled with more collaborate supplier relationships. Both AMT implementation levels and buyer‐supplier collaboration are shown to have significantly increased over a five‐year period. While AMT implementation levels of individual firms appear to have diverged, levels of buyer‐supplier collaboration appear to have converged during the five years.</jats:p>",

The manufacturing department is responsible for meeting random demand of a product with a short life cycle. The supply department's responsibility is to provide the sufficient amount of raw materials so that the required production level can be achieved. When coordination prevails, both departments' decisions are jointly made; otherwise, decisions are made independently without an exchange of information. If the random demand exceeds the amount produced, a second production run can be expedited at a substantially higher cost. Our analysis yields insightful results to such a coordination problem between the two departments. We provide conditions under which it is desirable to coordinate, resulting in a significant increase in expected profit. If coordination is optimal, then the supply department would purchase additional reserved material for the second run. Under this scenario, we analyze the effects of joint coordination on the expected profit. We also find explicit conditions for which joint coordination is not beneficial, i.e., the supply department should only order sufficient material to meet the first production run requirements. We provide a detailed set of numerical examples and generate response surfaces indicating the desirability of coordination for different pairs of parameter combinations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A Working Party of the UK group of European Primate Resources Network (EUPREN) considered primate supply for scientific work in the UK. Through a questionnaire, which achieved a very good response, it obtained details of primate use, sources and breeding in the UK and it put forward options to ensure that animal welfare is the best possible whilst ensuring continued supply. </jats:p><jats:p> The questionnaire showed that contract research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies use about 80% of the 4233 primates used annually at the moment, with the rest accounted for by academic establishments and public sector laboratories. Fifty-four per cent are cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis), of which nearly 90% are captive-bred outside the European Union (EU), the remainder being bred in the UK. Nearly 90% of cynomolgus macaques are used by only five institutions. Thirty-seven per cent of primates used are marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus jacchus), all of which are bred in the UK. Most of the rest are rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta), about half of which are captive-bred outside the EU, the other half being bred in the UK. Overall primate use has increased from about 3000 per year in 1990 and users predict that requirements for all species except baboons ( Papio sp.) will be maintained or increase. </jats:p><jats:p> Marmoset breeding in the UK is already closely matched to use, and it could be increased reasonably easily if necessary. Some of the existing breeding centres of macaques in the UK would be prepared to consider expanding to supply others, although investment and imported breeding stock would be needed and it is likely that a large investment would be needed to breed a significant fraction of the macaque use in the UK. A further problem is that the users of only about 10% of the cynomolgus macaques said that they could replace this species by rhesus macaques, which are easier to breed in the UK. </jats:p><jats:p> The questionnaire showed that much of the use of macaques would be transferred to other countries equally remote from the natural source countries of the animals, if constraints on primate use became more severe in the UK. Users felt that it is unlikely that much of the work could be transferred to the natural source countries themselves. </jats:p><jats:p> A review of the literature revealed a paucity of information on the effects of transport on primate welfare. The importance of obtaining this information before making decisions about alternative means of supply is stressed. Current schemes for the accreditation of primate breeders were reviewed. </jats:p><jats:p> A list of options is presented for discussion. Users vary so much in their requirements that it is unlikely that one means of supply will be applicable to all. Animal welfare will benefit and supply will be more certain if cooperation between those concerned (preferably through the UK group of EUPREN) is maintained. </jats:p>",

Findings suggest that wage rate, imports from competing regions, and urban pressure have had significant negative impacts on regional production. The negative relationship between price and production may have resulted from the strong negative effects exerted by the nonprice factors.</jats:p>",

Beauv. in Dutch nutrient‐poor chalk grasslands increases with enhanced nitrogen supply, whereas other grass species also require an enhanced phosphorus supply for a similar response (e.g. <jats:italic>Dactylis glomerata</jats:italic> L.), or are competitively suppressed at any increase in nutrient supply (e.g. <jats:italic>Briza media</jats:italic> L.). We investigated whether this interspecific variation in response to N and P supply is caused by differences in P productivity (PP), i.e. the instantaneous rate of biomass production per unit of P present in the plant. We hypothesized that PP is highest in <jats:italic>Brachypodium pinnatum</jats:italic>, in contrast to N productivity which is known to be the highest in <jats:italic>Dactylis glomerata.</jats:italic> Phosphorus productivity and its components were studied using a growth analysis with four exponential P addition rates of 0.03, 0.06, 009 and 0.11/0.15 mg P mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>P d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p><jats:p>Although <jats:italic>Brachypodium pinnatum</jats:italic> allocated more P to its leaf blades, it had a lower P productivity at high N and low P supply than did <jats:italic>Dactylis glomerata.</jats:italic> This was associated with a higher productivity per unit leaf P in <jats:italic>Dactylis glomerata.</jats:italic> Across all species and treatments, leaf PP showed a distinct negative correlation with P concentration per leaf area, regardless whether the variation in area‐based leaf P concentration was caused by variation in leaf thickness, leaf tissue mass density or mass‐based P concentration. A possible explanation for this would be a positive correlation between leaf chlorophyll concentration and P concentration, leading at high concentrations to shading within the leaf and to a low photosynthetic rate per unit leaf P. We conclude that a high pp is determined by the ability of a plant to distribute its P over a large leaf area, rather than by greater allocation of P to the leaves. Interspecific relationships for P productivity are similar to those known for N productivity.</jats:p>",

Pigou concurred and drew L‐shaped cost curves; Viner realized that this made firm size indeterminate and industry output volatile. Using Austin and Joan Robinson's analyses, Stigler justified rising costs/supply, determinacy, and stability by irrational entrepreneurs enduring coordination failure and by factor price changes. We conclude that consistency requires constant costs but firm employment, output, and factor incomes remain theoretically indeterminate. It becomes likely that large firms will undermine perfect competition.</jats:p>",
