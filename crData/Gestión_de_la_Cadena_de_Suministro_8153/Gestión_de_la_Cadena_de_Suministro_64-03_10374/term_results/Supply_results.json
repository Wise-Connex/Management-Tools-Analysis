Topics discussed include: the impact of alternative pricing policies on the nature and solution of the anticipated water supply problems and the resulting implications for economic efficiency; questions concerning the best regional plan for outdoor recreation that stem from the plan's major investment in recreation facilities; the cost of meeting water quality standards related to low flow augmentation; the inadequate state of technical resources to deal with water quality issues and water resources planning; and, uncertainty about how modifying the current standard might affect the costs and benefits of quality improvement programs.</jats:p>",

The evoked growths were generally small cones, 5–10 mm in length; none developed into limbs of normal size and morphology, but some formed digits and cartilage and developed striated muscle. The combined influences of trauma, effected by salt treatment, and electrical stimulation of the nerve produced more growths than trauma or stimulation alone.</jats:p>",
