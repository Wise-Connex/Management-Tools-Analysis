      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbohydrates fulfill several roles in plants; as building stones, as a source of energy, and also, as recently demonstrated, as modulators of gene expression. Primary, photosynthetic production of carbohydrates (as well as their release from tree reserves) is linked with the carbohydrate-consuming processes through complex feedback and feedforward regulatory loops. With horticultural productivity as the goal, maximum resources must be diverted toward reproductive processes. Persistence of viable vegetative structures must be secured, however, to enable the function of tree systems and ensure the tree's potential for future years. Thus, in the carbohydrate resource allocation of fruit trees, a delicate balance must be maintained between the vegetative and reproductive needs. Flowering, fruit set, and fruit enlargement have been identified as three distinct, critical stages within the annual course of yield formation in citrus. While each of these stages has its own, salient developmental features, all require considerable amounts of energy and their occurrence is dependent, at least to some extent, on the availability of carbohydrates. Whereas flower bud differentiation may require only a threshold level of carbohydrates, floral development and anthesis consume large amounts of carbohydrates due to the very large number of flowers per tree and their high rates of respiration. Fruit set is more closely linked to carbohydrate levels. Fruitlet abscission acts as a self-thinning, feedback mechanism to adjust the tree's fruit population to the carbohydrate supply. This mechanism does not operate properly in certain mandarin cultivars, resulting in alternate bearing. The acquisition of fruit size appears to be most directly correlated with the availability of photosynthate. Elimination of alternative sinks by extreme thinning and girdling brings about tremendous increases in fruit size. The fruit's vascular system also expands in response to the increase in photosynthate availability. A dynamic model has been constructed to provide a quantitative analysis of citrus trees' carbon balance during the annual productivity cycle.</jats:p>",

One good turn (the loan of a book) deserves another. The concepts of “reciprocal borrowing: and “resource sharing” are yielding to accounting principles and business processes. Charging for loans is becoming an acceptable practice. Which leads to the question, where did we get the idea that loans should be free in the first place? Early proponents of interlibrary loans in the USA did not shrink from the idea of charging but were stymied by the mechanics of collecting and distributing money. Our moral reluctance to charge is a relatively recent and perhaps transitory phenomenon. Bibliographic utilities have resolved many of the accounting problems. In the light of history, the decision to charge has more to do with mechanics than morality.</jats:p>",

Origins have often been traced to national responses to randomly exoge¬nous historical events or contingencies, including the role played by a national elite and national leaders. By the 1960s the debate among Western analysts had come to focus on the question of convergence across nation-•al systems. Processes of bureaucratic rationalization were seen to bring about a uniform web of rules requiring standard interpretation by a new global elite of professional managers. The basis of most versions of the ‘con¬ vergence thesis ‘ is the-essentially Weberian-assumption that the process of industrialization, in which the use of machines and an accompanying rationalization of public thought and procedure pervade all aspects of social life, has been and remains the impelling logic behind societal development. This assumption is now being challenged in so-called post-modernist approaches to the analysis of contemporary events. However, the indices of modernist ‘progress ‘ remain central to the operation of most organiizations particularly those with a global brief such as the World Bank and UNO agencies. Since the days of the old League of Nations the economic and social performance of nation states has been measured, monitored, and clas¬sified into grades in which, until recently, Western countries made up a premier league of outstanding and exemplary achievers.</jats:p>",

This sensitivity is described in terms of the effects these geometric features have on hole-exit velocity and turbulence intensity distributions and on adiabatic effectiveness values on the surface downstream. These measurements were taken under high freestream turbulence intensity (12%) conditions, representative of operating gas turbine engines. Coolant is supplied to the film cooling holes by means of (1) an unrestricted plenum, (2) a plenum which restricts the flow approaching the holes, forcing it to flow co-current with the freestream, and (3) a plenum which forces the flow to approach the holes counter-current with the freestream. Short-hole (L/D = 2.3) and long-hole (L/D = 7.0) comparisons are made. The geometry has a single row of film cooling holes with 35°-inclined streamwise injection. The film cooling flow is supplied at the same temperature as that of the freestream for hole-exit measurements and 10°C above the freestream temperature for adiabatic effectiveness measurements, yielding density ratios in the range 0.96–1.0. Two coolant-to-freestream velocity ratios, 0.5 and 1.0, are investigated. The results document the effects of (1) supply plenum geometry, (2) velocity ratio, and (3) hole L/D.</jats:p>",

The traditional justification for rationality models is that they offer good predictions. The main argument in this article is that individual rationality is testable and can serve to assess the empirical accuracy of the assumption of rationality in models. Three strategies to judge whether an individual action is rational — situational logic, motivational analysis and process-tracing — are used to analyse Henry Kissinger's decision in July 1975 to provide arms to Angola, an act which was intended to increase the value of the American reputation for toughness. The discussion is informed by Barry Nalebuff's game-theoretic analysis of rational beliefs concerning the value of reputation in deterrence. Finally, the article draws the implications of the empirical analysis of Kissinger's decision for the model of rational beliefs, concluding that such models can and should be evaluated on their assumptions rather than their predictions. </jats:p>",

In the model production takes time, which introduces a lag between the incurrence of costs and the receipt of revenues. Aggregate supply is determined by expectations of aggregate demand, and actual aggregate demand depends on actual aggregate supply. Expectations of lower future nominal wages can reduce employment because of the “cash flow” effect, whereby lower future nominal wages cause lower future prices, thus rendering firms unable to recover costs fully. This effect represents a supply‐side obstacle to using nominal wage deflation to restore full employment, and it complements traditional demand‐side debt‐deflation effects.</jats:p>",

This brief editorial is not to discuss the scientifically elegant molecular manipulations that led to the cloning of this newly recognized virus: this is briefly reviewed by Karayiannis &amp; Thomas (1996). Suffice to say the GBV‐C agent discovered at Abbott Laboratories (Simons <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 1995) was identified in human sera that reacted with two similar viruses (GBV‐A and GBV‐B). These had been cloned from serum of a tamarin inoculated with the GB agent derived from a surgeon who developed acute hepatitis 30 years ago. HGV was cloned by Genelabs Technologies (Linnen <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>., 1996) from the plasma of a patient with chronic hepatitis, co‐infected with HCV. Both GBV‐C and HGV are single positive‐stranded RNA viruses of ∼9400 nucleotides. Their genomic organization is consistent with the Flaviviridae; they have 25% nucleotide homology with HCV. GBV‐C and HGV are different isolates of the same virus (Masuko <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, 1996) showing 86% nucleotide homology and 96% amino acid similarity.</jats:p>",

These key issues are evaluated from the experience of a recent and comprehensive national strategic study, involving detailed consultation with many stakeholders with an interest in groundwater resources. Such balances are not easy to achieve because groundwater systems are complex to analyse and slow to respond to change, resulting in considerable uncertainty in assessment and prediction without in‐depth research and high‐resolution monitoring. Current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the water sector in England and Wales do not appear to be achieving the best possible use of aquifer storage and optimal investment in groundwater protection.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water is a key variable driving the composition and productivity of pastures and rangelands, and many of the ecosystems in these grasslands are highly sensitive to changes in water supply. The possibility that elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations may alter plant water relations is therefore particularly relevant to pastures and rangelands, and may have important consequences for grassland ecosystem function, water use, carbon storage and nutrient cycling. The planning of effective research to better understand these changes requires attention to both: (i) gaps in knowledge about CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and water interactions, and (ii) knowledge of how precisely the effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> must be understood in relation to other factors, in order to predict changes in grassland structure and production. A recent microcosm experiment illustrates that non‐linear effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and water stress could perturb primary production by triggering changes in grassland community composition. The magnitudes of the effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on key grassland ecosystems remain to be precisely determined through ecosystem‐level experiments. A simplified simulation of the impact of different levels of productivity change in a water‐limited Australian rangeland system was conducted by varying effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on radiation and water use efficiency. The results indicate that direct effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> may be moderated at the enterprise scale by accompanying changes in adaptive management by farmers. We conclude that future research should aim to construct quantitative relationships and identify thresholds of response for different grassland systems. The sensitivity of these systems to management (such as grazing pressure) should also be considered when developing integrated predictions of future effects of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on water supply to grassland ecosystems.</jats:p>",

This study examined the relationship between the type of water supply and the quality of water used. Source (communal taps, private outdoor and indoor taps) and point-of-use water samples were examined for heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), total and faecal coliforms, E. coli, and coliphages. Ten percent of samples were also analysed for enteric viruses, Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Approximately 320 households were included in a case-control study. In addition, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Both studies examined the relationship between different types of water facilities and diarrhoea among pre-school children. The source water was of good microbial quality, but water quality was found to have deteriorated significantly after handling and storage in both case and control households, exceeding drinking water quality guideline values by 1-6 orders of magnitude. Coliphage counts were low for all water samples tested. Enteric viruses and Cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected. Giardia cysts were detected on one occasion in case and control in-house samples. Comparisons of whether in-house water, after handling and storage, complied with water quality guideline values demonstrated households using communal taps to have significantly poorer quality than households using private outdoor or indoor taps for HPC and E. coli (χ2 = 14.9, P = 0.001; χ2 = 6.6, P = 0.04 respectively). A similar trend (although not statistically significant) was observed for the other microbial indicators. The cross-sectional study demonstrated an apparent decrease in health risk associated with private outdoor taps in comparison to communal taps. This study suggests that a private outdoor tap is the minimum level of water supply in order to ensure the supply of safe water to developing communities.</jats:p>",

For the late Quaternary, kaolinite/feldspar ratios and variations of terrigenous element ratios of Zr, Ti, K, Rb, and Al reveal that the composition of Zaire River sediment load has fluctuated in tune with precessional variations of boreal summer insolation. In particular, the correspondence of high kaolinite/feldspar and Al/K ratios with low‐latitude insolation maxima strongly corroborates the assumption that west African monsoonal precipitation and chemical weathering was enhanced during periods of increased central African heating. The most striking feauture observed is that opal accumulation has been 2 to 10 times higher in Zaire Fan sediments than outside in continental margin sediments off Angola, although biogenic Ba and C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> fluctuations from both areas indicate that changes of total paleoproductivity were of the same magnitude in the Zaire River plume and off Angola. From this we infer that the contribution of biogenic opal production to total paleoproductivity has been significantly higher within the Zaire River plume than in the oceanic upwelling regime farther to the south off Angola over the last 200,000 years. The pattern of opal accumulation rates with respect to that of marine organic carbon implies that enhanced opal production off the Zaire River to a great extent was the result of additional fluvial supply of dissolved silica during humid climates characterized by more intense chemical weathering on the continent, while total paleoproductivity created by oceanic upwelling was high in periods of increased zonal trade wind intensity at precessional insolation minima and during cold, more arid glacial climate conditions. We presume that paleoproductivity off the Zaire was controlled by the following two sources of nutrients: (1) marine nutrients including nitrate and phosphate as well as the uptake of Ba on particulate C<jats:sub>org</jats:sub> caused by upwelling, and (2) silica, mainly delivered by the Zaire River dissolved silicate. Hence our results underline the importance of dissolved silicate in large rivers for marine silicate cycling in the tropical to subtropical Atlantic at a millenial timescale.</jats:p>",
