      "abstract": "<jats:p>As global markets grow increasingly efficient, competition no longer takes place between individual businesses, but between entire supply chains. Collaboration can provide the competitive edge that enables all the business partners in a supply chain to prevail and grow. This paper presents a framework for customer‐supplier collaboration that facilitates effective and efficient supply chain operation. The paper reveals that the level of involvement of customers and suppliers differs across different supply chain processes and also across different sectors. While the involvement of customers is high in demand management and product development, the involvement of suppliers is high in transportation and inventory management processes. The paper also reveals that about 50 percent of the organizations surveyed indicate that suppliers and customers have little or virtually no role in the demand management, inventory management, and product development processes.</jats:p>",

Some observers have interpreted this positive association between changes in wages and labor supply as reflecting movement along stable labor supply curves. The author casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that the wage elasticity necessary to account, by itself, for the observed labor supply decline would greatly exceed elasticity levels typically found in prior studies. Analysis of Census data shows little relationship between changes in relative wages at the state level and changes in male labor supply. Also, panel data analysis shows no strong correlation between long-run changes in individual hours and wages. The small implied labor supply elasticities suggest that very little of the labor supply changes of men during the 1980s can be related to changes in relative wages. </jats:p>",

On the one hand, pressure on library budgets has resulted in cancellations of serials and an increased use of interlibrary loan and document delivery to supplement journal subscriptions. This trend is reinforced by the increasingly sophisticated search and discovery tools available to the individual researcher, linking not only to the journal but actually to the individual article. On the other hand, consortial purchasing and the advent of the ‘big deal’ look likely to reduce demand for individual article supply through document delivery and interlibrary loan. In the light of these drivers for change, this article examines the evolving document supply needs of libraries, and outlines some of the new services developed to address these needs.</jats:p>",

For the application, the impact of the 2030 climate change scenarios on streamflows and system yield has been examined. The preliminary results have demonstrated that the proposed assessment method can provide valuable insights into the impact of climate change on water supply systems, allowing it to be incorporated into planning decisions.</jats:p>",

Inventory is managed at various points of the chain (members), based on local information that each member observes and continuously updates. The key feature of our model is that it takes into account the ability of the members to observe subsets of the underlying state vector, and adopt their forecasting and replenishment policies accordingly. This enables us to model situations in which the members are privy to certain explanatory variables of the demand, with the latter possibly evolving according to a vector autoregressive time series. For each member, we identify an associated demand evolution model, for which we propose an adaptive inventory replenishment policy that utilizes the Kalman filter technique. We then provide a simple methodology for assessing the benefits of various types of information-sharing agreements between members of the supply chain. We also discuss inventory positioning and cost performance assessment in the supply chain. Our performance metrics and inventory target levels are usually presented in matrix forms, allowing them to accommodate a relatively large spectrum of linear demand models, and making them simple to implement. Several illustrations for possible applications of our models are provided. </jats:p>",

There was a massive scaling-down of the overall system, with the thermae falling immediately out of use, to be replaced to a certain extent by church baths for the clergy and poor. The Janiculum mills were maintained, and smaller watermills continued to function off the aqueducts, as well as from the Tiber. Baptisteries used both aqueduct and non-aqueduct-supplied water. There was an extensive network of wells and subterranean conduits utilizing ground-water. The system as a whole was organized centrally, by the Church – although the extent of private patronage (wells, smallscale mills and domestic baths) should not be overlooked.</jats:p>"

In 1993, President Clinton signed the first piece of federal MLL, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Similar to state legislation, the FMLA guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for eligible mothers. I evaluate the effect of MLL on the incidence of leave taking, the probability that mothers will eventually return to work at their prechildbirth jobs, and the timing of their return. The results indicate that the legislation increases the number of mothers who eventually return to their prechildbirth jobs but that MLL does not have a statistically significant effect on the incidence of leave taking. The results also indicate that MLL allows mothers to delay their return to work at their prechildbirth jobs.</jats:p>",

Fertilization effects on biomass accumulation, relative growth rate and tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were examined for seedlings grown under relatively high light. Higher light conditions in gaps are expected as human disturbance expands in tropical landscapes. Two questions were asked: (1) Does nutrient addition enhance growth or result in nutrient accumulation in the tissues of tropical tree seedlings grown in pots under high light? (2) Are these responses conditional on their adaptations to light availability, seed mass or growth form? Most of the species (73% of light-demanding and 60% of shade-tolerant) demonstrated a positive growth response to fertilization. The magnitude of the response of light-demanding species was more than twice that of shade-tolerant species. A higher proportion of shade-tolerant species accumulated nutrients in their tissues (up to 95% for P), but over half the light-demanding species did so as well. For both types of species, a higher percentage accumulated P than N. Responses in growth and in P accumulation were negatively correlated with seed mass. Shrubs responded more than trees in biomass accumulation, but there was a trend toward greater response by trees in relative growth rate and N and P accumulation. The results suggest that variation in nutrient availability could affect the structure of tropical forests regenerating from large-scale disturbance. In fertile sites, competitive exclusion may occur within the light-demanding species, resulting in a decline in local tree diversity. Depending on the effects of human disturbance on nutrient availability, loss of tree diversity at a local scale may compound diversity loss due to habitat destruction at the landscape scale.</jats:p>",

Longitudinal data were analyzed in four complementary ways: (1) simple univariate regressions; (2) regressions in which temporal trends were <jats:italic>partialled out</jats:italic>; (3) time series comparing percentage differences across segments of time; and (4) a bivariate Granger causality test.

Longitudinal correlations were associated with temporal lags of approximately 5 years for health employment and 10 years for changes in physician supply. The magnitude of changes in per capita physician supply in the United States was equivalent to differences of approximately 0.75 percent for each 1.0 percent difference in GDP.

Using these self‐reported measures, the authors find evidence which suggests that the income associated with this shock‐induced labor supply is important in allowing the household to avoid reducing consumption expenditure. Household members, however, do not seem to increase their total hours of work. They appear to just reallocate their time from household farming to other labor market activities.</jats:p>",

More attention than ever is being paid to the nation's vulnerabilities, and this has prompted officials at all levels to examine the tools available for ensuring the security of public utilities. The recent emphasis on making sure that public water supplies are safe has created the need for continuous monitoring systems and analytical techniques that can be used at the utility level to test for a variety of toxic materials in a short amount of time. States and colleagues provide a survey of continuous monitoring and analytical methods currently available to utilities for security purposes. This survey grew out of an investigation the Pittsburgh (Pa.) Water &amp; Sewer Authority (PWSA) and the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering conducted in order to identify feasible analytical responses to security concerns. This investigation included a literature search; discussions with personnel from various water utilities, water industry organizations, and regulatory agencies; and evaluation of several commercially available monitoring and analytical systems. The article also takes a look at the analytical measures PWSA uses to screen for possible contamination in response to threats or suspected tampering with its water system as well as during times of heightened security. Although these methods are limited and their results should be interpreted with caution, there are some techniques, such as acute toxicity testing, that can be useful.</jats:p>",

The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, the only abductor or respiratory muscle of the larynx, plays a vital role in cases of recurrent palsy and orthotopic transplantation. Descriptions of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle nerve supply pattern vary considerably.

However, in six cases (4%) a small branch also arose from the ramus anastomoticus. The number of branches coming from the anterior division varied, ranging from one to six. The two‐branch pattern was the most frequent (42.7%), followed by the three‐branch pattern (34%) and the one‐branch pattern (7.3%). The remaining 16% of cases showed patterns of four, five, or six branches. When two or more branches were present, a connection between them was observed in 64% of cases. Five different types of origin of the various branches were observed along the course of the recurrent nerve in relation to the cricothyroid joint: type a, vertical segment below the cricothyroid joint (7.5%); type b) vertical segment behind the cricothyroid joint (40.5%); type c) vertical segment just above the cricothyroid joint (16%); type ) from the <jats:italic>genu</jats:italic>, in common with the arytenoid branch, above the cricothyroid joint and just below the cricoarytenoid joint (34%); and type e) oblique segment (2%).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold> Despite the variability of the innervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and its strong connection with the interarytenoid nerve, this should not preclude successful reinnervation.</jats:p>",

The differences in secondary compounds among these plant parts were both qualitative and quantitative. In all parts, condensed tannins accounted for more than 50% of the phenolics. In the first true leaves and cotyledons, chlorogenic acid was the most abundant of the HPLC phenolics. The main components in stems were (+)‐catechins and rhododendrins whereas in roots, the main components were ellagitannins. The seedlings were grown at three levels of nitrogen supply (very low‐N, low‐N, moderate‐N), and the effect of nitrogen on concentrations of phenolic compounds was studied in all plant parts. The dry weight of all plant parts, except the roots, increased with increased nitrogen. In all parts, the concentration of condensed tannins was higher at lower levels of nitrogen than at moderate‐N. The concentrations of total HPLC phenolics and also those of the compound groups of HPLC phenolics were, however, affected only in the first true leaves and roots. The concentrations in the first true leaves were generally higher in seedlings grown at very low‐N and low‐N than in seedlings grown at moderate‐N. The concentrations in roots were highest at low‐N. Not all compounds responded to nitrogen supply in the same manner. The changes in concentrations cannot be exclusively interpreted as changes in the accumulation of phenolic compounds, due to dilution caused by the increase in biomass in better nitrogen availability. There were differences in carbon allocation between condensed tannins and HPLC phenolics in seedlings grown at different nitrogen levels.</jats:p>",

A study was undertaken to investigate how N supply influences the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). Two field experiments were carried out in a typical argiudol in 1996 and 1997. Six cultivars were grown at two N treatments (0 and 100–150 kg N/ha) in a split plot design. Percentage of necrosis (severity) of the two upper leaves of each treatment was evaluated three times during the growing season. Height and heading date were also scored and related to the resistance level. In 1996, with weather conditions conducive to the disease, AUDPC values were higher in the fertilized treatment. In 1997, with insufficient rain immediately after inoculation, the disease only progressed faster under N fertilization in the flag leaf, which was exposed to conducive environmental conditions from its appearance. The effect of N fertilization was influenced by the cultivar characteristics, climatic and agronomic conditions. Knowledge that N fertilization promotes the development of <jats:italic>S. tritici</jats:italic> in conducive conditions will be useful for deciding management strategies of the cultivars and for optimizing conditions for the selection in breeding programmes.</jats:p>",

We measured forearm vascular blood flow (FBF) and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) by plethysmography and urinary albumin excretion in 20 normotensive without family story of hypertension (NT: 25±9 years), 10 modulating offspring of hypertensive parents (MHO: 25±6 years), 10 nonmodulating offspring of hypertensive parents (NMHO: 26±5 years), 12 modulating essential hypertensives (MHT: 34±5 years), and 11 nonmodulating essential hypertensives (NMHT: 32±4 years). Measurements were repeated in hypertensives after 3-month treatment with ramipril (5 mg daily). Nonmodulating individuals showed lower maximum FBF (NMHT: 41.96±3.3 mL/100 g per minute and NMHO: 35.6±9.0 mL/100 g per minute) than modulating subjects (MHT: 57.5±10.0 mL/100 g per minute and MHO: 51.8±7.0 mL/100 g per minute;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.003). Likewise, all nonmodulating subjects showed higher minimum FVR (NMHT: 2.5±0.2 AU; NMO: 2.8±0.5 AU) than modulating individuals (MHT: 1.9±0.5 AU; MHO, 1.8±0.3AU;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.025). Urinary albumin excretion was higher in NMHT and NMHO than MHT, MHO, and NT (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05). Ramipril increased maximum FBF to 53.8±8.0 mL/100 g per minute and reduced minimum FVR to 1.9±0.5 AU in NMHT (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.01). Likewise, ramipril increased effective renal plasma flow and reduced renal vascular resistance and urinary albumin excretion only in NMHT (\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.05). These results have shown an early involvement of the peripheral circulation in association with increased urinary albumin excretion not only in essential hypertensives but also in NMHO. The effectiveness of ramipril in reducing minimum FVR and urinary albumin excretion in NMHT also suggests a common mechanism.\n          </jats:p>",

In Experiment 1, four groups of rats received diets with coconut oil or salmon oil (100 g/kg diet) and vitamin E concentrations of 40 or 240 mg α‐tocopherol equivalents/kg. In Experiment 2, eight groups of rats received diets supplemented with pure or oxidized cholesterol (5 g/kg), coconut oil or salmon oil (100 g/kg diet) and vitamin E concentrations of 40 or 240 mg α‐tocopherol equivalents/ kg. Rats fed the salmon oil diets had significantly higher concentrations of 7β‐hydroxycholesterol in liver, plasma, low density lipoproteins and erythrocytes than rats fed coconut oil diets. Rats fed the diets supplemented with oxidized cholesterol had significantly higher concentrations of 7β‐hydroxycholesterol in all the samples analyzed than rats fed pure cholesterol. Increasing the dietary vitamin E concentration from 40 to 240 mg α‐tocopherol equivalents/kg diet reduced the concentration of 7β‐hydroxycholesterol in plasma; the concentrations of 7β‐hydroxycholesterol in liver, low density lipoproteins and erythrocytes were not influenced by the dietary vitamin E concentration. The study suggests that diets with fish oil or oxidized cholesterol are critical with respect to the formation of 7β‐hydroxycholesterol.</jats:p>",
