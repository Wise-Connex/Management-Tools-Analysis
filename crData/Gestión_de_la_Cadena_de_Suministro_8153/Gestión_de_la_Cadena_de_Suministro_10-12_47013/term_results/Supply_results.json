The research was motivated by the incident of E-coli outbreak in packaged spinach in the US. We base our analysis on information gathered from published literature and data collection in the region from personnel involved in Agriculture. Our research is aimed at addressing the following research questions: What key factors contribute to the vulnerability to disruption from contamination and what are the interrelationships between these contributing factors? What managerial actions may be taken to minimize the fresh produce supply chain's vulnerability to disruption? In this research we develop a conceptual framework consisting of the contributing factors: product type, topological structure, exposure to contamination, product traceability, and communication. The practice related contributions of this research are managerial insight and recommended actions derived from the proposed conceptual framework.</jats:p>"

However, these voluntary activities are often not sufficiently recognised internally and externally due to a missing sustainability framework and a less developed communication strategy. Therefore, a comprehensive framework for the measurement and reporting of corporate responsibility (CR) in water supply was developed, comprising the environmental and sustainability issues of resource protection and water supply, social responsibility and long-term economical development. This framework was successfully applied in a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach and served as basis for a CR report of a German regional water and wastewater company. The CR Performance Indicator system was imbedded in the IWA framework of Performance Indicators (PI), and as such is universally applicable in water and wastewater systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is a study on financial sustainability of water supply service to the city of Offa, in Kwara State, Nigeria. The value consumers place on water supply and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improved service and the factors that influence their preferences were determined using an econometric model. The WTP was estimated using a double-bounded dichotomous model and the mean WTP was found to be 70% higher than the current tariff, while the expected monthly revenue from domestic customers alone was 21 million ($175,000)1. The study revealed that the consumers were not satisfied with the level of service but they were willing to pay for improved service and even support reforms that will bring about this change. The mean WTP in practical terms gives social benefit of a policy for the offered service for the affected population. The study outcome shows that the high WTP is a good incentive for private sector involvement in the management of urban water supply.</jats:p>",

Researches related to the sustainability of water services have been conducted in several developing countries. However, there are no identical researches in Indonesia. This paper discusses the analysis of factors that contribute to sustainability of rural water supply systems in East Java, Indonesia. Data is collected by observing rural water supply facilities, interviewing water committees and water users, and taking documentation. The data is used to build a model, which was developed from theoretical or conceptual model. The model's development uses structural equation modeling (SEM). This model can show the factors that contribute to sustainability of rural water supply systems. The sustainability is influenced significantly by nine variables; they are selection of technology, water sources, investment cost, capability of operator, availability of spare parts, operation cost, technical operation, community participation, and institutional management.</jats:p>",

The gestalt and profile deviation (Venkatraman, 1989) approaches were used to identify the relationship between practices and the degrees of alignment in the respective strategy groups. When compared to other strategy groups, the group of companies predominantly devoted to the Focus on Low Cost strategy (49,25%) was found to have: greater consistency in the development of practices between supply, manufacturing and distribution, a high degree of alignment of most of these practices with that strategy, a greater tendency towards achieving better business performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globalization of food supply chains requires from companies located in developing countries to comply with strict production standards. Hence, there is an increasing need for socio-economic environmental certification worldwide. A way to meet food standards is to create a supply chain management that deals with sequential processes coordinated by the chain leader. In the particular case of agri-food markets, it is common for food retailers to perform the role of chain leaders. This paper describes the configuration and coordination of a certified fair trade fruit supply chain in Brazil servicing the United Kingdom (UK) market. The methods used are interviews with key informants working at different stages of the supply chain in both countries and secondary data analysis. Our findings suggest that retailers in the UK transfer the responsibility of supply chains coordination to their partnering traders in Brazil, who, in turn, are responsible for monitoring information flow and tracking processes. Theoretical contributions are related to the understanding of a complex supply chain because it involves members that have different technologies, skills, language and knowledge about the market. This heterogeneity makes the co-coordinating role even more important.</jats:p>"

A conceptual model was formulated based on previous literature. A questionnaire based survey was performed. Data from 30 Bangladeshi Readymade Garments Industry were collected through interview and mail survey. The content validity, construct validity, and reliability are tested. Path Analysis is performed for the identification of the validity of the model. The findings show that information sharing is a prerequisite for knowledge sharing and the close supplier-buyer relationship is a vital factor for escalating the supplier's operational performance.</jats:p>"

Wholesale introduction of fuel cell vehicles to over 50% of the total market from beyond 2025, will require a significant increase in platinum supply.

This paper also sums up the characteristics and the management experiences of the drainage facilities of ancient Chinese cities, including drainage system management methods, rules and laws about drainage in different eras, and overall principles of ancient city water systems. At present, most major cities in China are facing issues relating to drainage systems and city water systems. These cities are often bothered by floods and other water-related problems. Learning from the ancestors' experience would be important and necessary for modern planners and decision makers. Therefore this paper may be used for reference in modern city planning and construction.</jats:p>",

The idea of this method, based on the solution of Maxwell's equations in the lamination material, was described by the author in the previous work [3], taking into account approximation of constitutive static hysteresis loop by elliptic form of the function <jats:italic>B</jats:italic> = <jats:italic>f(H)</jats:italic> depending on magnetic saturation. In the previous formula for new isotropic and anisotropic materials it is needed to introduce so called \"anomaly coefficient\" deduced from the comparison of measured and calculated value of power losses in arbitrary excitation frequency for assumed induction. The method was tested by comparison with the results of experiments presented in commercial catalogues [1, 2]. Assuming superposition of harmonic power losses it is possible to enlarge this method for the estimation of overloss coefficient in dynamo sheet during axial magnetization with nonsinusoidal flux generated e.g. by PWM voltage supply.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted in pilot scale under conditions typical for waterworks at a dam water treatment plant. A comparison of different ceramic membranes implied that total membrane resistance was more influenced by feed water type and by operation than by membrane type for the waters tested. Nevertheless, ceramic membranes seem to accumulate during operation less organic foulants especially polysaccharides compared to organic membranes leading to lower total membrane resistances for ceramic membranes during filtration process. Ceramic membranes may be considered to be applicable to treat spent filter backwash water as well as source water in public water supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>A recent trend in aerospace is that aircraft original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, Eurocopter and for instance Dassault, are developing from a “production” orientated company towards “integrators of value.” Suppliers were already involved mainly with “built to print” activities, leaving most of the risk with the OEM. Today, the suppliers are involved with the co‐development of entire functions of the aircraft such as wings, fuselage, and stabilizers, which causes the production value to shift from the aerospace OEM towards the supply chain (SC) and network. The co‐development includes the investment in development for the specific aircraft function(s) by the suppliers. The aerospace OEM is in fact leveraging value on suppliers; this is what we call “value‐leverage.” The rational behind this value‐leverage approach is the reduction of supply complexity, which destines from lean manufacturing theories adopted from the automotive industry.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Examples of Boeing B787 and Eurocopter show the approach of value‐leverage on the suppliers. The 3C value‐leverage model is found as an applicable method to measure value‐leverage effects in a network, from which suppliers are most important value drivers. Aerospace OEM companies are challenged to leverage value smart on the supply chain and network to make value to flow.</jats:p>"

By substituting fresh water with appropriately treated greywater, it is possible to save 30–50% of fresh water. In this paper, an up-flow pilot biological aerated filter (BAF) is tested for the treatment of synthetic greywater and the design parameters are determined. An organic load of 8 kg COD/(m3 d) allows to achieving a good effluent quality with regard to COD, suspended solids, and anionic surfactants. By reducing the organic load to 5 kg COD/(m3 d) full nitrification is achieved as well. A process set-up for a full-scale BAF greywater treatment plant is proposed and dimensioned using the parameters from the pilot plant tests. Here, the required specific volume is approx. 3 L/C for the reactor and 16 L/C for the storage tanks. This feature make the BAF a compact process which can be successfully integrated in intra-urban water reuse schemes.</jats:p>",

Corrosion is an important problem in drinking water because it can affect public health due to leaching of lead or other metals into the drinking water. For this reason, a corrosion control program is an important measure to help mitigate exposure to lead in drinking water. The biggest challenge that remains in assessing corrosion control through monitoring programs is the variability of the concentrations of metals such as lead in drinking water, and the interpretation of the results when using different approaches for monitoring. This is due to the many factors that contribute to the leaching of metals from drinking water distribution system materials. Balancing the challenges of stagnation time, sample volume and sampling frequency to assess corrosion control with their practicality and the need to ensure optimal corrosion control treatment are important considerations for regulators and decision-makers to ensure that potential exposure to lead through drinking water is minimized.</jats:p>",

We build on findings from a previous study in which the need for supply chain metrics of performance was identified. A five-step method to develop performance measures is suggested as an improvement alternative. Examples of specific metrics for quality and time performance are provided. This approach facilitates collaboration between supply chain partners and provides information that allows a more efficient focus on improvement projects. Supply chain measures of performance are important for seeing beyond a single entity and aligning strategy in the supply chain. Companies that want to integrate their suppliers and customers in their improvement efforts can benefit from the information presented here, because a common set of performance measures is essential in evaluating progress toward a goal.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water can increase the levels of copper released from copper pipes to water and inhibit the formation of protective deposits such as malachite. Since adsorption of NOM on copper pipes surfaces is believed to be one of mechanisms that explains this phenomenom, the objective of this study was to determine kinetics and the adsorption equilibrium of main components of NOM, humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA), onto copper surfaces. The kinetics and equilibrium adsorption of HA and FA on copper foils were examined using batch experiments at 22°C. HA and FA followed pseudo second-order kinetics adsorption. Rate constants measured were 2.59 × 10−1 (mgTOC cm−2 h−1) for HA and 3.13 × 10−1 (mgTOC cm−2 h−1) for FA. The adsorption behavior of HA and FA on the copper surface is in accordance with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Langmuir adsorption constants measured were 5.98 × 10−2 L mg−1 for HA and 4.78 × 10−2 L mg−1 for FA. The copper foils exposed during five months to FA formed malachite deposits, whereas those exposed to HA did not and just cuprite was found. The results of this study showed that both HA as well as FA adsorption on copper surfaces is favored and no significant differences were found in the adsorption parameters calculated for both compounds. However, the inhibition of the malachite precipitation could be attributed to the HA adsorption.</jats:p>",

The coordination of a three-level supply chain made up of one manufacturer, one distributor and one retailer is studied under the random demand. Firstly, the optimal order quantity is determined with the channel coordination of the supply chain; Secondly, the paper designs a combined contract (revenue-sharing contract &amp; rebate-penalty contract, RS-RP contract) to coordinate the supply chain, namely, manufacturer offers distributor a revenue-sharing contract and distributor offers retailer a rebate-penalty contract. The paper validates that RS-RP contract can coordinate the three-level supply chain by choosing reasonable parameters. The reasonable choice of parameters can attain the win-win good among all business members, which will help to improve the decision-making capacity and competive ability of businesses involved in the supply chain, and the sizes of parameters in a reasonable range relate to the bargaining position of a business. Finally, the validity of the RS-RP contract is illustrated by a numerical example.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines an integrated decision-making process regarding pricing for uncertain demand and sourcing from uncertain supply, which are often studied separately in the literature. Our analysis of the integrated system suggests that the base stock list price policy fails to achieve optimality even under deterministic demand. Instead, the optimal policy is characterized by two critical values: a reorder point and a target safety stock. Under this policy, a positive order is issued if and only if the inventory level is below the reorder point. When this happens, the optimal order and price are coordinated to achieve a constant target safety stock, which aims at hedging the demand uncertainty. We further investigate the profit improvement obtained from deploying dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing. Our results indicate that either supply limit or supply uncertainty may induce a significant benefit from dynamic pricing, and the compound effect of supply limit and uncertainty can be much more pronounced than the individual effects. Whether or not the supply capacity is limited has a major implication on the value of dynamic pricing. Under unlimited supply, dynamic pricing is more valuable when procurement cost is high or when demand is more sensitive to price. With limited supply, however, the capacity restriction tends to be relaxed, reducing the value of dynamic pricing. </jats:p>",

To develop effective demand management strategies for rural and regional areas, this paper investigates the drivers and barriers to water saving in southwest Victoria. Although the majority of people felt water saving was important, the drivers for water saving differed between different groups. Residential users were saving water for altruistic reasons, while for farmers the drivers were farm viability and productivity. Although the barriers differed between property types, common barriers included lack of understanding of the impact their water use has on supplies, lack of knowledge, the pricing system and distrust of the water authority. The findings provide information for effective demand management strategies for the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a multiple product supply chain where a manufacturer receives orders from several distributors. If the orders cannot all be met from available production capacity, then the manufacturer allocates that capacity and a set of resubmittable orders among the distributors. The distributors may share their allocated capacity among themselves before submitting revised orders. Finally, the manufacturer schedules the revised orders to minimize its cost. We consider three practical coordination issues. First, we estimate the benefit to the manufacturer from considering scheduling costs and constraints in making capacity and order allocation decisions. Second, we estimate the additional profit that the distributors achieve when they share their allocated capacity. Third, we estimate the value of coordination between the manufacturer and the distributors. Our work is among the first to consider all three issues simultaneously. We model scheduling costs and constraints within the manufacturer's capacity allocation problem. We model the distributors' capacity sharing problem as a cooperative game that has properties that are unique within cooperative game theory. Finally, we develop optimal algorithms for all the models defined by the three coordination issues. Our exact evaluation of decisions about the appropriate coordination level improves managers' ability to make those decisions. </jats:p>",

Seemingly unrelated regression is used in a profit maximization framework to model softwood lumber supply as a function of lumber and stumpage prices, lagged supply, wage rate, and interest rate for the eastern and western United States. The effects of listing the northern spotted owl (<jats:italic>Strix occidentalis caurina</jats:italic>) as a threatened species and the US–Canada softwood lumber trade dispute are controlled for in empirical estimation. Results show that regional lumber supply is quite inelastic to lumber price and that stumpage price and bank prime rate negatively influence regional lumber supply. Results also suggest that present market supplies of softwood lumber have potential expansionary influence on future supplies, that listing of the northern spotted owl in 1990 reduced the lumber supply in the western region during subsequent years, that the US–Canada softwood lumber trade dispute/agreements favored regional lumber production in the United States during the period from 1996 to 2005, and that supply has declined during the recent period of economic recession.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A study was carried out to characterize the sludge produced at Kadahokwa Water Treatment Plant (KWTP) in Butare to assess the effectiveness of the sludge treatment and potential impacts of sludge disposal on the environment. Parameters analyzed were chromium, nickel, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, aluminium, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, potassium and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The results showed that 450±244.5 tons (dry weight) of sludge are produced annually. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sludge were below the standard limits for land application set by different countries. The high concentrations of nickel (42.3±2.5 ppm), chromium (29.9±6.2 ppm), cadmium (1.1±0.3 ppm) and lead (31.6±3.7 ppm) in the dried sludge posed a pollution risk for the wetland. The CEC was 28.4–33.3 cmol (+)/kg and pH was 6.50–7.45. It was concluded that the KWTP sludge is a poor source of total carbon, a moderate source of nutrients (NPK), and an important source of micronutrients, making it generally suitable for reuse for crop production. The CEC showed that the sludge could improve soil nutrient and water holding capacity. The higher concentration of aluminium (280 ppm) in the sludge creates an opportunity for recycling.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Application of virtual case studies (VCS) is a well established technique in environmental engineering to test measures, approaches, models or software. However, preparation of VCS for an infrastructure network is a tedious task. In literature, approaches can be found which generate very simplified VCS, which are only partly comparable with real world case studies. VCS which are more comparable with real world case studies can be generated with the software VIBe (Virtual Infrastructure Benchmarking). With VIBe, a methodology for algorithmic generation of VCS with varying spatially distributed boundary conditions was presented. Therein the investigated infrastructure is constructed accordingly to the state-of-the-art design rules meeting the requirements of the generated virtual urban environment. In this paper the module for the generation of water distribution systems (WDS) is presented. The generated WDS are set in context with data from real world WDS and systematically investigated. A set of 75,000 virtual WDS with varying properties is characterized and stochastically analysed in order to identify system coherences e.g. impact of mesh degree on hydraulic, water quality performance and costs. An example involving the systematic investigation of a simple pipe sizing algorithm with the set of 75,000 WDS is shown.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a framework for the matching industry clusters to appropriate alternative water sources using an eco-industrial approach. Alternative water sources are increasingly being considered in new industrial developments to reduce demand on potable supply and improve sustainability performance. The suitability of alternative water sources for industrial development is influenced both by the demand profile of the industrial tenants and the limitations and opportunities presented by the local environment. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates the principals of industrial ecology for considering the feasibility of alternative water services in a new industrial estate. The application of industrial ecology principles takes a site specific approach that considers the opportunities and limitations offered by the local environment and existing regional industries in moving towards sustainable water services. Industrial ecology facilitates opportunities for planning symbiosis between industries through by-product exchange, water cascading and cooperative infrastructure. The framework was applied to a new industrial development in Melbourne, Australia; with the assessment of alternative water sources part of a larger project that had the purpose of identifying regional by-product synergies based on materials, energy and water exchanges between businesses. The feasibility assessment detailed demonstrates that suitability of alternative water sources varies depending on the industry water demand profile. The paper demonstrates that the application of industrial ecology principles can be used to consider the feasibility of alternative water sources based on the regional context and the demand profile of industries locating to an eco-industrial park.</jats:p>",

Our optimization determines that to realize the highest profit, the principal and the involved agents should avoid any agents' becoming dominant. Hence, the volume of sourced items from the agents should not vary too much. We further outline the on-boarding process of new agents in the network and how the network needs to compensate for the potential loss for some of the agents if the network should fulfill the incentive-compatibility condition.</jats:p>"

L. pneumophila serogroup 1 is the worldwide prevalent serogroup in water sources while serogroup 3 was only occasionally reported. Previous reports on L. pneumophila serogroup 1 as the main causative of respiratory disease in Israel revealed a drop from 52 to 15% in incidence during a 5-year survey, with a rise in the incidence of seropositivity to “other Legionellae”, mainly sg. 3. As antigenuria is the main clinical tool to detect Legionellosis among infected patients, the shift from serogroup 1 to serogroup 3 in water sources will go undetected for obvious reasons. The process of serogroups prevalence shift in water sources is an interesting issue that has to be investigated further in order to advance our understanding of Legionella epidemiology.</jats:p>",

Thirty-eight domestic and imported bottled water brands were tested for Total Coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococci, HPC, Yeasts and Moulds. Three brands did not comply with both of the above criteria for Total Coliforms. Seventeen brands did not comply with HPC criteria and 21 brands displayed mould growth. A questionnaire was used to assess the impact of manufacturing procedures on bottled water quality. Four responding manufacturers, which represented 11 bottled water brands, bottled at least one brand that did not comply with the ANZFS Code for HPC. Our study demonstrated that even 10 years after the initial study in New Zealand microbiological contamination in bottled waters was still being detected. We further demonstrated that monitoring of bottled water microbiological quality was essential and that the presence of manufacturers' procedures for ensuring satisfactory bottled water microbiological quality did not always guarantee it.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Multivariate Consumption Profiling (MCP) is a methodology to analyse the readings made by Intelligent Meter (IM) systems. Even in advanced water companies with well supported IM, full statistical analyses are not performed, since no efficient methods are available to deal with all the data items. Multivariate Analysis has been proposed as a convenient way to synthesise all IM information. MCP uses Factor Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis to analyse data variability by categories and levels, in a cyclical improvement process. MCP obtains a conceptual schema of a reference population on a set of classifying tables, one for each category. These tables are quantitative concepts to evaluate consumption, meter sizing, leakage and undermetering for populations and groupings and individual cases. They give structuring items to enhance “traditional” statistics. All the relevant data from each new meter reading can be matched to the classifying tables. A set of indexes is computed and thresholds are used to select those cases with the desired profiles. The paper gives an example of a MCP conceptual schema for five categories, three variables, and five levels, and obtains its classifying tables. It shows the use of case profiles to implement actions in accordance with the operative objectives.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a two-stage optimum drip irrigation lateral design model is developed based on a new uniformity formula that includes hydraulic variation, emitter manufacture’s variation, and field roughness variation. The non-linear objective function minimizes the capital cost and the present values of the lateral operating cost. In the first stage, the pipe diameter and the emitter average pressure are taken as decision variables for the specified uniformity and lateral length. In the second stage, a commercially available pipe size that is very close to the diameter obtained in the first stage is selected. It has an allowable pressure that is a little more than or equal to 1.5 times of the maximum lateral pressure obtained in the first stage. The emitter average pressure is calculated for a known diameter. The model is applied to a case study in which the result indicates that a lateral with a larger diameter and the lower emitter average pressure can be economically justifiable. A drip irrigation system with a lower pressure should be developed on the basis of this study.</jats:p>",

In the unidirectional method, the necessary flow and water pressure for the minimum flow velocity for flushing become greater when pipe diameter exceeds a certain value. Therefore, the maximum length of flushable pipeline decreases. The velocity in a pipeline is not highly dependent on the number of open hydrants; in contrast, the velocity in a pipeline after conventional flushing increases with the number of open hydrants. The hydrant discharge flow is smaller in unidirectional flushing than in conventional flushing. However, the percentage of velocities above 1.0 m/s or 1.5 m/s in a flow is relatively higher in conventional flushing when multiple hydrants are open concurrently. Moreover, preplanning or choice of an exact target area is more necessary for unidirectional flushing than for conventional flushing. In this research, a flushing path that can generate optimum effects with less hydrant discharge flow can be observed when conventional and unidirectional flushing processes are applied to specific components in advance.</jats:p>",

A negative campaign blaming illegal coffee producers for the loss of tigers in the Bukit Barisan Selatan (BBS) National Park in the province further complicates the issue, as the current coffee supply chain could not guarantee the workability of price transparency and asymmetric structures of coffee markets, to name a few. In this region, community initiatives have been developed to foster forest conservation by adopting coffee multi-strata practices under the agroforestry system and community-based forestry management in the buffer zone outside the BBS National Park. Based on research findings, buyer-driven regulation of environmental practices in the coffee industry, which characterize most global initiatives, have somehow restructured the supply chain in producing regions. Recent global sustainability standards require adequate organizational capacity of coffee-farmer groups and rural cooperatives involved in the supply chain. The paper recommends policy integration between bottom-up initiatives at farm level or institutional changes at supply-chain organizations, and top-down sustainability standards set by the private sector and non-government organizations.</jats:p>",

We can use virtual water flow calculations to estimate the water efficiency of a country, as well as its economic dependence on water resources. Former studies on this area have focused on quantifying the virtual water flows between countries, in an international context. In this study we reduce the action framework to regions within a country, determining the virtual water balance between two Spanish regions: Castilla-La Mancha and Murcia. In 2004, Castilla-La Mancha exported to Murcia 2,453,442 tons of commercial products, from which 1,191,628 tons were agricultural goods. In terms of virtual water, it means 1,365 hm3, including food-processing, and industrial products. It is necessary to add 350 hm3 to the result, because of the water transfer (Tajo-Segura transfer) between the rivers basins of these regions, so the final virtual water number, in 2004, was 1,715 hm3. The other way round, Murcia exported in 2004 2,069,000 tons of products, from which 490,351 tons were agricultural goods. That supposes 712 hm3 of virtual water. Virtual water flow is unbalanced and displaced towards Murcia with a difference of 1,003 hm3.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses the influence of physical parameters such as aeration and permeates flux on migration and deposition of above micron particles on the membrane surface. Kaolin clay suspension of particle 3.7–8 μm with mean particle diameter 4.1 μm was used in this study. Equal amount of mass of deposited particles on the membrane surface created different transmembrane pressure (TMP) when operated at different aeration rates and permeate flux showing that there is a composite effect. The particle deposition rate at the beginning at lower flux was almost linear which changed to a sharp logarithamic rise at higher flux. The difference in TMP rise for the same amount of deposit demonstrated the selective nature of particle deposition. The mass of the particle deposition on the membrane surface could be described by two parameters: maximum deposition and time using a simple empirical logarithamic equation y=k/[1+exp(b−at)], where k, a, and b are constant; y is the particulate mass deposit (g/m2) and t is the time. The maximum particle mass deposition growth could be described by the equation dy/dt=1/4ka.</jats:p>",

The objective of the study is to uncover the nature of supply chain collaboration and explore its impact on firm performance based on a paradigm of collaborative advantage. Reliable and valid instruments of these constructs were developed through rigorous empirical analysis. Data were collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing firms in various industries. The statistical methods used include confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (i.e., LISREL). The results indicate that supply chain collaboration improves collaborative advantage and indeed has a bottom‐line influence on firm performance, and collaborative advantage is an intermediate variable that enables supply chain partners to achieve synergies and create superior performance. A further analysis of the moderation effect of firm size reveals that collaborative advantage completely mediates the relationship between supply chain collaboration and firm performance for small firms while it partially mediates the relationship for medium and large firms.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The research data were treated with statistical discriminant and cluster analysis. The findings identified the relationship between employee and client satisfaction in 25 of the 27 business units studied. On the other hand, the factor that largely influences the client retention rate in this business environment is client satisfaction, while employee satisfaction is almost null.

These data were reviewed searching for correlations with blood banking and transfusion medicine practices. Wide varieties of health care and blood supply schemes were documented. There was no apparent relationship between their structure and organization nor their financing arrangements and their proclivity for the implementation of new methods or approaches such as pathogen inactivation and universal leucoreduction. The costs of the operation of the blood supply system as represented by their product fees and the rate of collection of red cells could also not be associated with the factors examined. The diversity of practice evident across developed countries is not explicable solely through their health care and blood supply system structures.

The multi‐echelon inventory systems are modeled with the guaranteed service approach to handle the uncertain demands at each echelon. The maximum guaranteed service time of the last echelon of the PSC is proposed as a measure of a PSC's responsiveness. The problem is formulated as a bi‐criterion mixed‐integer nonlinear program (MINLP) with the objectives of minimizing the annualized cost (economic objective) and minimizing the maximum guaranteed service times of the markets (responsiveness objective). The model simultaneously predicts the optimal network structure, transportation amounts, and inventory levels under different specifications of the PSC responsiveness. An example on acetic acid supply chain is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model and to comprehensively compare different measures of PSC responsiveness. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2011</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The behaviour of residual chlorine concentration in drinking water treated by the mid-chlorination or the advanced water treatment (AWT) was investigated. The AWT removes dissolved organic matter more than the mid-chlorination, thus the rate of residual chlorine reduction is decreased. The analysis of chlorine concentration data measured by automated continuous monitoring devices revealed that the introduction of AWT reduced the maximum and mean chlorine concentration by 0.33 mg L−1 and 0.21 mg L−1 compared to the mid-chlorination respectively, while the minimum concentration was maintained at around 0.3 mg L−1 in the whole city. The overall chlorine reduction rate coefficient in the AWT was reduced to approximately half of that in the mid-chlorination. Volatilization of chlorine from a water surface could be expressed by the zero-order rate of reaction from laboratory experiments. The rate of volatilization increases with increasing water temperature and shallower water depth. The residual chlorine prediction models were developed based on the results of data monitoring and laboratory experiments. The accuracy of simulated values is good and almost all of the predicted concentrations are in the range of±0.1 mg L−1 of measured concentrations. The models are very effective to control residual chlorine concentration at predetermined target value.</jats:p>",

This difficulty can be averted if conscious efforts are made to offset it and to stimulate positive responses from the supply side.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The major intent of this research is to analyze the performance quality dimensions of a telecom service company Supply Chain in the Indian context. Currently a rapid boom has been experienced in telecom sectors. While dealing with more and more sophisticated technologies and better change management schemes, one of the crucial problems faced by the top management is the comparative evaluation of various alternatives in the telecom service supply. ANP is a powerful multi-criteria decision-making tool to encapsulate the interdependencies among and between levels of decision attributes. It structures the decision problem in a hierarchical form and links the determinants, dimensions, and enablers with alternatives available to the decision maker. Therefore, in the current study undertaken in a public sector unit in India, the dimensions of telecom service sector have been captured in four perspectives viz. customer, internal business, innovation and learning, and finance, which mimic a balanced score card. Three services of the public sector telecom organization that have been analyzed are (i) Consultancy (ii) Project Execution (iii) Training and quality control. Here the determinants, dimensions and enablers have been derived based on the combination of literature review and insights gained through exploratory interviews with the appropriate experts/ professionals. It was observed that criteria, sub-criteria, determinants, etc. were interrelated. The comparative evaluation between alternatives was done based on the feedback of ten relevant executives. Geometric mean of their response was considered as the combined evaluation score. Later super matrices were formed. Further, a quantified value named as overall weighted service index, which would give an indication of the performance of an organization and provide directions to managers where the improvement efforts has been derived. This was highest for consultancy and lowest for training and quality control. The article concludes with managerial implication and scope for future work. </jats:p><jats:p> [Service Science, ISSN 2164-3962 (print), ISSN 2164-3970 (online), was published by Services Science Global (SSG) from 2009 to 2011 as issues under ISBN 978-1-4276-2090-3.] </jats:p>",

The third of these, the Ziegler polar expedition (1903–1905), led by Anthony Fiala and funded by the American baking soda tycoon William Ziegler, set up numerous camps and caches of supplies along its various expedition routes through the islands. The papers of Anton Vedoe and Ernest Leffingwell at the Rauner Special Collections Library at Dartmouth College reveal both the locations and contents of the caches Fiala ordered to be established in spring 1905, as he made his second and final attempt to reach the pole. These caches extend from the expedition base camp (Camp Abruzzi) at Bukhta Teplitsa [Teplitz Bay] on Ostrov Rudol'fa [Rudolf Island] to the main base of the preceding 1901–1902 Baldwin-Ziegler expedition (Camp Ziegler) on Ostrov Aldzher [Alger Island]. Little is known of the condition of these sites, especially the main cache site of Kane Lodge on Ostrov Grili [Greely Island]. As such, they hold the potential to provide new sources of archaeological data to study American polar ambitions at the turn of the 20th century. While these sites remain unexplored, increasing tourism in the islands necessitates informed planning and field research to establish the nature and stability of these remains so that they may be preserved and the potential effects of tourism mitigated.</jats:p>",

The primary aim of this study was to develop a chemical monitoring program that can demonstrate proper plant operation resulting in the removal of priority chemical constituents in the product water. The feed water quality to the pilot plant was tertiary-treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. The unit processes of the AWTP were comprised of an integrated membrane system (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis) followed by final chlorination generating a water quality that does not present a source of human or environmental health concern. The chemical monitoring program was undertaken over 6 weeks during pilot plant operation and involved the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, steroidal hormones, industrial chemicals, pesticides, N-nitrosamines and halomethanes. The first phase consisted of baseline monitoring of target compounds to quantify influent concentrations in feed waters to the plant. This was followed by a period of validation monitoring utilising indicator chemicals and surrogate measures suitable to assess proper process performance at various stages of the AWTP. This effort was supported by challenge testing experiments to further validate removal of a series of indicator chemicals by reverse osmosis. This pilot-scale study demonstrated a simplified analytical approach that can be employed to assure proper operation of advanced water treatment processes and the absence of trace organic chemicals.</jats:p>",

Trials were carried out on a pilot RO system with a capacity of 50 m3/day. Initially, proof of concept for the DO-HS method in water reuse application was established wherein the profile of osmotic driving force for DO backwash, DO backwash flow during HS injection, removal of foulants with DO-HS treatment and lower RO fouling rate with the DO-HS method were demonstrated. 6 months of trials further demonstrated that RO membrane fouling rate and CIP frequency could be significantly reduced with the DO-HS method and there was no impact on the performance of RO membranes. Further trials were carried out focusing of salt requirements and it was found that salt injection duration could be reduced by 68% while the 48-h interval of salt injection was not recommended. Currently, the salt consumption has been reduced from the initial at 0.5 ton to the current at 0.16 ton as per 10,000 m3/day production. The study is ongoing to achieve the target of 0.05 ton for ease of operation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Historically, low-pressure membranes (microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF)) used in potable water treatment are made of polymers (polysulfone (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyethersulfone (PES), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) etc). Recently, membranes made of ceramic materials (aluminium oxide) have been developed by MetaWater (Japan), Kubota (Japan) and others and is being marketed in the United States (US) by Krüger, Inc. (Cary, NC). Ceramic membranes offer several potential advantages over polymeric membranes, including higher mechanical robustness and ability to handle higher loading of particulates, higher resistance to oxidants and membrane cleaning chemicals, higher membrane integrity, longer service life and compact footprint. The authors conducted collaborative evaluations of this emerging technology at two different places; (i) Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant (WTP) of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU), Dallas, Texas, USA and (ii) Graham Mesa WTP, City of Rifle, Rifle, Colorado, USA. The evaluations included pilot testing of ceramic membranes in direct filtration mode (i.e. without clarification) and with coagulant addition. The water streams that were pilot tested at Elm Fork WTP included Trinity River water, spent filter backwash wastewater and lagoon recycle water (spent filter backwash water combined with clarifier blow down water). The City of Rifle pilot testing was conducted on Colorado River water. This paper presents the key results of these two pilot studies. Results of pilot testing were used to define the potential membrane flux, backwash protocols (interval and duration), chemical enhanced backwash (CEB) and clean-in-place (CIP) protocols. Pilot test results and engineering judgment were used for developing concept-level sizing and outlining parameters for future evaluation. This paper will discuss the key technical and economic considerations of the emerging treatment technology and its potential applications for potable water treatment. This paper will be of interest to water providers that are considering alternatives to treat challenging source waters (waters with high particulates and under heavy microbial influence), build new compact water treatment plants, increase plant capacity through membrane retrofits and treat recycle streams at existing WTPs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wider scientific community now accept that the threat of climate change as real and thus acknowledge the importance of implementing adaptation measures in a global context. In the UK, the physical effects of climate change are likely to be directly felt in the form of extreme weather events, which are predicted to escalate in number and severity in future under the changing climatic conditions. Construction industry; which consists of supply chains running across various other industries, economies and regions, will also be affected due to these events. Thus, it is important that the construction organisations are well prepared to withstand the effects of extreme weather events not only directly affecting their organizations but also affecting their supply chains which in turn might affect the organisation concerned. Given the fact that more than 99% of construction sector businesses are SMEs, the area can benefit significantly from policy making to improve SME resilience and coping capacity. This paper presents the literature review and synthesis of a doctoral research study undertaken to address the issue of extreme weather resilience of construction sector SMEs and their supply chains. The main contribution of the paper to both academia and practitioners is a synthesis model that conceptualises the factors that enhances resilience of SMEs and their supply chains against extreme weather events. This synthesis model forms the basis of a decision making framework that will enable SMEs to both reduce their vulnerability and enhance their coping capacity against extreme weather. The value of this paper is further extended by the overall research design that is set forth as the way forward.\n\n\nSantruka\n\n\nGana daug mokslininku jau sutinka, kad klimato kaitos gresme yra reali, taigi pripažista, kaip pasauliniame kontekste svarbu diegti prisitaikymo priemones. Tiketina, kad Jungtineje Karalysteje fizinis klimato kaitos poveikis bus tiesiogiai jaučiamas per ekstremalius meteorologinius reiškinius. Prognozuojama, kad kintant klimato salygoms ju skaičius ir intensyvumas ateityje dides. Tokie reiškiniai paveiks ir statybu pramone, kuria sudaro per kitas ivairiausias pramones šakas, ūkius ir regionus einančios tiekimo grandines. Taigi svarbu, kad statybu organizacijos būtu tinkamai pasiruošusios atlaikyti ekstremalius meteorologinius reiškinius, kurie daro tiesiogine itaka ne tik šioms organizacijoms, bet ir ju tiekimo grandinems, kurios savo ruožtu gali paveikti atitinkama organizacija. Daugiau kaip 99 proc. statybu sektoriuje veikiančiu imoniu priklauso SVV kategorijai, tad šiai sričiai išties praverstu politika, gerinanti SVV atsparuma ir gebejima susitvarkyti. Šiame darbe pateikiama literatūros apžvalga ir trumpai pristatomas daktaro disertacijos tyrimas, kuriuo siekta išnagrineti statybu sektoriaus SVV ir ju tiekimo grandiniu atsparuma ekstremaliems meteorologiniams reiškiniams. Pagrindinis darbo indelis, pravartus ir mokslininkams, ir praktikams, tai sintezes modelis, kuriame suformuluojami veiksniai, didinantys SVV ir ju tiekimo grandiniu atsparuma ekstremaliems meteorologiniams reiškiniams. Šis sintezes modelis yra sprendimu priemimo sistemos pagrindas, o sistema SVV leis ne tik mažinti pažeidžiamuma, bet ir didinti gebejima susitvarkyti esant ekstremaliems meteorologiniams reiškiniams. Šio darbo verte dar labiau padidina bendras tyrimo modelis, pateikiamas kaip žingsnis pirmyn.</jats:p>",

By taking an independent metro vehicle duct as research object in this paper, supply air through air duct is simulated and compared with the actual test results from the angle of supply air velocity at each outlet and supply air volume through several outlets of air duct. The results show that the relative deviation of simulation and test value of air velocity at most of the outlets are within or near ±20%, which is acceptable for the engineering applications. Moreover, the ratio of supply air volume through several outlets to the corresponding total supply air volume through main air duct or flat duct in the case of simulation is consistent with that in the case of experiment. It can be concluded that numerical simulation method is effective and reliable in air duct optimization design of metro vehicle.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider an assemble-to-order system where one of the components faces uncertainty in the supply process in which the actual available quantity is equal to some random fraction of the production quantity. Demand is assumed to be price-dependent. We analyze how the supply uncertainty of one component affects the product pricing and production quantities of all the components under the assembly structure. We show that it is profitable for the firm to assemble the product only if the product price exceeds a certain threshold. This price threshold increases as the unit cost of each component or the degree of variability of the supply reliability distribution increases, but it is independent of the underlying demand function and demand distribution. Also, the optimal product price decreases as supply uncertainty decreases. We further show that under deterministic demand, the components can be managed independently such that the production quantity or unit cost of the component with supply uncertainty does not affect the optimal production quantity of the other components, as long as it is profitable to assemble the product. However, when demand is stochastic, the optimal production quantity of each component depends on the supply reliability distribution as well as the unit costs of the other components. For a fixed product price, the optimal production quantities of the components are smaller when the unit product price is low, and they are higher when the unit product price is high as compared to the case with no supply uncertainty. </jats:p>",

The paper explores the methodologies that have been employed by the PVD. Results overtime show that the PVD has improved the SCM system especially in the areas of quality and delivery services, other services and as well as cutting costs that manufacturers had to face due to problems that arose in the shortcomings of the supply services. The PVD has managed to promote the Localization Programme and has also been able to establish qualified vendors. Findings also establish that the PVD team is the key to the success for development of the PVD programme.

When a contamination is detected, further investigations are necessary to confirm or to cancel the initial alarm. The proficiency of a non-target screening approach with solid phase extraction and GCMS in full-scan mode was examined. A selection of pesticides and industry chemicals was used for proficiency testing in extracts of raw and drinking water from Lake Constance. All total ion chromatograms (TIC) of extracted water samples showed a significant chemical background that have an adverse effect on compound identification. The TIC was evaluated with a two-dimensional search algorithm considering mass spectra similarity and retention index for identification, which was used an additional identification criteria to increase the confidence in identification. At a spiking level of 0.50 μg/l, up to 70% of the pollutants were unambiguously assignable. The sample pre-treatment was kept as simple as possible to reduce analysing time. A solid-phase extraction with extraction disks at flow rates up to 100 ml/min without any precedent filtration step reduces the sample pre-treatment time for a 1 l-sample below one hour. The recovery rates for most of the examined pollutants were above 60%.</jats:p>",

We show that with common pricing schemes, such as wholesale price or two-part tariffs, downstream firms under Cournot competition overinvest in demand forecasting. Analyzing the determinants of overinvestment, we demonstrate that under wholesale price contracts and two-part tariffs, total demand forecast investment can be very significant, and as a result, the supply chain can suffer substantial losses. We show that an increased number of competing retailers and uncertainty in consumer demand tend to increase inefficiency, whereas increased consumer market size and demand forecast costs reduce the loss in supply chain surplus. We identify the causes of inefficiency, and to coordinate the channel with forecast investments, we explore contracts in the general class of market-based contracts used in practice. When retailers' forecast investments are not observable, such a contract that employs an index-price can fully coordinate the supply chain. When forecast investments are observable to others, however, the retailers engage in an “arms race” for forecast investment, which can result in a significant increase in overinvestment and reduction in supply chain surplus. Furthermore, in that case, simple market-based contracts cannot coordinate the supply chain. To solve this problem, we propose a uniform-price divisible-good auction-based contracting scheme, which can achieve full coordination when forecast investments are observable. We also demonstrate the desirable properties for implementability of our proposed coordinating contracting schemes, including incentive-compatible and reliable demand forecast information revelation by the retailers, and being regret-free.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study develops a mathematical inventory model for deteriorating item taking into account a vertical integration of a three-echelon supply chain (one supplier, one distributor, and one retailer) through strategic alliances. The objective is to minimize the joint total relevant cost for the integrated inventory model. A simple but efficient heuristic technique is used to derive the optimal solution. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis on the optimal results are presented to validate the results of the proposed integrated model. The proposed mathematical model has demonstrated how an integrated approach to decision making can achieve a global optimum and outperform three typically individual models (i.e., independent model, dominant supplier's model and dominant retailer's model). </jats:p>",

Here, when cells of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana were transferred from P-replete medium to P-free medium, the phospholipid content of the cells rapidly declined within 48 h from 45±0.9 to 21±4.5% of the total membrane lipids; the difference was made up by non-phosphorus lipids. Conversely, when P-limited T. pseudonana were resupplied with P, cells reduced the percentage of their total membrane lipids contributed by a non-phosphorus lipid from 43±1.5 to 7.3±0.9% within 24 h, whereas the contribution by phospholipids rose from 2.2±0.1 to 44±3%. This dynamic phospholipid reservoir contained sufficient P to synthesize multiple haploid genomes, suggesting that phospholipid turnover could be an important P source for cells. Field observations of phytoplankton lipid content may thus reflect short-term changes in P supply and cellular physiology, rather than simply long-term adjustment to the environment.</jats:p>",

These samples showed a wide range of HAA5FP levels (20 to 443 μg L−1). Four pre-oxidation methods were evaluated for their performance in enhancing HAA5FP removal from six water samples by coagulation. Pre-Cl2 and pre-KMnO4 were not effective. While pre-ClO2 showed some enhancing effects for all samples, pre-O3 exhibited markedly higher effects without producing perceptible oxidation by-products such as bromate and formaldehyde. An enhancement factor (EF) value of 13–17% was achieved at an ozone dose of 0.5 mg L−1 and the maximum EF values were 16–25% at an ozone dose of 1.5–2.0 mg O3 L−1 (0.3–0.7 mg O3/mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC)). A 3D contour plot was applied to interpret the effects of two independent variables (DOC and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254)) on the formation potential of HAA5 using a quadratic smoothing technique, and it was found that the enhancing effect on the removal of HAA5FP by pre-ozonation was attributed to the destruction of reactive sites of organic compound, which could be expressed by the changes of SUVA254.</jats:p>",

This study identifies factors that encourage private landowners to permit public access to their land for recreational purposes and determines how much acreage would be offered in the SCA region. The Tobit and Heckman's sample selection models suggest that the probability of offering land to the public is correlated with the number of acres offered. Having acreage suited for recreation is a positive determinant of acres leased, but attributes developed by the landowner act as a disincentive. Type of recreational activity has no effect on the landowner's decision, and the supply of recreational acreage is inelastic with respect to price.</jats:p>",

An optimized management considering and weighing up the various demands on raw water reservoirs (long-term storage for drinking water supply, flood control, ecological state of the rivers downstream, energy production, nature conservation and recreational uses) against each other is therefore very difficult. Thus, an optimal reservoir management has to take into account scenarios of possibly occurring external influences and to permit predictions of prospective raw water qualities, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of short and long term changes in raw water quality on subordinate processes should be considered. This approach was followed in the work presented here, as there currently is no tool available to predict and evaluate the impacts of raw water reservoir management strategies integratively. The strategy supported by the newly developed decision support procedure takes into account all aspects from water quality, flood control and drinking water treatment to environmental quality downstream the reservoir. Furthermore, possible extreme events or changes of boundary conditions (e.g. climate change) can be considered.</jats:p>",

Supplier selection is an important step in the supply chain design. In many existing decision models for supplier selection, only quantitative criteria are considered. However, supplier selection is a multi-objective problem containing quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Hence, this paper attempts to demonstrate the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to overcome the above-mentioned problem. From an extensive analysis of the results, it is evident that selection of an appropriate supplier would result in improving effectiveness of supply chain. </jats:p>",

The migration of tubificid, especially drift migration in the source water is the main cause of worm pollution in drinking water plant. Migration modes and correlative factors of Tubifex tubifex, dominating the tubificid frequently, were investigated to help drinking water plant to solve worm pollution. Migration modes were divided into superficial, deep and drift migrations, representing migrations occurring in surface sediment (0–2 cm), deep sediment (deeper than 2 cm) and from sediment to overlying water, respectively. The results showed that both temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) affect the worm migration modes. The maximum drift efficiency occurred at 22°C while DO was controlled around 8 mg O2 l−1. When the temperature was fixed at 20°C, maximum drift efficiency was observed at 2 mg O2 l−1. Distinct increase of superficial migration and decrease of deep migration were observed at 28°C compared to 16 and 22°C. Low DO appeared to be the main reason for the increase of worm’s deep migration. The results confirmed that worm drift from sediment to overlying water, which was influenced by the temperature and DO content, was the main cause of worm pollution in the drinking water plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health workforce researchers routinely conduct studies to determine whether a profession is currently in short supply and whether future shortages are likely. This is particularly important for registered nursing since the profession has experienced periodic shortages over the past three decades. Registered nurse (RN) forecast studies can be valuable in quantifying supply and demand gaps and identifying the most appropriate strategies to avert future shortages. In order to quantify RN supply/demand gaps, it is important to have accurate data on RNs, including the number of active RNs as well as their demographic, education, and practice characteristics, and work location(s). A lack of relevant and timely data on the nursing workforce is a significant barrier to identifying where nursing shortages exist, where they are most severe, and determining the factors that contribute to them. This lack of understanding impedes the development of effective health workforce programs and policies to mitigate shortages and the ability to evaluate these programs and policies for effectiveness. This study describes the national data sources available to nursing researchers to study the supply and distribution of the RN workforce and assesses the sources' strengths and limitations. This study also explores the potential for using state-level data for nursing workforce research. </jats:p>",

Eight cows (453 ± 75.8 kg) yielding 14 kg milk/day were allotted to a factorial design, with two manners of cactus processing (knife-chopped or forage machine) and two diet supplies (separate concentrate or total mixed ration). Intakes of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber and total digestible nutrients were lower when cactus was knife-chopped. Digestibility, milk production and fat and protein yield did not change according to the manner diet was supplied neither by forage cactus processing. Average milk production was 14.8 kg/day for knife-chopped cactus and 14.6 kg/day for cactus chopped in forage machine and 14.8 kg/day when cactus was given in separate concentrate and 14.5 kg/day when it was given in total mixed ration. However, fat content was lower (36 g/kg) for knife-chopped cactus fed cows. Purine derivatives and concentrations of N-ureic were not influenced by the manner in which diet was supplied neither by the forage cactus processing. Means observed for efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (98.9 g/kg TDN), PUN concentrations (21.3 mg/dL) and MUN (18.2 mg/dL) were similar for cactus processing and for the manner in which diet was supplied. Forage-machine cactus processing improves dry matter intake and total mixed ration supply avoids selectivity.</jats:p>",

The model for emerging pathogen risk included separate modules to calculate the frequency and severity of infections from transfusion‐transmitted agents that could cause either acute transient or chronic persistent infection. Important model input variables were annual number of components transfused, the presumed incidence and prevalence of a new agent, the time interval of recipient risk, recipient age and sex, projected recipient survival, rate of secondary infection, pathogen‐induced morbidity, and the associated medical costs of such morbidity.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> In the 5‐year time frame considered in the model, it was estimated that approximately 3500 recipient infections (two‐SD range of 0 to 11,370 infections) could occur from an emerging pathogen that establishes a chronic infection in donors, with 60% of these due to red blood cell transfusion. The medical costs associated with recipient outcomes due to a catastrophic emerging pathogen could be lowered by 20% if an effective pathogen reduction method for either platelets or plasma were in place.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> This modeling exercise offers a framework for other blood services to construct similar models. It also provides a useful way to model the implementation of new blood safety interventions (e.g., pathogen reduction) on emerging pathogen risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> Several methods are employed by the timber industry to try to restrict the flow of products from illegal or unsustainable sources into timber supply chains. The most commonly applied are systems of log marking and associated documentation that accompany the logs. However this system is open to falsification, particularly between the logging concession and the timber mill, where the majority of illegally logged timber enters the supply chain. This paper describes the development of a methodology to track a unique genetic fingerprint for single logs of merbau, Intsia palembanica (Leguminosae), a high-value Indonesian timber species, from logging concession to the mill, where the DNA profile of individual logs is difficult or impossible to falsify. We find that whilst the ability to extract DNA and amplify a PCR product from logs decreases slightly between forest concession (59.2%) and mill (41.9%) samples, that overall enough samples worked across the 14 microsatellite markers to provide an exact genotype match between forest and sawmill samples for 27 out of 32 logs. Furthermore for these 27 samples, the probability that an illegal log with an exact genotype match to forest samples had been substituted was very low (less than 10-5) for 18 samples, was low (between 10<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and 10<jats:sup>-4</jats:sup>) for 7 samples and was moderate (10<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) for 2 samples. Improvements to DNA extraction and amplification success are recommended to improve this protocol, and there was a negative correlation between locus size and amplification success but a positive correlation with allele number. However, overall we propose that this methodology is now suitable for broad-scale industry application to track legally harvested timber and check for illegal substitutions along supply chains.</jats:p>",

Dissolved Si (DSi) consumption was clearly boosted as a result of iron addition. We estimate an apparent Si isotopic fractionation factor of 21.36% ± 0.11%, not significantly different from estimates based on in vitro incubations under Fe‐replete conditions and in agreement with previous SO studies under Fe‐depleted conditions. The temporal variations of the δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si<jats:sub>Si</jats:sub> are best reconstructed considering the fertilized surface waters as an open system, i.e., DSi is continuously supplied from the winter water. Using vertical diffusivity, we estimate a supply of 6.7 ± 1.2 mmol Si m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> representing 30% ± 5% of total DSi demand. We estimate biogenic silica (BSi) production at 22.1 ± 1.8 mmol Si m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, similar to BSi production under natural conditions in the SO. The DSi use preceding the start of the fertilization was conservatively estimated at 49% ± 4%, and as a result of the Fe‐fertilization, a further 31% ± 4% of the initial DSi reservoir was consumed. The BSi export was estimated to be 17.4 ± 1.7 mmol Si m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Our results suggest that for this study three main processes were acting significantly on δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si<jats:sub>Si</jats:sub> signatures, biological uptake, Si supply from subsurface, and export of BSi, and that the magnitude of production and export in such a Fe‐fertilized experiment are similar to those for natural diatom blooms occurring in the Southern Ocean.</jats:p>",

An oxidation zone is created around the tube well where Fe(II) is oxidised. The freshly formed iron hydroxide surfaces provide new sorption sites for soluble Fe(II) and arsenic. The system's efficiency is determined based on the ratio between abstracted volume with reduced iron/arsenic concentrations (V) and the injected volume (Vi). In the field study presented in this paper, the small-scale application of this technology was investigated in rural Bangladesh. It was found that at small injection volumes (&amp;lt;1 m3) iron removal was successful and became more effective with every successive cycle. For arsenic, however, the system did not prove to be very effective yet. Arsenic retardation was only limited and breakthrough of 10 μg/L (WHO guideline) was observed before V/Vi=1, which corresponds to arrival of groundwater at the well. Possible explanations for insufficient arsenic adsorption are the short contact times within the oxidation zone, and the presence of competing anions, like phosphate.</jats:p>",

Results from this study have shown that some members of these root-expressed MADS box genes have different responses in the shoot and root to N treatments, whereas others have similar responses or no responses to the N treatments. Among these 12 root-expressed MADS box genes, AGL16 was the only gene to show a similar response to N fluctuation in both shoots and roots in the same way as ANR1. Results from this study have also shown that ANR1, AGL12, AGL16, AGL19, and SOC1 responded to changes of the complete nutrient condition, which might indicate that they could play key roles in general nutrient stress. These novel findings will help us to further characterize these 12 MADS box genes to uncover the complex regulatory networks that integrate plant responses to changes in nutrient availability. </jats:p>",

Five of the 10 lambs were fitted with a rumen catheter and duodenal cannulae. Treatments included no supplement (control); 7 g/kg LW daily of cassava meal (<jats:italic>Manihot esculenta</jats:italic>, high-starch low-nitrogen (HS-LN)), cassava meal plus corn gluten meal (2:1, high-starch high-undegradable N (HS-UN)), cassava meal plus calcium caseinate (2·8:1, high-starch high-degradable N (HS-DN)) or corn gluten feed (low-starch high-degradable N (LS-DN)). Total intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and N, as well as digestible OM intake were increased with HS-UN, HS-DN and LS-DN (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>⩽0·050). Forage DM intake was reduced by HS-LN (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·030). Apparent digestibility of DM and OM was increased by HS-LN and HS-DN (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>⩽0·038). Digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and OM true digestibility were similar for all treatments. Supplementation with HS-LN decreased duodenal flux of total N, amino acid N, ammonia N and feed residual N (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>⩽0·023). None of the supplements affected rumen microbial protein entering the small intestine, whereas the efficiency of rumen microbial protein synthesis (EMPS) was reduced by HS-LN and HS-DN (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>⩽0·036). Ruminal degradability of dietary N (RDN) was increased by HS-LN, HS-DN and LS-DN (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>⩽0·050). In conclusion, supplementing lambs fed ryegrass with degradable or undegradable high-protein concentrate increased the amino acid supply without affecting the supply of digestible energy, regardless of either the starch content or the degree of ruminal degradability of the protein source. These results indicate that supplementation of ryegrass-based diets should include both starch and protein sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aimed to verify the qualification of Subsistence Section’s suppliers of Salvador Air Force Base, in 2009, selected by public bidding in the trading mode, to construct a reliable supply chain. Exploratory research was conducted through literature review and showed that the old supplier/customer relationship, based on only one part’s profit, needs to be revised, because it´s against a reliable and long-termed relationship, as Martin Christopher purposed. The documental analysis aimed to verify characteristics of the suppliers’ selecting process and revealed that the lowest price, as a criterion for choosing suppliers, recommended by the mode session, must be confronted with the companies’ capability to add value to the product. A questionnaire, purposed by Edelvino Razzolini Filho, was applied to the suppliers, in order to evaluate the their performance, with emphasis on logistics.The results showed that 62.5% of companies reported dismal performance. Thus, data analysis revealed that the selected suppliers’ performance had been classified as a business risk, and that the bidding process based on the lowest price is ineffective to qualify the suppliers.</jats:p>"
