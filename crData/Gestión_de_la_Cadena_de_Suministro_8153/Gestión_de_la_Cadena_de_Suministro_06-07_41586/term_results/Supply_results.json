Current methodologies for analysing supply chains, such as the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model, are not sufficiently comprehensive, particularly when it comes to understanding the complex social and political factors that are an integral part of any supply chain. This paper aims to use a case study of a supply chain from the public utility industry sector in Australia to develop an integrated framework for analysing supply chains within a multi‐disciplinary and multi‐method research paradigm.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The case study supply chain was mapped with the SCOR modelling tool which provided insights into the physical characteristics and value points along the supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Analysis of the SCOR model map also helped identify 31 key “actors” in the chain, who were then interviewed in depth.

First, it shows the relationships between relevant variables from different disciplines (i.e. corporate governance, infrastructure, operations knowledge, social climate and innovation), and how they impact on performance. Second, the framework provides a way forward in synthesising multi‐disciplinary and multi‐method research into a coherent whole.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In response to the heightened regulatory environment, many organizations have initiated reviews of their conflict of interest policies and ethical codes of behavior in supply management. The goal of the current exploratory study is to determine the most common approaches used to promote compliance with ethical codes of conduct (specifically conflict of interest policies) in supply management. Questionnaires were administered to eight “typical” Fortune 500 companies. Current conflicts of interest policies were identified, in addition to spotlighting common approaches to enforcing ethical behavior, including multiple communication and reporting channels, formal procedures, effective sanctions against violators and regular training of employees in ethical policies. Survey results were used to generate a scoring system that compares the overall level of ethics management maturity based on profiles of the companies studied in the research.</jats:p>",

Despite the importance of supplier performance in new product development (NPD), most research has focused on supplier performance in operations. Few studies have focused on how product development practices of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) influence OEM evaluations of supplier performance. This paper posits a model of the relationships among three factions: OEM practices that involve suppliers in design, concurrent engineering practices of the OEM and OEM assessments of supplier performance. This model is tested and cross‐validated using a sample of 406 NPD projects in Germany and the United States. The findings suggest that NPD practices of OEMs influence their perceptions of suppliers' performance.</jats:p>",

This paper examines the variables likely to influence the outcomes of a two‐party negotiation in an experiment that reproduces some of the details encountered in real‐life negotiations. The study used two‐party negotiations to examine the effect of reservation prices, aspiration prices and competitive stance on the outcome of the negotiations. The study confirms the importance of reference points, and that negotiators may adjust their reference points during the negotiation. The results also suggest that the negotiator's bargaining stance has a significant influence on settlement price and may act as a moderator of the effect of reference points on settlement price. Finally, the analysis suggests that a negative bargaining zone does not necessarily lead to an impasse; however, it increases the risk of an impasse compared with a negotiation with a positive bargaining zone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To address the mountain pine beetle epidemic, the allowable annual cut (AAC) for the Prince George Timber Supply Area (TSA) has been increased by 5.7 million m3 to 14.944 million m3. Timber supply model forecasts supporting AAC uplift decisions show a significant mid-term timber supply falldown. Timber supply modelling undertaken for the Prince George TSA in support of the recent AAC decision has not incorporated mortality in stands less than 60 years old, has generally considered the shelf life of beetlekilled wood to be 5 years for use as dimension lumber and 5 additional years for use as products of reduced fibre quality, and has assumed that pine timber makes up at least 78% of the total harvest in the short term. Current research suggests that certain of these assumptions may be optimistic. Refinements to these important timber supply analysis assumptions may result in a mid-term timber supply falldown that is deeper and longer than originally forecast. If the current outbreak continues unabated, stands in which lodgepole pine represents over 70% of the volume will provide enough mature growth to satisfy the new AAC for a further 14 years. It may be that the current increased AAC will not be realized for this period of time because of economic and environmental reasons. Greater value may be gained by not harvesting pine-dominated stands that contain significant stand structure or advance regeneration. Retention of these stands could mitigate the negative effects to the environment, hydrology, and wildlife while increasing the volume available in the latter part of the mid-term. Barriers to forest licensees focussing harvest in these stands include current mill requirements, existing traditional operating areas, previously approved cutting permits, stumpage appraisal, accessibility, and other economic considerations.</jats:p>"

Responses from 284 Chinese manufacturing firms were used to test the study's hypotheses. Results revealed that the frequency, diversity and formality of Internet communication played an important role in determining the level of purchasing performance. Additionally, formality was critical to managing information flows over the Internet and preventing potential Internet information security risks. Further, results indicated that two factors, perceived Internet security risks and norms of Internet information sharing, significantly influenced Internet communication behaviors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Some of the world’s largest recent hydrocarbon discoveries are located beneath the waters of the Northern Caspian Sea, or offshore Kazakhstan. The Kashagan field alone is believed to contain in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil, and there are fields at containing billions of barrels at several other locations. The exploitation of these reserves is now moving from discovery and exploration phases towards production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Northern Caspian Sea is an unusual environment for offshore development. The water is generally extremely shallow; less than 10 m water depth in almost all locations and down to 1.5 m in several areas above the oil and gas reservoirs. While the Caspian has minimal tides, storm surges can lead to rapid depth changes of over 1 m in depth, up or down. For 3-5 months of the year, depending on location and on the severity of the winter, ice cover is present. Some of the ice is land fast, and the rest is more or less mobile. Large ridge and rubble fields build up, often becoming grounded. Two other challenges for operations are that the environment is sensitive, with important and endangered species. The oil is also associated with high concentrations of sour gas, whose high toxicity presents additional safety risks in the event of blowouts or other accidents.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>All the drilling and production platforms in the area are and will be gravity based. They range in (planned) size from several square kilometers with over 1000 persons on board to small wellhead installations that will normally be unmanned. The platforms must be supplied and supported by a large fleet of vessels including OSVs, tugs, barges, and other specialized vessels. The flagship of this fleet are the icebreaking supply vessels. This paper describes the genesis, design, construction, and entry into service of the largest of the vessels now in operation, the Ice Breaking Supply Vessel (IBSV) Tulpar, the Kazakh flying horse.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>BMT SHIP DESIGN Limited was approached in April 2001 by BUE to ascertain whether it was possible to design a shallow water icebreaker with a large deadweight capability and also meet with the requirements of transiting the canal system into the Caspian Sea. The vessel was to be delivered into the Caspian by November 2002 in time for the winter ice season.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After exploratory discussions with BUE, BMTSD entered into an agreement to jointly support each other in the development of a suitable vessel design, later to be designated SWIMSS, (Shallow Water Ice Management Standby Supply) and then present this design to AGIP as a viable solution to their requirements. The design was to be based upon design study information supplied by BMT Fleet Technology Limited and was a development of a river icebreaker concept.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Agip KCO’s program for the design, build and delivery of the vessel in what was effectively a fourteen-month timeframe was ambitious to say the least at the outset, it was further complicated by the requirements changing twice in the design phase and the contact award being correspondingly delayed. How these challenges were met is set out below.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The consumption of birds in late medieval England is often summed up by reference to one event: the enthronement feast for Archbishop Neville in 1465, which, it was said, included 400 pigeons, 2,000 chickens, 204 cranes, 104 pea- cocks, 1,200 quails, 400 swans, 400 herons, 100 capons, 400 plovers, 4,000 mallards and teals, 204 bitterns, 200 pheasants, 500 partridges, 400 woodcocks, 100 curlews, and 100 egrets. But while this conveys a sense of the munificence of this occasion and the status and availability of birds in the mid-fifteenth century, it tells us little about their wider role in the medieval world. This chapter explores the documentary evidence for the consumption and supply of birds in England between the twelfth century and the sixteenth, as a complement to the archaeological evidence discussed in Chapter 9. It suggests that birds did play a significant part in lordly diet, albeit usually on a more modest scale, but also that they represent one of the best-documented aspects of peasant economic behaviour and provide tangible evidence of changing patterns of consumption following the Black Death—and in this the historical sources fill one of the most significant gaps in the archaeological record.</jats:p>",

The influences of ozone dosage, retention time and bicarbonate concentration on the NOM degradation rate were studied. The change of molecular weight distribution of NOM caused by ozone-enhanced photocatalysis was analysed, as well as the degradation rate of NOM with different molecular weight (MW). It was shown that ozone-enhanced photocatalysis was much better for NOM degradation than sole ozonation or photocatalysis. Increase of both ozone dosage and retention time could effectively increase the TOC removal rate, while biodegradability could be improved solely by an increase in ozone dosage. The existence of bicarbonate significantly reduced the photocatalytic degradation rate of NOM; however, its impact was effectively offset by the addition of ozone into the photocatalytic process. Macromolecular NOM was transformed into smaller molecules, and the larger NOM was mineralized by ozone-enhanced photocatalysis much faster than the smaller NOM.</jats:p>",

There has been a huge increase in the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Iraq and Afghanistan. The deployment of US troops to these countries and published case reports of transmission to soldiers in endemic areas, by transfusion to infants with immature immune systems, and to individuals immunocompromised by disease or immunosuppressive therapy beckon a reexamination of blood donor deferral procedures. The length of the ongoing military conflict and the nature of exposure indicate that prior decisions regarding blood donor deferral made during the first Gulf War may no longer apply. Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom present a much greater <jats:italic>Leishmania</jats:italic> threat than did Operation Desert Storm. Because most transmission by transfusion occurs in endemic areas, and visceral infection is asymptomatic in healthy individuals such as blood donors, it is difficult to determine the absolute risk of transmission by transfusion, but review of the literature provides many clues as to the appropriate measures to be taken for blood donor deferral.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hexagonal mesoporous silicates (HMSs) are synthetic silicate materials that have uniform mesopores, comparatively large surface areas, and uniform surface functional groups, which lead to higher adsorption selectivity. Selective adsorption characteristics of HMSs for six types of organic pollutants (2,4-d, mecoprop, 4-chlorophenol, toluene, dichloroacetic acid, and thioflavin T) from synthetic wastewater were investigated. Five different types of HMSs were synthesized by surfactant-templating methods, and three of them were subsequently grafted with organic surface functional groups, i,e. n-octyldimethyl-, 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-, and 3-mercaptopropyl-groups. Titanium-substituted HMS was also made in the same way as pristine HMS. Increasing hydrophobicity of HMSs did not always enhance adsorption of hydrophobic adsorbates, such as toluene. Grafted organic functional groups changed surface charge, which enhanced electrostatic force between HMSs and ionic pollutants. Negatively charged contaminants, i.e. 2,4-d, mecoprop and dichloroacetic acid, were more readily adsorbed on positively charged AM-HMS by electrostatic interaction. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates, as well as combination of these forces, also enhanced the adsorption capacities of HMSs. In addition to the electrostatic interaction, a cationic dye, thioflavin T, was adsorbed on the surfaces due to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction for hydrophilic surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively.</jats:p>",

In the presence of calcium, algae flocculation after permanganate preoxidation was appreciably increased due to Ca2 +  functioning as a bridging agent between MnO2 and EOM.

Samples were taken from microcosms and groundwater of two tetra- and trichloroethene-contaminated sites differing significantly in their pollutant profiles. At the Killisfeld site, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, vinyl chloride and ethene are detected in the plume indicating complete reductive dechlorination. At the Frankenthal site, cis-1,2-dichloroethene is predominating and ethene is not detected. The sensitivity of Dehalococcoides detection by 16S-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in groundwater was increased by optimizing the DNA-extraction and the protocols for direct and nested PCR. Direct PCR made the visualization of Dehalococcoides growth during complete degradation of tetrachloroethene in microcosms possible. With nested PCR Dehalococcoides were detected in all seven groundwater samples taken in the plume from the Killisfeld site, but not in any of eleven samples taken at the Frankenthal site. Thus, 16S-PCR detection of Dehalococcoides represents a quick and easy means to assess the potential of complete reductive dechlorination in microcosms and field samples.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the discrepancy in production lead‐times among suppliers furnishes a firm with a valuable option to defer ordering decisions until uncertainty has been partially resolved. The suppliers also have an option: to defer their pricing decisions. Using a single‐period, multi‐stage model of a two‐echelon supply chain with competing risky suppliers and a single manufacturer, this paper investigates how the supplier default risk and default co‐dependence affect manufacturer procurement and production decisions, supplier pricing decisions, firms profits, and the deferment option value and how the introduction of the deferment option alters supplier competition. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using simulation based analysis the variance of demand is performed for a three stage reverse supply chain, consisting of single supplier of waste paper, godown owner and waste paper merchant. Two inventory control policies (min‐max and stock‐to‐demand) are used for the analysis.

Repeated regeneration of ion exchange resin with a sodium chloride solution (brine) did not alter the resin performances with respect to the fresh one. Besides, neither the sodium chloride concentration of the brine, which was varied between 1 and 3 M, nor the presence of sulphates at concentrations up to 20 g/L in the brine, did notably affect the regeneration efficiency. The brine was effectively treated by adding calcium or barium chloride, in order to remove the sulphates and re-establish the original chloride concentration. Calcium chloride was allowed to obtain up to 70% sulphate precipitation, whereas an almost 100% precipitation efficiency was obtained when barium chloride was used. The precipitation step was described by a model based on the mass action, coupled to the Bromley model for the description of the non-ideal behaviour of the electrolytic solution. This model was shown to give correct, or at least conservative, estimates of the equilibrium sulphate concentration when either calcium or barium chloride was used as precipitating agent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the rural Terai region of Nepal, many tubewell drinking water sources are microbially and/or arsenic contaminated and consequently, millions lack access to “safe” water. Those who drink contaminated water may suffer from preventable water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, stunting, skin lesions, and cancer. To combat this problem, a team comprising researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), together with two local partners, Environment &amp; Public Health Organization (ENPHO), and Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Support Programme (RWSSSP), have developed an award-winning household water filter, the Kanchan™ Arsenic Filter (KAF), for simultaneous arsenic and pathogen removal. The KAF is constructed using locally available labour and materials and is optimised based on the local socio-economic conditions. The first part of this paper explains the technology development process and the technical details of this innovation. The second part of this paper describes the dissemination activities since 2004. This dissemination model not only built capacity in local people towards long-term, user-participatory safe water provision, but also made a contribution to the local economy. As of January 2006, over 25,000 people have gained access to safe water as a result of the implementation of the KAF.</jats:p>",

As supply chains are ultimately a human activity, a multidisciplinary approach must include human‐centric investigation and knowledge‐sharing techniques. Systems engineering is seen as a proper foundation for defining a process for which the characteristics are unknown and for solving the problems found in cross‐organizational supply chains. Building on (Haskins 2003, 2004), Christopher Alexander's pattern language approaches are considered as a mechanism for sharing best practices.

Besides focusing on process-specific market power distributions, the impact of relationship stability and process connectivity is analyzed as determinants of the diffusion of communication standards within different supply network topologies. In this context, two real-world scenarios from the automotive and paper/publishing industries are used as examples for different network topologies. The results support the thesis that increasing relationship dynamics and process connectivity lead to decreasing competition of communication standards. In certain circumstances, local communication clusters appear along the value chain, enabling these clusters to preserve their globally inferior standardization decision.</p>",

The manufacturer incurs inventory risk when purchasing too many contracts and spot price risk when buying too few. We quantify these risks for a single selling period by studying the profit mean and variance for a given portfolio of option contracts. We characterize the set of efficient portfolios that the manufacturer must hold in order to obtain dominating mean‐variance pairs. Among these, we emphasize the maximum expectation portfolio, obtained by solving the classical newsvendor problem, and the corresponding minimum variance portfolio. We show that the upper‐level sets of a mean‐variance utility function are connected. Hence, a greedy method will find the portfolios on the efficient frontier. Finally, we provide a comparison with standard hedging strategies and show that the approximation associated with financial hedging can be relatively inaccurate. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Considering the disadvantages of known carbon sources, this paper provided slow-release organic carbon-source (SOC) technique to solve the problem and the results showed that SOC materials showed good performance during simulated groundwater denitrification. Structure analysis suggested that hydroxy chemical bond existed between PVA and starch in SOC and surface configuration changed with materials dissolving into water. After seven days of domestication, with 40–50 mg/L initial NO3-N, denitrification efficiency increased from 80.6% to 90.7% and the real COD consumption per N-NO3 reduction was 1.82–3.73 with 2.79 as average.

When bubble size was similar to particle size (10–50 μm), the maximum removal efficiency was 92% in a Kaolin solution of 10−3 M Al3 +  without pre-treatment for flocculation process, and, as time passed, the floc size was observed to increase at a pH of 8, which was the condition of high removal efficiency as seen through image analysis. When the air-saturated water was spouted into the reactor, the size of particle at p.z.c. (point of zero charge) seemed to increase to form a floc due to collision effects caused by turbulent flow. Consequently, floc formation by turbulent flow in the reactor seemed to positively affect removal efficiency.</jats:p>",

Catalytic ozonation with several metal oxides (synthetic α-FeOOH (FeOOH), γ-Al2O3 (Al2O3), CeO2 and MgO) significantly reduced THMsFP of the water compared with ozonation alone. For the FeOOH catalyzed ozonation, several factors, including bromide concentration, pH, alkalinity, ozone dosage, and reaction time, were further studied for their effect on THMsFP of the water. The FeOOH/O3 showed a significant advantage over ozonation in controlling the THMsFP at the applied conditions of bromide (0–3.36 mg/L), pH (6.33–9.43), O3/DOC ratio (0.65–2.05 mg/mg), and reaction time (2–20 min). Increase of bicarbonate alkalinity weakened its advantage. The possible mechanism for the FeOOH/O3 in controlling the THMsFP can be ascribed to higher DOC removal rate and enhanced oxidation of some precursors.</jats:p>",

In the first period, the primary focus was on how to make operations throughout the supply chain more efficient. In the second period, the focus shifted from efficiency to effectiveness as leading firms began to incorporate the ideas and expertise of their suppliers and partners into the management of the supply chain. In the current period, some firms are beginning to explore how supply chains can be extended across industries in addition to operating efficiently and effectively within industries.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The individual Kfw of MIB and geosmin from CLSA/SPME method was 4.21 and 4.85, and resulted an order of magnitude greater than the Kfw obtained from direct SPME method. A detection limit of 10 ng/L of MIB and geosmin was achieved by GC-MS with CLSA/SPME with a polyacrylate phase.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The degradation of phenol (C6H5OH) was investigated under sonication, ozonation, and the combination of sonication and ozonation. The coupling of these two oxidation processes yielded phenol degradation kinetics that are similar to those predicted from the linear combination of the individual sonication and ozonation experiments. However, synergistic effects of sonolytic ozonation were observed for the reduction of the total organic carbon (TOC) in these systems. The rate of TOC decomposition was found to be proportional to both the aqueous steady-state ozone concentration and the ultrasonic power density. At 358 kHz, sonication combined with ozonation enhanced TOC loss rates by 43% over the sum of the rates obtained by the separate treatments. Intermediate species detected during the degradation of phenol indicate that while the primary degradation products are efficiently degraded by simple ozonolysis, the simultaneous addition of ultrasonic irradiation is necessary to degrade the more recalcitrant unsaturated daughter products.</jats:p>",

The backorder cost and inventory holding cost are calculated in each phase of simulation and summarized. The paper infers that the total inventory cost is optimum in phase II, in which reorder point is same as that calculated by mathematical model. In phase I, total inventory cost is more than that of phase II because of backorders. In phase III, excess inventory increased the total cost. Thus, the values obtained from mathematical model produce optimal inventory cost. Base stock model is effective when the demand is not deterministic and service factor assumed in mathematical model is 0.9, which is quite acceptable. Base stock model assumes replenishment order quantity as 1 and the total inventory cost decreases with replenishment lead time. Base stock model is beneficial for supply chains having short replenishment lead time.

In addition, the obtained results were correlated with the physicochemical properties of regenerated homo-ionic zeolites. A unifactorial experimental design, balanced with permanent effects, was applied to assess the removal of ammoniacal nitrogen with homo-ionic zeolites presenting 0–10 sodium regeneration cycles (Z0–Z10). The experimental conditions of trials were as follows: pH 7, contact time was 30 min, stirring speed was 100 rpm, in completely mixed batch reactors. Samples of natural zeolite (ZN without sodium homo-ionization) and homo-ionic zeolites (Z0–Z10) were used to determine their surface properties by using the BET-N2 method (surface area (m2/g), pore volume (cm3/g) and pore diameter (Å)). Other determined properties were the zeta potential (by micro-electrophoresis), percentage of elements (by the X-ray disperse spectrometric method) and particle morphology by scanning electronic microscopy. The results have shown that homo-ionic zeolites had a high removal capacity of ammoniacal nitrogen; this and other properties did not change in a significant way, even after a number of regeneration cycles as high as 10.</jats:p>",

The surface charge status, surface hydroxyl group status of γ-alumina, and pH values of the solution can be linked together. When the pH value of the solution was near the pHzpc of γ-Al2O3, there was observable activity in the catalysed ozonation process. Rct, which denoted the relative concentration of hydroxyl radical (·OH), was much higher in the catalysed ozonation process than in the ozonation process.

The 2001 Australian heroin shortage was used to assess the effects of a reduction in heroin supply on age of initiation into heroin injecting. Data collected from regular injecting drug users (IDU) over the period 1996–2004 as part of the Australian Illicit Drug Reporting System were examined for changes in self‐reported age of first heroin use after the onset of the heroin shortage. Estimates were also made of the number of young people who may not have commenced injecting heroin during the heroin shortage. The proportion of IDU interviewed in the IDRS who were aged ≤24 years decreased from 46% in 1996 to 12% in 2004, with the most marked drop in 2001, the year in which there was an abrupt and marked reduction in heroin availability. Of those who reported first injecting between 1993 and 2000, similar proportions reported heroin and amphetamine as the first drug injected. After 2000, methamphetamine was the drug most often reported as being the first injected. Estimates suggested that between 2745 and 10 560 young people may not have begun to inject heroin in 2001 as a result of reduced heroin supply. If around one in four of these young users had progressed to regular or dependent heroin use, then there may have been a reduction of between 700 and 2500 dependent heroin users. There was an increase in amphetamine injecting but it is unclear to what extent any reduction in heroin injecting has been offset by increased amphetamine injecting. Reduced heroin availability probably resulted in a reduction in the number of new heroin injectors in Australia. Efforts need to be made to reduce the chances that young people who have initiated methamphetamine injecting do not move to heroin injecting when the heroin supply returns.</jats:p>",

Taking into account both the results of the philological analysis of Pliny's text and the mineralogical assemblage of the sand, a new hypothesis regarding Roman glass‐making technology is proposed and tested here. The technology implies the production of ‘quartz‐enriched’ sand by means of selective grindings according to the different degrees of hardness and cleavage of the mineralogical phases. Melting experiments, carried out on treated sand and in the temperature range compatible with Roman technology, yielded a glass with composition similar to those of typical Roman glasses. Therefore, new perspectives on the sources of supply of raw materials, hitherto debated, are opened up.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Of the four main nerves traversing the arm, namely median, ulnar, radial and musculocutaneous, the ulnar and median nerve do not give any branches to muscles of the arm. Ulnar nerve after taking origin from medial cord of brachial plexus runs distally through axilla on medial side of axillary artery till middle of arm, where it pierces the medial intermuscular septum and enters the posterior compartment of arm. Ulnar nerve enters forearm between two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris from where it continues further. It supplies flexor carpi ulnaris , flexor digitorum profundus and several intrinsic muscles of hand . We recently observed dual supply of biceps muscle from ulnar and median nerves in arm. Musculocutaneous nerve was absent. Although communications between nerves in arm is rare, the communication between median nerve and musculocutaneous nerve were described from the 19th century which could explain innervation of biceps from median nerve. But no accurate description of ulnar nerve supplying biceps could be found in literature. Knowledge of anatomical variation of these nerves at level of upper arm is essential in light of the frequency with which surgery is performed to transfer nerve fascicles from ulnar nerve to biceps in case of brachial plexus injuries. We also observed third head of biceps, our aim is to describe the exact topography of this variation and to discuss its morphological.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to quantify the distribution of DEHP in liquid/solids (floating scum, suspended solids and settled sludge) after coagulation and flocculation processes with/without bubble. For this purpose, we developed a closed jar tester to prevent DEHP volatilization and contamination from the laboratory environment. According to DEHP adsorption results, the aluminium coagulant is an important factor for DEHP adsorption and the floating solid contained more DEHP than the settled solid. 60–72% of initial DEHP was found in solid under conditions with aluminium coagulant, whereas 3–5% of initial DEHP was found in solid under the condition without coagulant. When the bubble presented, DEHP concentration in the solids in the top and middle layers increased. The 55 minutes of operation time (coagulant, flocculation and settling processes) was not long enough to achieve the equilibrium of DEHP adsorption especially in the cases with coagulant.</jats:p>",

This work focused on the characterisation of the performances of commercially available powdered activated carbons (PAC). Equilibrium isotherms were carried out on pre-treated water, i.e. after coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. In order to determine the efficiency of the PAC, the DOM content was estimated through DOC and UV absorbance measures, as well as being characterised by size exclusion chromatography. The various experiments carried out showed some differences in the adsorption capacity, depending on their pore distribution and surface chemistry. The maximum removal ratio reached 82% and 45% for DOC and SUVA respectively. The isotherm equilibrium results can be used to define several kinds of DOC fractions, which were modelled by the Freundlich equation. Finally, the SEC chromatograms showed that the pore size distribution of the activated carbons affected significantly the compound size distribution of the removed DOM.</jats:p>",

The supply of primordial follicles in postnatal life should be depleted during folliculogenesis, either undergoing atresia or surviving to ovulation. Recent studies of mouse ovaries propose that intra- and extraovarian germline stem cells replenish oocytes and form new primordial follicles. We quantified all healthy follicles in C57BL/6 mouse ovaries from day 1 to 200 using unbiased stereological methods, immunolabelling of oocyte meiosis (germ cell nuclear antigen (GCNA)) and ovarian cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)) and electronmicroscopy. Day 1 ovaries contained 7924±1564 (<jats:sc>s.e.m.</jats:sc>) oocytes or primordial follicles, declining on day 7 to 1987±203, with 200–800 oocytes ejected from individual ovaries on that day and day 12. Discarded oocytes and those subjacent to the surface epithelium were GCNA-positive indicating their incomplete meiotic maturation. From day 7 to 100 mean numbers of primordial follicles per ovary were not significantly depleted but declined at 200 days to 254±71. Mean numbers of all healthy follicles per ovary were not significantly different from day 7 to 100 (range 2332±349–3007±322). Primordial follicle oocytes were PCNA-negative. Occasional unidentified cells were PCNA-positive with mitotic figures observed in the cortex of day 1 and 12 ovaries. Although we found no evidence for ovarian germline stem cells, our data support the hypothesis of postnatal follicle renewal in postnatal and adult ovaries of C57BL/6 mice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two critical decisions must be made daily when managing multiechelon repair and distribution systems for service parts: (1) allocating available repair capacity among different items and (2) allocating available inventories to field stocking locations to support service operations. In many such systems, procurement lead times for service parts are lengthy and variable, repair capacity is limited, and operational requirements change frequently—resulting in demand processes that are highly uncertain and nonstationary. As a consequence, it is common to have many items in short supply while others are abundant. In such environments, integrated real-time decision-support tools can provide significant value by reducing the impact of inventory imbalances and responding appropriately to the volatile nature of the demand processes. By “integrated” and “real-time,” we mean (respectively) tools that simultaneously consider key aspects of the current state of the operating environment in deciding what items to repair, where to ship available units, and by what mode to ship them. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, we develop an integrated real-time model for making repair and inventory allocation decisions in a two-echelon reparable service parts system. We formulate the decision problem as a finite-horizon, periodic-review mathematical program, we show it can be formulated as a large-scale linear program, and we develop a practical heuristic method for solving the problem approximately. By simulating the operation of a service parts supply chain, we demonstrate the value of employing integrated decision models over using separate repair and inventory allocation rules for a range of environments where inventory imbalances exist. We also show that our heuristic approach is highly effective and that its inventory allocation subroutine, used as a stand-alone tool for making distribution decisions, outperforms a commonly used inventory allocation rule in most circumstances tested. </jats:p>",

Radium isotope activities were measured along transects during two seasons at a site that lacked any obvious surficial water input. An onshore well and an offshore end member were also sampled. For all samples, nutrients and salinity data were collected. Radium isotope activities generally decreased with distance offshore and exhibited significant tidal variability, which is consistent with a shorederived tidally influenced source. Submarine groundwater contributes only 1–2% of the water along this coast, but this groundwater provides 8–46% of the nutrients. This saline groundwater is derived predominately from tidally pumped seawater percolating through the unconfined coastal aquifer and leaching radium and nutrients. This process represents a significant source of nutrients to the oligotrophic nearshore reef.</jats:p>",

These predictions agree closely with data from 65 central European lakes during summer stratification.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been postulated that unsuccessful resuscitation of victims of accidental hypothermia is caused by insufficient tissue oxygenation. The aim of this study was to test whether inadequate O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>supply and/or malfunctioning O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction occur during rewarming from deep/profound hypothermia of different duration. Three groups of rats ( n = 7 each) were used: group 1 served as normothermic control for 5 h; groups 2 and 3 were core cooled to 15°C, kept at 15°C for 1 and 5 h, respectively, and then rewarmed. In both hypothermic groups, cardiac output (CO) decreased spontaneously by &gt;50% in response to cooling. O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>consumption fell to less than one-third during cooling but recovered completely in both groups during rewarming. During hypothermia, circulating blood volume in both groups was reduced to approximately one-third of baseline, indicating that some vascular beds were critically perfused during hypothermia. CO recovered completely in animals rewarmed after 1 h ( group 2) but recovered to only 60% in those rewarmed after 5 h ( group 3), whereas blood volume increased to approximately three-fourths of baseline in both groups. Metabolic acidosis was observed only after 5 h of hypothermia (15°C). A significant increase in myocardial tissue heat shock protein 70 after rewarming in group 3, but not in group 2, indicates an association with the duration of hypothermia. Thus mechanisms facilitating O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>extraction function well during deep/profound hypothermia, and, despite low CO, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>supply was not a limiting factor for survival in the present experiments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We present the first assessment of willingness to pay (WTP) for water supply change to be conducted in the largest city in the developing world: Mexico City. Two large sample contingent valuation surveys are conducted to investigate WTP for two levels of water service quality: maintenance of or improvement over current provision levels. This study design permits one of the first tests of the “scope sensitivity” of WTP responses to different levels of baseline supply provision. This testing is complicated within the present case because as our study confirms, higher‐income households typically enjoy better levels of current provision, while poorer households generally endure lower current standards of water supply. We incorporate this heterogeneity of service and correlation with income within a suite of novel scope sensitivity tests. These confirm prior expectations that richer households enjoying higher baseline service levels would prefer programs to maintain the status quo, while poorer households enduring lower initial quality of service would prefer schemes which improve the quality of supplies. The implications of these findings are further investigated by contrasting conventional benefit‐cost analysis aggregation procedures with an equity weighting approach which confirms the difference in priorities according to initial supply conditions. In this case, the ranking of programs changes when the ability to pay is equalized across society. In fiscal terms, aggregate WTP figures show that authorities could collect the resources necessary to fund households' preferred schemes and simultaneously substantially reduce current subsidies.</jats:p>",

In the process, firms have started to incorporate new service providers in their commercial interactions with customers over the Internet. This paper studies conceptually and empirically why Internet commerce firms (ICFs) have established relationships with these providers. Focusing on logistics services in outbound distribution channels, we rely on transaction cost theory to reveal that low levels of asset specificity and uncertainty drive Internet commerce firms to establish these relationships. Moreover, we apply strategic network theory to show that Internet commerce firms seek these providers because they offer access to relationship networks that bundle many complementary logistics services. In addition, logistics service providers make these services available across new and existing relationships between the Internet commerce firms, their customers, and their vendors.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
