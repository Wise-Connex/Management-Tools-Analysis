The prime object of the work is to assess new materials as they are developed, either by industry or by themselves, and keep a check on the ultimate durability of all types of paint which may, as a matter of expediency, have had to be accepted on the basis of short‐term accelerated tests. Whilst the emphasis of the work may differ, therefore, from that of the paint manufacturer, the ultimate objective is the same and the principles which have governed the choice of the site and its operation will be of value to other workers in this field.</jats:p>",

With the end of the war in sight, the forecasters were faced with a programme that showed a reduction of something like 75 per cent in output to be achieved in the course of a few months.
