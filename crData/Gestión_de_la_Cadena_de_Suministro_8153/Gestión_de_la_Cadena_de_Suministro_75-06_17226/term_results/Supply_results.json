The cold air did not increase myocardial O2 consumption significantly, and the accompanying changes in systemic hemodynamic factors known to influence myocardial O2 consumption were minor. Coronary blood flow determined by the xenon clearance method did not change significantly. In 18 patients, cold air inhalation for 1 1/2 minutes caused no detectable constriction of coronary arteries visualized arteriographically. We conclude that angina pectoris induced by breathing cold air cannot be explained satisfactorily by a concurrent increase in myocardial work and O2 consumption. Although neither large coronary artery constriction nor generalized coronary arteriole constriction seem to be involved, some other specific effect of cold air inhalation on coronary vasomotion, perhaps affecting collaterals or coronary blood flow distribution, is suspected.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since adenosine is present in normal brain tissue and cerebrosipinal fluid and since it dilates the pial vessels, it is possible that adenosine, in addition to H-+, is also a mediator of the metabolic regulation of cerebral blood flow. Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained under various experimental conditions characterized by achange in brain oxygen supply. The brain was frozen in situ by means of a small bonerongeur precooled in liquid N2 and the tissue was processed for adenosine determination (nmol/g of tissue). Electrical stimulation of the cortex at 0, 15, 30, and 45 Hz yielded adenosine levels of 5.4 plus or minus 0.7, 10.5 plus or minus 1.7, 13.0 plusor minus 1.2, and 9.0 plus or minus 2.1 nmol/g. Arterial pressures of 87, 60, and 40mmHg gave adenosine levels of 7.5 plus or minus 0.76, 13 plus or minus 2.6, and 26.6plus or minus 3.3, respectively. Ventilation with 29.7, 20, 10.7, and5.5% O2 significantly increased the adenosine levels to 9.4 plus or minus 3.0, 6.4 plus or minus 1.2, 30.0 plus or minus 9.3, and 63.3 plus or minus 18.2 nmol/g, respectively. Hyperventilation significantly increased adenosine form 6.7 plus or minus 1.0 to 11.8 plus or minus 1.4 nmol/g. This increased adenosine level was reduced by additionof CO2 to the ventilating gas mixture. Lactate, the main H-+ donor, pyruvate, and cAMP changed in a fashion parallel to adenosine. However, cAMP showedonly a small increase in adenosine. These findings are in accordance with the concept that adenosine and H-+ may act synergistally to regulate cerebral blood flow and that endogenous adenosine may exert a small effect on cAMP formation. </jats:p>",

This paper incorporates the sequent peak method as the central feature in establishing a procedure for determining the sizes of several potential reservoirs located in a system of one or more rivers. Separate algorithms are developed for sites on parallel streams and for sites on the same stream. In both cases the approach is to find the combination of reservoirs which can satisfy a given constant monthly demand at a minimum total construction cost. It is shown that both problems can be cast in the form of a dynamic programming problem. A more complex system is then a combination of reservoirs in parallel and in series. An extension is given if the monthly demand is not constant but each reservoir satisfies a constant fraction of the monthly demand.</jats:p>",
