      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Focal companies have rationalized their supply bases. Besides the number of suppliers, this chapter considers other factors that may be considered in supply base rationalization such as how the suppliers may be connected in their own business relationships and how similar or dissimilar their culture and processes might be. The chapter also introduces emerging issues that affect supply base management, such as category management, cybersecurity, and startup suppliers. While we typically view suppliers in a supply base as first-tier suppliers, we also realize that a supply base may include tertiary-level suppliers that supply products to other suppliers. The idea of complexity is addressed. The chapter points out how the complexity of a system is captured in three things—number of elements, level of connectivity among the elements, and how similar or different these elements are from one another. The chapter considers managerial implications of supply base complexity and how different portions of a supply base may be viewed as a supplier ecosystem.</jats:p>",

To do that, they procure goods and services from their suppliers. These suppliers, as companies, do the same thing with their suppliers. When we line up all buying companies and supplying companies, we end up with a supply chain. Supply chains behave as a system of autonomous companies that exhibit systems-level dynamics. To bring a product to the market, many supply chains that include companies from different industries crisscross one another and form networks of companies we call supply networks. In other words, what we have in reality resembles a network more than a chain. In this regard, supply chains are a simplification of what actually happens. Supply networks are much closer to what is real.</jats:p>",

In the international and European market-based energy regime, what is the role of energy law in neutralizing supply disruptions? The legality of sudden interruptions of energy exports under international law was already a debated question when the Arab oil-producing countries interrupted their exports in 1973. In parallel, an important literature developed on whether and how governments should intervene with energy markets to contain the impact of supply shocks. Building on this literature, this chapter analyses the legality of supply disruptions under international law and examines attempts by energy exporters to obtain force majeure relief for their supply obligations. The analysis then centres on regulatory measures to ensure supply security in liberalized energy markets through storage requirements, coordinated energy purchases, price control, and demand reductions, using the solidarity measures implemented by the EU in 2022 as a core case study.</jats:p>",

However, the source of their problems may arise from deeper in their supply chains. This realization places importance on considering extended supply chains and necessitates a multi-tier supply chain perspective. At the functional level, a focal company may consider directly sourcing from important lower tier suppliers. As a focal company engages in directed sourcing, it is, in fact, making its supply chain. As such, we discuss supply chain make versus supply chain buy. We also consider how supply chains may be theorized using network concepts involving institutional theories, supply chain financing, and cyber security.</jats:p>",

European energy law, and the international energy regime that the EU helped to establish, has been based on the necessity of facilitating cross-border energy supplies. However, this liberalization regime also facilitated the expansion of Russian gas in Europe. Building on the literature on trade, geopolitics, and economic imperialism, this chapter examines how trade instruments can be used to secure dependence and geopolitical control. Since Soviet times, energy geopolitics has had a profound influence on energy contracts, facilitating the dependence of the former Soviet states and Europe on Russian gas.</jats:p>",

We also study, in a triad, how power can come from the structural position. One such position is the structural hole—a bridge that sits on the structural hole can be a tertius gaudens (the third that profits) or a tertius iungens (the third that channels). A new type of tertius is proposed, tertius adiuvans, the third that helps another node in the triad, albeit reluctantly. Triads can help explain supply chain disintermediation, embedded supplier performance, and services outsourcing.</jats:p>",

That is a dyad—two entities linked up in a relationship. Examining how suppliers are embedded in their extended ties, we discover the duality of buyer-supplier relationships; for instance, a deep buyer-supplier relationship offers stability but also poses rigidity. We consider another form of a dyad in supplier-supplier relationships. The relationship between suppliers matters because sometimes the buyer would want the suppliers to work together, as in a new product development project; other times, the buyer would not want the suppliers to even talk to each other, especially when they are bidding on the same contract. These relationships between suppliers, in general, operate in varying degrees of co-opetition involving cooperation and competition.</jats:p>",

The chapter characterizes the structural behavior of supply networks. The chapter then subjects the data to software to compute the network structural indexes both at the node level and network level. Building on the lessons learned from the network analysis, a new type of critical supplier whose importance comes from their structural position in the network is proposed. They are called nexus suppliers, and an algorithm is developed for the nexus supplier index. It is then discussed how supply network mapping should be considered as one anticipates more extreme events that will disrupt global supply networks in the coming years.</jats:p>",

Interactions between the complex adaptive system and the environment lead to co-evolution, and what comes out of the co-evolution can affect what happens in the environment and the complex adaptive system. Through such dynamic interactions, supply networks emerge over time with no single entity (i.e., a focal company) orchestrating its entire activities. A focal company makes a strategic decision as to how much of that supply network to control. Beyond the realm of control and visibility, things simply emerge for the companies in a supply network. We apply these concepts to theorize the behaviors of supply chains and how supply networks may operate more resiliently through a jury-rigging process. Computational studies are conducted using Wolfram’s cellular automata and Kauffman’s NK model.</jats:p>",

In specific, we look into this problem in two different yield risks: multiplicative and additive. One might intuit that if the retailer shares a manufacturer’s random yield risk with the manufacturer, the manufacturer will be better off. Interestingly, we confirm that this intuition is only valid in the additive yield risk but not necessarily in the multiplicative yield risk. Moreover, under dual sourcing, both manufacturers fiercely compete on their prices (i.e., Bertrand-like competition) to become the sole source in the additive yield risk, but the manufacturers do not compete as much in the multiplicative yield risk. Lastly, this paper shows that the supply chain inefficiency may decrease (increase) as risk-sharing increases in the additive risk model under dual sourcing (single sourcing) while it does not changeinthemultiplicativeriskmodel.\n\nKey words: supply risk, random yield, dual sourcing, game theory\nJEL Classification: L11, M11, M21</jats:p>"

The relevance of the research lies in Ukraine's desire for energy independence and energy efficiency of existing systems, modernization of energy supply systems, which are already outdated and have low efficiency and efficiency. Further ways of improving and optimizing the energy supply of civil engineering systems in Ukraine are being researched, and their feasibility is proven. It is concluded that understanding the importance of these issues will lead to energy independence and energy security of the country as a whole, as well as an increase in the volume of civil construction and energy renovation of civil buildings. Special attention is paid to RES, which are already used in Ukraine, are quite energy-efficient and preserve the environment, which increases the country's competitiveness in the world energy supply market, as well as the production of many goods and services that are relevant today. Leading experts in the field of civil engineering and energy consider the development of renewable energy sources (RES) as one of the most important ways to energy independence of Ukraine and the development of civil engineering systems, the needs of which are growing along with the construction of new consumer facilities. The further development of this work consists in the targeted monitoring of problematic links of the modern energy supply system and the implementation of the latest developments of domestic and foreign specialists, which are already available today and allow to significantly reduce the percentage of energy costs in all areas of energy supply stem of civil engineering.</jats:p>"

According to this aim, the water system was equipped with remote sensing (RS), networked sensors, advanced modems, and data loggers. The study showed how to control hydraulic parameters by the Internet of things and RS. The higher retention time led to the probability growth of rebar oxidation in concrete in the presence of chlorine and increased the possibility of water loss. This work also showed how to decrease the probability of water leakage in reservoirs. The computational fluid dynamics analysis results showed that the two baffles case led to the emergence of three eddy currents in the three zones created. The better fluid interpenetration caused the reduction in retention time. In the areas where the vortex was formed, the number of eddy currents decreased and the retention time increased. Regression analysis showed that the P value was 0.998 and 0.977 for the inlet flow and outlet flow for the reservoir, respectively (two baffles case perpendicular to the flow direction). The curve estimation showed that the power function had a suitable correlation on the scatter diagram and with the best curve fit.</jats:p>",

Using ethnographic data from gyms, interviews, and social media platforms, this book investigates the growing use and supply of IPEDs in a UK context. Various levels of user motivation are explored, from the psychoanalytic processes of desire and bodily dissatisfaction to the instrumental and pleasurable aspects of consumption, and their relationship to social media. The gym is also critically examined as a space of deviant leisure, applying cutting edge criminological theory to build links between gym culture, masculinity, and consumption. Tracking the intricate relationship between supply and demand, The Muscle Trade then studies the local offline IPED market in the city of ‘Potsford’, before tracking the commercialization, normalization, and digitization of supply. Within this, particular attention is paid to the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram as spaces of self-representation and illicit commerce. Ultimately, this book serves as a guide to the muscle trade, its infrastructure, the various key actors, and the motivations behind chasing masculine bodily perfection.</p>",

The study was conducted in the context of developing an automatic diagnosis system for power sources based on internal combustion engines, which has gained additional relevance during times of energy instability caused by the war.&#x0D;\nTo justify the necessity of installing a backup power source and its timely diagnosis, the relationship between the probability of power interruption before and after backup on a production line is analyzed. The final product of the line results from a sequence of operations, and any interruption in any of them leads to defective production. Based on input data, the cost of one unit of the product and the time required for its production are estimated, allowing for an hourly income assessment for the production area. The time lost during a power interruption, the economic impact of such an event, and the associated risks are calculated.&#x0D;\nSimilarly, the situation is considered, but with backup in place, taking into account the operational readiness of the backup power source. It is assumed that the technical condition of the backup power source may randomly deteriorate and remain in that state until it is actually restored. The probabilities of power interruption and the associated risks under these conditions are calculated. The obtained data is compared, and recommendations are provided for increasing the reliability of backup.&#x0D;\nThe results of the research reveal that the installation of a backup power source significantly reduces the risk of power interruption. The inspection period for the diesel generator can be reduced to enhance the reliability of backup, with the maximum level achieved through the use of an automatic diagnosis system for the diesel generator's condition.</jats:p>"

However, this method is not very common in all enterprises nowadays, mainly due to the unattainable coordination ability and flexible supply chain. It is already known that the factors limiting the flexibility of the supply chain are basically related to its three key links: procurement, operations and logistics. This paper assumes a positive relationship between sales revenue and operating cost and obtains their relationship through linear regression analysis and correlation analysis on Carnival Corporation &amp; Plcs worldwide data from 2008 to 2022. Finally, positive relationships were found and confirmed, as well as highly correlated results. The results show that the factor restricting the supply chain to achieve better marketing response lies in cost control. Better operating costs and logistics costs can achieve better sales revenue and profit sources.</jats:p>"

The objective of the study was to establish effect of contract   management   phases   on supply chain performance among manufacturing firms in Nairobi County.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The population of the study was manufacturing companies which are based in Nairobi, Kenya. Nairobi has 640 manufacturing firms. The sample size of this study consisted of 246 supply chain managers in manufacturing firms in the Nairobi, obtained through stratified sampling and randomly selected.  Self-administered questionnaire were used to collect data from the respondents. The quantitative data was coded and grouped into to various categories, percentages, frequencies, means were derived and presentation done through tables for compiling the study.&#x0D;\nFindings: The study found that pre-contract phase, solicitation, contract execution phase, post award phase influenced supply chain performance as per correlation analysis. The findings indicted buyer specifications are emphasized at pre-contract stage, the contract is signed at execution stage and deliverable during post ward phase and all the stages are crucial for supply chain performance at manufacturing firms.  The study concludes that manufacturing firms depend highly on the clear contract singing and fulfillment of the contractual obligations by all parties across the phases. The study also concludes that the success of the firm will depend on efficiency in supply chain therefore; the management should ensure that there are no lapses in the procurement process.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommends that there is need for manufacturing firms in Kenya to invest in constant training of their employees on effective contract management across all the phases to enhance their performance. The study also recommends that manufacturing firms in Kenya should put in place appropriate measures that ensure that potential risks regarding contract management phases, detected in advance, and mitigated to enhance operational performance.</jats:p>"

The results showed that 334 samples did not meet the permitted limit QCVN 01-1:2018/BYT for free chlorine residual  (0.2-1.0 mg/L), of which, about 80% of sample have concentration  less than the lower limit. The reason is due to the inaccurately used chloramine dose, mainly quantified without adjusting for actual output quality and distribution system. Some companies even periodically disinfect water 1-3 times/week. In many cases, the water samples at the companies’ storage tanks have high free chlorine residual, about 2 times greater than upper limit (&gt;2.0 mg/L). Regarding microbiological parameters, for total coliforms about 40-50% surveyed provinces have water samples that were non-compliance with the acceptable quality standard for QCVN 01-1:2018/BYT with total of 102, 57 and 105 samples. For those water samples, free chlorine residual found also lower than required limit (&lt;0.06 mg/L). Apart from total coliforms and E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa) was also detected in water samples in some provinces and cities with levels exceeding the allowable standards from several times to dozens of times. In addition, the number of provinces/cities where Ps. aeruginosa was detected in supply water also increased over the years but insignificantly. Water samples that did not meet the standard are mostly from water supply companies with a capacity of less than 1,000 m3/day. Correlation analysis by regression coefficient R2 and Pearson correlation coefficient showed that there was a negative correlation between free chlorine residual and microbiological parameters (total coliforms, E.coli), but the correlation was low and non-linear.\"</jats:p>",

As gas prices surged to historically high levels, states responded with emergency interventions and initiated market reforms to limit the social and economic impact of the crisis. More fundamentally, the supply shock triggered a profound rethink of foreign supply and infrastructure dependencies, leading to the adoption of an important number of new legal initiatives, aimed at ensuring the resilience of clean energy supply chains. Energy geopolitics and supply security are firmly back at the centre of global energy policy. In this new geopolitical reality, a critical reassessment is needed of the role of energy law in the creation of dangerous dependencies, and its relevance in neutralizing the potential weaponization of energy dependencies. This book provides a legal analysis of the use of energy as a tool of geopolitical power, an issue that has so far predominantly been researched in the economic statecraft and energy geopolitics literature. The analysis shows how legal instruments of energy security have in reality contributed to creating the dependencies that allowed for the weaponization of energy. At the same time, the book warns, international energy, trade, and investment law may substantially constrain supply security measures. As new dependencies in the clean energy industry are the subject of increasing scrutiny, reforms are needed to allow states greater flexibility to ensure supply security, while still preserving the international collaboration that is needed to accelerate the clean energy transition.</jats:p>",

The United States will need to secure lithium resources to expand its EV production capacity. Additionally, in developed countries, it will not suffice just to supply lithium, but to ensure that its production is conducted under fair labor standards and environmental regulations while being at an economically viable price. In the United States, only one player has emerged that can mine and refine a substantial amount of lithium: Lithium Americas. They have tested and refined their process so that it minimizes waste and energy consumption, does not negatively impact the locale, and is economical to boot. As a result, Lithium Americas is poised to become a major player in the lithium industry and is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the mineral. Our goal is to capitalize on their previous work, highlight their sustainability and positive impacts, and set a benchmark for future mines and processing plants.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The book’s conclusion attempts to weave together the various themes that dominate the work, cohering around three undergirding sections: Why use IPEDs?; Potsford’s local closed market structure; and market trajectory: commercialization and SNS supply. Chapters 4 to 7 are drawn upon to present a multi-layered theorization as to why the men under study were drawn towards image and performance enhancing drugs. Building out from a psychoanalytical account of bodily desire, to include meso and macro factors such as sporting and occupational context, the role of pleasure and lifestyle, and will-to-recognition on social media, the chapter offers some much-needed nuance to the question of motivation. Potsford’s offline market is then summarized, drawing heavily on Chapter 9. This is then woven into the final section, which reiterates the growth and development of the IPED market, bringing together Chapters 9, 10, and 11 to present a dual space of traditional offline, culturally embedded supply, alongside a burgeoning online market catering to an evolving consumer base. The chapter, and book, are drawn to a close with a number of recommendations for future research and policy implementation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Chapter 8 is the first of four chapters examining the supply-side of the IPED market. It is principally concerned with how and where these compounds are produced, highlighting underground laboratories (UGLs) and licit pharmaceutical production. First, UGLs are identified as the primary domestic source of anabolic steroids and some other compounds, and the heterogeneity of these labs, ranging from extremely modest set-ups to large-scale manufacture employing a range of highly skilled chemists, is discussed. The importance of brand recognition and the need to present as legitimate is then explored, as UGLs, mirroring licit businesses, rely on customer loyalty and attempt to build an image of professionalism. Licit pharmaceutical production is then examined, which represents the principal means of producing ancillary drugs like those used for post-cycle therapy. Although some users siphon pharmaceutical products from the UK medical supply chain, the most common origin of pharmaceutical-grade IPEDs appears to be European nations with laxer regulations than the UK, and this is therefore explored. Ultimately, the chapter paints a picture of how these products are produced and entered into the UK market.</p>",

The growth rate of world organic farming or business increases to more than the growth rate of traditional agriculture. In Bangladesh the pace of growth of organic agriculture is insignificant. The organic agriculture or organic supply chain in Bangladesh was scarcely studied. Hence, an intensive study is needed for the organic agriculture industry to pursue the organic supply chain that leads to a promising growth of organic business. A great deal of research has been conducted to explore the factors that may influence the organic supply chain and growth of the organic business. This study aims to explore the influence of e-technology and the dynamics of the actors on the organic supply chain enhancing the growth of the organic business. By collecting data (primary data) using self-administrated questionnaires the research work was evaluated. A total of 389 responses from the organic agriculture industrial actors, consumers, and transporters were collected using stratified random sampling methods. To inspect and analyze data, Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were used with AMOS. The research objectives of this study were accomplished and research hypotheses were supported. The results of the study indicated that the proposed model provided a good understanding of the factors influencing the organic supply chain. From the result, it was revealed that e-technology and dynamics of the actors of the organic supply chain influences the growth of organic business. This study theoretically offers useful information and collected data might help to further research relevant to the organic supply chain and the impact of factors and e-technology of the organic supply chain from various aspects.</jats:p>"

One type of food with excellent market prospects is processed crispy mushroom products. However, there are challenges in the process of making and distributing the product that affects the low competitiveness of the Crispy Mushroom SME; thus, an increase in supply chain management performance is needed in processing the product and meeting customer demand. This study aims to measure and evaluate the performance of Supply Chain Management (SCM) in the SME of Crispy Mushroom for improvements with new strategies that can be carried out. The process of measuring SCM performance uses the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) method as a conceptual model that can describe the supply chain into metrics for obtaining more efficient supply chain management. The performance weight of each indicator will be calculated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on the answers to questionnaires from the analyzed business owner. The results of this study obtained 23 indicators from five processes, namely plan, make, source, delivery, and return, with the final value of SCM performance being good. With the absolute value of SCM performance of 80.891 and classified as good. The core processes with low-performance values are plan and return, which are 8,098 and 9,049, respectively.</jats:p>"

Emergencies and significant violations of the thermal regime in premises and buildings worsen microclimate conditions for an indefinite period of time, until its parameters reach extreme values dangerous for human life. These issues are particularly relevant in the context of the growing number of emergency situations in heat supply systems in Ukraine, both due to the high level of wear and tear of their infrastructure in general, and wartime emergencies. Therefore, conducting research to ensure the safety of heat supply systems operation during emergency shutdowns by determining the regularities of temperature changes in rooms, reaching the critical temperature and operating time of heat supply systems, taking into acount the spatial location of rooms in buildings and their design features, is an urgent task. The purpose of the article. Study of the risk of reaching critical modes of heat supply systems operation in emergency situations, taking into acount the structural features of buildings and ensuring the necessary microclimate conditions. Conclusion. On the basis of the conducted research, the regularities of the structural features of buildings and structures in emergency situations in heat supply systems to ensure microclimate conditions in the premises have been determined. The limit conditions for achieving critical indoor microclimate conditions due to accidents in heat supply systems are determined, which allows predicting the limit conditions for eliminating the consequences of emergency situations and optimizing the activities of repair and rescue services, which is especially important in connection with the failure of outdated heat supply systems and combat operations on the territory of the country.</jats:p>"

This work aims to consider the flow when pipes are opened in the house plumbing systems. The approach deviates from a traditional peak demand-based analysis of the water distribution network. The analysis gives the flow rate at each nodal point that could be observed in the different story buildings. The methodology is applied to a hypothetical network and shows how much flow and nodal pressure can occur when different percentages of consumers are in an active state. This study indicates that the peak demand-based sizing of the supply pipes could have a deficient capacity under real scenarios.

The chapter defines the concept of supply security, and explains how, under the existing European and international energy regimes, trade and investment instruments are expected to ensure secure energy supplies. It then introduces the literature on economic statecraft and energy geopolitics that has long warned of the security risks associated with certain types of energy dependencies, and the literature on imperialism and international law that has criticized the use of investment and trade agreements as an instrument of control and power. As states can use trade and investment instruments to achieve geopolitical benefits, it is necessary to critically reflect on how energy market regulation, and energy trade and investment agreements, can contribute to the creation of dependencies that allow for the weaponization of energy. At the same time, the international economic law scholarship on national security provides a solid theoretical basis to understand how existing energy, trade, and investment disciplines can constrain energy security strategies.</jats:p>",

Fish is a marine product that is easily damaged or perishable, and this is due to enzymatic activity in the fish's body and the activity of microorganisms due to wrong handling. The cities of Medan and Deli Serdang are areas that have good potential for marine products. Enjoying fish products from the sea by consumers, fish distribution was carried out at Belawan Port, precisely at Belawan Ocean Fisheries Port and Fish Auction Place Bagan Percut, Deli Serdang. This study looks at the supply chain or supply chain for traditional fishermen in the North Sumatra region, especially in Medan City and Deli Serdang Regency. The research method used is descriptive qualitative research. The results of the study found that the supply chain of most fishermen caught in Bagan Deli through agents and distributors of fish was then brought to the market or auction place. There are also fishermen in Bagan Deli who directly sell their catch at the local market where the fishing group is located, namely the Bagan Deli and Belawan Traditional Markets. Meanwhile, Bagan Percut of Deli Serdang Regency shows that the role of fish agents and distributors in the supply chain of capture fishermen is very influential. Through these fish agents and distributors, distribution channels can be determined based on the amount or amount of fish caught.</jats:p>"

On the basis of technology–task fit theory, this study aims to theorize and examine blockchain technology and supply chain risk management by proposing a set of research hypotheses. To achieve this, blockchain technology is classified into two main characteristics, namely, traceability and security, and categorized supply chain risks into supply, demand, and process risks. This study also empirically validates the conceptual framework and proposes hypotheses using structural equation modeling, with 355 Chinese manufacturing firms as the research sample. Empirical findings demonstrate that all the three types of risk and the two main characteristics of blockchain (i.e., blockchain traceability and security) positively contribute to the supply chain risk–blockchain technology fit. Results also suggest that the supply chain risk–blockchain technology fit positively affects new product development (NPD) performance. In addition, the relationship between supply chain risk–blockchain technology fit and NPD performance is positively moderated by global value chain upgrading. </jats:p>",

In turn, due to the specificity of thermodynamic steam processes, steam supply systems of industrial enterprises in practice have significant unused potential of secondary energy resources (SEP). Modern steam supply systems should be built exclusively when evaluating their exergetic efficiency, which will make it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems grossly in all elements of the life cycle of the project: energy, economic, ecological and even social. The article shows modernized thermal schemes of steam supply systems, for which it is possible to achieve additional electrical power at the level of 135-250 kW/(kg/s) when devices with a relative internal efficiency of up to 60-70 % are operating. In combination with an increase in the percentage of condensate return and the utilization of secondary energy resources (SRP), the increase in energy efficiency of the system is 2-4 %, and the absolute value of exergetic efficiency is 16-22 %, taking into account the exergetic efficiency of the boiler unit. Low-potential \"tail\" consumers: the heating system, the hot water supply system - increase the exergy efficiency of the steam supply system of an industrial enterprise by 0.2-0.6 % in the case of joining on the steam side of secondary boiling. Any processes of generating electrical energy are associated with obtaining a significant amount of thermal energy, and must be accompanied by its utilization; enterprises that use steam as an energy carrier (the same applies to energy enterprises such as thermal power plants and nuclear power plants) for the deep utilization of hydroelectric power plants must have thermal energy consumers in their composition, which can act as communal household consumers (if they exist), as well as new technological consumers of thermal energy.</jats:p>"

First, the sanctity of peer networks and informal contacts in the hardcore fitness community for those seeking to purchase IPEDs is highlighted, as the traditional ‘partial’ market is conceptualized as a space that requires a requisite amount of bodily and cultural capital to enter. As such, the chapter identifies the barriers that are deliberately erected to preclude those who lack the cultural embeddedness required to engage in the local market, which typically takes place in gyms, users’ and sellers’ homes, and through mutual acquaintances. This dynamic is exemplified through a case study of an amateur bodybuilder named Dom and the underground laboratory Astra. Dom’s connection to this UGL ultimately facilitated a number of other men’s purchasing, and the chapter argues that such a relationship is highly mutually beneficial for user and supplier alike.</p>",

We can have as our collective goal a world at peace, a world devoid of sicknesses, and a world with no global warming, all worthy goals, but these are elusive goals. This Happiness is not a controlled state that can be attained by planning and execution but an emergent state that needs to be allowed to unfold over time. From our end, we just have to better control the interdependencies among happinesses at the individual company level.</jats:p>",

The chapter examines retail-level sellers operating on each platform, drawing a crude typology of underground laboratory representatives and online resellers. UGL representatives, it contends, mainly operate on private or semi-private groups on Facebook and only sell on behalf of a specific UGL brand. Independent resellers, on the other hand, embody the indiscriminate nature of the social media market, proactively soliciting for business on Instagram and using hashtags and recommended follows to target prospective customers. The chapter draws upon digital ethnographic screenshots and interviews to highlight the modus operandi of these seller types, exploring their means of communication, transactions, product delivery, and strategies to avoid detection. Ultimately, connections are drawn between the IPED market as a whole, and the emergent nature of this aspect of online supply is emphasized.</p>",

The use of incomplete contracts and jury-rigging is brought to the fore. The chapter argues that buyer-supplier relationships may be defined not so much by what exists at the interface between two companies but by the supporting social networks that operate within each of the two companies. The digitization of supply chains and digital supply chains are compared. The chapter proposes the unique characteristics of tetrads that are instrumental in studying supply networks further. Introduced is the concept of supply chain financing to avail liquidity to suppliers and, in particular, to deep-tier suppliers. Discussed is how cybersecurity is a supply chain problem. It is pointed out how a focal company needs to scan across supply networks to find innovation. Moving forward, supply networks need to be modularized to operate more resiliently.</jats:p>",

However, these measures can conflict with the requirements of investment protection and non-discrimination under the international law of energy. How can states protect their supply security against the potential threat of the energy investment weapon, within the limits of international energy, investment, and trade law? The European experience shows the difficulty of designing policy measures that are both effective in addressing the security risks posed by foreign energy investments and compliant with international energy, investment, and trade law. Paradoxically, the international instruments of investment protection and open trade, promoted to achieve supply security based on market forces, can also constrain supply security strategies aimed at reducing dependencies through security reviews, diversification, and nationalization. To address these constraints, international reforms are needed to enable states to neutralize the energy investment weapon.</jats:p>",

First, the role of competitive sporting activity is considered as a driver of consumption, and the underlying competitive individualist mindset present among the men under study is interrogated. Following this, the utility of attaining a muscular enhanced body for professionals working in the health and fitness industry, particularly personal training and online coaching, is investigated. This analysis is contextualized within the post-industrial political economy of Potsford and an argument is advanced that IPED consumption ought to be viewed as a means of hyper-conformity to the edicts of late-capitalist accumulation, particularly given the precarious nature of many roles in the sector. Ultimately, the chapter concludes that both the sporting context of consumption and the insecure local health and fitness economy represent ‘dopogenic environments’.</p>",

Serving as the theoretical base onto which analysis of the compulsion to engage in excessive bodywork and IPED consumption stands, this chapter draws on advanced psychoanalytic theory to make a case for the role of lack and desire as the key driving forces for the sample. First, the pivotal role of lack in human subjectivity is laid out, before an argument that the body, for the book’s subjects, represents the objet petit a is offered. This stance is then mobilized to interrogate the corporeal suffering and jouissance taken on by hardcore gym users, before the cyclical, psychically appealing nature of bodywork is explored. The notion that fitness is a never-ending journey is then leant upon to argue that IPED consumption is essentially a means to prolong bodily dissatisfaction, allowing subjects to suspend themselves in a state of corporeal desire. Finally, the relationship between IPED addiction and desire is explored, taking in both the chemical and psychic aspects of dependence present in the men under study.</p>",

For the economical transportation of natural gas to distant markets, physical (i.e., liquefaction and compression) or chemical (i.e., direct and indirect) monetisation options must be considered to reduce volume and meet the demand of different markets. Planning natural gas supply chains is a complex problem in today’s turbulent markets, especially considering the uncertainties associated with final market demand and competition with emerging renewable and hydrogen energies. This review study evaluates the latest research on mathematical programming (i.e., MILP and MINLP) as a decision-making tool for designing and planning natural gas supply chains under different planning horizons. The first part of this study assesses the status of existing natural gas infrastructures by addressing readily available natural monetisation options, quantitative tools for selecting monetisation options, and single-state and multistate natural gas supply chain optimisation models. The second part investigates hydrogen as a potential energy carrier for integration with natural gas supply chains, carbon capture utilisation, and storage technologies. This integration is foreseen to decarbonise systems, diversify the product portfolio, and fill the gap between current supply chains and the future market need of cleaner energy commodities. Since natural gas markets are turbulent and hydrogen energy has the potential to replace fossil fuels in the future, addressing stochastic conditions and demand uncertainty is vital to hedge against risks through designing a responsive supply chain in the project’s early design stages. Hence, hydrogen supply chain optimisation studies and the latest works on hydrogen–natural gas supply chain optimisation were reviewed under deterministic and stochastic conditions. Only quantitative mathematical models for supply chain optimisation, including linear and nonlinear programming models, were considered in this study to evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed approach.</jats:p>"

The concept of energy security, which has traditionally been limited to securing the availability of fossil fuels, is being expanded to include the resilience of clean energy supply chains. The geopolitics of energy is no longer confined to fossil fuels, but now includes the international competition to control clean technologies, critical minerals, and clean energy investments. In this new energy landscape, what is the role of energy law in managing the investment, technology, and resources dependencies that are created as part of the clean energy transition? This chapter maps the new dependencies in the clean energy landscape and, on this basis, examines states’ responses to clean energy security and supply chain resilience, and their compatibility with international energy, trade, and investment law.</jats:p>",

Pipeline networks are crucial for gas trade and supply security, and are also at the centre of the geopolitics of energy. The understanding of investments as an instrument of geopolitical power challenges the perception of foreign investments as a force of energy security under the liberal principles governing the international law of energy. This chapter aims to understand the role that EU energy law, and international energy investment agreements, played in establishing the dependencies on Russian pipelines that allowed for the weaponization of energy. More fundamentally, it builds on the literature on imperialism and international law to propose a critical reflection on the role of energy investment law in facilitating and entrenching dangerous infrastructure dependencies. Energy producers and capital-exporting states can make use of investment instruments to secure control over, and exclude foreign interference in, their sphere of influence.</jats:p>",

First, a visual photomontage is offered, depicting the most-liked images that were shared by the sample. This is utilized to position social media sites as manifestations of the contemporary Big Other, for which the men perform and parade their physiques in hope of validation. Yar’s concept of will-to-representation is then built upon to propose a ‘will-to-recognition’, wherein users’ posts are dictated by their fidelity to the digital Big Other. These sites, particularly Instagram, are then conceptualized as the digital Lacanian mirror, where the highly selected and often edited images put forward distort the men’s self-image, leaving them estranged from their own digital form. This process, the chapter argues, is underpinned by an inversion of the ego ideal and the ideal ego, leaving the sample desiring their own fantastical self-representation online. The chapter concludes with the contention that social media sites are potent dopogenic environments, where the highly cultivated, digitally mediated images stimulate bodily desire and dissatisfaction.</p>",

To ensure the planet’s preservation, authorities and corporations should implement proactive strategies. Achieving sustainability depends on diverse stakeholder involvement, especially scientific research driving the proposed investigation. Human languages often contain imperfect or unknown information, inherently lacking certainty; achieving precision in describing existing states or future outcomes is frequently unattainable. In probability theory, sufficient historical information is crucial for estimating probability distributions; while in fuzzy theory, determining a reliable membership function proves challenging; hence, there is often a hesitant estimation of the degree of belief in the occurrence of each condition. Addressing such uncertainties, the theory of uncertain intervals proves highly valuable. Given these considerations, the elements of the specified problem are recognized as uncertain intervals. To manage this lack of assurance, a fusion of interval theory and methods from uncertain programming is used to formulate two distinct models: an expected value model and a chance-constrained model. The equivalent deterministic models are then formulated and solved utilizing Weighted Sum Method, fuzzy programming, and goal programming. Following this, a numerical example is utilized to assess the model’s performance, and the results obtained are compared. Finally, the document concludes with a sensitivity analysis and outlines future directions.</p>"

Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model and Stata 17 software to analyze quarterly data from Q1/2007 to Q4/2022, the analysis reveals strong and enduring correlations. An increase in money supply and economic growth positively influences foreign portfolio investment, with the money supply from the previous quarters significantly impacting foreign portfolio investment (P-value &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). However, foreign exchange rates and foreign direct investment negatively affect foreign portfolio investment. Three macroeconomic indicators show significance at 1% and 5%, where gross domestic product positively affects foreign portfolio investment, while foreign exchange rates and foreign direct investment have detrimental impacts. The findings indicate that a 1% increase in gross domestic product leads to a USD 50.426 million increase in foreign portfolio investment, while a USD 1 million increase in foreign direct investment results in a USD 0.025 million decrease. Foreign exchange rates significantly affect foreign portfolio investment, with the potential for reduction through VND devaluation or an increase in the VND/USD exchange rate due to government adjustments. Definitive conclusions about external debt, interest rates, and inflation require additional data and research. The study’s R-squared value is 0.2738, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.1813, explaining 27.38% of future changes in Vietnam’s foreign portfolio investment. These findings have important implications for policymakers, suggesting that expanding the money supply and implementing suitable interest rate policies could enhance foreign portfolio investment attractiveness in the nearest term.\nAcknowledgmentThe author would like to thank the board of editors and the anonymous reviewers for their time and suggestions, which were most helpful in improving this article.</jats:p>",

This paper identified metrics to evaluate the firm’s SC performance, using secondary data from firm records, primary data from a survey of 200 sales agents, and the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. Production records revealed a manufacturing lead time of 11 days and a production time of 24 h plus 7 days for refrigeration and observation. Order fulfillment delivery times ranged from 13 to 16 days. About 86.0 percent of customers rated the product as good or very good, and 60.5 percent claimed benefits from consuming the product. SC management costs of goods sold were 75.27% of total costs, while production cost was 41.99% of total costs. Total assets increased 16.6% from 2019 to 2021, but profits declined by 32.9% for the same period, while return on assets fell 42.4%. To maintain a competitive advantage, the company should apply information technology to improve SC performance. The results showed that the SCOR model is appropriate for evaluating the performance of this firm and similar business enterprises.</jats:p>"

Berbagai penelitian mengenai pengembangan sistem SCM telah banyak dilakukan dengan berbagai implementasi yang telah dilakukan di berbagai sektor, dan dapat dikonklusikan bahwa akses sistem melalui internet yang dapat dilakukan dari mana saja, kapan saja dan oleh siapa saja memungkinkan adanya celah keamanan data berupa akses sumber daya oleh pengguna yang tidak memiliki otorisasi maupun hak akses. Penerapan Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) menjadi solusi yang dapat diterapkan dan mencegah akses resource dari pihak-pihak yang tidak memiliki otorisasi. Penerapan RBAC dalam salah satu framework yang banyak digunakan hingga saat ini, yaitu Framework Laravel, sangat dapat dilakukan dengan memanfaatkan library Laravel Spatie.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain systems in the food industry are complex, including manufacturers, dealers, and customers located in different areas. Currently, there is a lack of transparency in the distribution and transaction processes of online food trade. The global food supply chain industry has enormous hurdles because of this problem, as well as a lack of trust among individuals in the sector and a reluctance to share information. This study aims to develop a blockchain-based strawberry supply chain (SSC) framework to create a transparent and secure system for tracking the movement of strawberries from the farm to the consumer. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the proposed solution monitors participant interactions, triggers events, and logs transactions to promote transparency and informed decision-making. The smart contracts also govern interactions between vendors and consumers, such as monitoring the status of Internet of Things (IoT) containers for food supply chains and notifying consumers. The proposed framework can be extended to other supply chain industries in the future to increase transparency and immutability.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the application of supply chain systems in South African healthcare institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review (SLR) was employed to explore the performance of existing supply chain systems, followed by a case study that tested and compared the acquisition and distribution of COVID-19 resources. The SLR revealed that most of the flare-ups were exacerbated by the acquisition of insufficient resources and speculative shortages as the supply chain systems got overwhelmed by the unprecedented demand. The simulation of the real-world data of South Africa revealed gaps in the distribution of resources, allocation of medical staff to administer COVID-19 vaccines, and shortages of vaccines. The study recommends development of effective contextual (SA) healthcare supply chain systems to support the containment of pandemic flare-ups. The study was conducted in South Africa and only reported data was used.</p>",

The study covers 18 core areas including 32 samples sites. Altogether 325 samples collected from intake, reservoirs, treatment plants and deep wells to their connectivity as well as alternative sources such as shallow wells, tube wells, processed water and stone spouts of Sundarijal water supply system. Primary information collected through In-depth interview with 155 households (hhs), 15 focus group discussions, interview with 20 water suppliers (government and private sector) and 30 school teachers and students of linking with water supply system within the study areas. The study analyzed 7 physical, 16 chemical and 2 microbiological parameters (Total coliform (TC) and Fecal coliform (FC) following the standard methods (APHA 2000). The findings have elaborated the water quality in the source is acceptable and it is deteriorate the quality linking with its supply chains and connectivity, which is severely affected by the scaled, rusted, leakage, old pipelines and intermittence of water supply. Most of the sampling sites were microbiologically, contaminated (TC 6-&gt;180MPN/100mL and FC 1-7MPN/100mL). The processed water contains lower level of essential minerals because of reverse osmosis treatments.&#x0D;\nThe fluoride (0.8-2mg/L), manganese (0.1-0.5mg/L), ammonia (52-70mg/L), iron 5mg/L, color (20-25°Hazen), pH (6) and turbidity (32-40 NTU) in deep wells, its supplies, well, tube wells were found beyond the value of tolerance level recommended by NDWQS and WHO guidelines. About 98% hhs used traditional methods for water management; indicates poor handling practices. Hence water quality management is a big challenge in Kathmandu Valley in terms of adequate safe water and requires regular surveillances and monitoring system for improvement.</jats:p>"

We also analyze the mediation effect of GSCM on the interplay between TMS and EP. Additionally, the paper also provides an analysis of the moderating role of SCCA between IP and EP. To attain the objective of this research, we assembled data from 710 business entities within the Shaanxi province of China utilizing a survey design approach. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to test and assess the hypothetical outline. The study outcomes empirically show that TMS, GSCM, and SCCA positively and significantly impact EP. Interestingly, our study found an insignificant association between IP and EP. The study's results also demonstrate that IP directly relates to top management support. Moreover, the study's empirical findings reveal that GSCM positively mediates IP and EP. The study findings show that SCCA shapes IP and EP's connection. Accordingly, the practical implications of our study's findings suggest that business managers, investors, and government agencies must know the importance of adopting sustainable practices within the supply chain. Business managers must take action to integrate environmental criteria into supplier selection, evaluate suppliers' EP, and collaborate with eco‐friendly suppliers. Hence, government agencies, stakeholders, and business managers can use this information to shape regulations and policies that encourage businesses to adopt sustainable supply chain practices. Offering incentives such as tax benefits or grants for sustainability initiatives can also promote adoption. The study recommends that a business culture that targets improving EP due to IP and top management support is essential in achieving GSCM practices, thereby promising competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

First, the increased profitability of UGL ownership, propelled by new-found direct-to-end user sales, is explored. Evidence of increased animosity and intra-lab rivalries is presented in a formerly amicable marketplace. This change is contextualized in relation to an influx of ‘market-oriented’ profit-driven dealers, intent on cashing in on the burgeoning customer base. Following this, the mainstreaming of the IPED market, stimulated by an increase in lifestyle use as well as the removal of many cultural barriers to supply, is examined. The chapter argues that this development has allowed many less culturally embedded users, who would otherwise lack the necessary peer networks, to purchase AAS and other substances. Ultimately, the chapter presents something of a chicken and egg problem, as it remains unclear whether an increase in lifestyle use has fed the expansion of the online market, or whether the ease with which substances can be purchased has encouraged consumption in a wider demographic of users.</p>",

A sprawling interview conducted with Phillip in a coffee shop in Potsford is utilized to first introduce this notable participant, before unpacking his initially instrumental motivations to use IPEDs. However, although first rooted in sporting aspiration, Phillip’s consumption exemplified the age-defying, lifestyle-enhancing experiences of consuming IPEDs and his use is therefore explored in relation to medicalization, the liberal tenet of a mastery over nature, and testosterone as a gateway to ‘perma-adolescence’. Though a unique case study, this exploration serves to highlight the role of pleasure and lifestyle within the broader IPED-using population.</p>",

These data, originally prepared for the LandGriffon service, include indicators of deforestation, conversion of natural ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, and loss of intact or high integrity ecosystems following international standards and guidelines for reporting and target setting in the agriculture, forestry, and land use sector. In order to assign impacts to agricultural production, we prepare data using a spatial adaptation of the statistical Land Use Change (sLUC) accounting approach distributing impact to human activities across the local area using a 50km radius. The results are high resolution global maps of impact per hectare of land occupation. These can then be combined with land footprint data, cropland extent, or productivity maps to calculate land use change related impacts for specific crop volumes sourced from specific regions. Carbon and deforestation results are validated against FAO statistics at the national level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research aimed to examine the influence of transformational leadership in enhancing successful management of water supply services at IRUWASA. The study applied the transformational leadership theory developed by Bass in 1985. The specific objective of the research was to assess how intellectual stimulation influence employee performance in enhancing successful management of water supply services at IRUWASA. The study adopted a quantitative research approach where data were collected through structured questionnaires. The study involved 109 IRUWASA employees selected using a proportionate simple random sampling method. Multivariate Correlation analysis was employed to analyze the quantitative data. The research findings demonstrated that there were significant positive correlations between intellectual stimulation and employee performance in the context of successfully managing water supply services at IRUWASA. Furthermore, the study revealed a positive relationship between employee performance and the successful management of water supply services. Therefore, it can be concluded that fostering qualities of intellectual stimulation should be prioritized and actively encouraged. By doing so, employee performance can be enhanced, ultimately leading to the successful management of water supply services at IRUWASA. This underscores the importance of implementing transformational leadership practices to achieve desired outcomes of management of water supply services at IRUWASA.</jats:p>"

So as to secure SCs, insulate them as much as possible from certain risks, and mitigate the severity of the consequences of disruptions, such as those that occur during pandemics, researchers and policy makers need to be abreast of developments in the field of SCRM. This study selected hot and frequently cited papers of WoS from the last 10 years for analysis, performing quantitative visualization analysis so as to establish what the current trends are within the field. Additionally, further attention was paid to those studies that specifically focused on the impact of COVID-19 on SCs. This study used a keyword timeline and clustering analysis map to establish what the main research directions in SCRM were between the years 2012 to 2018, as well as the perspectives from which SC optimization was studied from 2018 to 2021. The key journals and research institutions for SCRM are established, as well as the key categories that the published literature falls under. Cluster analysis shows which areas in the published literature have the most references. Further, the study establishes the direction of current trends within SCRM research, such as those concerning the integration of blockchain technology, and SC designs with low ‘certainty’ requirements, and suggests developing an innovative perspective with regards to SC disruption management. Finally, the study finds that understudied areas of SCRM include the correlations between supply chain resilience and sustainability, the environmental and social dimensions of designing sustainable SC networks, and the lack of focus on the supply chains of low-demand items and SMEs (small and medium-size enterprises).</jats:p>"

Inefficiencies in the supply chain create massive waste and stifle innovation in manufacturing, both well-established concerns for the environment. Carbon-based fuels and products are detrimental to the land, air, and sea. Single-use products made from toxic materials flood the food and medical supply chains. Businesses are increasingly moving toward the single purchasing platform model (for example, Uber and Airbnb). Following that model, this paper proposes a platform as a service (PaaS) manufacturing sharing service that matches small- to mid-size manufacturers with production capacity as a solution to obtaining ethically sourced products at a competitive price while offering access to last-mile delivery locally on a single purchasing platform. The development of an Internet of Things (IoT) platform can achieve these four things: (1) provide better coordination of the sourcing and supply of materials, (2) ensure effective provisions of eco-friendly and recycled inputs, (3) provide efficient distribution of equipment and manufacturing resources, and (4) shorten the supply chain by centralizing and coordinating last-mile delivery.</jats:p>"

The schools of ultra-realism and deviant leisure are first unpacked, before an argument that the gym represents a site of contemporary consumption is advanced, wherein these spaces of committed bodywork have been submerged by a tide of commodification and ‘gym gentrification’. Tensions are then unpacked around the hardcore gym as a space of sociability for users, whereby sites such as Muscle Sanctuary and Predator simultaneously represent arenas of fraternal kinship and competitive individualism. Finally, the gym is interrogated as a site of labour and ascetic hedonism, and links are drawn to Potsford’s industrial heritage of craft and graft.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid development of industrialization has led to the increasing contradiction between human and nature, and green products are favored by more and more consumers. In this paper, a two-level green manufacturing supply chain between a manufacturer that produces green products and a retailer that invests in advertising is investigated. The Stackelberg game is used to study the supply chain decision-making and coordination problems when the demand depends on the greenness of the products and the investment in advertising, and to propose a coordination mechanism for cost-sharing and revenue-sharing. Finally, numerical simulation is used to simulate and analyze the research findings and important parameters. Our results indicate that: (1) When the cost-sharing coefficient and the benefit-sharing coefficient satisfy a certain range of conditions, the supply chain members considering a single coordination mechanism are superior to the supply chain without a coordination mechanism; (2) With the gradual increase in the cost-sharing coefficient of contract, the degree of greenness of the products produced by manufacturers and the level of intensity of the advertisements invested in by retailers show a tendency to increase first and then decrease; (3) In the study of the integrated coordination mechanism of cost-sharing and benefit sharing, the stronger the coordination ability of supply chain members, the wider the range of constraints to reach a win–win cooperation, and the higher the benefits created for supply chain members. All this yields novel insights into managing the manufacture of green products in the context of green supply chain members’ consideration of coordination mechanisms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Smart, reliable, and connected multi-modal mobility has been a long-standing goal of transit services. This paper focuses on the smart, seamless, and multi-modal mobility service in the context of “Mobility as a Service” (MaaS). Intelligent mobility is the smarter, greener, and more efficient movement of passengers around the world. Increasingly, mobility is approached as a service. This study first conducts an extensive literature review on mobility behavior and demand pattern of MaaS end-users. It then extends the mechanism of supply chain, MaaS, synergy (i.e., vertical cooperation synergy, horizontal competition synergy), and coopetition to develop the multi-tier closed-loop intelligent mobility service supply chain network. This paper explains the intelligent mobility service supply chain network from following perspectives: (i) mobility service taxonomy of MaaS; (ii) aims of intelligent mobility service supply chain network; (iii) urban rail transit (URT)-centered alternatives for integrated multimodal journey planning, i.e. access + URT + egress, and both access and egress can be served by Mobility-On-Demand (MOD) transport; (iv) node member imperatives. From a synthesis of insights from the ‘during’ journey, this study puts forward the synergetic design of intelligent mobility service supply chain network, including: (i) multi-tier closed-loop structure; (ii) key nodes identification for the physical multimodal transport network in the supply chain; (iii) hybrid synergy mechanisms among the partners, i.e., synergy principle, temporal splitting approach for coopetition synergy; (iv) index systems and evaluation methods for synergy measurement. This study also contributes to the integrated multimodal journey planning.  In concluding, the paper highlights the important implications of the proposed intelligent mobility service supply chain network for MaaS bundle design and adverse effects reduction, resulting from 1 + 1 &amp;gt; 2 synergy effects.</jats:p>"

Thanks to autonomy and resiliency in fuel procurement, organizations with decentralized energy plants may be able to quickly adapt to the changing needs of society. The main aim of this study was to increase the sustainability of a Finnish CHP plant&amp;#039;s wood procurement by determining the company&amp;#039;s profitable wood procurement region while keeping the forests renewable. The income received from the sale of energy and the costs incurred from the procurement of wood were collected from the ERP system as input data for the developed DSS. The environmental sustainability of wood procurement was assessed by considering the additional costs caused through the EEAP mechanism if the carbon sink of the forest worsened due to wood procurement in the area. The supply chains were compared so that the CHP plant managers could adopt the best energy wood value chains. The results showed that updating the procurement strategy would be necessary. The CHP plant managers should purchase energy wood from a larger procurement area than the current one and focus on roadside purchases of wood. The Techno-Economic Wood Payment Ability Model was a useful part of the DSS to guide wood buyers toward sustainable wood procurement by increasing the share of renewable forests.</jats:p>"

Bangbayang Village is one of the villages that was quite heavily affected. Ninety percent (90%) of the buildings in this location were damaged with level moderate to severe .This program aims to overcome the scarcity of clean water in the refugee area of RT 02 Bangbayang Village and build awareness of clean and healthy living even in refugee camps. The program was carried out in the form of activities, namely in the form of making drilled wells as a source of water supply for residents and education on clean and healthy living. After the implementation of this activity, the community can meet their needs for water supply both for toilets, ablution and cooking. This is important because the health condition of residents is important in an emergency situation and there is no disease transmission due to bad sanitation. Through this activity, the community is greatly assisted and can live an emergency life without clean water constraints.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n                        &lt;p&gt;Recently Internet of things (IoT) and its applications are emerging as a momentous trend in industry. Numerous hardware and software providers have been entering the intense market competition in IoT related industries. Correspondingly, the attention on evaluation of IoT industry is growing. However, it is a main theme as how to consider the multiple dimensions and dependencies among the criteria in IoT supply chains simultaneously. By considering internal processes in DMUs as well as their interactions, this study designs the evaluation methods with network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) and multi-objective programming (MOP) techniques. This work intends to estimate the efficiency of IoT businesses from the perspectives of R&amp;D, manufacturing, sales and finance, and the overall performance. The proposed models are implemented with empirical case studies in IoT supply chains in Taiwan. The results show the usefulness and validity of the proposed methods in evaluating IoT related business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n                    </jats:p>",

The evaluation of the value added in each chain is based on indicators, which are a tool to measure changes in the actual situation or to show performance trends in achieving the progress set by the objectives. The presented indicators are based on publicly available statistics and foreign literature that allow measuring value added in specific livestock chains at aggregate level (beef production, pork production and dairy production) and are based on publicly available statistics in the Republic of Slovenia. The need to produce indicators of value added in livestock food supply chains arises from the large differences in structural changes in the sector itself and in the development and economic performance of the various livestock industries.</jats:p>"

Existing national electrical energy supply systems possess good technical availability but with significant system-inherent risks. The latter show their effects in the systems’ operational behaviour, their impact on the national economy and on the global climate. National electrical energy supply systems in their current state can therefore not be considered sustainable. This invites the question, “can there be a national electrical energy supply system that is simultaneously technologically, economically and environmentally sustainable?”.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Main text</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The contents of this article are of a fundamental nature. They start from a newly established axiomatic system for multiple-sustainable electric energy systems. The axioms contain no dependencies on individual users, nation states or technologies. For the transition into a sustainable energy system, core challenges faced by existing systems are synthesized, the fulfillment of which determines the feasibility of future systems. We state that anthropogenically generated electrical energy is a product possessing a cultural-technical significance. In this article, the possibilities arising from the physical fundamentals are considered. In addition, a new control system is developed that integrates user impact, quality assurance and cost developments in order to show a means to multiple-sustainable energy supply systems. An essential component of the control system is a unified view of energy production and energy transport. This also includes a transition from the previous, technology-dominated energy supply system into a new system for which the relevant social concerns are primary.

As a result, delivery reliability is becoming a key factor in competing in the industry. In recent decades, scholars’ interest has focused in selecting the most appropriate supply chain management strategy has increased because it has been recognized by many organizations as an effective strategy to achieve business objectives and consequently improve firm performance and achieve competitive advantage. Therefore, many SMEs are interested on adopting supply chain management practices to be able to ensure better quality products and diminish operational costs with the end goal of improving their business efficiency and add value to consumers. Considering this context, the objective of this study is to analyze the effects of supply chain management on competitiveness and performance of manufacturing companies, using for it a sample of 217 firms of the State on Aguascalientes in Mexico. The relationships between the variables were analyzed through structural equation modeling and the empirical results conclude that supply chain management has a positive influence on competitiveness and performance of the manufacturing companies. \n\t\nJEL classification numbers: M11.\nKeywords: Supply Chain Management, Competitiveness, Performance, Mexico.</jats:p>"

Effective implementation of supply chain leadership strategic actions at each level in the company can create sustainable innovative and competitiveness. The study collected statistical data using an online Survey- Monkey questionnaire from 46 of top 100 JSE-listed companies with the intention to discover supply chain leadership strategic actions that drive sustainable innovation and competitiveness in the company. The findings expose a significant empirical insight for companies to understand and leverage supply chain leadership strategic actions to influence sustainable innovative position in a developing economy. These results suggest that firms operating within emerging markets should embrace and acknowledge the importance of sustainable innovation in business practices in the provision of goods and services. This study therefore delivers major contributions to the literature to assist in planning sustainable innovation and supply chain practices in a developing economy to survive in a competitive global environment. The paper also offers a vigorous awareness and knowledge of the common characteristics and strategies for supply chain management that needs to be prioritized by the JSE-listed companies.</jats:p>"

The problem of financing difficulties for agricultural SMEs has seriously constrained their economic development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of supply chain finance in solving the financing constraint problem of agricultural SMEs, which in turn affects the performance level of enterprises. By constructing a theoretical model and selecting the data in Chinese National Small and Medium Enterprises Stock Transfer System from 2011 to 2022 for mediation effect regression analysis, the results show that there is a stable positive correlation between supply chain finance index and return on net assets (β = 0.585, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); there is a stable negative correlation between supply chain finance and financing constraints (β = – 0.216, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); there is a stable negative correlation between financing constraints and return on net assets (β = –0.893, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). This study examines the impact of supply chain finance on the performance of agricultural SMEs from the perspective that supply chain finance can alleviate financing constraints. The results of this study suggest to business stakeholders that agricultural SMEs can choose supply chain finance as a better choice of financial strategy, and the government can formulate corresponding policies to further develop preferential and supportive policies for supply chain finance.</jats:p>",

We aim to understand the potential consequences of deeply uncertain systemic events on the supply chain resilience and how does the information precision affect individual agents' choices and the chain‐level preparedness to aggregate shocks. Augmenting a parsimonious supply chain model with uncertainty, we analyse the relationship between the upstream sourcing decisions and the supply chain survival probability. Both risk‐averse and ambiguity‐averse individually‐optimising agents' upstream sourcing paths are efficient but can become vulnerable to aggregate shocks. In contrast, a chain‐level coordination of downstream firm sourcing decisions can qualitatively improve the robustness of the entire supply chain compared to the individual decision‐making baseline. Such a robust decision making ensures that in the presence of an aggregate shock—independently of its realisation—part of upstream suppliers will survive and the final goods' supply will be ensured even under the most demanding circumstances. Our results also indicate that an input source diversification extracts a cost in foregone efficiency.</jats:p>",

This paper provides a new multi-function Blockchain Technology-enabled Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (BT-enabled PSC) mathematical cost model, including PSC costs, BT costs, and uncertain demand. The purpose of this study is to find the most appropriate algorithm(s) with minimum prediction errors to predict the costs of the BT-enabled PSC model. This paper also aims to determine the importance and cost of each component of the multi-function model. To reach these goals, we combined four Supervised Learning algorithms (KNN, DT, SVM, and NB) with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (HS and PSO) after data generation. Each component of the multi-function model has its importance, and we applied the Feature Weighting approach to analyze their importance. Next, four performance metrics evaluated the multi-function model, and the Total Ranking Score determined predictive algorithms with high reliability. The results indicate the HS-NB and PSO-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in predicting the costs of the multi-function model with small errors. The findings also show that the Raw Materials cost has a more substantial influence on the model than the other components.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Grain supply is the lifeblood of a country, and the stability of the supply chain is a crucial prerequisite for ensuring national grain security. This paper draws on the definition of resilience in physics and economics. It takes supply chain fracture resilience, impact resilience, and synergy resilience as the secondary indicators. It constructs a comprehensive evaluation indicator system of the grain supply chain resilience, measures the resilience indicator of China&amp;#039;s grain supply chain from 1996 to 2021, and analyzes the role of supply, cost, exchange rate, and other external shocks in influencing the resilience of China&amp;#039;s grain supply chain on this basis. The study found that the overall level of China&amp;#039;s total grain supply chain resilience has been growing year by year and can be divided into three stages: low-level stabilization stage, continuous growth stage, and high-level stabilization stage. Grain supply chain fracture resilience has been growing steadily, grain supply chain impact resilience fluctuation is more obvious, and grain supply chain synergy resilience has been changing more gently. In the inquiry of the impact of external shocks on the resilience of China&amp;#039;s grain supply chain, it was found that world grain exports and the RMB exchange rate have a significant positive impact on China&amp;#039;s grain supply chain resilience level, while the international oil price has a significant negative impact. Based on this, the paper puts forward suggestions for ensuring stable production and supply in the grain market, improving the structure of foreign trade in grain, and actively coping with international commodity price shocks.</jats:p>"

Further, data on prices and quantities together identify whether constraints bind due to increased demand or reductions in capacity. Applying the model to interpret recent US data, we find that binding constraints explain half of the increase in inflation during 2021-2022. In particular, tight capacity served to amplify the impact of loose monetary policy in 2021, fueling the inflation takeoff.</jats:p>"

The considered supply chain includes the levels of suppliers, production centers, and distribution, which are taken into account in the decisions of the location of capacity facilities, optimal allocation of flow, and vehicle routing at the same time. Due to the indeterminacy of the problem environment, the two-stage probabilistic programming method has been used to control the model, and the new WOGA algorithm has been used to solve the problem. The presented algorithm is a combination of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) algorithms, which are used to minimize the costs of the entire designed network. The results obtained from the model analysis show that WOGA has a high efficiency in solving the developed mathematical model compared to GA and WOA. There was no significant difference between the averages of the objective function and the computational time between different solution methods. Since the perishability of the drug in transportation was considered in this article, it was observed that the cost of the entire network reaches its highest level if the period of perishability is 1. Because the production and distribution centers cannot have inventory in their warehouses and must meet the demand of pharmacies in every period.</jats:p>"

This study shows the existence of a contracting mechanism the manufacturers can employ to induce information sharing. This study’s results will be helpful to managers of green supply chain structures to make marketing and operational decisions under uncertain situations.

One of the most significant changes has been the development of supply chain management systems. It is now essential to use cutting-edge technologies to maintain competitiveness in a highly dynamic environment. Restocking inventories is one of a supplier’s main survival strategies and knowing what expenses to expect in the next month aids in better decision-making. This study aims to solve the three most common industry problems in Supply Chain – Inventory Management, Budget Fore-casting, and Cost vs Benefit of every supplier. The selection of the best forecasting model is still a major problem in much research in literature. In this context, this article aims to compare the performances of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters (HW), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for the prediction of a time series formed by the dataset of Supply Chain products. As performance measures, metric analysis of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used. The main concentration is on the Automotive Business Unit with the top 3 products under this segment and the country United States being in focus.

It focuses on environmental issues – and leaves workers´ protection aside. The comparison of the various draft texts of the EU Commission of 23 February 2022, the position of the <jats:sc>ep</jats:sc>´s Committee on Legal Affairs of 8 November 2022, the Council´s joint statement of 1 December 2022, and the <jats:sc>ep</jats:sc>´s statement of 1 June 2023 reveals that climate abatement has become an important pillar, next to workers´ protection. The analysis shows how contested the instrument of civil liability in the context of climate change abatement has become. It is most likely that civil liability for the violation of climate change related due diligence obligations will become central to the final package of compromises, and once enacted it may neither be frequent, nor an important legal tool. However, for the understanding of the political momentum, it is important to understand the background of some delegations standpoints, in this case the fierce opposition of the German delegation against civil liability as a tool, and the counter arguments. The analysis also reveals some interesting novelties: Liability would, if causation could be established, extend to ecological damages. The concept of due diligence changes some basic requirements of civil liability, such as the violation of a duty, the addressee of a claim and the procedural set-up. The limitation to large firms is consistent with this concept, and does not appear non-equitable.</jats:p>",

The EMRIO table uniquely disaggregates existing sector-level input-output tables into an enterprise-level structure encompassing 47 countries, 8,861 sectors, 9,246 companies, 20,098 segments, and 76,622 subsegments. This approach allows for a detailed breakdown of global economic interactions, extending from individual companies to their diverse business units. The database is constructed by integrating annual security reports, fundamental financial information, business-to-business transactions, and bills of lading into input-output tables, facilitating a granular view of the global operations of enterprises. EMRIO's detailed structure is particularly adept at enhancing the understanding of global value chains and Scope 3 emissions, offering a new lens for examining the intricacies of international trade and corporate environmental impact.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid advancement of technology has led to increased electronic consumption and a corresponding rise in e-waste generation. To address this issue, this study develops a low-carbon e-commerce closed-loop supply chain (LCE-CLSC) system with remanufacturer, platform, and the government as key stakeholders. An evolutionary game approach is employed to investigate the system&amp;#039;s dynamics, analyzing the impact of stakeholder strategies on system equilibrium. Numerical simulations reveal important findings: Firstly, government initiatives promoting recycling, carbon taxes on traditional products, can incentivize remanufacturers to produce low-carbon items and encourage platform investment in recycling services. Secondly, higher sales revenues motivate remanufacturers to produce low-carbon products. Thirdly, consumer sensitivity to recycling services strengthens waste recovery when platforms increase investments in these services, leading to remanufacturers choosing low-carbon production. Lastly, government subsidies may become ineffective if the cost of remanufacturers&amp;#039; carbon reduction and platforms&amp;#039; recycling services exceeds their affordability. These findings offer insights for the sustainable development of obsolete electronic product recycling systems.</jats:p>"

As an economical and mobile means of dust suppression, it is recommended to use the developed impulse fine-dispersed irrigation system \"Ustimor\". The principle of operation of the installation is based on the pulsed displacement of water from the water-air tank by the combustion products of the fuel-air mixture under high pressure (&gt;5 MPa). Experimental and industrial tests of the installation were carried out at the tailings storage facility of PJSC \"Ingulets Mining and Processing Plant\". The range of the installation is on average 120-130 m. The area of the irrigated surface in one cycle of operation is from 500 m2 to 750 m2. Fine spraying was observed along the entire length of the jet flight. In one hour of operation, the installation can release from 5 to 30 tons of water into the atmosphere in the form of drizzle. The intensity of watering for one work cycle is on average 0.85 l/m2. The possibility of autonomous operation of the installation and its remote control through the SCADA system has been confirmed. The installation of pulse fine-dispersed irrigation is recommended for use as a means of spraying liquid by the method of fine-dispersed irrigation on open areas of surfaces where dust is intensively swept and suspended. It can be used for dust suppression and humidification at tailings storage facilities, warehouses of bulk materials, landfills, technological highways. The \"Ustimor\" installation can also be used for fine-dispersed irrigation of plantations, vineyards, gardens, etc. Irrigation of leaf cover and soil surface will lower their temperature by 7 - 10 °C in the sun and by 6 - 6.6 °C in the shade.</jats:p>"

New approaches and structural models for the formation of local microenergy systems are proposed, which will encourage territorial communities to a new type of activity related to their own energy generation based on the use of local types of fuels and renewable energy sources. The principles of building such local energy supply systems, in general, consist in the rational distribution of resources (renewable sources, sources of combined energy generation using biofuels, energy from external networks) and coordination of the processes of generation, transmission, accumulation, distribution and consumption of energy within the boundaries of a separate territorial community by creating its own high-tech infrastructure assets. The formation of the energy balance in the medium and long term is proposed to be carried out on the basis of a resource-process analysis of the operation of local networks by finding the optimal use of local types of biofuels and renewable sources in the combined generation of electricity and heat, taking into account their current value. The cost of energy for the end consumer is determined by differentiated tariffs of energy supply companies and the use of several heterogeneous sources that participate in the process of decentralized energy production. Mathematical relations are obtained for calculating the values of the time intervals of the execution of a set of parallel processes that arise during the interaction of competing sources of distributed generation with end consumers and establishing the regularities of the formation of the energy balance a micro energy system. The proposed method can be a tool for finding optimal energy efficiency management scenarios of facilities with local energy supply, using operational redistribution of energy flows in the system of combined energy generation and forecasting current costs for energy supply in calculation periods. Such a concept can be a theoretical basis for the formation of principles of energy independence of territorial communities.

This in-depth study examines the diverse effects of generative artificial intelligence on supply chain operations, including risk management, inventory optimization, procurement, logistics, and more. Given the predictive capacity of generative AI, traditional methods have been completely modified, enabling companies to anticipate demand, maximize inventory, and expedite procurement procedures with previously unheard-of accuracy. Real-time adaptation is made possible by its dynamic decision-making skills, which also help to promote resilience against interruptions and enable proactive reactions to changing market conditions. However, there are some challenges in implementing generative AI in supply chains. Obstacles requiring strategic navigation and organizational preparedness include skill gaps, ethical considerations, scalability issues, and data integration complexity. Future directions for generative artificial intelligence in supply networks are extremely promising. Substantial improvements are expected to be driven by advances in explainable AI, predictive analytics, seamless integration, and ethical frameworks. Redefining supply chain models could be facilitated by autonomous supply chains, adaptive resilience to disturbances, and increased transparency in decision-making.</jats:p>"

Both natural bulk major element and optical petrography fingerprints are preserved through construction sand processing and transport such that sand can be tied back to its original mining source even at the final point of distribution.

Promoting territory spatial protection and governance by improving the ecological products supply is very important. In this study, we established an ecological products supply capacity evaluation index system involving three types of ecological products, i.e., ecological environmental products, ecological material products, and ecological cultural products. For the case of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, we comprehensively used principal component analysis, equivalent factor method, and entropy method to evaluate the supply capacity of the ecological products from 2011 to 2021. Then, we analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern combining the natural breakpoint and quantile classification methods and analyzed the obstacle factors using the obstacle degree model of ecological supply. The results show that the supply capacity of different ecological product in each city are closely related to ecological resource endowment. The supply capacity of ecological products exhibited an upward trend, with the highest ecological environmental products supply, relatively smaller ecological material product supply, and the largest growth rate for ecological cultural product supply. The supply capacity of different ecological products varied across cities over time and displayed noticeable spatial differentiation. The main obstacle factors included eco-land, eco-tourism, eco-leisure, park green space, and fishery products, although there were variations among cities. Finally, based on the level, spatial-temporal pattern, and obstacle factors of ecological product supply, we proposed strategies for territory spatial protection and governance from the perspectives of integrated protection of elements, structural regulation, and systematic governance. The results reflected the ecological functional heterogeneity of territory space, which can provide spatial planning guidance for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

This study makes two groundbreaking and novel contributions. First, we augment Plunket’s emotional research and leverage the emotional classification algorithm in Fin-Emotion to introduce a novel quantitative metric, “emotion magnitude”, that captures the emotional undercurrents of the market. When integrated with traditional time series analysis using Temporal Convolutional Networks applied to stock market futures, this metric offers a more holistic understanding of market dynamics. In our experiments, incorporating it as a feature led to significantly better performance on both the training and validation sets (9.26%, 52.11%) compared to traditional market-based risk measures, in predicting futures market trends based on the commodities and supply chains analyzed. Second, we deploy a multidimensional data science framework that synthesizes disparate data streams and analyses. This includes stock metrics of sector-leading companies, the time horizon of significant market events identified based on company stock data, and the extraction of further knowledge concepts identified through “emotion magnitude” analysis. Our approach stitches together countries, commodities, and supply chains identified in the targeted news search and identifies the domestic companies impacted based on the time horizon of these emotional supply chain events. This methodology culminates in a unified knowledge graph that not only highlights the relationships between supply chain disruptions, affected corporations, and commodities but also quantifies the broader systemic implications of such market events that are revealed. Collectively, these innovations form a robust analytical tool for financial risk strategy, empowering stakeholders to navigate an ever-evolving financial global ecosystem with enhanced insights. This graph encapsulates multi-dimensional forces and enables stakeholders to anticipate and understand the broader causal implications of related supply chain and market events (such as economic sanctions’ impact on the energy, technology, and telecommunication sectors).</jats:p>"

The aim is to determine the optimal cruising speed that minimizes fuel use under operational constraints. Many older vessels in local offshore regions face limitations in adopting new fuel efficient technologies due to financial constraints. Hence, alternative cost-effective methods are needed to improve energy use and reduce emissions from these older ships. We propose using a backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all potential speed solutions and find the optimal one. Operational constraints like time restrictions and weather factors are incorporated during the optimization. The algorithm branches out to potential solutions and backtracks when they violate constraints. This allows for the pruning of infeasible solutions to improve the computational efficiency. The study provides the basis for optimizing offshore voyages as a sustainable transportation activity. Further work could expand the technique by adding parameters and real-time data.</jats:p>"

This growing demand is putting a strain on domestic supply, and Cambodia now imports more coffee than it produces. In 2020, Cambodia imported around 770 tons of coffee beans, mainly from neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Laos. A qualitative method combined with a descriptive analytic approach is the methodology addressed. The data is review from relevant sources on the supply and demand of coffee in Cambodia include academic papers, government reports, industry reports, and news articles. found that the coffee sector in Cambodia has the potential to generate significant economic and social benefits for the country. The study found that the coffee sector could create up to 100,000 new jobs and generate $500 million in revenue by 2025. The study also found that the coffee sector could help to reduce poverty and improve the livelihoods of rural communities. Coffee is a relatively high-value crop, and coffee farmers can earn significantly more than farmers who grow other crops. An estimated 9,650 tons of coffee were consumed in Cambodia in 2022. This represents a significant increase from 2014, when Cambodians consumed only 5,970 tons of coffee. In 2020, Cambodia produced around 3,900 tons of coffee, and the government has a goal of increasing production to 10,000 tons by 2025.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the article was to study the consumption of petroleum products in the agricultural sector of Ukraine under martial law, to investigate the state and state regulation of the market and fuel from petroleum products, and to forecast their price in the future. The following methods were used in the article: dialectical, abstract and logical, statistical, correlation and regression, tabular and graphical, analysis of series of dynamics and structural changes, comparison, strategic planning and forecasting. Based on the results of the research carried out using statistical methods, the article analyses the consumption of petrol and diesel fuel by agricultural enterprises and calculates their cost per hectare of harvested area. It was found that the decrease in fuel consumption in 2022 was due to the fact that ¼ of the sown areas were not sown due to the war. The share of fuel used for the needs of the agricultural sector was also investigated. The correlation and regression analysis revealed a close relationship between the exchange rate and the price of diesel fuel in Ukraine, and a negative relationship between the world oil price and the price of diesel fuel. Due to the established dependence, a model for calculating the price of diesel fuel based on world oil prices and the exchange rate is developed, and the price is calculated. It is substantiated that the main economic method of state regulation of the fuel market is the establishment of an excise tax. It is concluded that the reduction in the consumption of fuel and energy resources in the agricultural sector of Ukraine has led to a decrease in the energy intensity of agricultural products. The results of the research are of practical importance, which will allow identifying destabilizing factors in the oil and oil products market, as well as formulating the State’s policy that will promote the use of energy resources, in particular liquid fuel, in agriculture under martial law</jats:p>",

The baseline results show that corporate innovation and profitability reduce supply chain concentration, while over-indebtedness and financing constraints increase it. These findings suggest that higher R&amp;D investments and profitability enable firms to diversify their supply chains, whereas financial pressures lead to consolidation. The results remain robust after addressing endogeneity concerns using the system GMM approach. Heterogeneity analysis reveals stronger responses in large firms, state-owned enterprises, and high-tech industries. These results suggest policy implications of promoting R&amp;D investments, reducing the debt levels, alleviating the financing constraints, and adopting profit-generating activities to diversify supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The outcome of species competition strongly depends on the traits of the competitors and associated trade-offs, as well as on environmental variability. Here we investigate the relevance of consumer trait variation for species coexistence in a ciliate consumer – microalgal prey system under fluctuating regimes of resource supply. We focus on consumer competition and feeding traits, and specifically on the consumer’s ability to overcome periods of resource limitation by mixotrophy, i.e. the ability of photosynthetic carbon fixation via algal symbionts in addition to phagotrophy. In a 48-day chemostat experiment, we investigated competitive interactions of different heterotrophic and mixotrophic ciliates of the genera<jats:italic>Euplotes</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Coleps</jats:italic>under different resource regimes, providing prey either continuously or in pulses under constant or fluctuating light, entailing periods of resource depletion in fluctuating environments, but overall providing the same amount of prey and light. Although ultimate competition results remained unaffected, population dynamics of mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates were significantly altered by resource supply mode. However, the effects differed among species combinations and changed over time. Whether mixotrophs or heterotrophs dominated in competition strongly depended on the genera of the competing species and thus species-specific differences in the minimum resource requirements that are associated with feeding on shared prey, nutrient uptake, light harvesting and access to additional resources such as bacteria. Potential differences in the curvature of the species’ resource-dependent growth functions may have further mediated the species-specific responses to the different resource supply modes. In addition, while the presence of a heterotrophic competitor may have a direct negative effect on the growth rate of a mixotrophic species through grazing on a shared prey species, its presence may also have an indirect positive effect on the growth rate of the mixotroph by reducing competition between the autotroph and mixotroph for shared nutrients and light. Our study thus demonstrates that complex trophic interactions determine the outcome of competition, which can only be understood by taking on a multidimensional trait perspective.</jats:p>"

Through the game model, the optimal contract design of the retailer under different organizational structures was obtained by solving the corresponding equilibrium results, and the optimal organizational structure design of the retailer was obtained by analyzing the corresponding equilibrium results. Departmental capital costs are decreasing monotonically. The result of analyzing the manufacturer's output uncertainty shows that the most favorable complete output probability for the retailer is lower than the manufacturer's optimal complete output probability. Extending the model to consider the existence of external financial institutions, the manufacturer's financing model selection plan was obtained. This research provides theoretical support and reference for the financing and operation decisions of retailers, manufacturers, and external financial institutions in the context of supply chain finance.</jats:p>"

Agricultural costs and product sales prices in the agricultural year 2017–2023 in Luoyang Plain and its surrounding areas were collected for this purpose. Optimal irrigation strategies according to different water price scenarios were considered to calculate water use efficiency and net profit. In the conditions of optimal distribution, the amount of allocated water was 7,809, 2,928, 3,904, and 1,789 m3/ha for the stages of vegetative growth, flowering, crop formation, and ripening by the proposed model. On the other hand, it is necessary to reduce water stress in the periods of clustering and seed filling to increase crop yield and net income, as well as to achieve the desired irrigation schedule. Effective rainfall, especially in the ripening stage of the crop, can be considered to determine the optimal volume of water harvesting from the river. In addition, the results showed that by reducing the amount of available water, the water model allocated to leaf greening and tillering stages decreases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Renewable jet fuel (RJF) production has been recognized as a promising approach for reducing the aviation sector's carbon footprint. Over the last decade, commercial production of RJF has piqued the interest of airlines and governments around the world. However, RJF production can be challenging due to its dispersed supply resources. Furthermore, the production of RJF is more costly compared to producing conventional jet fuel. In this study, using a mixed integer linear program (MILP), we design an RJF supply chain network in which we obtain an optimized configuration of the supply chain and determine operational decisions required to meet RJF demand at airports. To accelerate commercialization of RJF production, we considered four different monetary incentive programs, which could cover the supply chain&amp;rsquo;s costs. This study is validated by employing the model to design an RJF supply chain in the Midwestern US. Results from this study are promising as they show the supply chain can achieve commercialization with partial financial coverage from the incentive programs. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers can devise policies to commercialize RJF production and accelerate its adoption by industry.</jats:p>"

The data used in the research was obtained from the Ministry of Trade and Industry of West Sumatra, including the production variables, employment, investment, and other variables that influence the production activities. A regression equation connecting production factors and production levels is formulated. Furthermore, another regression equation is also formulated by considering the electricity interruption factor, namely the SAIDI index on production levels. The effect of electrical power interruptions is then evaluated by comparing the two equations. The research results show that the most significant production loss occurred in 2019, 16.07 hours/year, while the most negligible loss occurred in 2015, 6.53 hours/year. Trend data collected during the research period regarding loss conditions and interruption parameters shows that electricity disturbances do not have a linear impact on production losses. The research also shows that electric power does not significantly impact the production activities of small and medium enterprises in West Sumatra.</jats:p>"

These new developments are shown to yield new insights into the established themes of reconciling demand and supply in the theory of long-run growth, and the relationship between distribution and growth.

This article aims to plan the two objectives of water supply and reducing the environmental effects of nitrates in rice cultivation and analyzing the maximum and minimum benefits. By modifying the methods of fertilization and water distribution, the amount of production can be gradually increased by taking into account the harmful effects on the environment. Water and nitrate have a synergistic effect on the growth of paddy rice. However, the amount of runoff that is affected by nitrates is directly related to the pollution of aquatic environments. The results confirmed the correlation between nitrate concentration and production and reported the reduction of its negative effects depending on the management of inflow and outflow to rice fields. Changing the outflow according to the fertilization time and the inflow rate is an effective solution in the fertilizer nitrogen uptake and reducing the nitrate concentration in surface water sources in the long term.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the quick rise in cross-border e-commerce and the expansion of global economic integration, cross-border e-commerce logistics alliances now present new opportunities and potential. Simultaneously, research on risk concerns in cross-border e-commerce in the modern era has drawn interest. This paper considers the special scenario of cross-border e-commerce supply chain disruptions, analyzes the main decision-making behaviors of key entities in the cross-border e-commerce logistics alliance under normal and risk scenarios, and based on this, constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model among cross-border e-commerce platforms, logistics service providers, and overseas merchants. The article analyzes the evolutionary stability of strategy choices for all participants, discusses the impact of various elements on the strategy choices of the three parties, and conducts a simulation analysis of the dynamic game of strategy choices for the three parties under the influence of different parameters using MATLAB 2021a software. The findings of the study demonstrate the following: (1) The reduction in the allocation coefficient for additional total costs of logistics service providers, the increase in the overall losses of the alliance due to customer complaints, and the increase in compensation rulings by the platform for supply chain risks faced by merchants will all encourage logistics service providers to actively pursue service innovation strategies and prompt overseas merchants to actively participate in alliance cooperation. However, an increase in overall risk costs and an increase in opportunity costs for merchants will raise the costs of tripartite alliance cooperation, thus hindering cross-border e-commerce logistics alliance collaboration. At the same time, when logistics service providers receive punishment from the platform and face potentially increased losses due to complaints, this will not only enhance the platform’s control over logistics service providers but also reduce the enthusiasm of logistics service providers to pursue service innovation strategies. (2) As the main body of the alliance, cross-border e-commerce platforms should coordinate the participants, constrain the behaviors of the participating entities within the alliance through setting reasonable reward and punishment mechanisms, and ensure the comprehensive benefits of the cross-border e-commerce logistics alliance through the combined effect of different exogenous variables. Finally, through the analysis, verification, and explanation of the established model and methods, the effectiveness and applicability of the model and methods are confirmed, providing certain strategic support and a development reference for actively establishing cross-border e-commerce logistics alliances to promote cross-border e-commerce trade.</jats:p>"

Given that the car industry in any country is one of the indicators of development because of its value and special place in industrial production and the after-sales service network, and in terms of its extensive connection to the chains of the previous and later industries, it is a key industry. And it has a high potential for employment and an effective role in economic growth and development. Therefore, this study was devoted to a case study on the supply chain of Iran Khodro Company. The goal is to identify and prioritize the supply chain risks for this company. In this regard, after identifying the effective risks in the supply chain of Iran Khodro Company, according to experts, we used the Dematel-ANP Combined Approach to rank the identified risks and apply the importance of each risk strategy and responsive programs appropriate to them.</jats:p>"

The BP neural network is used to assess the risk of business accounts receivable from the horizontal as well as vertical perspectives, respectively, and to enhance the security quality of credit supply decision-making. The results show that strengthening the management of accounts receivable enhances the robustness of corporate accounting, keeps the rate of change in surplus around 0.4% per year, and the accounts receivable turnover rate reaches a maximum of 15.9 times/year so that the business credit supply decision will be more prudent.</jats:p>",

During the Covid-19 pandemic there were a number of high-profile organised food defence attacks on the food industry using ransomware, leading to imperative questions over the extent of the sector’s vulnerability to cyber-attack. This paper explores food defence through the lens of contemporary ransomware attacks in order to frame the need for an effective ransomware defence strategy at organisational and industry level. Food defence strategies have historically focused on extortion and sabotage as threats, but often in terms of physical rather than cyber-related attacks. The globalisation, digitalisation and integration of food supply chains can increase the level of vulnerability to ransomware. Ransomware is an example of an organised food defence threat that can operationalise both extortion and sabotage, but the perpetrators are remote, non-visible and often anonymous. Organisations need to adopt an effective food defence strategy that reduces the risk of a ransomware attack and can enable targeted and swift action in the event an incident occurs. Further collaboration between government and the private sector is needed for the development of effective governance structures addressing the risk of ransomware attacks. The novelty of this article lies in analysing the issue of ransomware attacks from the perspective of the food sector and food defence strategy. This study is of potential interest to academics, policy makers and those working in the industry.</jats:p>"

The association between SCI and service performance was also studied. Data were collected from four-star and five-star hotels in Egypt. A total of 114 responses were obtained. The PLS-SEM technique and SmartPLS 4.0 software were employed for analysis. The study revealed that absorptive capacity has an impact on SCI and service performance. There is also a positive relationship between SCI and service performance. Specifically, a positive influence of internal integration and customer integration on service performance was found. However, supplier integration shows no significant relationship with service performance. This suggests that enhancing awareness of customer needs and internal coordination improves service performance. From a practical viewpoint, managers must promote a learning culture, foster innovation, and encourage internal and external collaboration. These factors were identified as key components that can improve service performance and lead to the development of competitive advantage, as shown in this paper. In addition, supply chain vitality was found to enhance quality and service, particularly when there is coordination between departments and consideration of customer needs. This study is among the earliest to examine how absorptive capacity affects both supply chain integration and service performance in the hotel industry. The research contributes at a theoretical level by shedding light on the role of absorptive capacity in the development of competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

These arrangements shape the criminal networks that exploit protected wildlife.

The purpose is to improve the temperature behaviour inside the building and to tackle comfort problems such as overheating and undercooling which cannot be coped with by the standard heating curve. The Q-learning controller considers predicted future weather data as system states. This can be shown to be superior to Q-learning controllers without weather prediction. Furthermore, in order for the controller to capture different thermal effects of different time constants, a cascaded control structure is designed: An inner Q-learning based controller deals with thermal effects of smaller time constants. It is wrapped by an outer slower Q-learning controller which can tackle effects of larger time constants. Therewith, further improvement of comfort can be achieved.</jats:p>",

This paper studies how firms react to electoral violence using the case of Kenyan flower exporters during the 2008 postelection violence as an example. The violence induced a large negative supply shock that reduced exports primarily through workers' absence and had heterogeneous effects: larger firms and those with direct contractual relationships in export markets suffered smaller production and loss of workers. On the demand side, global buyers were not able to shift sourcing to Kenyan exporters located in areas not directly affected by the violence or to neighboring Ethiopian suppliers. Consistent with difficulties in ensuring against supply-chain risk disruptions caused by electoral violence, firms in direct contractual relationships ramp up shipments just before the subsequent 2013 presidential election to mitigate risk.</jats:p>",

The current difficulty in sharing supply chain information is significant, and there are issues of information asymmetry and incompleteness among co participants. In order to improve the integrity and efficiency of supply chain information sharing and enhance the competitiveness of the high supply chain, this article conducts in‐depth research on the path of supply chain information sharing using Internet of Things technology. This article first analyzes the level of information sharing, influencing factors, and existing problems, then explores the Internet of Things technology, and finally establishes specific methods and means for the supply chain information sharing path through the Internet of Things technology. To verify the effectiveness of the supply chain information sharing path based on the Internet of Things, in this article, a comparison was made between the development effects of enterprise supply chains before and after applying the supply chain information sharing path based on the Internet of Things. The results show that after applying the IoT based supply chain information sharing path, the market price, production capacity, and market forecasting ability of enterprises have all increased by more than 20%. The conclusion indicates that the Internet of Things can help optimize supply chain information sharing and provide a new perspective for enterprise supply chain management and development.</jats:p>",

The Augmented Dickey–Fuller unit root test and the Phillips–Perron unit root test are utilized to confirm that the variables are stationary. In the bounds test of the NARDL as well as Johansen–Juselius cointegration test, this study finds evidence of cointegration amongst variable used in the study. NARDL testing model is employed to investigate the dissimilar influences on variables with short- and long-run dynamics. Short-term estimates suggest that the money supply ( M1) is most responsive to positive shocks involving retail payments, the exchange rate and interest rates, but negative shocks involving card payment and prepaid payment instruments. A reduction in card payment, as well as a positive increase in retail payment, the prepaid payment instrument, the exchange rate and the interest rate, would all have major effects on M3 in short run. In addition, a long-term finding demonstrates that all of the variables have a significant influence on the money supply ( M1) in its mixed form while all of the factors, with the exception of the one involving card payments, have a considerable impact on the money supply ( M3). Wald test results confirm the existence of asymmetric influences which can have significant lessons for policymakers. </jats:p>"

For the first time, using the SDG mapping algorithms, this article focused on 7009 publications from 2013 to 2022 mapped explicitly to 17 SDGs. This study uses bibliometric and science mapping techniques to create a detailed mapping between GSCM research and SDGs. This study created an SDG citation network to show how specific SDGs are related to GSCM practices. The most mapped SDGs in this study are SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals). Our results showed that GSCM research mainly focuses on three thematic areas: industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chains, GSCM practice coordination, and sustainable environmental policy management. This also includes integrating the circular economy into GSCM, sustainable sourcing, supply chain resilience, digital transformation in GSCM for better environmental performance, and the social impact of GSCM. A shift towards integrating sustainability into supply chain processes has been found. Environmental management, performance monitoring, and new technologies like Industry 4.0 and AI have been used to support the SDGs. International interest and collaboration in GSCM research can be seen from the bibliographic coupling study covering countries like Europe, Western Countries, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe. This study shows how GSCM can directly address global challenges identified by the United Nations by mapping GSCM research to specific SDGs.</jats:p>"

The outbreak disrupted many organizations' supply chains, and supply chain disruption is an extremely serious issue for organizations. Traditional supply chain risk management is based on analyzing historical understanding of the extent of an event's impact. However, when faced with a rare and severe catastrophic event such as COVID-19, traditional approaches struggle to quantify the risk due to a lack of historical data, leading to serious losses for organizations. Describing the supply chain through mathematical modeling and data analytics allows predictions to be more realistic and forward-looking, helping to counter or respond to the risk of supply chain disruption during a pandemic. These strategies not only reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions faced by organizations but also drive digital transformation and improve the competitiveness of organizations. This paper highlights how AI-based data collection and analysis methods in the context of epidemics can help companies better respond to the risk of supply chain disruption and achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>"

In this report, we propose novel chip-embedded package that uses Semi-additive metallization with non-prepreg coreless substrate and 300 mm square Panel-level manufacturing for cost competitiveness.</jats:p> <jats:p>In the case of a prepreg substrate, it is difficult to make large thermal vias due to presence of glass cloth and the presence of the substrate core makes thickness reduction difficult. Because of such difficulties, prepreg substrate packages have limited characteristics around thermal performance and thickness.</jats:p> <jats:p>Our proposed structure has excellent heat dissipation and minimized thickness due to using thin non-prepreg coreless substrates that allows for large thermal vias by a laser drill and the thin package. We performed thermal resistance simulations and found that our package improved up to 43% as compared to the prepreg package. And also, our build-up interlayer material has close CTE to Cu-RDL and a low Young’s modulus that is effective in reducing package warpage. As a result of simulation, package warpage after post-curing is just 1/10th of that of the prepreg package, this means highly reliable on board. Developments using Si power die will be reviewed. We believe our proposed new package is also suitable for high performance package utilizing GaN and SiC.</jats:p>"

In order to solve the above problems, this article intends to use multimedia technology to control computer viruses, and proposes a virus control method based on SICES model. According to the controlled SICES model and the set objective function, the influence of users' online behavior patterns on virus propagation can be explored, and an optimal control problem is proposed. Through theoretical analysis, the existence of optimal control is proved, and the optimal system is obtained. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the optimal control strategy. In addition, in order to optimize the objective function to make its value smaller, and to control the proportion of infected nodes at a lower level, users should choose the corresponding online behavior mode according to different network structures. For example, on the WS small world network, the network should be frequently disconnected or always kept online.</p>",

The specific objectives are: to identify and characterise the types of enterprises operating in automotive supply chains, to identify changes during the pandemic in automotive enterprises, depending on the type of activity, to show disruptions in automotive supply chains and ways to counteract these disadvantages depending on the type of activity. Automotive enterprises operating in Poland were selected for the study purposefully. A random selection method was used to select 500 automotive companies for the study. The data sources were surveys conducted in June 2023 among 500 enterprises in the form of a face-to-face telephone interview. Automotive companies experienced supply chain disruptions, regardless of the type of business. Most often, these were caused by lockdowns and official closures, low stocks of materials and products, and problems with employees. There was no difference by type of business. Disruptions were most often short-lived, up to 1 year. Companies countered disruptions by using mostly operational measures, which were short-lived. Only a small percentage of operators made strategic decisions and countered disruptions over a longer period. The scale of these actions was greater among manufacturers than among dealers and car service companies.</jats:p>"

To compete in the global scene, firms need to transform their supply chains to adhere to eco-friendly practices. This study focuses on the electronics market, which is distinctively interesting due to its small product life cycles, high-end capabilities, and fierce competition. A novel research model comprising nine hypotheses that attempt to investigate and assess the factors influencing customers’ perceptions and purchasing preferences in relation to green supply chains in the electronics industry was developed. We conducted field research to test the model empirically using survey data from 147 individuals with different backgrounds. The dataset was verified and validated by means of explanatory factor analysis. Structural equation modeling analysis was performed that revealed the linkage between demographics (age), willingness to pay, purchasing intention, and green consumerism. Other research findings included the intricate interconnections between environmental concern, knowledge, attitude, customers’ perceptions/effectiveness, and behavior. This research gives insights into green consumerism in the electronics sector, and its managerial implications can guide sustainable supply chain practices and customer-centric marketing approaches.</jats:p>"

Although the national level of water supply and sanitation facility coverage is 88 and 98 percent respectively, only 25.4% of water supply projects are fully functional. The performance assessment of completed piped water supply scheme should to be assessed for the functionality and sustainability of the project. With an example of Kawasoti Small Town Water Supply Project (KSTWSP), performance of the service provider is assessed in terms of physical state, functionality, customer satisfaction, water resource management, financial management and human resource management. The major findings were that bacterial removal efficiency of slow sand filter is greater than 95 % and the turbidity from the outlet of slow sand filter was found to be less than 0.1 NTU. The study of financial data of Kawasoti WUSC shows that operating revenue is sufficient to cover the operating expenses of WUSC. The water demand for the year 2075 to 2086 were found to be (7.32, 7.58, 7.84, 8.12, 8.40, 8.69, 8.99, 9.31, 9.68, 10.07, 10.47, 10.89, 11.33 and 11.79) MLD respectively. The water production was taken as an average of 9.94 MLD. The analysis shows up to the year 2083, the system will be able to meet the water demand. So after 2083, the WUSC might need to make necessary arrangement for additional water sources to meet the water demand. Staff productivity index has been 3.70 from the year 2070 to 2075, which indicates efficient utilization of the staff. Thus the study concluded that the performance of Kawasoti WUSC is up to satisfactory level till this study year 2075.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is shown that maintaining a balance between the production and consumption of electric energy is an important condition for the stable operation of modern energy supply systems. The active increase in the share of renewable energy sources forces the use of new algorithms for balancing demand and supply, in particular, at the expense of flexibility. This implies the need to implement new technological solutions and approaches to balancing the modes of generation and consumption (the ability to quickly respond to changes in demand and supply), which, in turn, requires a detailed analysis of energy exchange processes in electric power systems.&#x0D;\nIt is recognized that there is a need for an in-depth analysis of the balance of energy components, and an assessment of electromagnetic compatibility in electric power systems, especially in the conditions of the growing influence of renewable energy sources on local electricity markets. Analysis of various factors influencing technological solutions and cooperation of different market parties are key components for developing effective management strategies and ensuring the stability of the electric power system.&#x0D;\nThe peculiarities of the analysis of energy exchange processes in local electric power systems with the determination of exchange capacities, which are integral characteristics of the influence of various factors of the non-acidity of electricity on exchange processes, are considered. It is proposed to balance the components of electric energy on the basis of exchange processes in controlled intersections of local electric power systems using the components of instantaneous power at each energetically constant state. The exchange processes in local electric power systems are analyzed with the selection of different modes of their operation, in particular, when assessing the level of electromagnetic compatibility of the elements of the local electric power systems.&#x0D;\nThe introduction of exchange capacities made it possible to develop indicators for assessing the level of electromagnetic compatibility of the elements of the local system. To estimate the share of consumers' contribution to the deterioration of the quality of electricity at the common connection point, an algorithm for evaluating the mutual influence of elements is proposed, with the allocation of the element's contribution to the distortion of electricity in the controlled intersection and the analysis of the magnitude of the influence of distorting factors on electromagnetic processes in the system element.&#x0D;\nAn optimization model for achieving the specified levels of balancing (flexibility) in local electric power systems with energy accumulators has been developed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Various explanations and ideas of Supply Chains (SC) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) have emerged owing to the rise in global sourcing since the 1980s. Manufacturers agree that a solid Supply Chain and efficient resource allocation are crucial after the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers and producers are more aware of their products' environmental implications. The environment and society are threatened by population growth and economic activity. Circular Economy (CE) concepts like logistics, vendor management, and resource mapping can boost an organization's performance. The relationship between CE and SCM can be understood in several ways, one of which is Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). SSCM adds social and environmental factors to supply chain procedures, increasing a company's long-term success. Before utilizing SSCM, focus organizations must create an effective information process method to address supply chain uncertainty, hazards, and information-sharing questions. Digitization and circular development can give manufacturers long-term benefits. Information Digital and Technology (IDT) was first used in supply chain management with EDI, ERP, and computer-aided technologies. AI, IoT, BDA, Cloud, and Blockchain Technology (BT) have gained traction as IDT that could improve SSCM today. Environmental challenges that may affect human cultures and well-being are significant concerns as Food Supply Chains (FSC) expand to satisfy seasonal food demand, sustainability, and safety. As a result, the meaning of SSCM has emerged in recent years to address the growing concern over sustainability in the FSC. FSC was made more sustainable by measures such as the use of technology, improved resource effectiveness, staff education, and a better knowledge of customer demand.</jats:p>"

Can the energy exchange between supply and demand offer hope via effective management of BESS operations? How will the depth of discharge in microgrids affect individual BESS prosumers? Motivated by such questions, this study determines the minimum energy costs and optimal energy management considering the BESS discharge depth for industrial prosumers with different PV power production to electricity demand ratios. In addition, the impact of Epv/Eload and depth of discharge on individual PV-BESS microgrid prosumers is evaluated annually from a technical, economic, and environmental perspective. Moreover, considering the negative impact of the self-consumption rate (SCR) on the low voltage distribution network (overvoltage, power loss, etc.), unfavorable depth of discharge thresholds and Epv /Eload are determined. The optimization framework is built in Python Gurobi, and Mixed Integer Linear Programming solves the complex problem. The results show that a higher Epv /Eload can reduce the cost of energy (COE) by up to 84.1% and increase the renewable fraction (RF) and electricity sales revenues by up to 61% and up to 570.25 $/yr. It also emphasizes that for Prosumer 5, with the highest Epv /Eload (176.5%), each depth of discharge is not feasible due to SCR. In contrast, a higher depth of discharge can increase CO2 reduction by up to 4.45 tons/yr and thus provide additional revenues of up to 197.41 $/yr. Evaluating BESS operations in microgrid energy management will help many stakeholders determine reliable investments and help in the planned transition to clean energy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study integrates the elaboration likelihood model, institutional theory, and the image management perspective to identify the internal and external forces that can effectively drive firms to adopt a green supply chain. Using survey data from a sample of 246 firms in the Chinese manufacturing sector, we empirically examine how the internal green process and green product innovation of firms and different types of external institutional pressures contribute to their adoption of a green supply chain, which in turn can explain the variation in their environmental and new-product development performance. Results of our structural equation modeling analysis reveal that the internal green process and green product innovation of firms and three types of external institutional pressures (i.e., coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures) play an important role in driving green supply chain adoption. Moreover, firms can improve their environmental and new-product development performance by adopting a green supply chain. In addition, though the image management motivation of firms tends to play a negative moderating role in the relationship between their green process innovation and green supply chain adoption, such motivation positively moderates the contribution of coercive pressure to their green supply chain adoption. Our findings can help explain why emerging-market firms tend to adopt a green supply chain and do not follow the pattern predicted by classical strategic management theories. The results of our study clearly demonstrate the determinants and consequences of the adoption of a green supply chain of firms and confirm that their green supply chain adoption can exert a positive effect on their environmental and new-product development performance. Overall, our research highlights the importance of recognizing internal innovation and external institutional forces in driving the green supply chain adoption of firms, which in turn will contribute to their environmental and new-product development performance. In this regard, our study extends the stream of research on green supply chains and sheds new light on the importance of abandoning the conventional supply chain and adopting a green one. Our study also provides important implications for research, practice, and policymaking.</jats:p>"

This paper builds a two-tier newsvendor model composed of a single supplier and a single retailer and introduces Nash bargaining as a reference for fairness. We investigate (1) the impact of fairness concerns on the performance of a retailer-dominated supply chain and a manufacturer-dominated supply chain; (2) how demand uncertainty affects the inequitable state; and (3) how overestimated and underestimated values of fairness concerns affect supply chain performance when fairness concerns are private information. After solving the equilibrium solution of the Stackelberg game and Nash-bargaining games and numerical analyses, it is shown that unilateral fairness concerns by the Stackelberg leader or follower can motivate the leader to sacrifice its profit to reduce their income inequality by offering a coordinating wholesale price. Of course, it is also effective for both participants to be fair-minded as soon as their fairness sensitivity is moderate enough. However, followers’ fairness concerns are more effective at decreasing inequity, while leaders can improve social welfare, i.e., increase the entire supply chain’s efficiency as well as market scale. We also find that in a more uncertain market, fewer fairness-concerned participants are supposed to reach a relatively fair condition. In addition, we conclude that sometimes asymmetric information about fairness concerns can improve the profit share of the disadvantaged and even channel efficiency. This paper extends the study of Nash-bargaining fairness concerns to retailer-dominated newsvendor models and enriches the field, when fairness concerns are asymmetric information.</jats:p>"

Presuming that they had a Capper-Volstead Act immunity, the CWT cooperatives acted in a cartel-like manner to decrease milk supply to increase and stabilize milk prices received by dairy farmers. While the program may have modestly increased seller market power of dairy farmers, seller market power of dairy cooperatives involved in cheese manufacturing decreased. This is because the cost of milk used in cheese manufacturing increased at a higher rate than wholesale cheese prices, which caused wholesale cheese margins to decrease.</jats:p>",

Indeed, the compliance of vehicle operational requirements with service characteristics is essential to provide users with an efficient offer. To this end, this study investigates the factors affecting such choices by performing two evaluation procedures, with the integration of different techniques and the engagement of an expert panel. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to identify the best power supply technology among a few solutions in both procedures, which differed in the number of analyzed criteria. A literature review suggested a wide set of criteria considered in the first assessment, which were then limited to the most influential criteria using the fuzzy DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Notably, the latter enabled the reduction in the number of the criteria owing to the revealing of cause–effect relationships among them. The methodology was applied to a case study in the city of Trieste, Italy, comparing rankings obtained from the two appraisal procedures, which showed the predominance of internal combustion engine buses over hybrid and electric buses in terms of operational and financial aspects, despite their environmental impact.</jats:p>"

The research method used was a literature study with data sourced from Central Statistics Agency data and other sources in the form of scientific journals, scientific articles, and other valid information from print and digital media. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive analysis techniques. Based on the data obtained, it is known that the development of the purebred chicken population and demand for chicken eggs in South Sulawesi from 2018-2022 fluctuates and tends to increase. along with population growth in South Sulawesi. The production of purebred chicken eggs in South Sulawesi over the last 5 years has fluctuated. The number of egg production increased significantly by 38% from 2018 to 2019 and decreased in 2020 and 2021. Then the number of egg production increased again by 6.49% from 2021 to 2022. This happened because consumer demand for purebred chicken eggs increased. Thus, it can be said that people need purebred chicken eggs to meet their needs for animal protein sources. Factors that influence the demand and supply of broiler eggs in South Sulawesi are fluctuating egg prices, producer profits, raw materials (feed and seeds), demand, and disease outbreaks.</jats:p>"

One billion urban residents worldwide already face intermittent piped water access, making their public water supply unreliable and unequal. Thus, effective investments in water infrastructure improvements are critical. In a recent WRR paper, Jeuland et al. (2023, <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033897\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033897</jats:ext-link>) evaluate the impacts of a large infrastructure improvement project on various water security metrics and assess the challenges of such an investigation. They apply a rigorous difference‐in‐difference approach to data from a US$275 million investment in upgrades to water supply and sewage networks in the Zarqa governorate in arid Jordan, analyzing its effects on households, businesses, farms, and the water utility. The authors find a range of moderate improvements to water access and re‐use metrics, including a significant reduction in reported shortages. Key water security indicators related to access intermittency, however, such as the supply duration per day and the expenditure on water deliveries by tanker trucks, saw little to no improvement. The findings reveal that the efforts required to overcome the insecurity and inequity of intermittent public water supply systems might be considerably larger than expected. This suggests an urgent need to further enhance both the accuracy of impact evaluation methods and the effectiveness of infrastructure investments to support the pursuit of SDG 6.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic occurred in the world in January 2020. Without\nspecific vaccines and antiviral treatments, the virus easily spreads across different parts\nof the world. Accordance to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has\nwidely spread to nearly all countries across six geographical regions (i.e., Western\nPacific, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, Europe, and Americas). In\ndoing so, different countries implemented various preventive measures like hand\nwashing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing to minimize the transmission\nof the virus. However, such preventive measures are short-term, ineffective, and may\nnot be sustainable. The introduction of common vaccination campaigns is viewed as a\nvital effective way to against COVID-19. Over 60 vaccines for COVID-19 are either\npreviously endorsed or going through clinical experiments. As expected, there will be\nan increasing need for people to accept vaccine injections. The vaccine is a highly\nvulnerable, high-value, and rare product in the world. As such, resilient vaccine supply\nchain management is urgently needed. Otherwise, the inferior quality of vaccines poses\nglobal health risks and causes the problem of wasting useful medical supplies.\nNevertheless, some logistics firms encountered unfolded logistics challenges of the\nCOVID-19 vaccine due to a lack of professionals, capacity, data integrity, inventory\nmanagement, fluctuating demand, and geographic risk (e.g., vibration, location, shock,\nand temperature. In particular, most logistics firms and health specialists encounter\nsevere challenges in managing the vaccine supply chain in remote areas or developing\ncountries. Although the vaccine is a global and hot issue for researchers, industrial\npractitioners, local communities, and policymakers, there is scanty attention to\ninvestigating the establishment of a resilience vaccine supply chain management in the\ncontext of COVID-19. At present, only a few research groups have discussed the role\nof blockchain in vaccine supply chain management, however, the information is not\nenough to reveal the impact on how vaccine supply chain management of blockchain\ncan mitigate the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, this chapter will mainly focus on the\noverview of the influenza pandemic around the globe, the existing situation of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in the world and Hong Kong, the current development of\nvaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of blockchain in the vaccine\nsupply chain, and the vaccine logistics in COVID-19.</jats:p>",

The current labor market remains strong, and inflation is showing signs of slowing down. In addition, the bargaining power is weaker now than in the 1970s; higher productivity resulting from innovative technology and the trend of a more integrated global economy, which help to mitigate the impact of inflation. Policy solutions are proposed to address the challenges of easing supply pressure, promoting industrial development, and ensuring employment. The three key policy suggestions are as follows: energy transition incentives, research and development grants, skills development initiatives.

Leveraging data from a prominent North India-based dairy company, Company ‘X’, an ARIMA model is applied for predicting monthly milk production trends. Utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS STATISTICS 20) software, the study forecasts Company ‘X’s monthly milk production and identifies four distinct ARIMA models based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). By comparing predicted and actual milk production values (April–October 2021), sustainability metrics are integrated into ARIMA forecasts. Implications for the dairy sector’s sustainability and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are assessed through error terms such as R squared (R2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

When conducting a literature search, the following databases were used as follows: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, MedLine, Global Health, RSCI, as well as a search method based on keywords and citations. The purpose of the review is that despite the large number of developed technologies and various reagents, the problem of removing anthropogenic and anthropogenic pollutants from natural water purification cannot be considered to be solved. Water purification technologies are being improved; their effectiveness largely depends on the intensification of reagent treatment.\r\nIn addition to generally accepted laboratory studies of the reagents used in water treatment, it is necessary to conduct production tests to clarify the parameters of the health risk and toxicity of the transformation products formed during the water treatment process, as well as to study the effectiveness and safety of a set of reagents that together enter the water treatment process. The hygienic assessment of reagents should take into account the actual conditions of their use in drinking water supply practice, including further stages of water treatment. This concerns the assessment of the possible destruction of polymers during the production of composite reagents, the assessment of modifying additives included in their composition, the transformation of polymers in water during chlorination, chloramination, ozonation, under the influence of ultraviolet irradiation, and adjustment of a set of mandatory controlled indicators. To conduct these studies, laboratories must have publicly available analytical methods that allow accurately determining the presence of monomers, polymers, as well as various additives and transformation products in concentrations actually present in drinking water.</jats:p>",

The consequences of our examination show that a few respondents have a good understanding of blockchain innovation and know about its expected advantages in further developing security, guaranteeing information respectability and diminishing extortion. In any case, there are other people who have restricted mindfulness or more prominent interest in embracing the innovation. Taken together, the outcomes recommend that further exploration is expected to work with the broad adoption of blockchain innovation for supply network deriving the Indian online business in retail space. Likewise, obviously there are as yet exceptional issues in the implementation of blockchain innovation in e-commerce sector.</jats:p>",

They are also important for tracking lead or copper release in the distribution system before, during, and after a treatment strategy is in place. A major debate is whether to use test pieces of pipe harvested from the distribution system or to use conditioned new metal surfaces. Harvested and conditioned new test pieces were studied in multiple types of water systems using analysis of chemical scales, biofilms, and metals release data. It was found that both methods of testing are equally valid if procedures follow certain conditions: (1) apparatus configuration and operation are consistent, (2) properties of distribution system pipe wall accumulations are known, (3) dissolved and particulate metal fractions are determined, and (4) apparatus metal release data are correlated with residential data. The use of conditioned new test pieces, obtainable with relative ease, lowers corrosion control study costs, providing a tool for water systems of all sizes to select the most effective corrosion control strategy and to pro-actively track lead and copper release trends in the distribution system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Rwandan Freight forwarders federation (RWAFFA) was established in 2013 to deal with the fragility that was in the clearing and forwarding industry, which worked without defined and professional procedures that led to poor and inefficient practices within the industry. The objective of this study was to examine inbound logistics metrics on the performance of Freight forwarders federation in Rwanda. A case of RWAFFA in Kicukiro District. This study was guided by three specific objectives which are toto evaluate order fulfilment accuracy level of freight forwarders in Rwanda, to determine the status of on time delivered shipments, in case of freight forwarders in Rwanda and to analyse the degree of safety for goods handled by freight forwarders in Rwanda. The research was of great significant to the researcher, MKU and freight forwarding Industry in Rwanda. The descriptive research design with two mixed approach of qualitative and quantitative was used to collect data by use of interview guide and questionnaire. The 160 respondents of the study were selected from the target population of 246 including employees from RWAFFA management team, clearing agents and importers firms operating in Kicukiro District using the Krejcie and Morgan table with a simple random and census method of selecting the sample size. The collected results were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis with use of percentage, mean and standard deviation and inferential statistics by the use of Pearson correlation (r) and multiple linear logistic regression analysis. Data were also presented in figure, tables and narratives because the qualitative data were analyzed with the use of thematic analysis which require the researcher to present the qualitative results in narrative. In this study, research findings showed that inbound logistic metrics were adopted to reduce the damaged shipment in freight forwarding within Rwandan Freight Forwarders association (RWAFFA).Therefore,The intercept of the regression was 13.803 and statistically significant p= 0.000).While the coefficient of order accuracy was 0.100 and p = 0.003. On time delivery had an intercept of 0.043 but significant at 0.002 and finally safety of goods had it at 0.065 and also positive. Despite the problem arising within Rwandan freight forwarders association in Kicukiro District such as Inadequate Performance measurement and metrics pertaining to SCM, lack of professionalism, clear regulations and to some extend absence of documented procedures to follow, delays and unreliability, lack of previous empirical research that examined the effects of inbound logistics metrics on performance of freight forwarders. The current success in implantation of inbound logistic metrics was contributed to the performance of freight forwarders federations.

The research methodology included analysis of the literature and focus group discussions. The study began with an analysis of solar cell industry patents from the past decade using the WIPS Global Patent database to identify projects with the highest patent count. Subsequently, through the use of focus group discussions, the feasibility of a patent pool strategy within the supply chain was explored. Finally, a strategy framework was proposed for project-based patent pool licensing, focusing on the top 15 projects with the highest count of 5579 patents. The results indicate that adopting this strategy framework for supply chain manufacturer patents can result in higher commercial patent value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the concept of procurement practices has been studied, the relationship between strategic procurement management and organisational performance has yet to be discovered. Informed by this besetting reality, solid evidence that validates the connection is required to conceptualise procurement management. Thus, the study sought to assess the relationship between procurement management and organisational performance at the leading organisation in the health sector in Zimbabwe. The study adopted a descriptive research design and quantitative research approach. The data was collected from a sample of 40 respondents who comprised the supply chain leaders of a global public health organisation in Zimbabwe. The respondents were randomly selected, and data were collected using a closed-ended questionnaire. The study's key findings indicated that sound procurement management improves organisational performance at a global public health organization in Zimbabwe. The study established that promoting e-procurement system management and strategic buyer-supplier relationships significantly contribute to organisational performance. Therefore, the study recommends that management adopt an electronic procurement system and e-procurement management and forge robust strategic buyer-supplier relationships to improve organisational performance.</jats:p>"

Various interest groups, including energy businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), start-ups, information technology developers, financial institutions, national authorities, and the academic community, have shown interest in this matter. The enhancement of daily corporate operations is projected to be achieved by several means, such as the decentralization of authority in transactions, installation of the Internet of Things (IoT), and utilization of smart contracts. Digitalization is already prevalent in several solutions within the energy sector, including smart grids, smart meters, and electric vehicles. Furthermore, the academic literature has developed a novel idea known as the Internet of Energy (IoE). This article examines the degree of trust and maturity associated with the use of Blockchain technology. The authors have developed the Blockchain Maturity Questionnaire to assess these factors. The database comprises replies obtained from experts in high management positions within the renewable energy sector. The report provides an overview of the current understanding of Blockchain technology, highlighting its primary advantages and challenges in implementation. Additionally, it examines the extent to which firms are inclined to use this technology into their future operations. The valuable input from industry professionals facilitated the development of a comprehensive plan, referred to as the \"Roadmap for Blockchain Adoption,\" which outlines the integration of blockchain technology into forthcoming energy systems.</jats:p>"

Although the impact of magnesium deficiency on plants has been reported from numerous studies, the responses of plants to excess magnesium salt levels have received less attention. Using five different magnesium levels (0, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 ppm) and two magnesium sources (MgSO4 and MgCl2), this study evaluated the effect of excess magnesium salts on rice production and associated physiological processes on a hybrid rice cultivar ‘XP 753’. Rice morphological and physiological parameters, including plant growth, biomass, root morphological features, tissue and grain mineral concentrations, membrane injury (MI), chlorophyll, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, proline concentrations, as well as gas exchange parameters, were evaluated. A dose-dependent reduction in above- and below-ground shoot and root morphological features was observed under the application of magnesium salts on the soil substrate. Analysis of physiological parameters demonstrated that an inhibition in plant growth, biomass, and yield was due to the decrease in total chlorophyll content, net photosynthesis rate, and membrane stability in rice. Furthermore, this study showed that the application of magnesium salts to soil interfered with the uptake and translocation of minerals and significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and proline levels, indicating the toxic effects of excess magnesium salts on rice plants.</jats:p>"

That activity is very similar to thermalism, which uses natural mineral water (NMW) captured in aquifer systems. In Portugal, thermalism is a well-established activity, and for a medical spa to be in operation, there is a legal requirement to have two specific professionals: a medical doctor—Clinical Director—and a hydrogeologist—Technical Director (TD). The exploitation of the NMW is the responsibility of the TD, a professional with know-how in the field of hydrogeology. Thus, this chapter presents an introduction with some fundamental concepts about thermalism and thalassotherapy, generic aspects of those activities in Portugal, and their objectives. Methodological elements are presented, followed by the main results and interpretations, with the physic-chemical characteristics of Portuguese NMWs; of very salty special groundwaters, not licensed as NMW; and sea and ocean waters. Finally, the main conclusions and several considerations are presented, in the sense that the practice of exploiting salty groundwater, in the proximity of the sea, will be a new field for the activity of hydrogeological professionals, provided that they are classified as NMW, to use in the thermalism activity.</jats:p>"

This research were analyzed using PIECES method and based on observations at the Sinar Buah Giwangan's store. With PIECES method, there was a serious problem that's hampering the imported fruit supply chain process. It's the stock of fruit at distributors and the distribution itself. This thing has an impact on order information, fruit distribution, and irregular fruit stock. In this research we designed a website called fruitmob. Fruitmob is a website designed to facilitate the fruit import process with a supply chain management system. In designing this website, a platform is available for distributors to provide information on fruit stocks to make it easier for retailers to access information on fruit stocks availability. This website has a feature that can display an ordering system that allows customers to track the whereabouts product they orders and received real-time updates about delivery status. By designing this website, our hope is the supply chain system for distributors and retailers can be fulfilled and resolve the problems in an integrated manner with a system design that facilitates communication to achieve maximum sales &amp; profit optimization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A current-balancing circuit for a dual-channel Ethernet power supply system is designed in this paper, which can be used to solve the mismatch between the two channels caused by unavoidable factors, such as mismatched resistances, temperatures and voltages. Based on the design, the mismatch of the currents between the two power transmission paths can be controlled to be less than 1% of the original ones. It can be operated under these conditions with the changes of the load current and the PSE output voltage. The maximum output power of the dual-channel power supply can reach up to 96.5 W. When the DC–DC conversion efficiency is less than 75%, it can still provide 72 W for the PD end, meeting the requirements of the PoE power system. The current-balancing circuit designed in the paper has potential application value to improve the dual PoE power supply system.</jats:p>"

The main results achieved in this sphere are presented, and objectives for further research are outlined. Due to the ongoing processes of digitalization and intellectualization of social and technological systems, a new concept of design and operation management, development and conservation of water supply and sanitation systems of settlements, cities, and buildings is proposed. This concept is based on the creation of digital twins of all system and subsystem elements and their management in real and virtual space using cloud technologies and specific software systems. Forthese purposes, water supply and sanitation systems are considered from the perspective of general principles of organization, hydraulic calculation, formation of operation modes, the probabilistic nature of water withdrawals and wastewater inflows, uncertainty in the behavior and prospective loads of facilities, along with other characteristics typical of large and complex systems. The paper presents the main tasks for calculating and designing water supply and sanitation systems and briefly describes possible solutions, implemented in the relevant software packages, tested in practice in the actual process of designing, operating, and maintenance of piping systems of a housing and utilities infrastructure. All optimization models are based on the lifecycle cost criteria for water and sanitation systems.</jats:p>"

The government of each region needs to strive for clean water for the community. Efforts to fulfill clean water can be realized with the Water Supply System. Water Supply System sustainability indicators need to fulfill three aspects of quality, quantity, and continuity. The aim of this research is to assess the sustainability of the ‘Sugio’ Water Supply System in Lamongan Regency which serves three villages, namely Sugio, Lebakadi, and Sekarbagus. The aspect of water quality, seen from the results of the analysis of the quality of production water, shows that it meets the quality standards as raw water for drinking water. The aspect of water quantity is calculated to meet water needs for the next 20 years. The calculations results show that the daily average debit requirement is 17 L/s and the daily maximum debit is 19 L/s, while the existing debit is 15 L/s. The aspect of water continuity is calculated from the ability to distribute water during an emergency. The calculation results show that the distribution of clean water when there is no source of electrical energy can only be carried out in a maximum of 1 hour 13 minutes 48 seconds. The conclusion obtained is that the sustainability of the ‘Sugio’ Water Supply System from the aspect of water quantity and continuity still needs to be improved.</jats:p>"

In order to achieve better research results in the safety analysis system of spacecraft energy systems, it is very necessary to establish an assessment method for the safety of spacecraft power distribution systems. Previous research mainly focuses on the safety assessment of power systems or aircraft power systems and has not formed a relatively complete assessment method for the safety of spacecraft power distribution systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation method for the safety of spacecraft power distribution systems. It combines objective and subjective evaluation methods to comprehensively evaluate the safety of spacecraft power distribution systems. The objective parameters of the spacecraft power distribution system are processed and objectively evaluated; Subjective evaluations are obtained using analytic hierarchy. The proposed method can reasonably evaluate the safety of spacecraft power distribution systems and assist in the selection of different spacecraft power distribution systems.</jats:p>",

The study aimed to assess the short-term impact of the conflict on food supply and global retail food prices resulting from the disruption of agri-food exports from Ukraine after the war outbreak. To assess the impact of the conflict on retail prices worldwide, the actual food price level during the conflict period was compared with the counterfactual values obtained from the forecasting models. The research points to a significant decline in Ukraine’s commodity exports at the beginning of the conflict leading to a supply gap for cereals in particular, affecting global access to staple foods. As a result, global food commodity prices rose sharply, however, the upsurge was short-lived, and as early as July 2022 price indices returned to their pre-war levels. On the other hand, in most regions worldwide the gradual and persistent increase in retail food prices was observed after the war outbreak. The study also found strong regional differentiation in the response of retail food prices to the conflict due to various specific factors that exacerbated or mitigated the impact of the war.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Gosaba, a village on the outskirts of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, people experience a lot of problems related to shortage of potable water due to salinity and arsenic contamination in the supplied water. Rapid growth of industrialization, increased population, saline water intrusion etc. is causing a decrease in fresh water. Due to overuse of groundwater, GWT is declining rapidly in the Gosaba region. Moreover, seawater is intruding into the groundwater, causing pollution of surface water and a rise in Fe content, Cl content, arsenic content and salinity content in groundwater of that location. The runoff available from that amount of received precipitation is estimated using two empirical equations derived by Sir Aiexander Binnie; Ingels-De Souza and T.G. Barlow and the calculation confirms a good amount of runoff that can be utilized for harvesting in order to decrease the water scarcity of the location. The scarcity of fresh water in the Gosaba location can be minimized by adopting the rainwater harvesting (RWH) method, a sustainable process to obtain disinfected water at a very low cost. The technical part of the present study is to adopt RWH where rainwater is collected from rooftop of an institute building and to design tank where water can be stored and utilized further at minimum costs.</jats:p>"

The selection process of banana suppliers has not been a factor considered by the industry in its strategic planning. The technology used should be able to produce quality processed banana products, but in reality, production is still below the available normal capacity. The distribution of processed banana products to consumers has not been well identified, and market access is still limited, resulting in stagnant industry development. The aim of this research is to identify the problems related to the performance of the banana agro-industry supply chain, measure the performance of the banana agro-industry supply chain, and provide and evaluate solutions that can be used to improve the performance of the banana agro-industry supply chain. The method used in this research is to measure the performance of the supply chain using weighting with the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, which consists of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), determining alternative solutions using the VIKOR (Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method. The results show that the identification of problems in the banana agro-industry supply chain consists of 5 main criteria and 20 sub-criteria, as well as 7 proposed solutions. The measurement of the supply chain performance resulted in a score of 32.032 (poor), indicating that the performance of the banana agro-industry supply chain is still low. The alternative solution provided to improve the performance of the banana agro-industry supply chain is to establish collaboration and partnerships among supply chain stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\r\nRecently, supply chains (SCs) are applying information technology to enable data sharing among suppliers, instant access to information, and complete tracking of products. With more cybersecurity risks present, such as theft of information, service interruptions, and financial resources risks, the vulnerability of systems is increased. The management of supply chain cybersecurity, which encompasses information systems, software, and infrastructure, is the emphasis of the supply chain's safety measure. There are several serious danger that attack supply chain systems. Most SC Cybersecurity procedures are used to reduce the threats posed by vulnerabilities to those processes. Researchers have mostly concentrated on supply chain-related cyber physical system (CPS) issues. This study makes attempts to classify and evaluate the cybersecurity insecurities of supply chains. In addition, this work provides an update of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method called α-discounting multi-criteria decision-making (α-D MCDM), which enables a more uniform assessment of supply chain cyber insecurities. This paper suggests using the α-D MCDM in various ways to address various supply chain evaluation problems.\r\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the growing severity of global environmental issues, the international community has reached a consensus on the importance of reducing and controlling carbon emissions. As a result, an increasing number of consumers are opting to purchase green products in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. This trend has prompted supply-chain enterprises to invest in green innovation. Simultaneously, carbon tax policies have gained significant attention from governments worldwide due to their dual role as environmental laws and fiscal-policy tools. Considering consumers’ preference for green products and the risk of R&amp;D failure associated with them, this study focuses on the effects on emissions reductions and profits associated with different carbon tax policies for a green supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The results reveal that (1) increases in the carbon tax per unit of product motivate the manufacturer to increase R&amp;D efforts; (2) wholesale and retail prices follow a pattern of initial increase and subsequent decrease as the carbon tax per unit of product rises; (3) higher carbon taxes per unit of product generally lead to lower manufacturer profits, while both carbon emissions and retailer profits can increase with a per-unit carbon tax under certain circumstances; and (4) the increase in the proportion of the population with green preferences can yield long-term benefits for both the retailer and the manufacturer, yielding an inverted U-shaped relationship with carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

Identifying and ranking agility factors in the SAIPA company in Iran to reach a sustainable and green supply chain is the primary purpose of this study. SAIPA is an automotive company with an extensive supply chain. The data were quantitative, and the collection was completed by reviewing the literature and questioning experts. The FANP and the OPA methods were the tools used to analyze the data. These methods are proper for facing multiple-criteria decision-making problems, as in the case of this paper. We first identified the factors (capabilities, enablers, and attributes) using a literature review. After that, we gathered the data for ranking analysis by collecting the opinions of SAIPA’s organizational experts using a pairwise comparison questionnaire for the FANP and a prioritizing list for the OPA. Both methods showed that “Quickness” is the capability with the highest priority. “Customer Sensitivity” was the most critical enabler, and “Accurate customer-based measures” was the most significant attribute of the FANP analysis. The OPA results showed that “Information Management” was the first enabler, and “Efficient funds transfer” took first place among all the attributes. Managers should pay more attention to these factors to develop agile supply chains in the SAIPA company. The results also showed that the methods proposed for multi-attribute decision-making problems like the FANP have shortcomings, such as difficulties completing the pairwise comparison matrix due to burdensome data collection in cases similar to the one in this study with many factors.</jats:p>"

Initially, a fundamental BP neural network model is developed and evaluated. Subsequently, an Adam-BP neural network model is proposed by optimizing the Adam optimizer, providing substantial technical support for enhancing the supply chain financing model and virtual economic risk control. The research results indicate significant performance improvement after applying Adam optimization to BP, with all indicators in the plant classification dataset surpassing 0.92 and those in the credit card fraud dataset increasing to above 0.9. Thus, the model presented here exhibits exceptional adaptability and offers effective technical support for optimizing the supply chain financing model and virtual economic risk control methods.</p>",

This study aims to investigate a supply chain policy that can achieve an impressive level of responsiveness, reaching close to 100%. Additionally, by focusing on the supply chain of RON 92 gasoline in Indonesia, the research aims to identify the key factors influencing responsiveness instability. To achieve these objectives, a simulation model was used to analyze the inventory policy, considering various factors such as demand, production, safety stock coverage, transportation delays, production capacity, and importation due to insufficient production capacity. The results showed that forecasting accuracy is the main determinant of the responsiveness rate. Moreover, maintaining a minimum inventory level of 28 days yielded an impressive 99% responsiveness rate, provided that the deviation in demand does not exceed 5% of the forecast. The analytical tool used in the system dynamics framework was a simulation, which significantly contributed to the research findings. However, it is important to note that this research has limitations, specifically in its inability to analyze crude oil supply. Therefore, further research is necessary to thoroughly examine this aspect and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall supply chain dynamics.</jats:p>"

This paper contends that considering the decisions made in supply chain disruption management involve groups and the individuals within them, the relevance of behavioural economic concepts becomes paramount. As such, the objective of this paper is to conduct an integrative literature review, utilising the purposive sampling method to explore the dearth of academic work connecting behavioural economic theories and organisational culture to supply chain disruption management. Additionally, the paper aims to offer guidelines for future research in this domain.

Recently, the MiSC has been disrupted, affecting mineral supply and generating uncertainty among clean energy producers. Supply chain (SC) mapping addresses this uncertainty, providing a holistic end-to-end view. However, MiSC mapping studies mainly focus on the downstream segment, leaving aside the upstream segment. In this context, the fundamental gap is the lack of standardized modelling frameworks that can accurately represent the upstream segment dynamics and, at the same time, seamlessly integrate with the downstream segment. This paper bridges this gap, designing a model for the MiSC upstream segment (MiSCOR). Framed within design science research methodology, MiSCOR is built by adapting two reference models, the Exploration and Mining Business Reference Model (EM) and the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model (SCOR), focusing on the commodity-making process. The MiSCOR demonstrates its applicability and robustness in real operational scenarios of one of the largest copper producers. MiSCOR provides a management tool for practitioners and decision-makers in the MISC’s upstream segment, offering blueprints to throw functional silos, foster collaboration, and a standardized framework that integrates seamlessly with the downstream segment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As computer networks become increasingly important in various domains, the need for secure and reliable networks becomes more pressing, particularly in the context of blockchain-enabled supply chain networks. One way to ensure network security is by using intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which are specialised devices that detect anomalies and attacks in the network. However, these systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, such as label and distance-based flipping, which can undermine their effectiveness within blockchain-enabled supply chain networks. In this research paper, we investigate the effect of these attacks on a network intrusion detection system using several machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, SVC, and XGB Classifier, and evaluate each model via their F1 Score, confusion matrix, and accuracy. We run each model three times: once without any attack, once with random label flipping with a randomness of 20%, and once with distance-based label flipping attacks with a distance threshold of 0.5. Additionally, this research tests an eight-layer neural network using accuracy metrics and a classification report library. The primary goal of this research is to provide insights into the effect of data poisoning attacks on machine learning models within the context of blockchain-enabled supply chain networks. By doing so, we aim to contribute to developing more robust intrusion detection systems tailored to the specific challenges of securing blockchain-based supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

Previous studies implicate LARP1 in 40S- or 80S-ribosome complexes that repress and stabilize TOPs. However, a mechanistic understanding of how LARP1 and TOPs interact with these complexes to coordinate TOP outcomes is lacking. Here, we show that LARP1 senses the cellular supply of ribosomes by directly binding non-translating ribosomal subunits. Cryo-EM structures reveal a previously uncharacterized domain of LARP1 bound to and occluding the 40S mRNA channel. Free cytosolic ribosomes induce sequestration of TOPs in repressed 80S-LARP1-TOP complexes independent of alterations in mTOR signaling. Together, this work demonstrates a general ribosome-sensing function of LARP1 that allows it to tune ribosome protein synthesis to cellular demand.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>One-Sentence Summary</jats:title><jats:p>LARP1 directly binds free ribosomal subunits to repress TOP mRNAs</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Materials and Methods. A total of 956 individuals undergoing treatment voluntarily participated in our survey. The methodology predominantly involved individualized questionnaires. In the city of Mingechevir, out of 566 participants, 96 visited a pharmacy once a month, 102 visited 2-3 times a month, 147 visited 4 times a month, and 221 rarely visited a pharmacy. Among the respondents, 33% could afford medicines from their pensions, 17% by using expences from relatives, and 11% from other sources, while 39% purchased medicines from their monthly salaries. In the Yevlakh district, out of 390 participants, 140 visited a pharmacy once a month, 90 visited 2-3 times a month, 35 visited 4 times a month, and 25 rarely visited a pharmacy. Here, 33% could buy medicines using their pensions, 17% by using expences from relatives, 11% by using expences from other sources, and 39% from their monthly salaries. Results. Medical professionals, upon patient examination, prescribe necessary medications, with insurance companies covering the expenses. Patients can acquire their prescribed medications at any pharmacy for free through electronic prescriptions. The electronic prescription system incorporates measures to monitor medication distribution, enforce updated legal regulations, and establish an informational resource that tracks the turnover, wholesale, and retail sales of manufactured and imported goods that require labelling. The prescription is designed to include only the active substance of the drug. Conclusions. We advocate the necessity of enhancing medical care to improve medication provision for the population. Moreover, we emphasize the need to empower pharmacists in the organization of pharmaceutical services. Within the compulsory medical insurance program, there should be a careful selection of medicines, including the compilation of a comprehensive medication list, while ensuring strict adherence to quality standards.</jats:p>"

With the increasing competition in the catering industry, it is an important research direction to study the working capital management of listed catering enterprises in China from the perspective of supply chain. As a large catering brand in China, Jiumaojiu was in a poor financial situation in recent years. To better understand and help to tackle the problem existing in the management of its working capital, this paper takes Jiumaojiu Group as a case for study. Based on the working capital management evaluation method proposed by Professor Wang Zhuquan, we analyzed the working capital management of Jiumaojiu Group in recent years from the procurement, production and sales parts of its supply chain. According to the results of financial analysis based on Jiumaojiu Group&amp;rsquo;s annual reports for the periods from 2018 to 2022, we conclude that, in order to improve the utilization of the funds and the management of the working capital, Jiumaojiu Group need to improve it inventory management capabilities, strengthen the management of its accounts receivable, and slow down its business expansion slightly. It is hoped that this research can provide reference for Chinese catering enterprises to improve their working capital management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of contamination of underground sources of water supply in Ukraine is currently serious and requires immediate resolution. It is necessary to conduct systematic monitoring of water quality, develop and implement strategies to reduce emissions of hazardous substances and ensure proper storage of toxic waste. It is also important to increase public awareness of the need to protect the environment and use environmentally friendly technologies. In order to study the complex system of \"groundwater quality - environmental impact - population health\" and identify relationships between its various components, systematic monitoring of groundwater pollution in Ukraine is necessary. This monitoring may include various research methods, such as geochemical, hydrochemical, hydrogeological, and others, which will contribute to the study of the complex system of groundwater pollution in Ukraine and identify priority areas for their purification and preservation. The research utilized theoretical and empirical methods, with the main ones being a systemic approach, methods of analysis and synthesis (comparison, analogy, abstraction, formalization, classification). Standard laboratory methods for chemical analysis of groundwater quality were used in the chemical-bacteriological control laboratory serving the \"Ternopilsky\" water intake for drinking water. The \"Ternopilsky\" water intake is an object of the Municipal Enterprise \"Ternopilvodokanal\". The operation of facilities for the production of drinking water is carried out in accordance with technological regulations and in compliance with regulatory documentation. The main parameters that determine the quality of groundwater include chemical composition, physical properties, bacteriological composition, and radioactivity. According to regulations, drinking water must meet the requirements for drinking water quality, which includes the maximum allowable concentration of substances and the absence of pathogenic microorganisms. Due to the potential consequences for the environment and human health in case of inadequate control over water quality, we have assessed some possible consequences of such an impact. Possible consequences include: a decrease in the level of groundwater, water pollution, a change in water composition, and an impact on local flora and fauna. By the nature of the impact, excessive use of groundwater can lead to a decrease in the level of groundwater, which can lead to a decrease in soil quality and affect ecosystems that depend on groundwater; careless handling of waste and chemicals can lead to groundwater pollution, which can pose a threat to human health and ecosystems; groundwater has its own composition and level of mineralization, so improper use can lead to a change in water composition, which can affect its use for drinking and industrial water supply; groundwater is an important element for local ecosystems, so the consumption and pollution of groundwater can affect local flora and fauna. Requirements for the quality of groundwater in Ukraine are aimed at ensuring safety for drinking water supply and other needs. In order to reduce possible consequences of groundwater use, it is necessary to conduct constant monitoring of water quality, regulate water use, regulate groundwater consumption, and take measures to purify and protect it from pollution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In South Africa, there has been a rapid adoption of solar power, particularly inverter-based solar sources, in low-voltage (LV) networks due to factors such as load shedding, rising electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In residential LV networks, the alignment between solar supply and energy demand is less precise, necessitating larger battery storage systems to effectively utilize solar energy. Residential areas experience peak energy demand in the morning and evening when solar irradiance is limited. As a result, substantial energy storage is important to fully utilize the potential of solar energy. However, increasing inverter-based, customer-generated power creates an imbalance in the utility supply. This is because utility LV supply transformers have three phases, while individual customers have single-phase connections and no load balancing control mechanism. This supply imbalance adversely affects the overall power quality, causing energy losses, damage to devices and other issues. To address these problems, the paper proposes a smart control approach to minimize power imbalances within utility LV supply transformers. The controller uses customer battery storage in residential areas to balance the utility transformer phases. A laboratory model was built to simulate a three-phase low-voltage network with single-phase customers, both with and without a smart controller. The results show that closely monitoring and controlling individual inverters through a central controller can significantly improve the balance of the supply network.</jats:p>"

From 2024 onward communities are legally required to develop a plan documenting how the objective will be achieved. Geothermal resources can be a major building block to reach the aspirational target if they can be developed at competitive costs. To evaluate the economic potential of geothermal resources is time and money consuming. Questions which need to be addressed in the context of such evaluations are: how can an economic recovery of geothermal heat be achieved, how can subsurface risks associated with an exploration be managed, and how competitive is a deep geothermal energy recovery compared to other options of heat supply? These questions are key to a development of deep geothermal heat, especially if the geothermal conditions are not as prominent as in already realized projects, but less favorable as in the deep clastic sediments of the North German Basin. With this contribution a procedure is presented and used to determine net present values and the associated levelized costs for deep hydrothermal heat recovery systems. It consists of modelling the geothermal cycle, sizing all necessary components, costing them, and calculating net present value and levelized cost. The thermal model is verified by comparing the modelled state variables pressure and temperature at relevant state points of the thermal cycle with actual data of a geothermal project. The cost model is validated with biding results and cost information from actual projects and modified as appropriate. In applying the model to a setting in the Hannover–Celle area with temperatures of around 70 °C, conditions are determined, which lead to positive net present values. The degree of their influence is determined in sensitivity analyses allowing a systemic optimization. The results show that for a coupled heat plant with geothermal heat supplied at baseload conditions, levelized costs of approx. 8 cents/kWh are achievable. The presented thermodynamic and cost models are considered helpful instruments for developing preliminary conceptual estimates, strategies for optimization, and portfolio management.</jats:p>"

This study, rooted in a thorough literature review encompassing both academic and industry research, as well as established standards, seeks to shed light on stakeholder perspectives regarding the integration of Additive Manufacturing (AM) into the maritime spare parts supply chain (SPSC). The aim is to address fundamental questions critical to shaping the maritime spare parts supply chain with AM. The research employs a questionnaire-based methodology, deemed the most appropriate tool for capturing stakeholder perspectives, motivations, and concerns. Participants are categorized as “end-users” and “suppliers” of spare parts. The end-users in the maritime SPSC encompass individuals both on board vessels and in onshore offices, ranging from ship owners to engineers, surveyors, and staff in various departments. On the upstream side of the SPSC, the study engages with manufacturers and suppliers of spare parts, including original equipment manufacturers and third-party subcontractors, as well as various types of distributors and service providers. The research concludes with a comprehensive understanding of the maritime industry’s engagement with AM, balancing cost-efficiency with the preservation of service quality and operational readiness. It identifies significant barriers, such as quality assurance, the need for skills and knowledge, digital asset management, copyright protection, and equipment availability and costs. This study marks a pioneering exploration of stakeholder perspectives within the maritime SPSC concerning the integration of AM technology. It underscores the industry’s eagerness to embrace digital transformation while highlighting key challenges that must be addressed for a successful transition; this is clearly an added value from a practical perspective.

They complement conventional, often globalized, long food chains where small farmers have little bargaining power, and consumers cannot link the food they buy to a known agricultural producer or geographical area where the food is produced. The advantage of direct sales is that producers can obtain a higher price while consumers have easier access to fresh and seasonal food products. The main aim of the paper is to identify and characterize the spatial concentration of local food systems in Poland and their importance in sustainable development and food policy for healthy eating. As part of this study, an analysis of the statistical data of the Central Statistical Office for 2021 was carried out. Data obtained from the Chief Veterinary Inspectorate as of mid-2021 were analyzed to discuss the topic in detail. Descriptive methods and comparative analyses were used to understand regional differences. Absolute and proportional values were used for the research to enable better comparisons between regions, using the traditional method used in spatial structure studies, i.e., the distribution index (number of entities per 1000 inhabitants). The analysis identified spatial differences and possible implications for food policy and regional development. In addition, data on the number of marketplaces in Polish regions in 2022 were used. The study results indicated that short supply chains in the Polish food system contribute to increasing the availability of healthy local products, which may improve consumer health. However, despite these benefits, the results revealed challenges such as the limited production scale of local suppliers and the need to adapt to changing market conditions.</jats:p>"

However, the competitive environment and the green input costs reduce the willingness of PBSC firms to improve the green technology level. This paper constructs a PBSC consisting of a smart construction management platform (SCMP), a contractor, and prefabricated-component manufacturers (PCMs) to explore green cooperation strategies in the PBSC. Stackelberg game models are constructed and the green technology level and PBSC profit under different cooperation strategies are examined. The study shows that the optimal service commission of the SCMP increases with the cost parameter of green technology and the intensity of competition between PCMs. However, the green technology level decreases with the competition. The integration strategy does not necessarily achieve the highest level of green technology. The horizontal cooperation among competing PCMs is not conducive to improving the green technology level, but PCMs always have incentives to form horizontal cooperative alliances to achieve Pareto improvement under certain conditions.

The objective of this work was to analyze the buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) production chain and the contribution of Porter’s Five competitive forces to the buffalo production chain in Northeast Brazil. For that, research was carried out through information obtained in the literature. Interviews and questionnaires were applied to the companies involved in the activity. It was observed that the main limiting factor on the buffalo chain in Northeast Brazil is the need for more information about the species, which makes it difficult for a more accurate analysis. Concerning daily activity, the production chain is well organized. Five small and medium-sized dairies process buffalo milk in the region. Other small-scale enterprises are also found. Regarding buffalo breeding for meat, the numbers associated with the activity in Northeast Brazil need to be clarified since buffalo meat is sold as beef, confusing the buffalo herd with the bovine herd. The commercialization of the buffalo carcass as bovine is the main factor responsible for this condition. Buffalo meat needs to be marketed as buffalo meat for the activity to be recognized. The use of Porter’s Five Forces efficiently describes the interconnected processes associated with the buffalo production chain in Northeast Brazil and contributes to improving the chain.</jats:p>"

Insights from research in these areas can inform policies to build sustainable food systems yet limited work has been done to build understanding around whether or not sustainability efforts compete with supply chain resilience. This study explores the interplay between food supply resilience and environmental impacts in US cities, within the context of global food systems’ contributions to GHG emissions, water use, and nitrogen pollution. Utilizing county-level agricultural data, we assess the water use, GHG emissions, and nitrogen losses of urban food systems across the US, and juxtapose these against food supply resilience, represented by supply chain diversity. Our results highlight that supply chain resilience and sustainability can simultaneously exist and are not necessarily in competition with each other. We also found a significant per capita footprint in the environmental domains across Southern cities, specifically those along the Gulf Coast and southern Great Plains. Food supply chain resilience scores ranged from 0.18 to 0.69, with lower scores in the southwest and Great Plains, while northeastern and Midwestern regions demonstrated higher resilience. We found several cities with high supply chain resilience and moderate or low environmental impacts as well as areas with high impacts and low resilience. This study provides insights into potential trade-offs and opportunities for creating sustainable urban food systems in the US, underscoring the need for strategies that consider both resilience and environmental implications.</jats:p>",

The method uses seven parameters, namely, depth to groundwater table, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, land use and land cover, and hydraulic conductivity to obtain vulnerability index values. These index values are validated with one or a few elements of water characteristics as pollution indicators. In most of the reported studies, the correlation coefficient between the DRASTIC index and the concentration of individual element(s) was low. The present study uses the water quality index (WQI) to correlate with the DRASTIC index value. In this paper, 11 physical and chemical water characteristics data of 31 well locations within the Faridabad District of Haryana, India are utilized to estimate the WQI. The correlation coefficients for single element concentration with DRASTIC index vary between the range of 0.104 to 0.304. The correlation coefficients for the concentration of NO3- and WQI are found to be 0.104 and 0.533, respectively. Thus, the DRASTIC index demonstrates a stronger correlation with the WQI when compared to single element concentration.</jats:p>",

The proposed system consists of a solar array, a boost converter, a three-phase inverter, and a three-phase filter. FHD technique is used to model the system, as it accounts only for dominant frequencies which enables obtaining of compact yet precise description of the system’s harmonic interactions. Compared to complexity, extra harmonic extraction routines, and large computational resources of the time domain technique (TD), FHD needs only one matrix inversion to obtain both the voltage/current waveforms and harmonic content of each part of the system. The obtained results prove the feasibility, accuracy, and simplicity of the proposed FHD technique for modeling switched devices while maintaining the computational resources. For each part/state of the proposed system, both the waveform and its harmonic content are visualized.</jats:p>",

It has been found in recent years that SSCM with assist of industry 4.0 applications, can benefit splendid productivity and efficiency in the supply chain. The numerous industry 4.0 applications that are involved are Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) Big Data Analytics (BDA), etc. Industry 4.0 with SSCM has gained a lot of interest from various authors and scholars across the world. Healthcare is one of the most critical sectors due to its importance in handling public health. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and other viruses (SARS and Ebola) have highlighted supply chain vulnerabilities that are further mitigated by their lean and globalized structures. Covid-19 underlined the need for supply chain visibility problems within the healthcare sector. When the need for medical supplies became urgent and global distribution was disrupted, companies faced the consequences of needing the technology, systems, and plans in place to correctly predict the onslaught. One report shows that about 94 percent of Fortune 1000 companies reported supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 global outbreak. Existing studies have discussed supply chain issues and the importance of AI in addressing these challenges. AI, like Industry 4.0 in the healthcare supply chain, is proving to be a game-changer. This paper aims to review and present the various aspects of SSCM and industry 4.0 applications to get a comprehensive literature review, which contains the analysis of multiple articles published from 2010-2020. In addition, the various challenges SSCM and industry 4.0 applications face are identified and discussed. Also, the impact of Industry 4.0 and sustainable practices brings together the healthcare supply chain. This study will help in getting a good understanding of the different industry 4.0 technologies that are important for setting up SSCM.</jats:p>"

The study was carried out from 2019 to 2021. A single‑arm clinical trial consisted of 20 individuals who presented with deep wound defects requiring flap coverage. A dynamic thermography study was conducted to examine the chosen donor site before and after dressing with NP.\r\nResults. The temperature measurements obtained from the two selected warm perforator points and the point in the cool area between perforators prior to the application of NP showed a steady downward trend in temperature. Specifically, the temperature in the cool area was observed to be lower by an average of –1.89 °С and –2.12 °С as compared to warm points. The application of local NP had an impact on trend analysis of skin temperature, which demonstrated a significant decrease in the differences between values seen in the cool and warm areas. This effect was already noted after the first day of the NP system application, as evidenced by the everyday data collection. The «levelling» of temperature curves was associated with temperature rises both in the cool area and at the perforator exit points.\r\nConclusions. The findings obtained from thermography analysis suggest that the application of NP has the potential to enhance blood circulation in the intended donor area. Therefore, it is plausible to discuss the possibility of improved microcirculation in the skin and the beneficial effect of local cutaneous NP application on the state of anastomoses between perforators.\r\n </jats:p>"

This involves efficient coordination, collaboration, and swift information sharing to align everyone toward common goals, ultimately reducing costs and inefficiencies. Integration enhances communication decision-making and standardizes processes, reducing errors and waste. Organizations must continually assess and monitor integration processes, emphasizing effective communication and collaboration in areas such as vendor management, procurement, and distribution. Success in SCM depends on vigilant monitoring and assessment of integration strategies, ensuring optimized outcomes. The study conducted a quantitative data analysis with survey questionnaires. The study found that for sustainable supply chains, it is essential to consider the competitive priorities of networked firms, industry type, and stakeholder collaboration. Different industries require varying levels of supply chain integration, necessitating exploration of integration-related topics for a comprehensive understanding. Sustainable supply chains depend on member collaboration, ethical practices, and a balance of economic and environmental considerations. Specifically, the agricultural food sector's focus on sustainability drives the demand for better integration. The lack of integration results in inefficiencies, higher costs, and a lack of collaboration, preventing the realization of potential benefits. Current research aims to explore the reliability of adopting SCM integration methods in the Asian agricultural food industry. This research explored the practical aspects of integrating supply chains in this sector that was neglected in the Asian agricultural food industries, hindering efficiency and cost reduction.</jats:p>",

EPANET is selected as the simulation model and Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) is selected as the optimization module. To link the simulation module with the optimization module, a program is written in MATLAB. The developed simulation–optimization approach was applied to two benchmark network problems to check the suitability of the method. The parameters of the RCGA were optimized for the two networks. The computational efficiency of the developed simulation–optimization model is checked based on the number of function evaluations. For both networks, the number of function evaluations to get the optimum network design was less than the number of function evaluations required for other methods mentioned in the literature.</jats:p>",

In this regard, dealing with online reviews and reference price together for a competitive interaction in a two-period dual-channel scenario is one of the main challenges. To address this interaction, in the present research, we consider a dual-channel supply chain with a two-period. The selling price and the reference price impact on the retailer’s demand in both channels. Whereas, the online reviews influence the demands of the direct channels only. The manufacturer, who announces wholesale prices and direct channel selling prices, is Stackelberg game’s leader and the retailer is the follower. Two different decision-making strategies (I, II) are made by both players: (I) The manufacturer and the retailer both make all their decisions at the beginning of the selling season. (II) Here all decisions are made at the beginning of each selling period. In order to compare these strategies, we create a centralized policy as a benchmark scenario. The optimal solutions of the supply chain and each player are determined and analyzed. The numerical and sensitivity analysis suggests that the responsive pricing can bring additional benefits to both the players.</jats:p>",

Field studies were conducted over two seasons (2017–2019) to evaluate the effects of drip irrigation (DI) and surface irrigation (SI) methods coupled with three irrigation regimes on agronomic parameters of carrot crops. Irrigation regimes consisted of water replacements of cumulated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) at levels of 100% (I100), 70% (I70), and 40% (I40) when the readily available water in I100 treatment was depleted. Results showed a reduction in carrot yield by 13–22% and 22–32% with I70 and I40 treatments compared to I100, respectively. Yield is affected by the irrigation method with a reduction of around 6–7% under the surface method for both years. The water productivity (WP) was found to significantly vary among regimes and methods, where the highest values were observed for the I40 regimes and drip method. Drip and I100 irrigation techniques seem to optimize carrot production. Under situations of water shortage, adopting deficit irrigation treatment (DI70) could be an alternative for managing carrot irrigation and improving water productivity.</jats:p>",

Because this plant is a summer crop, irrigation is critical to its production, and an absence of moisture is a significant constraint on its development. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of hydrophilic polymer (HP) and fulvic acid (Fu-A) as amendatory materials on yield, yield component, and photosynthetic parameters of corn plants under the deficit irrigation (DI) situation. The treatments were performed by mixing two water provision groups, including complete irrigation (CI) and DI, two soil improvements, including the application of without HP or with HP, and two foliar amendments, including spraying without Fu-A or with Fu-A, with four replications. According to the results, under DI and CI situations, the co-treatment of two amendatory materials, Fu-A and HP, enhanced corn yield significantly. These enhancements were higher than enhancements attained by using them alone. Besides, the moisture and leaf proline available for the plant during DI circumstances were increased by utilizing both amendatory materials. Under DI treatment, using Fu-A and HP amendatory materials together may thus be more significant and beneficial for increasing production and boosting photosynthetic mechanisms.</jats:p>",

Implementing and adopting the procurement Contracting practices in public institutions have continuously faced challenges due to their complexity and lack of resources, which directly impact supply chain performance. Institutions are operating in a competitive business environment with many players, and massive changes are taking place daily to improve their performance. The key to optimal performance is understanding the contributions of pre-contracting procurement practices. The study covered three road authorities with regional offices in Kakamega County: Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Kenya Urban Road Authority (KURA), and Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA). The study adopted system theory. The study employed the causal research method to explain the causes and effects of the variables. The target population was 48 respondents, comprised of supply chain officers, road officers, and account officers on the road authorities. A census method was employed in the study. Structured questionnaires were used as data collection instruments. Pilot testing was conducted in Vihiga County. The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data was presented using tables and figures. A Likert scale was used to determine how strongly variables agreed or disagreed with statements on a five-point scale. Regression analysis shows that pre-contracting procurement practice had no significant effect on supply chain performance in the road authorities of Kakamega County, Kenya (t = 0.605, P &gt; 0.05). This means that road authorities in Kakamega County that effectively implement pre-contracting procurement practices are more likely to have high-performance supply chains. The findings of this objective indicated that pre-contracting had P 0.05 and contributed to 0.8% of the changes in supply chain performance. Therefore, according to the study, the institutions need to re-examine their procurement practices so as to capitalize on areas that improve supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

Regarding this, we optimize and compare four three-stage Stackelberg game models between government and a two-echelon green supply chain, namely both manufacturer and retailer risk neutral (BN), manufacturer risk aversion while retailer risk neutral (MA), retailer risk aversion while manufacturer risk neutral (RA) and both manufacturer and retailer risk aversion (BA). The government as the leader decides the subsidy rate of green input cost with the goal of maximizing social welfare; the manufacturer as the first follower makes decisions on product greenness and wholesale price to maximize its own interests; and the retailer as the second follower determines retail prices to maximize its own interests. Employing mathematical reasoning and numerical simulation investigate thoroughly the effects of the government subsidies and the members’ risk aversion. Results indicate that an appropriate government subsidy investment has a positive effect on optimal decisions and related benefits. Risk aversion is in favor of improvement of product greenness and social welfare while reduction of retail price. With the increase of manufacturer risk aversion, green subsidy investment rate and retailer expected revenue increase; on the contrary, the wholesale price and manufacturer expected revenue decrease. With the increase of retailer risk aversion, the wholesale price and manufacturer expected revenue increase, while green subsidy investment rate and retailer expected revenue decrease. In the model of BN, product greenness and social welfare are the lowest, while retail price is the highest. BA is opposite to BN. In the model of RA, green subsidy investment rate and retailer expected revenue the lowest, while wholesale price and manufacturer expected revenue the highest. RA is opposite to MA. The government should formulate appropriate subsidy policies to encourage manufacturers to produce green products and raise consumers’ green awareness. Enterprises should control their own risk aversion and assess the risk aversion of the other party reasonably.</jats:p>"

It is noted that the energy sector of the railway infrastructure of Ukraine, as well as some European countries, is not diversified by energy sources, and the use of renewable energy sources (RES) is limited. The possibility of using hybrid systems with photovoltaic batteries and a wind generator to meet the electricity needs of the railway infrastructure facility is considered. The concept of a regulated railway crossing operating on renewable energy sources (RES) in combination with electric vehicles (electric bicycle and electric tire) is proposed, which will ensure the balancing of the hybrid power supply system, storage of excess RES energy and generation of additional energy as needed. In accordance with the proposed concept, possible scenarios for the functioning of the railway crossing load were identified. The electricity consumption is estimated and a typical load schedule for a railway crossing is determined. </jats:p>"

Соответственно рост добычи полезных ископаемых создает необходимость увеличения единиц специализированной, мощной горнодобывающей техники, особенно это касается экскаваторов, конвейерных и дробильно-сортировочных установок, работающих на электротяге. Актуальность работы заключается в том, что технологические процессы разработки и эксплуатации месторождений полезных ископаемых требуют обеспечения максимальной защищенности и бесперебойной работы электроснабжения. Известно, что нестабильная работа электроснабжения приводит к незапланированному простою горных машин, что, в свою очередь, влечет за собой снижение коэффициента их полезного действия, все это приводит к увеличению себестоимости продукции за счет уменьшения добычи в сутки по сравнению с запланированным, и как следствие – снижение уровня промышленной безопасности. Цель – описать опыт эксплуатации электроустановок, который свидетельствует, что надежность работы системы электроснабжения значительно зависит от наличия и правильной работы устройств релейной защиты, автоматики и сигнализации. Ключевыми методами, призванными повысить надежность электроснабжения и минимизировать возможные аварии, являются использование высокоавтоматизированных устройств релейной защиты, своевременная корректировка расчетов токов коротких замыканий, повышение квалификации инженеров. Результаты и обсуждение – раскрыты принципиальные отличия микропроцессорных устройств релейной защиты автоматики от установок аналогового типа, приведена краткая справка по микропроцессорному устройству релейной защиты КИТ-Р-А2-12-04-11-10-ФК-01, введенному в опытную эксплуатацию на территории Российской Федерации.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>Topicality – In the mining industry of Russia all the time there is an increase in production. Accordingly, the growth of extraction of minerals creates the need to increase the units of specialized, powerful mining equipment, especially excavators, conveyor and crushing and screening plants, working on electric traction. The relevance of the work lies in the fact that, technological processes of development and operation of mineral deposits require maximum protection and uninterrupted operation of power supply. It is known that unstable operation of power supply leads to unplanned downtime of mining machinery, which in turn leads to a decrease in their coefficient of performance, all this leads to an increase in the cost of production by reducing production per day, compared with the planned and as a consequence – reducing the level of industrial safety. The purpose – to describe the experience of operating electrical installations, which shows that the reliability of the power supply system significantly depends on the availability and proper operation of devices of relay protection, automation and alarm. The key methods to improve the reliability of power supply and minimize possible accidents are the use of highly automated devices of relay protection, timely correction of short-circuit current calculations, advanced training of engineers. Results and discussion – basic differences of microprocessor devices of relay protection of automatics from installations of analog type are opened, the brief information on the microprocessor device of relay protection KIT-R-A2-12-04-11-10-FC-01 put into experimental operation in territory of the Russian Federation is resulted.</jats:p>",

This study aims to bridge this research gap by examining a medical insurance reform in China, a major program of the targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) strategy, which offers higher reimbursement rates and lower medical deductibles for low‐income households. We use an administrative data set on impoverished people in a Chinese county to examine how exogenous changes in the medical insurance system affect the income structure of low‐income households. We apply a two‐part model to a Difference‐in‐Differences framework, with households that received reimbursement of the insurance reform as the treatment group and others as the control group. Our results imply that the medical insurance reform could increase the overall household income diversity. The mechanism analysis suggests that the medical insurance reform improves the health conditions of patients and encourages caregivers to engage more in off‐farm work.</jats:p>",

Moreover, it estimates that risk identification and risk assessment will have a significant regulatory effect on performance. However, this study explains that they don't have a positive effect on the results.\n \nResearch, Practical &amp; Social implications: Research gaps and opportunities are presented to lead further studies about supply chain risks in different sectors.

Many factors can influence the performance of supply flow management in companies, including information sharing, long term relationships, and cooperation. The method used in this research is to analyze the relationship between the dependent variable (cooperation, information sharing and long-term relationships) and the independent variable (Bajawa coffee supply flow performance). From the results of the multiple linear regression analysis carried out, it shows that: the long-term relationship variable has the greatest influence on the Bajawa coffee SCM performance variable (dependent) with a coefficient value of (0.047), then the cooperation variable with a value of ( 0.019 ), and which has a The smallest influence is the information sharing variable (0.018). This means that the three independent variables have a positive and significant effect on the dependent variable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, the creation of optimal microclimatic conditions is mandatory for the vast majority of premises in public buildings. The main problem in the cooling period of the year is the minimization of energy consumption. Traditional systems with recirculation require the return of exhaust air to the ventilation unit, which is obviously accompanied by additional energy costs for its movement. In addition, this enlarges air handling units, airducts and other equipment. This problem is not present in ventilation systems with local cooling. They consist of a ventilation system that provides a minimum flow of outdoor air and local closers that take air from the upper or middle zone, cool it and supply it to the room. The work considers the principles of analytical description of processes in a room with the simultaneous operation of ventilation and local cooling. A calculation algorithm and a software based on it have been created. The basis of the analytical description is the simplification that the supply air and the air after the closers are first mixed, and then the mixture participates in the assimilation of excess heat and moisture in the room. The influence of various factors on the productivity and cold performance of the guides is analyzed. It is shown that for maximum energy efficiency with minimum costs, it is necessary to perform the calculation, and not to use aggregated indicators. It is shown that the performance of the closers can exceed the consumption of outside air. The closers return the exhausted air to the working area, which leads to an increase in the carbon dioxide content in it and the possibility of the return of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses to it. It is shown how both problems are solved by a biotechnological measure - remedial phytodesign. The recommended assortment of plants is given.</jats:p>"

In line with this, scholars have been investigating supply network complexity (SNC) for over two decades, yet the domain is not converging; definitions and operationalizations are varied, a multiplicity of theoretical perspectives exists, performance implications are inconclusive, and supply chain managers are certainly still struggling with the complexity of their supply networks. To address this critical gap, we conducted a rigorous systematic review of 116 articles and synthesized the extant research in a comprehensive nomological network of SNC. Our synthesis encompasses the following key aspects: (i) defining (sub)dimensions of SNC by reconciling diverse conceptualizations, (ii) elaborating on the direct and contingent effects of SNC by highlighting underlying mechanisms and relevant theories, (iii) identifying antecedents of SNC, and (iv) introducing a detailed categorization of SNC management practices and illustrating SNC management capability as an antecedent of such practices. We conclude by presenting an extensive research agenda illustrating the gaps in the literature and charting a path forward in relation to different themes, theories, and methods.</jats:p>",

While the existing literature posits ICT technologies as individual enablers that enhance organizational performance in areas like sustainable operations, resource economization and organizational resilience, a gap remains in comprehending the nuanced role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in linking GSCM and SCR outcomes. This research delves into how top management perceives the alignment of ICT adoption with GSCM and SCR objectives within logistics firms. Data were gathered from 53 managers in Greek logistics firms. After utilizing factor analysis, the findings indicate that (1) a significant correlation exists between GSCM/SCR states and ICT adoption; (2) firms with higher ICT adoption rates more effectively address GSCM and SCR challenges; and (3) notably, larger firms with more resources have a slight edge over smaller counterparts with less focus on ICT. Policymakers and industry leaders in the logistics sector can leverage these insights to prioritize ICT-related initiatives, especially in regions with similar contexts to Greece.</jats:p>"

Eliminating undesirable damage to the means of transport through the possibility of predicting technical conditions and a state of failure may increase the reliability of the entire supply chain. From the aspect of sustainability, the issue of reducing the number of failures also makes it possible to reduce supply chain disturbances, to reduce costs associated with delays, and to reduce the materials needed for the repair of the means of transport, since, in this case, the costs only relate to the replaced elements before their damage. Thus, it is impossible for more serious damage to occur. Often, failure of one item causes damage to others, which generates unnecessary costs and increases the amount of waste due to the number of damaged items. This article provides an author’s method of technical condition prediction; by applying the method, it would be possible to develop recommended maintenance activities for key elements related to the safety and reliability of transport. The combination of at least two artificial intelligence methods allows us to achieve very good prediction results thanks to the possibility of individual adjustments of weights between the methods used. Such predictive maintenance methods can be successfully used to ensure sustainable development in supply chains.</jats:p>"

In the era of globalization, companies face pressure to increase efficiency, transparency, and security in their supply chains. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution to address some of these challenges by enabling more decentralized, transparent, and efficient supply chain management. However, the use of this technology in global supply chain management also raises several issues related to regulation, law, and collaboration with third parties. OBJECTIVE: This research then aims to explore the potential of blockchain technology in global supply chain management and understand the regulatory framework needed to support the implementation of this technology. METHOD: This research was carried out using a qualitative approach. The data used in this research comes from various research results and previous studies that are relevant to the discussion. RESULTS: The results of this research then found that the use of blockchain technology in global supply chain management promises to increase transparency, efficiency, and security. Smart contracts enable the automation of business processes, reducing costs and increasing visibility of operations. Collaboration with third parties is an important strategy in increasing supply chain efficiency. Regulation, data security, and international harmonization remain challenges.

Even today, providing electricity to remote areas is characterized by the absence or shortage of supply. The construction of power lines for a small number of consumers in remote areas is costly and, therefore, not economically viable. Partially, the energy supply of remote areas is provided by diesel power stations. However, the high cost of fuel combined with its transportation results in a high price on electric power and diesel power stations negatively impact our environment. Meanwhile, the modernization of active or the construction of new generators based on the usage of renewable energy sources, especially wind, significantly reduces the cost of electricity generation and presents a holistic solution for many remote or isolated areas. This effect may become more visible via innovative tools for the management of development and operation of energy supply facilities for remote areas that do not have access to a centralized energy grid.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>В соответствие с прогнозом, к 2040 году потребление электроэнергии увеличится более чем в два раза. Даже сегодня обеспечение электроэнергией отдаленных районов характеризуется отсутствием или нехваткой электроснабжения. Строительство линий электропередачи для небольшого числа потребителей в отдаленных районах затратно и, следовательно, экономически нецелесообразно. Частично энергоснабжение отдаленных районов обеспечивается дизельными электростанциями. Однако высокая стоимость топлива в сочетании с его транспортировкой приводит к высокой цене на электроэнергию, а дизельные электростанции негативно влияют на нашу окружающую среду. Между тем, модернизация действующих или строительство новых генераторов, основанных на использовании возобновляемых источников энергии, особенно ветра, значительно снижает стоимость производства электроэнергии и представляет собой комплексное решение для многих отдаленных или изолированных территорий. Этот эффект может стать более заметным благодаря инновационным инструментам управления развитием и эксплуатацией объектов энергоснабжения отдаленных территорий, не имеющих доступа к централизованной энергосистеме.</jats:p>",

Building on the literature relating to social supply and drift into ‘real dealing’, we explore whether the mid-market for non-‘street’ drugs in this locale follows a continuation of these norms, or whether features that are prominent in recent explorations of UK drug distribution relating to increasingly aggressive marketing, and organised criminal gangs moving into markets in provincial towns, are present in the city’s market. Analysis encompasses suppliers’ experiences of ‘drift’ into commercial supply, pull factors for market involvement, approaches to marketing and customer service, ethical concerns in supply, and finally perceptions of market violence. We observe that the market, while retaining many features of social supply, nonetheless shows evidence of issues relating to emergent norms of altered distribution, notably market violence linked to establishing ‘lines’ in new locales. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, practitioners and academicians alike must investigate spice supply chain management (SSCM) in terms of long-term sustainability. This study draws on the available literature to compile a collection of characteristics and maintain sustainable spice supply chain management techniques which come up with associated risks and relevant obstacles. Existing studies claim that due to a lack of resources, the associated risks are the root of poor SSCM performance. As a result, the goal of this study is to identify the primary risk variables using qualitative data; nevertheless, the attributes must be converted into a scale that is comparable. The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to obtain valid and reliable attributes from qualitative data, while the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) was used to address uncertainty and interrelationships simultaneously. FDM results suggest that there are eighteen critical risk variables and seven risks threatening effective SSCM. FDEMATEL results reveal qualitative data translated into crisp, comparable values in order to investigate causal linkages between variables and confirm the compatibility of the theoretical structure with industry realities. The findings show fluctuation in the Price (C8), diseases and pests (C20), human contamination (C23), spice adulteration (C24), and loss of food quality, and quantity (C36) are all important risks and sub-risks in these causative interrelationships. The primary risks involved in enhancing SCM include Financial Risk (A5), Ergonomic Risk (A8), and Operation and Management Risk (A10). The study recommends that industry professionals use future marketing tools to protect themselves from price changes which allow them to assess supply and demand circumstances and manage price risks over distance and time. Spices are the key contributors to earning a sizable amount of foreign currency through export in a developing country. It suggests to policymakers, regulatory organizations, and practitioners to develop regulations, raise farmer understanding about pest control, impose stiff penalties on vendors and businesses proven to be involved in spice adulteration, and develop a sustainable fertilizer distribution system. These corresponding action plans for improving the SSC sector and comparing it with agro-food and short-supply chains are investigated. This study contributes to theory by utilizing FDM and FDEMATEL methods for addressing the uncertainty and interrelationship among associated risks that hinder SCM from attaining sustainability.</jats:p>",

This hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified nano-bomb could be specially endocytosed by breast cancer cells through a targeting pathway, degraded and released cargoes in response to the high dose of GSH within the cytoplasm.

Moreover, the unloaded iron and calcium ions could further accelerate tumor damage by overloading Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> and ferroptosis, as accompanied by good magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

After the change in form from a Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) to a Regional Public Company (Perumda), the Tirta Medal Sumedang drinking water company was very active in making management improvements. Especially when this company was assessed by the Sumedang Regency DPRD in 2019 as having experienced mismanagement, resulting in losses of up to billions of rupiah. This research aims to understand the application of strategic management in realizing the performance of public sector organizations in Sumedang Regency. Research on strategic management implemented after experiencing losses is very interesting and very important to do. This research uses a qualitative approach. The research results show that in the last two years the strategic management implemented has focused on efforts to restore the trust of the community as customers, the Regional Government as owners, and company employees as implementers. This is carried out simultaneously through: strategies for improving the quality, quantity and continuity of services, increasing service coverage, and realizing Full Cost Recovery, as well as increasing more professional human resources.</jats:p>"

Despite these zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs), high rates of deforestation persist and may even be increasing. On the upside, a few region- and commodity-specific ZDCs have contributed to reductions by up to hundreds of thousands of hectares of deforestation, with mixed evidence on associated leakage. ZDCs have also spurred progress in monitoring, traceability, and awareness of deforestation. On the downside, as currently implemented, supply chain initiatives only cover a small share of tropical deforestation. Government- and company-led ZDCs are just two components of broader policy mixes aimed at reducing deforestation. To be more impactful, ZDCs needs to cover entire biomes, supply bases of companies, and export and domestic markets, with special attention not to exclude marginal producers.</jats:p>",

We present a novel way to consider, categorize, and label measures of cost and show cost measure estimates from a sample of 13 recent studies. We find that in general, there is too much variation and too few commonly represented EVSE cost measures to reasonably provide aggregate figures for these measures. We propose a convention for presenting EVSE cost measures that includes the application (commercial or residential), the power level (Level 1, Level 2, DCFC [with further distinction based on rated power capacity]), and the type of cost measure (hardware, installation, operation, and total cost). We contend that providing researchers with standard cost measures will help to advance our knowledge of EVSE costs by ensuring that future work will use common metrics. Establishing common metrics will enable conventional meta-analyses that will make assessments of EVSE costs even more accessible. Additionally, common metrics will make tracking costs more reliable as the technology continues to evolve and become more ubiquitous.</jats:p>"

Various water content values of the soil were determined using an energy balance model and an oven-drying method. The natural water content of the sandy soil determined by oven drying was between 30% and 40% for the sample soil from the same batch, with the second sandy soil sample having the highest value of 39.2% and the 15th sandy soil sample having the lowest value of 30.3%. The natural water content of sandy soils determined using an energy balance model was between 30% and 35%, among which the natural water content of the fifth sandy soil sample was the lowest at 30.12% and the natural water content of the third sandy soil sample was the highest at 34.46%.</jats:p>",

These were arranged into four categories: medication, patient, treatment, and miscellaneous. An online survey was designed using Qualtrics. This explored staff perceptions of the importance of each factor when making decisions, separately for type and duration of supply, using a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (”not at all”) to 5 (“a great deal”). A free-text box was available to add any additional factors. All pharmacy staff responsible for ordering patient-specific medication were invited to take part. Demographics were collected, participation was voluntary and all response data anonymous. Responses were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel. A pre-selected subset of factors were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.

For decisions both about supply type and duration, 14 factors were considered important (median score 4 or 5) with “patient on dosette box” and “duration of treatment” rated 5. Others with a median of 4 included “high risk patient”, “medication route/formulation”, “day of the week” and “drug history completed”. Only one factor, “nurse skill set on ward”, was considered unimportant (median score 2). The remainder were considered moderately important (median score 3). Statistical analysis suggested that some factors were significantly more important in certain groups. The factor “medication screened by a pharmacist” appeared less important to pharmacists versus MMPTs (p=0.0002) and less important to staff employed at the trust for longer than 10 years versus those employed less than this (p=0.0011).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Discussion/Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Results of this study provide valuable insight into the factors pharmacy staff consider when deciding on the type and duration of inpatient medication supply. To our knowledge, no previous studies have explored the factors influencing this kind of decision-making. Limitations include a small sample size, and that we focussed on which factors were more or less important rather than how they were used to guide decisions. We conducted some sub-group analysis, but the project was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance. This could now be addressed with the results of this survey enabling a power calculation. Further work using semi-structured interviews is currently underway to further explore how the factors influence decision making.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>References</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>1.

The present understanding of how pool‐riffle morphology varies with sediment supply and caliber, however, is insufficient due to the limited range of sediment supply rates explored in previous experiments and the little attention paid to sand supply and sediment size distribution in the laboratory and in the field. We present a model of river morphodynamics that can account for the spatial variability of channel width, and we validate the model with experimental data. Model validation shows how this one‐dimensional model can capture pool‐riffle formation, growth, and equilibration with errors that are comparable with those of other 1D models of river morphodynamics. We then apply the validated model to study the effects of sediment supply rate and caliber on pool‐riffle morphology. Model results show that pool‐riffle morphology is resilient to the range of tested sediment supply (i.e., five‐fold the sediment amount, 41‐fold the sand amount and coarsening the gravel supply). Bed and water surface slopes are sensitive to all types of change of sediment supply, whereas the sensitivity of bed surface sediment grain size varies with the type of change. These findings support prior research emphasizing the role of downstream width variations for the development/maintenance of pool‐riffle morphology and can help in the restoration and recovery of pool‐riffle gravel‐bed rivers.</jats:p>",

This research delves into the complex interplay among government policies, tourism supply chain behavior, and sustainability dimensions within the context of Zimbabwean tourism. A quantitative approach was employed, collecting data from 721 Zimbabwean tourism supply chain representatives using stratified random sampling and the Krejcie and Morgan table a method of determining the sample size. Questionnaires were distributed via Google Forms, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized for data analysis. The results provide strong empirical evidence that government policies have a significant positive effect on sustainability dimensions related to the tourism industry. The data indicates robust positive relationships between government policies and economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Furthermore, tourism supply chain behavior is shown to be a meaningful mediator between government policies and multiple sustainability outcomes. This emphasizes the significance of collaborative efforts, responsible practices, and harmonized actions within the tourism supply chain in achieving sustainable tourism. The study illuminates avenues for improving tourism sustainability, enhances policy makers and readers understanding on how policy‐driven efforts and tourism supply chain dynamics jointly impact tourism sustainability, there by emphasizing the need for coordinated actions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Scholars have begun to pay more attention to green entrepreneurial concerns (GEC) and sustainable management of supply chain (SMSC) practices, but the impact of these factors on a firm’s competitive performance (FCP) remains unclear, especially post COVID-19. Although previous studies have examined GEC and SMSC practices, they have mainly focused on assessing their effects on general firm performance, not specifically on FCP and the post-COVID-19 perspective. Therefore, this study investigates the direct links between GEC and SMSC, and between SMSC and FCP from a COVID-19 standpoint. This paper also examines the mediating effect of SMSC on the GEC–FCP relationship, and the moderating effect of digital technologies on the GEC–SMSC correlation. This study is a survey-based empirical research. The survey forms or questionnaires were distributed to 330 companies in Yemen with a response rate of 83.9%. The conceptual framework was assessed with structural equation modeling. The analysis outcomes indicate that GEC significantly affects SMSC and then FCP. The outcomes also unveil that SMSC mediates the GEC–FCP relation. Furthermore, digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence and big data analytics) significantly moderate the relationship between GEC and SMSC. This paper contributes to the existing literature by (i) expanding the limited findings of previous SMSC works by delivering a novel factor of GEC to boost the FCP via SMSC post the pandemic; and (ii) increasing knowledge about the effect of digital technologies on advancing SMSC and later FCP post the pandemic. Different from other academic works that have observed SMSC as a direct predicting factor for firm performance, the research offers novel insights about the capability of SMSC to mediate the relationship between GEC and FCP, and digital technologies can support the incorporation of GEC and SMSC for companies’ internal operations, particularly in the era of uncertainty such as in the post-pandemic times. </jats:p>"

The research was conducted in groundwater- and wastewater-irrigated agricultural plots. Water samples were collected weekly, soil samples were collected before planting and after harvest, and lettuce samples were collected at harvest time. The nutrient content (N, P, and K) was measured, and a mass balance method was applied. Wastewater had distinctly higher nutrient contents than groundwater, which guaranteed crop nutrition during the growing stage. Wastewater contributed 88%, 96%, and 97% to the N, P, and K requirements, respectively. The crop yield in the wastewater-irrigated areas was 43,8 ± 16 tons/ha, which was higher than 35 ± 8 tons/ha observed for the groundwater-irrigated areas, but results showed no statistically significant differences. Conclusively, wastewater led to reduced soil-nutrient gap and can be a source of nutrients. Therefore, wastewater is regarded as an alternative nutrient source of interest, and if properly applied, it might reduce environmental health hazards, resulting from run-off or leaching of excess nutrients.</jats:p>"

These initiatives are designed to reduce the damage to the environment and natural resource consumption caused the enterprise. In this study, we analyze how government recycling regulations, value co-creation activities, and recycling subsidies influence the pricing and output decisions of members of a closed-loop supply chain. We develop a Stackelberg game model led by manufacturers and followed by retailers to explore the impact of value co-creation activities and recycling subsidies on the quantity of new and remanufactured products, recyclers’ prices and prices of recycled electronic parts, manufacturers’ capacity to recycle, and environmental performance in the context of government recycling regulations. Manufacturers can choose from three recycling modes: mandatory minimum remanufacturing (<jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:inline-formula>model), non-mandatory partial remanufacturing (<jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:inline-formula>model), and full remanufacturing (<jats:inline-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:inline-formula>model). The results show that 1) higher recycling subsidies optimize the recycling capacity of manufacturers, increasing the number of remanufactured products and reducing the market share of new products, which affects the price of new products. 2) higher recycling subsidies reduce the price of recycled electronic parts purchased by manufacturers, strengthen the bargaining power of consumers, increase the price of recyclers, promote the active participation of consumers in value co-creation activities, and increase the level of value co-creation. 3) higher recycling subsidies help to increase the economic value of all parties in the closed-loop supply chain (manufacturers, recyclers, consumers), but stricter recycling constraints are not always beneficial to environmental performance; environmental taxes and fees above a certain threshold of recycling constraints reduce the negative impact of production activities on the environment. The novelties and contributions of this research include proposing a new application for the Value Co-creation and Government policy utilized to Supply Chain and their impact on sustainable supply chain. In addition, we proposed three new recycling strategies and analysed the impact of environmental tax on the environmental performance. Therefore, this study aims to provide some insights for government policymakers and for managers when facing a more complex business environment.</jats:p>"

Against this backdrop, we present the Canada Source Watershed Polygons dataset, or Can-SWaP. Can-SWaP was created using point locations of more than 3,300 municipal water licences defining rights to surface water withdrawal. Where possible, the resulting 1,574 catchments were assessed for accuracy in spatial coverage against provincial and local datasets. Each watershed in Can-SWaP has an estimated water volume used for municipal water purposes derived from licencing data, and several variables from RiverATLAS for investigating the integrity of surface drinking water sources in Canada. Furthermore, basing our method on the HydroSHEDS suite of global products offers a robust framework for the production of other national datasets following an established international standard.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Due to climate change and the occurrence of natural disasters in recent decades, energy supply to consumers has faced risks in different areas, especially in urban areas. Hurricanes are the most common natural disasters in urban areas in the damage to energy grids like electrical distribution grids. This study focused on enhancing resilience oriented in the electrical distribution grids in urban areas with smart grid technologies. The poles outage by hurricanes in the electrical distribution grid is introduced as a natural event subject to scenario generation via the pole fragility function. The short-term reserve scheduling is proposed as a pre-event response for enhancing resilience oriented against event at day-ahead. The reserve scheduling is implemented with attention to three strategies such as installing backup generators (BGs), demand response program (DRP), and storage systems (SSs) utilization considering microgrids formation in the damaged areas. The BGs are fed by urban gas grids for supply electrical demand in the damaged areas. In following, DRP is considered for demand management based on offer prices to consumers for demand reduction. Also, the SSs are operated by consumers as onsite generation for meet self-demand in the during event. The implementation of the proposed approach is done by using tri-objectives such as 1) minimizing the reserve costs, 2) minimizing the consumers’ dissatisfaction, and 3) maximizing the resilience oriented of the electrical distribution grid. The GAMS software and augmented ε-constraint method are presented for solving reserve scheduling. Finally, the superiority of the pre-event responses considering proposed reserve scheduling is verified via numerical simulation on the IEEE 33-bus distribution grid in the several case studies.</p>"

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been reported to be an ideal method, but it has never been carried out, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is a vital preliminary step. Therefore, this study aims to construct an LCI database for the production of drinking water in TOYAGAMA DWSS, covering the process of raw water intake to treatment. This database could serve as a reference for future LCA studies involving similar technologies and as an overview of its potential impacts. The data collection methods included observation, literature review, and interviews. The collected data focus was carried out from September 26 to November 3, 2022. Organizing and processing were performed using Microsoft Excel and OpenLCA 2.0 Beta. The results showed that TOYAGAMA DWSS consisted of 15 unit processes and an additional 1 non-TOYAGAMA DWSS unit process was included in the LCI. Flows recapitulation showed that 15 environmental flows were involved. Evaluation using Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method Environmental Footprint 3.0 indicated that the production of 1 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> drinking water contributed to 12 of 28 potential impact categories. Based on the results, to produce 1 m3 of drinking water, 3.35293 MJ of electrical energy and 1.22723 m3 groundwater were required.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a groundbreaking approach aimed at addressing the limitations of conventional inventory management practices in contemporary supply chains. The principal objective is to revolutionize inventory management by harnessing the synergistic potential of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Machine Learning (ML), and Fuzzy Logic. This integrated framework seeks to elevate demand forecasting, optimize ordering strategies, and enhance inventory control processes. Methods: The methodology encompasses the amalgamation of three potent techniques: ACO for the optimization of reorder points and quantities, ML for precise demand forecasting through the analysis of historical data and external variables, and Fuzzy Logic for managing imprecise and linguistic factors to facilitate adaptable decision-making. This fusion minimizes overall inventory costs while refining inventory-related choices. Findings: The fusion of ACO, ML, and Fuzzy Logic represents a pragmatic solution for contemporary inventory management. Businesses that embrace this approach can attain adaptability, data-driven precision, and flexibility, resulting in improved demand forecasting, optimized ordering strategies, and more efficient inventory management processes. An illustrative real-world case demonstrates that this integrated approach leads to cost-effective and responsive solutions, with the potential to revolutionize inventory management, translating into cost savings, heightened customer satisfaction, and enhanced operational efficiency. Novelty: The novelty of this integrated approach lies in its distinctive amalgamation of ACO, ML, and Fuzzy Logic within the inventory management context. While these techniques are well-established in their own right, their integration signifies an innovative response to an enduring challenge. This approach enables adaptability to shifting conditions, precise demand forecasting, and flexible decision-making, which were arduous to achieve using traditional methodologies.</jats:p>"

Using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in Expert Choice software. Nine famous aflaj systems in Oman were prioritized based on indicators including length, population, precipitation, discharge, quality, distance from the river network, cultivated area, and soil permeability. A snowball method for selecting participants was used, and a 28-item questionnaire was engaged to assess the relative importance of nine criteria when choosing the prior falaj. A scientific method is applied in a new case in this study to prioritize the aflaj for rehabilitation, and the method applied in this research enables to prioritize them to achieve the desired goal. The AHP method prioritizes the falaj Daris as the first ranking, based on the technical perspectives, with a relative value of 0.222. Findings show that in an equal condition, among these nine aflaj, it would be better that water decision-makers assign the budget to falaj Daris for rehabilitation aims.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>E-mobility represents an important part of the EU’s green transition and one of the key drivers for reducing CO2 pollution in urban areas. To accelerate the e-mobility sector’s development it is necessary to invest in energy infrastructure and to assure favorable conditions in terms of competitive electricity prices to make the technology even more attractive. Large peak consumption of parking lots which use different variants of uncoordinated charging strategies increases grid problems and increases electricity supply costs. On the other hand, as observed lately in energy markets, different, mostly uncontrollable, factors can drive electricity prices to extreme levels, making the use of electric vehicles very expensive. In order to reduce exposure to these extreme conditions, it is essential to identify the optimal way to supply parking lots in the long term and to apply an adequate charging strategy that can help to reduce costs for end consumers and bring higher profit for parking lot owners. The significant decline in photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage technology costs makes them an ideal complement for the future supply of parking lots if they are used in an optimal manner in coordination with an adequate charging strategy. This paper addresses the optimal power supply investment problem related to parking lot electricity supply coupled with the application of an optimal EV charging strategy. The proposed optimization model determines optimal investment decisions related to grid supply and contracted peak power, PV plant capacity, battery storage capacity, and operation while optimizing EV charging. The model uses realistic data of EV charging patterns (arrival, departure, energy requirements, etc.) which are derived from commercial platforms. The model is applied using the data and prices from the Croatian market.</jats:p>"

Introducing the concept of the Process of Argumentative Aphasia I highlight how the discourses of the participants in the research on Canadian ethical diamonds were becoming increasingly metaphorically unpronounceable and, therefore, misaligned with the official storytelling as I approached the mining context; whereas moving towards the sales contexts, the argumentative contents of the jewellers' and consumers' speeches were more aligned with the contents of the global advertising narratives on diamonds mined in Canada.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the study: In this work we tested the effects of three contrasted regimes of nitrogen supply, with nitrate concentrations in the nutrient solutions of 2 mM (low), 10 mM (normal) and 20 mM (high) on the susceptibility of Lactuca sativa L towards Botrytis cinerea (BC87) and Sclerotinia minor (SM) during storage. Once harvested, the outerleaves of the plants derived from the three nitrogen regimes were inoculated with either Botrytis cinerea (BC87) or Sclerotinia minor (SM). Data showed that the resistance to this two pathogens increase when plants were developed under low nitrogen concentration. This resistance observed is correlated with low values in oxidative stress indicators (MDA and H2O2) and high values in total phenols.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article brings to light the powerful connection between supply chain agility (SCA) and lean marketing as tools for gaining competitive advantage in this modern era of business. For organizations, achieving a competitive advantage is of the highest importance. Businesses use a variety of techniques to position themselves against their rivals as a result of rising competition. The study also looked at how SCA and firm competitiveness are moderated and mediated by lean marketing. In Ghana, information was gathered from 225 businesses via a questionnaire-based survey. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data obtained. The study demonstrated that the relationship between SCA and competitive advantage is highly influenced by lean marketing. The findings highlighted that lean marketing partially mediates the connotation between SCA and competitive advantage, while the moderating variables revealed that lean marketing has a significant but unfavorable influence on this association. The main goal is to ensure that firms focus on effective use of SCA and lean marketing to achieve competitive advantage. Firms should continually adapt to the fast-changing business environment and search for creative ways to satisfy new market needs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a two‐stage project supply chain with a downstream project firm producing an engineer‐to‐order (ETO) complex product or a make‐to‐order (MTO), low‐volume, customized industrial product as a project, and an upstream contract supplier supplying a key material to the project. The project faces two uncertainties: project activity time uncertainty and material consumption uncertainty, which may be positively or negatively correlated. In anticipation of these uncertainties, the project firm has to carefully decide its promised project due date to its project customer, against which harsh penalties will be assessed, and his material order quantity to commit to the contract supplier in advance. In most practical settings, project firms order from contracted suppliers via a flexible wholesale price contract consisting of a discounted advance order price and a risk‐premium adjusted expedite order price. The discounted advance order price encourages the project firm to take more inventory risk in the supply chain, and the expedite order price incentivizes the supplier to bear more inventory risk by carrying safety stock in excess of the project firm's advance material order. We formulate an optimization model that solves the project firm's project due date and material order problem, which takes into account the supplier's strategic reaction to the project firm's material order under the flexible wholesale price contract. We show that for MTO projects, risk‐sharing with suppliers on project materials is less important to the project firm, with the project firm assuming ownership of all material inventory in the channel and setting a deliberate project due date being the key. On the other hand, for ETO projects, risk‐sharing with contracted suppliers assumes critical importance. Project firms managing ETO projects should fully exploit the flexibility in the material supply contract to optimally drive the supplier's safety stock level and set the project due date reflecting the shared risk in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

Supply chain management (SCM) stands the process of actively managing supply chain actions in order to provide a competitive advantage over the long term and maximise the value of the customer. Sensors in IoT devices assess certain aspects of theworld around them, such as, temperature, location movement, handling, humidity, movement speed, light levels and other environmental parameters. GPS and other technologies are used for Internet of Things devices. It can track, validate products and deliveries in the supply chains. IoT in supply chain management is becoming increasingly important, and it has the potential to create a strategic competitive advantage. IoT-powered supply chain management is gaining traction as a viable solution to supply chain management's control and visibility issues, while also adding value and solving other challenges. It can also keep track of improving quality control across the storage conditions for the products and supply chain. Supply chain components must be prepared to place their belief in wearables makers to protect their data in order for wearables to continue to benefit the supply chain. The problems and applications of IoT on supply chain management are surveyed and summarised in this study</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In today’s competitive world, organizations are required to respond to customers and their stakeholders whose goals are profit, cost reduction, quality improvement, and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is vital to realize the ways for continuous quality improvement, customer satisfaction and organizational performance management. A performance measurement system should be designed to consider the chain specifications of the network and its interrelations. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is broadly used to evaluate the relative performance of a set of manufacturing processes because their models do not require considering the precise production functions. In this paper, a new approach based on network DEA is developed to evaluate the performance of an organization’s supply chain. The proposed model considers different constraints simultaneously. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach by effective network DEA in order to evaluate the supply chains with different assumptions. This model is input–output-oriented and has a target setting, considering dual-role factors and desirable/undesirable outputs as well as flexible intermediate measures to evaluate the efficiency in a more realistic situation. Finally, a case study in drink industry is reanalyzed relying on the proposed model, and the results are presented and discussed. The results show that the approach presented in this research by considering the targets for inputs and outputs, in addition to improving efficiency, can also calculate and report the distance between DMUs and their targets. Also, the proposed model by considering the dual-role factors, desirable and undesirable outputs, has provided a comprehensive method that with all of these assumptions can evaluate the network DMUs under more realistic conditions. So, through this model with the considered assumptions, not only the efficiency scores of the units can be calculated but also an analysis of how to improve the units is also obtained according to the decision makers’ opinion. </jats:p>",

Respondents were taken by purposive sampling consisting of 3 farmers, 3 middleman, 1 person from the company, namely the marketing general manager, and 1 retailer representative. Pameling avocado supply chain system at PT. S has 2 types of marketing channels, so that supply chain actors consist of 4 actors, namely farmers, middlemen, companies (PT. S), and retailers. Based on the Fuzzy AHP calculation, the priority risk at the farm level is environmental risk, with priority risk indicators being that land conditions do not support growth requirements (too dense soil, lack of nutrients). At the middleman level, the priority risk is price risk, with the priority indicator being the amount of marketing/distribution costs. At the company level, the highest risk priority is quality risk, with product damage priority risk indicators. Then, At the retailers, the highest risk priority is supply risk, with priority risk indicators in the form of uncertainty in the quantity of pameling avocado stock.

Rubber parts are used widely in automotive, motorcycles, trucks and other types of vehicles which are mostly small sizes but huge quantities to support original equipment manufacturer (OEM) brands with specific parts. The rubber part manufacturing process is complex and uncertain with compression molding and rubber curing conditions. Therefore, good conditions can predict to obtain high production capability for customer commissioning and delivery on schedule. The Neuro-fuzzy system is adopted and developed to deal with the uncertain capability under multi-criteria decision making. The methodology development can be used in the actual situation of the rubber part manufacturing supply chain environment and can predict uncertain problems that might occur in the subcontractor factories. The prediction of the production capability of the rubber part supply chain might be more effective on the real-time monitoring control system and can be tracked location part progressive for further planning both successful or has to be rescheduled. The platform was applied to audit and test in the actual industrial supply chain in Thailand. The methodology development was originally created for the particular supply chain in rubber automotive parts that can replace the existing manual approach to obtain a more efficient process of monthly performance evaluation.</jats:p>"

However, where AI compliments existing jobs and leads to higher productivity, this could open up new opportunities for international trade in services. How foundational AI affects international trade will also depend on how it is regulated. Governments are moving to regulate AI, which could become a barrier to international trade. Geopolitics could also undermine opportunities for AI to deepen globalization and trade in AI as the USA and China restrict trade in the technology needed to build and run foundational AI systems. Regulating the impact of AI on international trade is an increasing focus in free trade agreements (FTAs) and digital economy agreements (DEAs). The World Trade Organization (WTO) Joint Statement Initiative (JSI) e‐commerce negotiations could also support trade in AI.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. One of the most important tasks for ensuring the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population of the Vladimir region remains the provision of high-quality drinking water. Due to the fact that most of the population of the region consumes water from underground sources, which is characterized by an increased iron content, a hygienic assessment of the water of household drinking sources was carried out according to the content of this element.\r\nMaterials and methods. The paper presents the data of own research of the Department of Biology and Ecology of the Vladimir State University for 2022. During this period, the authors of the work investigated about one hundred nine samples of water from the household and drinking centralized and non-centralized water supply of the Vladimir region. Water samples were taken in the largest settlements (these are district centers, a regional city and large district settlements) and from drinking water sources of individual farms located in the territory of the region in various districts. The iron content in water was determined on a Hach Lange DR 6000 spectrophotometer using LCK521 and LCK320 cuvette tests.\r\nResults. Drinking water of the centralized water supply of the Vladimir region in terms of iron content in most administrative centers has been established to meet regulatory requirements and be safe for this indicator for the health of the resident population. Most of the water samples taken from non-centralized water supply sources have significant exceedances of regulatory values. The average excess of MPC in the region is 6.5 times, which is primarily due to the specifics of geochemical the composition of the water‒bearing rocks of these territories.\r\nLimitations of the study are related to the number of analyzed water samples, which reduces the possibility of interpolation of the obtained data over the entire territory of the region.\r\nConclusion. To provide the population with high-quality drinking water, local governments that do not have sufficient funds to purchase de-ironing treatment plants need to initiate a procedure for applying for subsidies under existing state programs for the implementation of measures for the construction, reconstruction, and modernization of water supply systems. Residents of the region are recommended to use household filters to purify water from those components-pollutants that are characteristic of the groundwater of these territories.</jats:p>",

Propeller dibedakan menjadi dua jenis salah satunya yaitu Fixed Pitch Propeller (FPP). Kecepatan pada kapal tidak terlepas dari desain propeller yang baik agar mendapatkan gaya dorong (thrust) optimal yang dihasilkan oleh gerak propeller. Penelitian ini dilakukan karena sering terjadinya losses dan terjadi retakan pada daun propller. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui nilai thrust optimum propeller dari analisa model variasi sudut rake yang dibuat sehingga dapat diketahui dari variasi model tersebut manakah yang memiliki nilai thrust dan torque tertinggi serta untuk mengetahui perbandingan nilai thrust yang dihasilkan dari variasi model B-Series dan Kaplan. Metode penelitian ini menggunakan simulasi Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD). Hipotesa dari studi simulasi variasi yang sudut berpengaruh pada nilai daya dorong kapal serta, nilai perbandingan thrust dan pola aliran serta kontur tersebut di dapatkan dari model dengan parameter analisis dimensi dan putaran yang sama dan mendapatkan nilai efisiensi tertinggi diperoleh pada model propeller B-Series dan Kaplan dengan variasi sudut rake yang maksimum.</jats:p>"

This study quantitatively evaluates the green-space supply level from four dimensions by constructing a framework for assessment in the community life circle. It also evaluates the matching of green space supply and demand, resource distribution fairness, and distribution equilibrium under group differentiation through the supply–demand coupling matrix, Gini coefficient, and the Kruskal–Wallis H non-parametric rank-sum test, respectively. This study shows that (1) a significant spatial imbalance exists in green-space resource allocation in community life circles in different dimensions. (2) The comprehensive green-space supply level in the community life circle matched the total demand of residents to a low degree. (3) There was significant inequality in green-space resource allocation within the community life circle (the Gini coefficient of each evaluation perspective was &amp;gt; 0.4). Based on the study results, we were able to identify community life circles with spatial mismatches, different supply and demand, and other green-space resource allocation problems, which is of great significance to urban green-space research and planning practice under the &amp;quot;green justice&amp;quot; framework.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Union is committed to both lowering greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) on its roads. To achieve these goals, it is imperative to speed up the development of the charging infrastructure as well as to ensure the effective integration of the charging infrastructure into distribution networks. Given that EV charging costs significantly contribute to the total cost of owning an EV, it is important to hedge against rising electricity prices and ensure affordable charging for the end users. Connecting solar power plants and battery storage to the electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) serves as a measure of hedging against potential future electricity price increases but also as an option that can contribute to reducing impact on the distribution network loading. In addition to this, connecting EVCS through grid connections of existing consumers (office/residential buildings, shopping malls, etc.) can reduce grid connection costs for EVCS but also contribute to electricity cost reduction for both EVCS and existing end consumers. Additionally, by integrating advanced charging strategies like the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) approach, the overall charging costs can be reduced even further. This paper focuses on optimizing the power supply and operation of EVCS by considering strategic investments in grid connection, photovoltaic plants, and battery energy storage. The research explores the potential savings derived from reduced energy/charging costs, along with the reduction in peak power expenses for different power supply options. In addition to this, the research explores the effect of different EV charging strategies as well as EVCS grid connection on optimal investments and total system costs. The combined investment and energy management problem is focused on determining the optimal EVCS power supply and operation while minimizing total investment and operation expenditures over the project lifetime. The underlying optimization problems for different supply scenarios are cast as mixed-integer linear programming problems that can be solved efficiently. The results show the influence of different grid connection options and EV charging strategies on the joint operation and costs of EVCS and existing buildings.</jats:p>"

How major wholesale marketplaces, such as the Ontario Food Terminal, fare during emergencies is key to understanding urban food system resilience, as these institutions connect farms to cities. Widescale interruptions to the supply of fresh produce did not take place at the Terminal despite challenges. We present data from the frontlines, documenting the challenges participants faced and their adaptive capacity. We find that food system resilience was rooted in pre-existing relationships, the adaptability of actors in produce supply chains, and worker stress and effort. We caution that, even though the system displayed resiliency, this does not mean that it is inherently resilient. We highlight vulnerabilities in the status quo and raise a red flag around the future ability of the system to withstand shocks. We conclude that, because the system resilience we document depends on people, the well-being of humans in the system is key to resilience of the food system itself.</jats:p>"

Information system audits are essential to reducing these risks, ensuring quality control, and optimizing the system. These audits evaluate gaps in controls, non-compliance concerns, and vulnerabilities, allowing for the installation of efficient risk mitigation measures. Information system audits are essential for locating and reducing hazards related to an organization's information systems.Vulnerabilities, threats, and control flaws can be found through routine audits, which then allows for the deployment of the necessary controls and risk-reduction measures. Additionally, audits support quality assurance by assessing data reliability, accuracy, and completeness, as well as system performance, regulatory compliance, and industry best practices.The deployment of remedial steps to improve data integrity and system reliability is made possible by their assistance in assisting organizations in identifying gaps and flaws. Information system audits also aid system optimization by revealing details about the functionality and performance of the system.&amp;nbsp; An extensive evaluation of the literature and case study analysis was used to perform the research.For the analysis of this research, a sequential mixed technique (qualitative and quantitative) study was conducted. Delphi questionnaires were used twice to conduct the study. It encompasses organizations and entities involved in various aspects including but not limited to logistics companies, freight carriers, shipping and distribution firms, public transportation agencies, and supply chain service providers. Data from the semi-structured interviews for the qualitative study were collected via a Delphi survey, and 14 nodes and six themes were then generated.Audits assist organizations in identifying areas for improvement and informing decisions about system upgrades or alterations by analyzing system utilization, response times, resource allocation, and scalability. The results of this study highlight the importance of information system audits in assuring the prosperity, effectiveness, and resilience of businesses engaged in supply chain operations. Organizations can attain a greater level of enterprise risk management, quality assurance, and system optimization, which will improve supply chain operations in general, by managing risks, improving data quality, and optimizing system performance.</jats:p>",

It is possible to make the production of thermal energy more environmentally friendly thanks to the introduction of solar technologies. Solar thermal technologies are necessary for the decarbonization of the industrial sector. Information from open sources on the state and prospects for the development of solar industrial heat supply systems in the world has been analyzed. Analysis of the development of solar heat and steam production for industry in the world has shown that the solar thermal energy market is currently in an early stage of development, but it is actively developing and many projects will be commissioned in the near future. Specific investment costs and economy of solar industrial heat supply systems of various capacities are determined. The average weighted cost of thermal energy for the life cycle is used as a criterion of economy in world practice. Specific investment costs for installing solar systems are significantly reduced when their thermal power is increased. Approximate dependences of average specific investment costs on thermal power were obtained. The specific investment costs of installation and the number of hours of operation significant impact on the average cost of solar heat and steam production for industry. Approximate dependences of the average cost of heat on thermal power at different discount rates and at different power on discount rates were obtained. In Ukraine, it is possible to organize the supply of industry with heat and hot water from the use of solar technologies in a short period of time. A promising direction is the use of solar heat supply systems in combination with other thermal energy sources.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper studies production-and-order strategies under three production systems in which the supplier’s production quantity is constrained by the upfront preparations of capacity due to a long production season. The newsvendor-like retailer may make an advance order at the beginning of the production season, relying on early demand information, or a delay order at the end of the production season, depending on the updated demand information. In two special cases of perfect and imperfect demand information updates, this paper analytically derives the optimal decision equilibrium of a supplier-led Stackelberg game for three production-and-order strategies: (1) advance order under single regular production, (2) delay order under single emergency production and (3) delay order under two-mode production. In the case of perfect information updates, all three strategies likely become the equilibrium strategies that depend on the instant wholesale price and on the production cost for emergency production. In the case of imperfect information updates, the strategy of advance orders under regular production represents the unique equilibrium of the supply chain. Furthermore, the effect of general demand information updates on the equilibrium strategy is analyzed. Counterintuitively, the research results show that the retailer is more profitable with imperfect information updates than with perfect information updates when a high instant wholesale price is charged. In sharp contrast to previous studies, where the supplier always benefits from a two-mode production system due to its flexibility, our results indicate that the supplier would prefer a single regular production system when the production cost under emergency production is large, or the quality of demand information is high. Numerical examples verify our theoretical results.</jats:p>"

We develop and estimate a New-Keynesian model with financial frictions, search and matching frictions in the labor market, and endogenous intensive and extensive labor supply decisions. We conclude that the estimated combination of the low degree of nominal wage rigidities and high degree of real wage rigidities, together with the small role of pre-match costs relative to post-match costs, are key in successfully forecasting the slow recovery in unemployment and the missing disinflation in the aftermath of the Great Recession. We find that endogenous labor supply data are very informative about the relative degree of nominal and real wage rigidities and the slope of the Phillips curve. We also find that none of the model-based labor market gaps are a sufficient statistic of labor market slack, but all contain relevant information about the state of the economy summarized in a new indicator for labor market slack we put forward.</jats:p>"

Yet researchers have long documented empirical evidence of the inconsistent, weak implementation of labour codes. Therefore, the effective use of this social compliance mechanism requires examining what causes supply chain actors to exhibit failures in substantively implementing labour codes, or ‘social compliance decoupling’. We conducted the first systematic review of all available empirical evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, on the implementation of labour codes by actors at different stages of the supply chain, to identify and catalogue the root causes of social compliance decoupling. By integrating our findings, we propose a conceptual framework on ‘social compliance decoupling cascades’ that illustrates the causes of social compliance decoupling by supply chain actors at different stages and explains three pathways through which decoupling by an actor translates into decoupling by one or more adjacent actors (‘rewards–rights trade‐off’, ‘compliance capital scarcity’ and ‘code acontextuality’). We recommend opportunities for research and best practice around the recoupling of social compliance through multi‐stakeholder collaboration, mutual investment, relational sourcing and expansion of the scope of global supply chain social responsibility to drive effective labour code implementation.</jats:p>",

To minimize the risk of suffocation, federal regulations require that mechanisms be provided and procedures be included so that, within the refuge alternative, the oxygen concentration is maintained at levels between 18.5% and 23% for 96 h. The regulation also requires that, during use of the RA, the concentration of carbon dioxide should not exceed 1%, and the concentration of carbon monoxide should not exceed 25 ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) evaluated the cryogenic air supply's ability to provide breathable air for a refuge alternative. A propane smoker was used to simulate human breathing by burning propane gas which will consume O2 and generate CO2 and H2O. The rate of propane burned at the smoker was controlled to represent the O2 consumption rate for the breathing of a certain number of people. Two 96-h tests were conducted in a sealed shipping container, which was used as a surrogate for a refuge alternative. While burning propane gas to simulate human oxygen consumption, cryogenic air was provided to the shipping container to determine if the cryogenic air supply would keep the O2 level above 18.5% and CO2 level below 1% inside the shipping container as required by the federal regulations pertaining to refuge alternatives. Both of the 96-h tests simulated the breathing of 21 persons. The first test used the oxygen consumption rate (1.32 cu ft of pure oxygen per hour per person) specified in federal regulations, while the second test used the oxygen consumption rate specified by (Bernard et al. 2018, “Estimation of Metabolic Heat Input for Refuge Alternative Thermal Testing and Simulation,” Min. Eng., 70(8), pp. 50–54) (0.67 cu ft of pure oxygen per hour per person). The test data shows that during both 96-h tests, the oxygen level was maintained within a 21–23% range, and the CO2 level was maintained below 1% (0.2–0.45%). The information in this paper could be useful when applying a cryogenic air supply as a breathable air source for an underground refuge alternative or other confined space.</jats:p>",

Among them are smaller weight and dimensions, with the same values of supply and pressure with centrifugal pumps. For a long time, it was this advantage that contributed to the use of vortex pumps in ship conditions. The load characteristics of the 1.5CWX-2A vortex pump and the CM-3-6 centrifugal pump obtained from the manufacturer's experimental data and empirical dependences are presented, energy efficiency and specific energy efficiency indicators are calculated for the same pumps.

Here we examine global patterns of morphology on mid‐ocean ridge (MOR) flanks in relation to magma supply derived from residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomaly (proxy for relative crustal thickness) and spreading rate. We use multibeam bathymetry to characterize morphology using both qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative approaches, and we compare results to both magma supply and spreading rate. Morphology becomes more isotropic and abyssal hills are more irregular and discontinuous as magma supply decreases, while roughness, area of steeper slopes, and anomalous fabric orientation increase. We interpret these changes to reflect changing magma distribution along‐axis, from large‐volume and spatially extensive to progressively reduced, increasingly localized, and more irregularly emplaced. Observed relations between crustal thickness and morphology imply that average thickness of purely magmatic crust in the Atlantic and parts of the Indian ridge system is significantly less than average seismically determined crust. Thus seismically defined crustal thickness in those regions likely includes significant non‐magmatic components such as serpentinized mantle. Excepting regions of extensive mantle exposure, most morphologic parameters that we examined are sensitive to estimated magma supply but not necessarily to spreading rate alone. We summarize our results in schematic models that relate morphologic variations to changes in magma supply and mantle serpentinization throughout the global MOR system. Finally, we note that combined qualitative and quantitative results of our study may be useful for developing automated morphologic classification schemes.</jats:p>",

With the development of the mining technique of longwall face and the extensive use of large mining height and high working resistance of the hydraulic support, the fluid supply pressure is more unstable and the pressure impact is increasingly intensified. The intelligent control of the emulsion pump station is the key to the development of the stable fluid supply technology at the working face. This paper develops a new on-line adaptive learning technique to improve the response speed of pumping station based on the optimal control algorithm of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The state space model of the working face fluid supply system in the process of no-load column lifting of hydraulic support is first established using the flow relationship, and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is then verified by simulation validation. Moreover, combined with a certain fluid supply system of a fully mechanized caving face in Shandong Energy Xinwen Group XinJulong Co., Ltd, a technical scheme of adaptive stable fluid supply is verified in engineering practice. The results indicate that the fluid supply system using the proposed control algorithm has a favorable tracking effect on the ideal trajectory, and the tracking error can converge to near zero. The output pressure of the fluid supply system using the stable fluid supply technology is more stable, and the practical effect is good, which meets the demand of stable fluid supply in the mining face.</jats:p>"

Analytical hierarchy process methodologies were used to undertake an analysis of the appropriateness of land using the GIS approach. Each parameter's weight was assessed using a 6 × 6 pairwise comparison matrix because six parameters, including slope, distance to the nearest road, land use land cover, population density, soil texture and rainfall deficit, are taken into account. After all, the weighted overlay approach of the GIS application was used to create the ultimate land suitability map for irrigation. Using the natural break classification approach, the final map was divided into land suitability classes. Of the entire region, 12.9% fell into the highly suitable (S1) class, 85.14% fell into the moderately suitable (S2) class, and 2.57% fell into the least suitable (S3) class. The finding of the study will play a significant role in performing irrigation taking into account the input parameters and ultimately defining suitable land classes and lands that may be used in accordance with current irrigation technology.</jats:p>",

Companies must be able to control inventory appropriately in order to avoid excess or shortage of inventory by using inventory control. Inventory control is a necessary part of a company that requires an appropriate inventory policy to meet uncertain needs. Based on this background, this study discusses the single item inventory model in the form of photochromic glasses at Merry Optik to find the optimal total inventory cost. In meeting the uncertain needs of the company, the Additive Decomposition forecasting method is used in order to find out the forecast sales data pattern in the future. Uncertain demand causes the inventory system to be probabilistic, so it is necessary to carry out probabilistic inventory control. The P model of the case of back orders was chosen because the range of ordering periods is fixed and the company can buy inventory when it runs out before the time the inventory order is made so that buyers can wait until the inventory arrives. By using Model P for the case of back orders, the company can obtain the period between orders, the total cost of inventory, and the optimal level of service. Based on the results of this study, a pattern of sales forecast data is obtained which repeats every 12 months. Companies must order glasses within a period of 32 days between orders so that it is optimal and able to provide a reduction in the total inventory cost of IDR 21,828,771 with a service level of 95%. Companies can save on inventory costs if they use shorter periods between orders. The total cost of inventory can be more optimal if the company reduces the cost of storing inventory in the warehouse.</jats:p>"

Since health deficits (in the frailty index) are accumulated at a rate of about 3 percent per year of life, almost all of the age-related decline in labor force participation can be motivated by deteriorating health.</jats:p>"

Tangible improvements in the sustainability of this sector are difficult because of the layers of complexity that characterize this industry’s products, processes and supply chains. This article analyzes the different facets of complexity relevant to sustainability in the industrial electronics sector, by implementing an in-depth longitudinal case study of a leading Italian business-to-business multinational company. We identify three core dimensions of complexity management that are pivotal for corporate sustainability: <jats:italic>internal complexity</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>supply chain complexity</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>external complexity</jats:italic>. We find that handling sustainability in complex production systems with multitier and multiproduct value chains presents organizational and managerial challenges but also offers new competitive opportunities for resilience and innovation. Once the appropriate metrics, know-how and information flows are established, our results highlight the transferability of sustainable innovations in these complex environments.</jats:p>",

The supply-side characterisation is based on the Smart City Technology Packages (SCTP), which are groups of solutions from those demonstrated in the Lighthouse cities of the Project, selected based on their replication potential and with the aim to maximise the impact of MAtchUP actions. The SCTPs are organised in the three main pillars of energy, mobility and ICT (information and communication technologies), and its characterisation includes three main fields: a general description (including reasons for implementing the technologies, barriers and benefits), operational model (analysing business models’ archetype, cost structure and financial model), and impact assessment (in the fields of environment, economy and social). Such characterisation is done under common criteria, which allows comparisons among SCTPs. The supply-side methodology included also a PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal) analysis done by each city in order to evaluate the viability of each SCTP under those circumstances of the city, to finally obtain the most suitable set of solutions to implement.</jats:p>",

The study aimed to investigate and provide the most feasible combinations of RES that meet domestic electricity demand. For Java and Bali, Indonesia, initially, 35 scenarios, given 4 primary RES (solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal) and municipal solid waste, were assessed based on economic and environmental indicators. This explorative data-driven study found that the existing capacity could only meet 51% of the electricity demand. However, the proposed energy mixes could cover 100% of the electricity demand in 2020 with a required capacity of 8.32–19.10 GW, varying on each scenario. The feasible energy mixes can reduce CO2 emissions by 90–94% compared to a fossil energy mix with gas-fired power plants. The installation, and operation and maintenance costs per life cycle can range from 29–50 and 4–16 billion dollars. The wind-based energy mix, with installed capacities of geothermal (1.16 GW), hydropower (2.87 GW), solar (0.003 GW) and municipal solid waste (0.18 GW) in 2020, showed the highest return on investment (139% ROI) and smallest CO2 emission with highest CO2 reduction (94%). This study provides a scientific method of selecting, projecting, and evaluating viable RES combinations for generating electricity without using fossil fuels.</jats:p>"

Major findings of this paper reveal that (i) when a take-back program is implemented, the government imposes a high penalty on products that are not collected, thereby encouraging manufacturers to collect more used products, (ii) implementing a take-back program in conjunction with a subsidy program results in a greater reduction in environmentally negative impacts and an enhanced social welfare compared to implementing them separately, and (iii) a coalition between a retailer and a remanufacturer results in lowering the penalty imposed to a manufacturer, which leads to lowering the quantity of the collected and remanufactured products.</jats:p>"

First of all, according to the analysis of users’ CECB, the decision-making model of regional users' energy supply transformation is established. A game model is constructed to explore cooperative planning of an integrated electricity-natural gas energy system based on the profit models of various market participants. The government is considered as the main body of planning and decision-making, and the evaluation model of government’s pollution emissions from both supply and demand sides is established. A two-level dynamic game planning model for the wide-area IES is then created as a result of the examination of the game mechanism between users, the government, the integrated energy system (IES), and other market players. Finally, the model is solved using an iterative search approach. Results from simulations are used to validate the suggested method’s accuracy and efficacy.</jats:p>"

However, Fontan patients may develop various complications, and their hemodynamics may deteriorate gradually, resulting in a poor long-term survival rate. Development of collateral vessels before and/or after the Fontan operation is one of the significant problems, and the patients may suffer from advanced cyanosis and heart failure. Although recent studies about the collateral vessels by MRI showed that a significant amount of blood is flown through the collateral vessels, little is known about its effect on the Fontan circulation. Therefore, understanding the mechanism and impact of collateral vessels on the Fontan circulation is important.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A 0-1-dimensional Fontan circulation hemodynamic model was developed to reproduce the hemodynamic changes of the blood flow in the entire body by introducing two types of collateral vessels (VVC: veno-venous collateral, APC: aorto-pulmonary collateral) into the model considering clinical status. Also, giving various conditions by ranging catecholamine dose and introducing the concept of oxygen delivery and consumption by changing workloads, arterial and central venous oxygen saturations (SaO2 and SvO2) are predicted in the Fontan circulation models. To evaluate the cardiac function, considering the impact of collateral vessels, four representative values were examined: (1) cardiac output (CO) per minute; (2) Ees relative to arterial elastance (Ees/Ea); (3) ejection fraction; and (4) the stroke work (SW) to pressure-volume area (PVA) ratio (SW/PVA).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>SaO2 and SvO2 were less in Fontan circulations with both VVC and APC present (92% and 54%) than those without collateral vessels (96% and 62%). Also, with collateral vessels, Ees/Ea was decreased while SW/PVA was increased, leading to poor perfusion to the tissue. Regardless of the presence or absence of collateral circulation, SaO2 and SvO2, and systemic blood flow rate decreased when pulmonary vascular resistance was high. By administering catecholamine at 10 microgram/kg/min, in the presence of both VVC and APC, SvO2 was increased from 53% to 58%, while SaO2 was decreased from 92% to 88%.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The simulated results of arterial and venous blood oxygen saturations and systemic blood flow rate were well-reproduced, matching the previously reported clinical results. It is suggested that pulmonary vasodilators may be beneficial in increasing blood oxygen saturation and improving tissue perfusion, even in Fontan patients with collateral vessels. However, the catecholamine's positive effect is limited. For reproducing various conditions of Fontan circulations, it is necessary to collect actual measurement data from a variety of patients and validate the predicted value to increase the credibility of the model.Arterial and venous oxygen saturationsPressure and volume curves</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

We investigate both experimentally and by numerical simulation the heat and water transport from ground surface into the subsurface, (i.e., above drinking‐water pipes). We consider the meteorological forcing functions by a sophisticated approach to model the boundary conditions for the heat balance at the soil–atmosphere interface. From August to December 2020, soil temperatures and soil moisture were measured dependent on soil type, land‐use cover, and weather data at a pilot site, constructed specifically for this purpose at the University of Stuttgart with polyethylene and cast‐iron pipes installed under typical in situ conditions. We included this interface condition at the atmosphere–subsurface boundary into an integrated non‐isothermal, variably saturated (Richards') the numerical simulator DuMu<jats:sup>x</jats:sup> 3. This allowed, after calibration, to match measured soil temperatures with ±2°C accuracy.

The efficiency of many machines and pieces of equipment is determined by the gas-dynamic and heat-exchange perfection of processes in diffusers. This study assesses the influence of the air supply method on flow structure in a diffuser. The studies were carried out on a test bench with thermal imaging for air flow rates ranging from 0.018 to 0.057 m3/s (42,500 &lt; Re &lt; 150,000). Two designs were examined: (1) a conventional air supply through one channel from below and (2) a nozzle air supply through four tubes at an angle of 45° to the vertical axis. In addition, the influence of the cross-sectional shape of the supply channels of both designs was studied. It is established that the use of a conventional air supply through one channel leads to the generation of a pronounced central flow along the vertical axis (all configurations of the supply channel) and the creation of stagnant zones in the corners of the diffuser (round and triangular channels; the use of a square supply channel causes the most uniform air distribution throughout the entire volume of the diffuser (while maintaining the central flow). It is found that with nozzle air supply, there are no stagnant zones in the corners and intense air movement generation in the centre of the diffuser (round and triangular tubes) can be observed; the use of square nozzle tubes causes intense flow movement at the base of the diffuser, which quickly collapses upstream, uniformly filling the entire volume of the diffuser’s cylindrical part. The presented data can be useful for designing various machines and pieces of equipment with vertical conical diffusers.</jats:p>"

The input indicators covered per capita water resources, industrial water consumption, agricultural water consumption, domestic water consumption, fixed assets investment, and number of employees. The output indicator was per capita GDP of each city. The findings of the study revealed that only Huaibei achieved efficiency according to the DEA model, while the other cities in the northern Anhui region did not exhibit the same level of efficiency. The overall water resource utilization efficiency in the region was low, with significant variations among the cities (p ≤ 0.05; ANOVA test). The order of water resource utilization efficiency from high to low was Huaibei, Huainan, Bengbu, Bozhou, Suzhou, and Fuyang. An analysis of investment redundancy revealed that a large number of employees and an unreasonable water use structure were key factors that restricted the efficiency of water resource utilization in the region. The overall TFP index of water resource utilization efficiency in the region showed an upward trend, with a value of 1.02. By addressing them, decision-makers can work toward promoting sustainable economic development and effective water resource management in the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            <jats:italic>The article explores the implementation and enforcement of corporate climate policies along international supply chains by means of contractual cascading and international commercial arbitration. EU law (in particular the Corporate Sustainability Reporting and Due Diligence Directives) and the ever-increasing stakeholder pressure (climate litigations and greenwashing allegations harming the companies’ reputation and business are on the rise) impel more and more supply chain leading companies to intensify their supply chain–related due diligence mechanisms in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. Due to extraterritorial effects, ESG-related EU law will have a direct or indirect impact on non-EU entities and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-related projects as well. The article stresses the need for climate-related contractual provisions and discusses the construction of such clauses for supply chains. Due to the nature of international supply chains (the article highlights the construction and automotive industry) characterized by multiple parties, contracts and tiers of subcontractors and suppliers, the enforcement of corporate climate policies will most likely lead to multi-party disputes. In this context, the article addresses the joinders of additional parties and the consolidation of several pending climate-related arbitrations and compares the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) and some of the most important Chinese arbitration institutions. The article answers the question concerning what arbitration rules allow forced joinders and consolidations against the objection of a party. Last but not least, the article emphasizes some China-related specifics in the context of consolidations and joinders in order to avoid invalid arbitration agreements and the non-recognition and non-enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in China.</jats:italic>\n          </jats:p>",

To bridge this gap, we propose the development and deployment of SCM educational programs that provide learning opportunities earlier in students’ educational journeys. We argue that such programs should be based on self‐directed learning of SCM knowledge, business concepts/skills, and their real‐life application with help from industry partners. We present a case study of a four‐way partnership SCM educational program for high schoolers, which utilizes a project‐based learning method. Survey data and focus group discussion revealed positive developmental learning outcomes, the program's uniqueness, and challenges such as lack of awareness, expertise, and industry partners. We evaluate the efficacy of this four‐way partnership among industry, government agencies, universities, and high schools and discuss the importance of “champions” for each partner. Our findings offer a scalable educational model that leverages multi‐stakeholder engagement to address the SCM talent and educational conceptual gap.</jats:p>",

Supply Chains are nowadays interconnected and can be easily influenced by foreseen and unforeseen events. Brexit affected the supply chains in the United Kingdom in a negative way and caused disruptions. One of the main factors caused by Brexit which is influencing the supply chains is the end of free movement. This study aims to analyze the effects of the end of free movement on the supply chains in the United Kingdom based on a literature review and personal reflection on the topic. The Business had to rearrange the supply chains and implement changes in order to make the supply chains resilient in the turbulent times. The post- Brexit immigration system introduced visa requirements for EU citizen which caused lack of workers in different areas and led to delays and struggles in the supply chains. Companies had to find different solutions for the labor crisis like increasing automation and hiring non-EU workers. The effects of the end of free movement will be ongoing and will be a topic for research and observation in the next years.</jats:p>",

In the first stage of the proposed method, supplier evaluation sub-criteria are identified and weighted from economic, social, circular, and Industry 4.0 perspectives using a fuzzy group best–worst method followed by scoring the suppliers on each criterion. In the second stage, the suppliers are ranked and selected according to an overall score determined by a fuzzy inference system. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a public–private partnership project at an offshore wind farm in Southeast Asia.</jats:p>",

Technology and management can reduce fossil fuel dependence in smart cities’ energy supply chains (SC). A sustainable smart city and reduced carbon emissions require coordinated technology and management with appropriate infrastructure. A systematic review of smart city SC management literature that reduces the carbon footprint (C.F) inspired this study. The study shows how each attribute reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Introduction highlights the subject matter and principal goal, which is to investigate how SC management strategies could assist smart cities in lowering their C.F. The Methods and Materials section provides a succinct description of the refining process in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) relevant to C.F mitigation in smart city (SC) management. Significant works are described in the Results and Findings section, which exposes how smart cities and SC measurements reduce C.F. The Discussion section examines and scientifically debates the research findings. The Conclusion provides a scientific analysis based on the presented insights and features to enhance how policies must be coordinated to achieve the goal of this research study in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, it provides suggestions for practitioners and governments, and proposals for future research. The main contribution of this paper is conducting and proposing a framework for a better understanding of how the novel digital SCs, their components, and their management practices can help smart cities reduce their C.F.</jats:p>"

Manufacturers may help ensure a sustainable supply and usage of drugs by increasing the shelf life of their products, selecting the most environmentally friendly storage options, and modifying the size of their packaging. Distributors are responsible for optimizing stock management and relaxing shelf-life regulations.

In an effort to expand access and support patient health, many states are reducing barriers for advanced practice registered nurses to provide primary care without physician collaboration. Maryland provides an interesting case study. We leverage Maryland's policy change to explore the effects of full practice authority (FPA), focusing on the number of professionals and health outcomes for patients. Employing a border county comparison between Maryland and Pennsylvania, we estimate the effect of FPA. Our analysis of health outcomes focuses on three county-level health outcomes: poor or fair health, poor mental health days, and preventable hospital stays. We find that FPA is associated with increases in the number of certified nurse midwives by 0.6 per 100,000 residents and nurse practitioners by 22.4 per 100,000 residents. We also find evidence of an association of FPA with reductions in the share of residents who report being in poor or fair health by 2.8 percentage points and poor mental health days per month by 0.354 days per person. Combined, our results provide suggestive evidence that moving to FPA improves access to care and leads to improved health outcomes for Maryland residents. Removing regulatory barriers that prevent certified nurse midwives and nurse practitioners from working to the full extent of their training may increase access to primary care and improve patient outcomes. </jats:p>",

In order to solve the problems of stability and robustness of the output power of the semiconductor laser, a semiconductor laser driving power supply with high efficiency, low ripple and strong anti-interference ability was developed. In this paper, the topology of the LCC resonant converter is adopted (LCC refers to the type of resonant converter, because its resonator is composed of an inductor L and two capacitors C, it is called LCC resonant converter). The power supply adopts full-bridge LCC resonant power topology. Firstly, a mathematical model is established to analyze the relationship between LCC resonator parameters and output current gain. Secondly, an LCC resonator parameter design method is proposed to reduce the current stress of components, and the variable frequency phase shift (PFM-PWM) composite control strategy and linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) algorithm are proposed, which not only ensures the zero voltage (ZVS) conduction of MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) tube, but also reduces the on-off loss of MOS tube. The PFM-PWM composite control strategy and LADRC algorithm not only improve the power efficiency of the drive power supply, suppress the output current ripple, but also ensure that the output current of the drive power supply is stable when the input voltage, load and parasitic parameters of the circuit change. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the power supply can be continuously adjustable in the output current range of 0–40 A, the current ripple is less than 0.8%, and the working efficiency is up to 92%. It has the characteristics of high stability, small ripple, high efficiency, low cost and good robustness.</jats:p>"

For this reason, this paper takes the Yellow River Delta region as an example to launch a study on the assessment of the effectiveness of water ecological restoration projects from the perspective of the supply and demand of ecological products. Specifically, the level of the supply and demand of ecological products, as well as the relationship between the supply and the demand in the studied area, were measured using the equivalent factor approach and the water footprint approach, and the effects of the Yellow River Delta hydro-ecological restoration project were assessed by integrating the following four metrics: land use, supply of ecological products (ecosystem services), demand for ecological products, and the relationship between the supply of and demand for ecological products. The results of this study show that although the hydro-ecological restoration project continues to replenish water resources in the Yellow River Delta region, and promotes the level of ecological product supply in the study area through the restoration of wetlands and water, the growing and excessive demand for ecological products in the study area still puts the local ecosystems at risk of degradation. In the future, the Yellow River Delta region should continue to control the scale of land for production and living on the supply side of ecological products and increase its investment in water ecological restoration, while establishing a highly efficient mode of ecological product development and utilization and a reasonable mechanism for the payment of ecological products on the demand side. In addition, the Yellow River Delta region needs to pay attention to the impacts of rising sea levels and other climatic problems on ecological restoration.</jats:p>"

The reason is that these two provinces had many manufacturing companies and were two of the largest industrial cities in Southeast Asia. Based on the survey conducted, there were 160 questionnaires distributed. However, the data that meets the requirements is 145 and can be processed further. This study used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis technique using Partial Least Square. Findings: This study has confirmed a number of findings including: (1) Digital HRM had a positive and significant influence on SC performance, (2) Digital HRM had a positive and significant influence on green orientation, (3) Green Orientation had no positive and significant influence on SC performance, (4) ) Green Orientation did not mediate the effect of Digital HRM on SC performance, (5) Green Innovation had a positive and significant influence on green orientation and Green Innovation did not moderate the influence of digital HRM on SC performance.Research Limitation/Implications: This study only focuses on the scope of Digital Human Resource Management (DHRM) on Supply Chain Performance (SCP). The mediating role of Green Orientation and the moderating role of Green Innovation in research findings did not have a significant contribution. The next study is expected to examine the concept of digital HRM which is not only oriented towards green orientation and green innovation in manufacturing companies. Other considerations are needed such as digital entrepreneurship, digital business and digital skills which are currently developing in the world and even in Indonesia. This is because Digital entrepreneurship, digital business and digital skills are one of the supporters of economic growth and company performance in a sustainable manner. Managerial Implication: This study is expected to be a reference for practitioners, especially in the field of Digital Human Resource Management (DHRM) on Supply Chain Performance (SCP). Furthermore, the concept of digital HRM by organizations can be used as an effective alternative in continuously improving SC performance in manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Theoretical Implication: The findings of this research provide a theoretical contribution related to the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance, although green orientation did not mediate the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance, likewise, green innovation did not mediate the pattern of relationship between digital HRM and SC performance. However, these two aspects can be an important focus in this research and must be considered for further research. Originality/Value: This study has originality because it examines the role of digital HRM on SC performance which is still very rarely researched especially when it is associated with the mediating role of green orientation and green innovation. </jats:p>"

Additionally, seawater desalination facilities are difficult to maintain, resulting in frequent breakdowns. When the water tank capacity is below a certain level, island residents contact the water supply shipment manager to request a shipment from land. In Korea, a seawater desalination plant project using ships was newly attempted to solve the water supply problem for island regions. Through this project, an attempt was made to supply water to many island areas suffering water supply disruptions due to drought. The purpose of this study is to compare water supply routes to multiple island regions using existing water supply shipment with desalination plants on ships through network analysis based on a geographic information system. To optimize sailing route, length (m), road connection type, and name of each road section, actual operation data, distance, etc., were set up on a network dataset and analyzed. In addition, the operational model predicted the stability of water supply using the GoldSim simulator. As a result, when sailing on the optimal route based on network analysis, the existing water supply routes could be reduced (2153 km -&gt; 968 km) by more than 55%, and operational costs can be verified to be reduced. Additionally, the validity of the network analysis results was confirmed through actual travel of the representative route.</jats:p>"

This study set out to investigate the effect of different levels of water and nitrogen on yield, soil nitrogen, as well as water productivity indices of winter wheat and barley. The experimental treatments were of three nitrogen levels: no nitrogen fertilizer (N0), 50 kg N ha−1 (N1), and 150 kg N ha−1 (N2), as well as two irrigation levels containing deficit irrigation (I1) and full irrigation (I2). Each treatment was repeated three times. Wheat yield for I2 was 5,640 kg ha−1 and for I1 was 3,720 kg ha−1. The yield for barley was 5,620 and 3,850 kg ha−1 for I1 and I2, respectively. The irrigation water productivity (WPi) was increased by 55% for wheat and 83% for barley under deficit irrigation level. We recommend the use of 50 kg ha−1 (instead of 150 kg ha−1), knowing that it reduces the yield and water productivity for wheat by 11.7 and 10.9%, and by 14.5 and 12.6% for barley, respectively. In contrast, the soil nitrogen residual for wheat and barley was reduced by 56.6 and 66.1%, respectively, thus greatly reducing the risk of contamination of groundwater resources.</jats:p>",

This study examines the design and administration of TRQ systems from an operations management perspective and analyzes their impact on market access, fill rates, and revenue for policymakers. We investigate the two most common TRQ administration methods, namely, licensing and first‐come, first‐served (FCFS) systems. We characterize the Nash equilibria (NE) of importers' strategies and observe how information delays and lead times can result in under‐utilization (i.e., imports being less than the quota limit) in licensing and over‐utilization (i.e., imports exceeding the quota limit) in FCFS TRQ systems. We introduce a dual TRQ system and demonstrate its superiority over licensing and FCFS systems. We study the effects of stock‐keeping options through customs‐bonded warehouses and the choice of logistics channels on arrival patterns and fill rates. We conduct a case study of the United Kingdom and the European Union imported beef market using customs data. Our numerical study provides an explanation for the suboptimality of the current TRQ systems and proposes modifications to transform the existing systems. Our findings offer practical directions for agricultural traders to reassess their supply chain strategies by considering the logistical implications of TRQ systems and understanding their competition. This study also urges policymakers to adopt an integrative approach in (re)designing TRQ systems, recognizing the pivotal role of supply chains in global agricultural trade. </jats:p>",

This paper explores this phenomenon through a game-theoretic model that takes into account a government entity, a supplier, and a manufacturer. The primary aim is to understand how the government can make optimal subsidy decisions when the supplier moves into the supply chain. Several interesting conclusions have been drawn: (1) under governmental innovation subsidies, the supplier will raise the price of the new technology to obtain more potential revenue, which is termed the inverse wholesale price effect; (2) different kinds of innovation subsidies are shown to have varied effects on R&amp;D, production, and consumption behavior; and (3) different subsidy strategies are made compatible with the characteristics of innovative activities to maximize social welfare as much as possible. These findings shed light on inconsistent results surrounding the impacts of government subsidies on private innovations in the existing literature, providing municipalities with helpful guidance when encouraging private innovation initiatives amid supply chain encroachment.</jats:p>"

The decision-making order in the supply chain depends on the power structures, which can affect the choice of the supply chain decision-making. To study the optimal choice of green product R&amp;D mode in different power structures and the influence of power structure on product price, market demand, green level, and enterprise profits, This paper compares five modes including green product R&amp;D by manufacturers, green product R&amp;D by retailers, green product R&amp;D outsourced by manufacturers to third-party companies, green product R&amp;D outsourced by retailers to third-party companies and green product R&amp;D by manufacturers and retailers in the three power structures of manufacturers as core enterprises, retailers as core enterprises, and equal power between manufacturers and retailers to study the selection strategy of green product R&amp;D modes in the sustainable supply chain. The conclusion provides a strategic reference for the selection of green product R&amp;D mode in different power structures. The findings indicate that when manufacturers are core enterprises, retailers’ green product R&amp;D is better than that of manufacturers. When retailers are core enterprises, manufacturers’ green product R&amp;D is better than that of retailers. In the same power structure, manufacturers’ green product R&amp;D is better than outsourcing to third-party companies, retailers’ green product R&amp;D is better than outsourcing to third-party companies, and manufacturers and retailers jointly conduct green product R&amp;D better than manufacturers or retailers alone. When manufacturers and retailers have equal power, the market demand and the product green level are the highest, and the retail price is the lowest. When manufacturers are core enterprises, manufacturers’ profits are the highest. When retailers are core enterprises, retailers’ profits are the highest. Finally, a two-part pricing contract is used to coordinate the optimal selection strategies.</jats:p>"

Targeting the nonlinear variation coupling features in China’s quarterly GDP data and using the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model based on deep learning, we employ wavelet analysis technology (WA) to decompose selected macroeconomic variables and construct a prediction model combining LSTM and WA, which is further compared with multiple benchmark models. The research findings show that, in terms of quarterly GDP data prediction, the combined deep learning model and wavelet analysis significantly outperform other methods. When processing structurally complex, nonlinear, and multi-variable data, the LSTM and WA combined prediction model demonstrate better generalization capabilities, with its prediction accuracy generally surpassing other benchmark models.</jats:p>"

The key findings are as follows. Firstly, subscription-based OTT services generally tend to offer only popular selected animations. On the other hand, VOD-based OTT services were found to provide most hit animations through purchasing or renting options. Subscription-based OTT services had lower content scale and diversity compared to VOD-based OTT services. Secondly, when examining the distribution by nationality, animations from three countries including Japan, the United States, and Korea accounted for 68.0%. When looking at the specific OTT platform services, Japanese, American, and Korean animations had a high supply rate across various OTT services, including Wavve Purchase (83.3%), Apple TV (75.0%), Disney Plus (100.0%), Watcha (66.7%), and Netflix (70.0%). Thirdly, when examining the distribution by genre, adventure, fantasy, and action accounted for 64.0%. When observed on specific OTT platform services, the supply rate of animations within these three genres was high on Wavve Purchase (66.7%), Apple TV (62.5%), Disney Plus (66.7%), Watcha (76.7%), and Netflix (60.0%).</jats:p>",

It is essential for the supply chain to choose and implement a response strategy that fits the characteristics of the risk. In particular, it is necessary to use appropriate response strategies according to the period of failure. Based on literature research, this study presented hypotheses on the effectiveness of the response strategy on the failure period and tested the hypotheses using simulation and regression analysis. As for the response strategy, we investigated surplus inventory strategy, multiple sourcing strategy, and contingent rerouting strategy. As a result, the longer the failure period of the supply chain, the lower the effect of the surplus inventory strategy, while the effect of the multiple sourcing strategy increased. The contingent rerouting strategy showed a lower effect than non-response when the failure period was short, but when the failure period was long, it showed the best effect among the three strategies. Furthermore, the effect of the surplus inventory strategy further decreased as the demand increased sharply, and the effect of the multiple sourcing strategy further increased. The contingent rerouting strategy has seen a dramatic increase in response effects as the failure period increases when market demand increases sharply.</jats:p>",

Specifically, two use cases, i.e., UC-I and UC-II, are proposed, which are based on global and local routing algorithms to exploit trucks’ load COVID-19 vaccine delivery from the airport and transport it to vaccination centers. In this paper, we focus on the supply chain routing algorithm technology of collecting COVID-19 vaccines from the airport and delivering them to vaccination centers in the smart city of Athens, Greece. Concretely, the purpose and the objectives of the research effort are in the areas of: (1) describing in deep detail the proposed supply chain system, (2) exploiting the adopted architecture based on certain separate use cases for system experimentation, (3) adopting specific vaccination routing algorithms to support vaccination distribution, and (4) evaluating experimentally the proposed supply chain system architecture with regards to the adopted use cases’ routing algorithms.</jats:p>",

Due to vendor supply issues, we implemented a strategy that would continue to support clinical decision making in the absence of supplies for protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBC) and blood (RBC) detection. Method: In supply shortage situations, an automated algorithm triggered such that urine samples would be sent to the automation chemistry line to run quantification of protein and glucose and make sure an automated urine microscopy was performed for RBC and WBC detection. The algorithm triggered printing two labels so nursing would collect two specimens. We monitored the turn-around time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to results, made sure that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having all usual urinalysis results provided by the strips. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS: When we put in place the algorithm, the turn-around time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more.

Küreselleşen dünyada rekabet edebilmek amacıyla faaliyet alanlarını gün geçtikçe genişleten işletmeler adeta küresel ölçekte faaliyet göstermeye başlamışlardır. Gerek ülke ölçeğinde gerek ise küresel ölçekte faaliyet gösteren işletmeler, bir yandan tüketici ilgi ve isteklerini belirleyerek oluşan talebe göre üretilen ürünün tüketiciye sunması işlemini yürütürken diğer yandan tüketici taleplerinin belirlenerek analiz edilmesi ve üretim aşamasına taşınması gerekmektedir. Dolayısıyla işletmelerin tedarik zinciri sürecini çok iyi yönetmesi gerekmektedir. Bu çalışmada işletmelerin tedarik zinciri sürecinde karşılaştıkları kırbaç etkisini oluşturan nedenler ve bu sürçte işletmelere yapılan “stokçuluk” suçlamaları incelenmiştir. Çalışma sonucunda; Covid-19 ve Ukrayna-Rusya savaşı gibi küresel ölçekte işletmelerin tedarik zincirinde bozulmalara neden olan olayların, işletmelerin stok seviyelerinde kontrolsüzlüklere neden olabildiği belirlenmiştir.  Ayrıca literatürde kırbaç etkisi olarak da bilinen stok seviyesindeki kontrolsüzlükler nedeniyle işletmelerin stokçuluk yapmakla suçlanabilmektedir. Stokçuluk yapmakla suçlanan işletmelerin yargılanması sürecinde bu konuda bilirkişilik yapacak olan uzmanların kırbaç etkisini dikkate almaları, işletmelerin haksız yere suçlanmalarının önüne geçeceği değerlendirilmiştir.</jats:p>"

Second, well-designed pacts can provide manufacturers and traders with more options for low-carbon strategies. Although both one-way and two-way cost-sharing pacts can generate Pareto gains for the supply chain and its members in advertising competition, two-way cost-sharing pacts are superior to one-way pacts in terms of coordination advantages. In addition, an important finding is that greater profit growth can be achieved through contractual cooperation in low-intensity advertising competition. Thus, moderate competition is desirable, while excessive competition can harm the supply chain system.

However, the role of network complexity and supply chain resilience to transform supply chain social capitals into sustainability remains poorly understood. We draw from social capital theory to argue that supply chain resilience is the mechanism to curb negative effects of network complexity to transform supply chain social capital into supply chain sustainability. Hypotheses were tested employing structural equation modeling technique on a sample (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 274) of Bangladeshi apparel suppliers, and supplemented by the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to identify all plausible underlying causal configurations. Our results suggest that supply chain social capitals positively influence supply chain sustainability both directly and indirectly via supply chain resilience. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that network complexity in the presence of supply chain resilience positively influences social capitals to bolster supply chain sustainability. Findings of this research imply that supply chain resilience is a crucial conduit that facilitates leveraging supply chain social capitals as well as withstanding challenges that emerge from network complexity to embolden supply chain sustainability. Findings of this research provide novel insights to existing literature by exploring the complex dynamisms and reaffirming the interrelationships among the four vital constructs of supply chain literature. Our finding can help supply chain managers to improve resilience and sustainability.</jats:p>",

Here, an innovative scenario‐based energy hub energy management system (EH‐EMS) is proposed for simultaneous cost and emission reduction considering the abovementioned uncertainties. Moreover, a multi objective hybrid heuristic algorithm, the so‐called hBES‐MOGWO, is introduced for solving the proposed EH‐EMS, which is a combination of bald eagle search (BES) and multi objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithms. The proposed EH consists of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), boiler, heat storage (HS),combined heat and power (CHP) and multi‐carrier energy storage technology such as power to gas (PtG) technology, electric vehicles and heat storages. Flexible loads are also taken into account for reducing cost and emission by participation in demand response programs (DRPs). The optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hBES‐MOGWO algorithm. The simulation results illustrated that the total cost of EH‐EMS can be effectively reduced by installing energy storage systems and implementing DRPs. The results emphasize that considering uncertainties can lead to increase the operating costs and emission, while flexible loads participation in DRPs and PtG can reduce the aforementioned ones.</jats:p>",

By referencing the theoretical model of Technology - Organization - Environment (TOE) combined with the qualitative research step, the study proposed a new scale with 65 observed items and 18 factors. Next, the study carries out a quantitative research step based on the case of the pork supply chain in Hue. The sample consists of 365 individual/organizational stakeholders. The analysis results shortened the proposed scale to 62 observed items, 18 factors, and 4 second-order factors – including readiness on technological conditions (TEC), readiness on inter-organizational conditions (INTER), readiness on intra-organizational conditions (INTRA), and readiness on environmental conditions (ENV). Further analyzing the importance of the factors, the results reveal that relative advantage (RA), trust (TRU), trading partner pressure (TPP), firm size (FS), top management support (TMS), and competitive pressure (CP) are considered the essential foundations for the adoption of blockchain technology to the agricultural supply chain.</jats:p>"

Commonly, farmers measure crop dry matter (DM) yield in autumn, but few complete quality tests. We assessed the DM yield and quality oflate spring sown kale and fodder beet (FB) from early autumn to late winter over five years at the Southern Dairy Hub, Southland, New Zealand. Yield and quality parameters were analysed over time since sowing, using polynomial data fitting. We hypothesised thatcrop yields would remain stable during winter grazing, but that the supply of nutrients would vary, driven by a decline in the leaf proportion. Overall, crops showed rapid growth prior to winter but stable yields during winter grazing, but there was year to year variation in apparent growth trends and yields. The proportion of FB bulb increased over winter relative to the total crop yield for all cultivars and years. Fodder beet leaf was numerically higher in multiple nutrient concentrations (crude protein, Ca, Mg, P, S) compared to the bulb. For both crops, nutrients had only small fluctuations in concentration over time. Completing yield assessments in late autumn would give farmers a useful baseline yield indication for winter. Crop quality tests are recommended to identify any nutritional deficiencies that need addressing to ensure good animal health and performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ethanol, a common renewable energy resource, can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to resolve the problem of global warming worldwide. Various feedstocks such as corn, sugarcane, maize stover, and wheat straw can be utilized for ethanol production. They determine production operations and relevant costs. Although there are monetary incentives and government policies in different countries to increase ethanal use, it is still challenging to make its sales price competitive due to the inefficient supply chain of ethanol. Unlike fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas using a well-designed supply chain in the long history of mankind, additional efforts are needed to organize and stabilize the supply chain of ethanol efficiently. The goal of this study is to investigate how simulation modeling techniques can be applied to various supply chain management issues of ethanol. Particularly, application cases of three major simulation paradigms such as discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and agent-based simulation are investigated by conducting a scientific literature review. The findings of this study will contribute to the expansion of simulation use in the field of biofuel supply chain management.</jats:p>"

However, the sediment particles are always ignored in the design. Hence, a numerical model and program were established for sediment laden water hammer based on the method of characteristics (MOC). Using the proposed model, the water hammer protection influences of sediment particles parameters are simulated for the same pipeline system of a water supply project. The result shows that the resistance loss of sediment-laden water in pipelines is larger than that of water, and the initial head of pump needed to be increased to ensure the water levels of downstream reservoirs are consistent. After power failure and pump stopping, the negative pressure wave of sediment-laden water is 2.97 m higher than that of water, and the theoretical minimum internal pressure along pipelines is 7.8 m lower. With the same air vessel protection, the lowest minimum internal pressure heads along pipelines decrease with the increase of quantities of sediment, while the results show no obvious influence by changes of median particle diameters. The lowest absolute pressure of pipeline could reach −0.69 m under the condition of 50 kg/m3 quantity of sediment and 0.05 mm median particle diameter. The relevant research results are of great significance sediment-laden water hammer numerical simulation and water hammer protection design.</jats:p>",

Based on this, an in-depth study was conducted on the economic benefits of water resources. Taking Hubei Province as an example, from the perspective of industrial structure, an empirical analysis was conducted on the water use benefits of various industries through input–output of water resources. The results showed that the mechanical industry and the transportation industry had the highest relative output coefficients, reaching 12.17 and 15.21, respectively. According to the results, the economic benefits of water resources in the secondary and tertiary industries of Hubei Province were relatively ideal. In practical development, industry-leading advantages could be utilized to optimize water resources management, innovate water use models and technologies, promote the improvement of agricultural water utilization rate and thus promote sustainable development of water resources.</jats:p>",

The aim is to devise an AI-driven system that can accurately appraise these intricacies within the domain and mitigate their vulnerabilities effectively. The work employs an empirical approach utilizing datasets from various studies for developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. These include linear regression, deep learning, CNN networks are designed to predict supply chain risks and enhance the overall stability and performance of an industrial supply chain system. The Deep CNN regression model outperforms as compared to the other models in predicting supply chain risks, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 90%. The developed model will be more proficient in dealing with complex and nonlinear relationships among the variables. The study introduces a novel approach to data augmentation using Fuzzy C-means in conjunction with a Deep Convolution network model. This approach expands the data size, reduces the forecast errors, and reduces the computational of the given model. The results highlight the potential of ML and DL in enhancing predictability and resilience in the face of escalating risks within supply chain networks. The findings of the work will significantly offer insights for strategists and planners in the supply chain sector to enhance their operational effectiveness and efficiency.</jats:p>",

Short-cycle crops with shallow root systems are more suitable for these conditions. On this subject, the objective of this study was to determine the responses of the lettuce crop to rising damp rates and water table depth levels. The variables of production, gas exchange, and SEW30 values (sum of excess water above 0.30 m depth) were analyzed. A physical model of seven drainage lysimeters was used; in six, the only water supply occurred by capillary rise from the water table (0.10; 0.15; 0.20; 0.25; 0.30 and 0.35 m depth) and, in the remaining lysimeter, irrigation was performed with no water table. The water table level maintained at 0.20 m from the soil surface was able to supply the water demanded by a sandy soil. The factor-product ratio indicates this depth as the most viable option in terms of crop response. Among the analyzed cultivars and under conditions of excess water in the soil, preference should be given to the establishment of the Gloriosa cultivar, for higher yields.</jats:p>"

Objective: This is an interrupted time series ecological study where a temporal analysis of the consumption of medications in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods in the São Lourenço do Oeste (SLO) city was performed. Material and methods: Data were collected monthly from January 2018 to March 2021 directly from pharmacies/drug stores for medications, and from April 2020 to March 2021 for COVID-19. The temporal analysis was performed using the Prain Winsten test. Associations between variables (drugs and COVID-19 data) were made by Spearman's correlation test. Results: The supply of ivermectin (coefficient, 7.71 p=0.005) and hydroxychloroquine increased (coefficient 26.84, p=0.021) in the pandemic; and azithromycin remained stable (p? 0.05). There was a positive correlation between new cases of COVID-19 and the supply of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (Spearman rho 0.857, 0.760 and 0.741 p&lt;0.01, respectively) and a positive correlation between deaths with azithromycin (Spearman rho 0.690, p&lt;0.01) and hydroxychloroquine (Spearman rho 0.617, p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: According to our data, it is possible to infer that the increased supply of ivermectin, azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine was not able to reduce new cases or deaths by COVID-19, showing no effectiveness as prophylaxis of this disease.</jats:p>"

In this study, we develop a high-resolution supply chain model for essential staple crops in Zambia, aiming to estimate how improvements in transportation infrastructure would impact food security. Specifically, we simulate district-level monthly consumption, trade flows, and storage for maize and cassava in Zambia. We then conduct a counterfactual case study with low transportation costs, discovering that reducing transaction costs leads to higher aggregate net agricultural revenue and aggregate net expenditure. These results indicate that transportation investments are more beneficial to suppliers than to consumers, with implications for household food security in smallholder agriculture. Our study highlights the potential for infrastructure investments to improve food security.</jats:p>",

However, epidural anesthesia (EDA) and synthetic oxytocin (synOT) are suggested to have negative effects on breastfeeding. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of intrapartum synOT and EDA on breast milk supply, breastfeeding rates, and maternal salivary oxytocin levels. Women were recruited during pregnancy or after birth at a single hospital. Data were collected at 3 days postpartum (T1), 1 month postpartum (T2), and 4 months postpartum (T3) on 83 low-risk primiparous women who planned to breastfeed for at least 12 weeks postpartum to avoid dropouts from early discontinuance of breastfeeding. Women with cesarean section, twin pregnancy, premature neonates, and an Apgar score of &lt; 7 at 5 min were excluded. Participants recorded their 24-h milk supply by test weights at 3 days and 1 month postpartum. Additionally, they filled out questionnaires assessing their breastfeeding level and lactogenesis stage II initiation. Salivary oxytocin levels were obtained at 3 days postpartum. Women who delivered using EDA had lower salivary oxytocin levels (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .055,<jats:italic> d</jats:italic> = .442), breast milk supply in early postpartum (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .025, <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = .520) and at 1 month postpartum (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .036, <jats:italic>d</jats:italic> = .483), and breastfeeding rates at 4 months postpartum (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .037, <jats:italic>V</jats:italic> = .236) than women who did not deliver using EDA. There was no association between breastfeeding and the use of intrapartum synOT. In conclusion, this study showed that women who delivered using EDA had lower breast milk supply in the early postpartum period and breastfeeding rates at 4 months postpartum. It also revealed that using synOT at low doses during labor did not affect breastfeeding. Thus, women who deliver using EDA need support for increased breast milk supply in the early postpartum period.</jats:p><jats:p>Trial registration<jats:bold>:</jats:bold> UMIN000037783 (Clinical Trials Registry of University Hospital Information Network).</jats:p>"

Management of the wood pellet supply chains, from feedstock harvesting to bioenergy conversion, is critical to ensure competitiveness in the energy markets. In this regard, wood pellets supply chain coordination can play a strategic role in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of bioenergy generation. This study proposes a contract-based coordination mechanism for wood pellet supply chains and compares its performance in alternative centralized and decentralized decision-making structures. A bi-level nonlinear game-theoretic approach with two economic and environmental objective functions is developed. It utilizes the concept of life cycle assessment in a Stackelberg leader–follower game to obtain the bioenergy equilibrium solutions. Further, this study examines the case of wood pellet supply chains in three remote Canadian communities. The aim is to showcase the practicality and significance of the proposed approach and interpret the findings. By focusing on these communities, the crucial role of supply chain coordination in fostering sustainable development, particularly, in the context of bioenergy generation is emphasized. The study colludes by advocating a number of avenues for future research.</jats:p>"

For many elements such as Li, Co, REEs and Ti, the production sources are located in countries with poor social and environmental standards, prone to political destabilization such as military conflicts, or vulnerable to strained relationships with consumer countries. Lately, the volatile geopolitical context has further demonstrated the high dependency of Europe and other developed countries in terms of raw material supply. In addition, there is a debate about the Earth's potential to sustain the transition toward a green society by using conventional resources from mining of terrestrial rocks. As nature conservation and climate mitigation are now priorities for the majority of governments, and since conventional mining on Earth suffers from a growing social resistance, humankind may need to look toward new frontier resources for supplying the mineral needs of the coming decades. Here, we explore the use of extra‐terrestrial resources as a potential source to feed the future supply of critical metals. Extra‐terrestrial mining may be an opportunity for wealth creation and an option for critical metal resource supply when mining on Earth becomes increasingly untenable. We conclude that the potential impacts of extraction and exploitation of space resources, both good and bad, could be societally profound.</jats:p>",

This work aims to compare structural differences in contract-regulated MP procurement systems in the Republic of Bashkortostan (RB). The official website www.zakupki.gov.ru provides data on volumes and structure of MP supply in medical and pharmaceutical organizations of the RB. This paper contains the indexes of supplier and consumer rotation in the RB trade in 2013 and 2017 and a comparative analysis of tenders according to the form of order placement. The authors calculated the efficiency gains of signed contracts and conducted a comparative analysis of the examined tenders in the MP procurement system according to federal legislation (federal laws). The work undertaken allowed the authors to determine development tendencies in the competition among MP suppliers, identify the structural specificity of the MP tenders, and demonstrate their efficiency. The authors present conclusions drawn based on the comparative analysis and provide recommendations on the improvement of MP procurement in the RB. They identify the high potential of the republic to implement digital public auctions as a form of an MP procurement mechanism in accordance with Federal Law No. 223-FZ.</jats:p>"

This study calculates the crop water stress index (CWSI) for four irrigation regimes in semi-arid region, India. Plots 1, 2, 3, and 4 had soil moisture depletion of 50% (drip system), 25% (drip system), unregulated (farmer replicated flood system), and 50% (flood system) with irrigation. In this work, we examined the value of employing a portable infrared thermometer (IRT) to measure wheat canopy temperature (Tc) at two geographical locations. The IRT field of view is 51.28–5,128 cm2, or 10–100 cm from the canopy crown. The field of view change from 10 to 100 cm affects Tc and CWSI in the four irrigation treatments, ranging from 0.65 to 2.71% and 9.2 to 36.4%, respectively. The research found that increasing the IRT from 10 to 100 cm reduced slope by 5.7% and intercept by 20.6% in lower baselines. The R2 for CWSI and soil moisture was 0.78 (10 cm) and 0.77 (100 cm). Drip-irrigated plots are more sensitive to IRT spatial resolution than flood-irrigated plots. The findings suggest that CWSI studies may benefit from specific sample methods for Tc evaluation.</jats:p>",

Although previous authors have broadly explored the determinants of biomass supply intentions in the field of bioenergy, the potential spatial variation of these factors has received limited consideration from bioenergy research. We performed a structural equation modeling based on the theory of planned behavior to investigate the impact of spatial disparities on factors determining people’s intentions to supply forestry residues for clean energy. Our data were generated through a survey of 247 participants randomly sampled from two contrasting geographic regions (north and south) of the Republic of Benin. We found that spatial disparities altered the effects of attitude and knowledge of renewable energy while income and perceived behavioral control exhibited consistent positive effects across geographical regions. Our findings imply that ignoring spatial disparities when analyzing bioenergy acceptance can lead to distorted inferences. These findings can be used as a baseline information by policymakers to develop region-specific actions for achieving local transition toward clean energy in the Republic of Benin.</jats:p>"

Traditional supply chains have evolved into transnational networks that grow with time, becoming more vulnerable.

For this reason, increased resilience against various types of risks that threaten the viability of an organization is of major importance. One of the ways to determine the magnitude of the risk an organization runs is to measure how popular it is with the buying public. Although risk is impossible to eliminate, effective forecasting and supply chain risk management can help businesses identify, assess, and reduce it. As a result, good supply chain risk management, including forecasting, is critical for every company. To measure the popularity of an organization, there are some discrete values (bounce rate, global ranking, organic traffic, non-branded traffic, branded traffic), known as KPIs. Below are some hypotheses that affect these values and a model for the way in which these values interact with each other. As a result of the research, it is clear how important it is for an organization to increase its popularity, to increase promotion in the shareholder community, and to be in a position to be able to predict its future requirements.</jats:p>"

This share is forecast to reach 38% by 2050. More than 50% of those networks rely on base load provided by biomass, complemented by fossil fuel peak load. This paper describes a strategy that would see storage being integrated to substitute peak load with base load. A university campus in Scotland acts as the reference use case to test the suggested fixed-order control strategy. Given these study conditions, the capacities of different storage systems are varied, and their potential for substitution and decarbonisation is accounted for. The study indicates that the integration of small storage volumes seems very promising albeit leading to limited results pertaining to decarbonisation. Depending on fossil fuel prices, a full decarbonisation potential depending on large seasonal storage volumes could be found and a value of 0.14 €/kWh could be calculated as economic threshold to fully decarbonise the reference case.</jats:p>",

Thus there is increasing importance in monitoring information related to supply chain risks. Analyzing real-time media texts, such as news articles, can be utilized for monitoring up-to-date information supply chain risks. However, researches regarding analyzing supply chain risk related text are in early stages, and researches to apply modern AI techniques such as deep learning-based natural language processing to supply chain risk texts are scarce. This study aims to develop a supply chain risk monitoring system that monitors and extracts information related to supply chain risks by analyzing news articles. To collect supply chain risk related articles a filtering model based on KoBERT is developed, of which risk types are identified based on LDA topic modeling to be utilized as the train data. To predict news articles’ risk types, two deep learning- based risk classification models are developed using BOW(Bag of Words) and KoBERT. The results showed high accuracy of KoBERT based model in filtering supply chain risk-related articles, and in the classification of supply chain risk types also KoBERT based model showed better performance than BOW based model.</jats:p>",

CC may also damage public infrastructures such as drinking water systems (DWSs) and reduce water quality from source to tap. The objective of this review paper is to provide a critical analysis of (1) the impact of CC on the three components of the DWSs: source, treatment, and distribution; (2) the perspectives of DWS employees on CC impacts and adaptation solutions for maintaining water quality; and (3) decision support systems (DSSs) that could be used by DWS employees for CC adaptation. A bibliographic research was conducted using international databases and search engines. The search for scientific articles resulted in the selection of 5234 articles, 78 of which were analyzed in more detail for the elaboration of this scoping review. This review shows that the impacts of CC on water quality are significant, but DWS employees are not enthusiastic about developing adaption measures. This review also shows that DSSs can help DWS employees facilitate the CC adaptation process for the protection of source water, improve water treatment plant operations, and enhance routine management of water quality in the distribution system. Further research is needed to identify strategies that might increase the awareness of and interest in climate change impacts, adaptation, and the use of DSSs among DWS employees. </jats:p>"

В ходе исследования на обмотки двигателя подавалось напряжение различного гармонического состава и амплитуды, что, в свою очередь, вызывало магнитный шум и вибрацию разной интенсивности, а также пульсации электромагнитного момента. Результаты моделирования позволили установить зависимости амплитуды колебаний сердечника статора, излучаемыхпри этом волн звукового давления и электромагнитного момента двигателя от амплитуд 3-й и 5-й гармоник питающего тока, а также от несимметрии питающих напряжений в статорных обмотках машины.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The article discusses the causes of magnetic vibrations in the stators of squirrel-caged induction motorsand provides a mathematical description of the process of their excitation.

Using these dependencies in a multiphysics finite element design environment, a model of an AIR180M4U3 asynchronous motor was built. Using this computer model, the interrelated electromagnetic, mechanical and acoustic processes in the motor were studied, taking into account the slotting of its rotating rotor. During the study, voltages of different harmonic composition and amplitude were applied to the motor windings, which, in turn, caused magnetic noise and vibration of varying intensity and strength, as well as pulsations of the electromagnetic torque. The simulation results made it possible to establish the dependence of the amplitude of oscillations of the stator core, the sound pressure waves emitted and the electromagnetic torque of the motor on the amplitudes of the 3rd and 5th harmonics of the supply current, as well as on the asymmetry of the supply voltages in the stator windings of the motor.</jats:p>",

So, new supply chain management and information technology is likely to have a strong impact on managing sustainability in the supply chain management with all its aspects; environmentally, socially and economically in pharmaceutical sector in Jordan. However, there is a lack of studies aimed at recognizing how supply chain practices (SCP) can affect sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) conceptualized as environmental, social and economic aspects. So, this study aims to find out how supply chain practices conceptualized by (strategic supplier partnership and customer relationship) can affect SSCM conceptualized as (environmental, social and economic) with the mediating role of the information and communication technology (ICT) in the pharmaceutical sector in Jordan. A total of 313 questionnaires selected by simple random sampling disseminated to the respondents who were chosen from the population list of 1568 the managers of pharmacies working in Amman the capital of Jordan. The study used SEM with SMART-PLS 4 to analyze the data collected, measurement model used to analyze the validity and reliability of the model and the path coefficient in the structural equation model used to test the study hypotheses. The results of this study support all of five direct effect hypotheses and the two indirect hypotheses. The result of the study finds that SCP (strategic supplier partnership and customer relationship) have a significant impact in the ICT and SSCM, and ICT has significant impact on SSCM, also the result of the study found that ICT mediate the impact of the SCP (strategic supplier partnership and customer relationship) and SSCM in the Jordanian pharmaceutical sector.</jats:p>"

Considering the influence of the new RSSC enterprises’ emotional attitude on the decision-making of quality improvement, the theory of rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) is combined with an evolutionary game, constructing an evolutionary game model of collaborative quality improvement of new RSSC, and analyzing the game strategy choice of each participant in collaborative quality improvement of new RSSC. The study shows that when only one party is emotional, the rationality of retail service integrators will promote the synergistic improvement of the quality of the new RSSC more than functional service providers. Moreover, pessimism and optimism have an inverted U-shaped effect on quality decisions. When both parties have emotions, functional service providers remain optimistic, and retail service integrators remain pessimistic or rational can promote the collaborative improvement of new RSSC quality. In addition, the effects of quality preference, peer mechanism, feedback mechanism, and risk mechanism on the collaborative quality improvement of new RSSC are analyzed. Based on the research findings, relevant countermeasures are proposed to incentivize new retailers to conduct collaborative improvement in quality in terms of establishing an open mechanism for negotiation and consultation, strengthening the emotion management of new retail node firms, and adjusting the transmission of quality signals, with a view to realizing the quality collaborative improvement of the new RSSC.</jats:p>"

Цель – исследование метода повышения электроэнергетической эффективности фотоэлектрических панелей для электроснабжения космических станций. Методы исследования – применены ключевые электроэнергетические закономерности в области солнечной энергетики и методики обработки статистических данных. Результаты и обсуждение – получены зависимости выработки фотоэлектрических панелей от солнечной радиации, параметры оценки рабочих режимов солнечной электростанции и эффект внедрения предлагаемого метода на технико-экономические параметры работы объекта. Полученные закономерности могут быть применены в актуализации методических рекомендаций по эксплуатации систем электроснабжения космических станций и спутников.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>The paper is devoted to the study of a method for increasing the electric power efficiency of PV–panels in order to improve the quality of the functioning of the power supply system of space stations and satellites. Relevance – the power supply of space stations and satellites is carried out through the use of bifacial PV–panels, the efficiency of which is 25 ... 30%. It is known that a solar power plant has significant weight characteristics – 45 ... 50 kg per 1 kW of installed power. The cost of delivering 1 kg of payload to the space station is 20 000...22 000 $. In this regard, reducing the weight of a solar power plant designed to supply space stations has a significant demand and can be implemented by increasing the power efficiency of PV–panels. Purpose – investigate a method for increasing the electrical energy efficiency of PV–panels for power supply to space stations. Methods – key electric power laws in the field of solar energy and statistical data processing techniques are applied. Results and Discussion – the dependences of the production of PV–panels on solar radiation, the parameters for assessing the operating modes of a solar power plant and the effect of introducing the proposed method on the technical and economic parameters of the facility were obtained. The patterns obtained can be applied in updating the methodological recommendations for the operation of power supply systems for space stations and satellites.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mountainous regions typically exhibit a strained relationship between humans and the land, with noticeable spatial differences in the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESS and ESD, respectively). ESS and ESD display varying characteristics at different spatial scales. Research on ESS and ESD at multiple scales can aid regional development and efficient ecosystem management. However, the current research focuses on ESS and neglects the ES characteristic changes at different scales. This study concentrates on the Hengduan Mountain region in southwest China. It evaluated ESS and ESD, analyzed the spatial matching relationship, and proposed a corresponding development strategy. The results demonstrated four key findings. First, ESS displayed an inverse spatial distribution on the two scales and was lower in the north and higher in the south at the raster scale. Over the period 2000–2020, ESS exhibited a pattern of initial increase, followed by a decrease, albeit with varying spatial patterns. Changes in land use primarily drove these ESS changes. Second, ESD increased from northwest to southeast on both scales and showed a rising trend over time. Third, at the grid scale, the low supply and low demand (L-L) region is primarily situated in the northwestern part, and it is crucial to prevent grassland degradation and manage grazing intensity. The low supply and high demand (L-H) region is located in the southeast, where the protection of cultivated land, along with comprehensive control of rocky desertification and debris flow, should be prioritized. High supply and low demand (H-L) are found in the northern mountain area, where paying attention to soil erosion control is essential. For areas with high supply and high demand (H-H) types, efforts should be directed toward maintaining forest habitat integrity. Fourth, on the county scale, L-H types should focus on realizing the ecosystem service value and implementing ecological agriculture. H-L counties can appropriately develop economic activities. Simultaneously, ecological compensation should be conducted among counties.</jats:p>"

To achieve this, crop growth models provide insights into the impact of various crop and irrigation management strategies on both crop productivity and water use. This study evaluated the capability of the AquaCrop model in simulating wheat yields, crop water use, and water footprints in the Middle-Manyame Sub-Catchment, Zimbabwe. The model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from field experiments. Simulation experiments were conducted to assess the impact of early and late planting, drip and sprinkler irrigation techniques, and no mulch, organic mulch, and synthetic mulch options on the water footprint (WF). The AquaCrop model accurately simulated soil water content, crop water use, crop biomass, and grain yield. Simulation runs showed that early planting reduced WFblue and WFgreen by 25 and 4%, respectively. The lowest consumptive WF was observed with drip irrigation and synthetic mulching. The greatest decline in WFblue and WFgreen (52 and 11%) was simulated under early planting, using drip irrigation and synthetic mulching. Overall, the study highlights the importance of efficient crop and irrigation management practices to reduce water footprints in agroecosystems.</jats:p>",

The e‐commerce platform sells blockchain‐compatible products through a self‐operated model, while the retailer operating on the platform sells general products. Furthermore, we take into account the impact of counterfeits infiltrating the general product market. This can trigger consumers’ anticipated regrets, including high‐price regret and fake purchase regret. We design three scenarios: Scenario <jats:italic>ES</jats:italic> (the e‐commerce platform makes the decision first), Scenario <jats:italic>RS</jats:italic> (the retailer makes the decision first), and Scenario <jats:italic>VN</jats:italic> (they make decisions simultaneously). We study the impact of consumers’ anticipated regrets and the decision sequence on pricing strategies, as well as the profits of the e‐commerce platform and the retailer. Our results show that the optimal retail prices of the two versions of the products and the profits of the e‐commerce platform and the retailer are negatively correlated with the relative regret intensity. The profits of the e‐commerce platform and the retailer are the lowest under Scenario <jats:italic>VN</jats:italic> due to the fiercest competition. The e‐commerce platform prefers Scenario <jats:italic>RS</jats:italic> to Scenario <jats:italic>ES</jats:italic>. If the counterfeit penetration rate is small and the commission rate is large, the retailer prefers Scenario <jats:italic>RS</jats:italic> to Scenario <jats:italic>ES</jats:italic>. However, if the counterfeit penetration rate is high, or if both the counterfeit penetration rate and the commission rate are low, the retailer prefers Scenario <jats:italic>ES</jats:italic> to Scenario <jats:italic>RS</jats:italic>. Furthermore, if government penalties (or consumer claims) exist, the retailer should combat counterfeiting appropriately for better financial performance.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, substantial regional disparities in food consumption contribute to variations in land demand, further exacerbating constraints on food security. However, few studies have delved into regional differences in land demand related to food consumption. To bridge these gaps, this study estimated the arable land demand and associated pressures, considering food consumption patterns and the land footprint across 31 provincial districts in China. The findings reveal that grains remain the primary crop consumed by Chinese residents. Notably, the food consumption pattern exhibits substantial disparities among provincial districts, particularly concerning livestock products. Given China's vast population and escalating consumption of livestock, the country demonstrates heightened land demands. While China does not face a national-level food security threat, regional disparities are evident, with eight provincial districts facing potential food security risks. This study explored the challenges and pathways in maintaining food security and the visions to achieve it, emphasizing the importance of sustaining a balanced food consumption pattern, reducing food waste, improving environmentally friendly agriculture practices, formulating effective and continuous laws and regulations, and exploring potential land resource development to alleviate the pressure on arable land and ensure food security.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, high-voltage switching was performed by connecting semiconductors in series. By employing Snubber circuits and voltage divider resistors for each semiconductor, the destruction of the semiconductors was prevented. Additionally, a pulse transformer was installed between the function generator and the photocoupler to isolate the gate circuit, preventing electrical discharges in the circuit and enabling operation at an output voltage of 10 kV and an operating frequency of 200 Hz. The temperature of the semiconductors increased with the increase in operating frequency, which was counteracted by connecting charging resistors and capacitors to limit the current to the semiconductors. As a result, operation at 430 Hz became possible. Furthermore, a saturable inductor (SI) was connected to enable continuous operation. The SI delays the rise of the current and creates a phase difference, thereby reducing the power consumption of the conductor and mitigating the temperature rise, enabling continuous operation at 300 Hz. Moreover, by increasing the number of semiconductor series stages to six, an output voltage of 20 kV was confirmed in tests. By using two semiconductor series circuits, the pulsed power supply that can be changed to any pulse width was also created. As a result, output voltages with arbitrary pulse widths from 5 μs to 30 μs were confirmed.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, the accumulation patterns of zinc and the harmful effects of excessive zinc on sweet potato have not been well explored. In the present research, two genotypes of sweet potato varieties with different accumulation patterns of zinc were selected to analyze the effects of excessive zinc on sweet potato via hydroponic and field cultivation experiments. The results indicated that the transfer coefficient was closely related to the zinc concentration in the storage roots of sweet potato. Excessive zinc inhibited the growth of sweet potato plants by causing imbalanced mineral concentrations, destroying the cellular structure and reducing photosynthesis. Furthermore, a total of 17,945 differentially expressed genes were identified in the two genotypes under zinc stress by transcriptomic analysis. Differentially expressed genes involved in the absorption and transport of zinc, defense networks and transcription factors played important roles in the response to zinc stress. In conclusion, this study provides a reference for the selection of sweet potato varieties in zinc contaminated soil and lays a foundation for investigating the tolerance of sweet potato to excessive zinc, which is meaningful for environmental safety and human health.</jats:p>"

By developing a multi‐stage game model, we study the blockchain adoption strategy and the information‐sharing strategy considering information transmission between the 3PL and the supplier and analyze the interaction of these strategies. We find that under the case of moderate blockchain cost, the retailer could encourage the supplier to adopt blockchain by sharing information strategically. In that case, the retailer would actively share with the supplier and the 3PL for fresh produce with low freshness sensitivity and serious consumer distrust. Otherwise, due to the dominant impact of information transmission, the retailer has to keep private information if consumers are less concerned about freshness, while it has to share information if consumers are more concerned about freshness.</jats:p>",

Given that MVDC distribution networks transmit power at high voltages (several tens of kV), control through sensors is necessary to prevent exacerbating MVDC distribution network accidents. Moreover, these high voltages in MVDC distribution networks mean that high voltage insulation is required between the sensor and the distribution line and for any power supply device electrically connected to the sensor. Therefore, this paper proposes a safe and reliable power supply method using the principle of IPT to maintain a suitable insulation distance between the distribution network and the current sensor supply line. After proposing and designing a transmitter/receiver pad and IPT system by considering the current sensor specifications, a 50-W experimental prototype is developed. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed IPT system can resolve concerns about the breakdown of insulation between distribution networks and power supply lines.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few decades, electronics have become commonplace in government, commercial, and social domains. These devices have developed rapidly, as seen in the prevalent use of system-on-chips rather than separate integrated circuits on a single circuit board. As the semiconductor community begins conversations over the end of Moore’s law, an approach to further increase both functionality per area and yield using segregated functionality dies on a common interposer die, labeled a System in Package (SiP), is gaining attention. Thus, the chiplet and SiP space has grown to meet this demand, creating a new packaging paradigm, advanced packaging, and a new supply chain. This new distributed supply chain with multiple chiplet developers and foundries has augmented counterfeit vulnerabilities. Chiplets are currently available on an open market, and their origin and authenticity consequently are difficult to ascertain. With this lack of control over the stages of the supply chain, counterfeit threats manifest at the chiplet, interposer, and SiP levels. In this article, we identify counterfeit threats in the SiP domain, and we propose a mitigating framework utilizing blockchain for the effective traceability of SiPs to establish provenance. Our framework utilizes the Chiplet Hardware Security Module to authenticate a SiP throughout its life. To accomplish this, we leverage SiP information including electronic chip identification of chiplets, combating die and IC recycling sensor information, documentation, test patterns and/or electrical measurements, grade, and part number of the SiP. We detail the structure of the blockchain and establish protocols for both enrolling trusted information into the blockchain network and authenticating the SiP. Our framework mitigates SiP counterfeit threats including recycled, remarked, cloned, overproduced interposer, forged documentation, and substituted chiplet while detecting of out-of-spec and defective SiPs.</jats:p>",

The primary objective of the research is to investigate the effect of demand and supply management on these scarce skills subject teachers in rural secondary schools, specifically in the Mutale area. To achieve this, the study adopted a quantitative research methodology. This employed surveys through questionnaires for quantitative data. The study targeted a diverse population, including principals, teachers, heads of departments, and managers at district levels. The sampling technique utilised simple random sampling to select participants. Three hundred questionnaires were administered to gather this quantitative data, but 201 respondents returned the questionnaires. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The study's findings reveal the critical effects of managing the supply and demand for teachers in Mathematics and Science, particularly in rural environments. Schools in rural areas struggle to attract Mathematics and Science teachers, and the study recommends restructuring teacher training programmes to motivate teachers to accept positions in rural areas. The study suggests further that offering attractive incentives is crucial to encouraging Mathematics and Science teachers in rural regions. At the same time, school principals should effectively manage the demand and supply of these teachers in rural areas.</jats:p>"

Our results highlighted interactions between [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] and N and P fertiliser supply for the shoot biomass at anthesis and straw biomass at harvest maturity. This was because biomass yield did not respond to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> level when fertiliser was deficient. However, shoot and straw yield increased (10.0–‐34.0%) with increasing [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] at optimum fertiliser rates.

This was attributed to nutrient 'dilution' due to increased carbohydrate content in the grain. Overall, fertiliser supply impacted crop responses more than CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatments, and the impact was greater under N than P deficiency. This was reflected through conservative values for CHI, thousand grain weight and NuHIs suggesting plants allocated biomass and nutrients at similar rates for vegetative and reproductive organs independent of [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>].</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, innovations have spillover effects that are beneficial to others, even though they are not involved in the practice of innovation. Innovation is full of uncertainty, which means investment is not guaranteed to pay off for innovators. Therefore, it is essential to choose the appropriate innovation strategy, especially for those leading firms with both innovative ability and bargaining power. In this paper, both uncertainty (including technical uncertainty and market uncertainty) and spillover effect are taken into consideration to explore the innovation strategies adopted by leading firms: non‐innovation, independent innovation, and collaborative innovation (i.e., co‐innovation hereafter). Furthermore, numerical analysis is conducted to explore the integration strategy that a leading firm adopts to control one of the manufacturers. The results are obtained as follows. First, the innovation of a leading supplier is always beneficial to the whole supply chain. Second, the spillover effect of co‐innovation is more significant, compared to other innovation strategies. Last, from the perspectives of profit and innovation efficiency across the supply chain, co‐innovation is the best option for a leading firm.</jats:p>",

The sustainable management of these flows will be vital to guarantee their uses. This research aimed to evaluate scenarios of water allocation for public supply and irrigated agriculture, in order to assist in the management of water resources and the maintenance of these uses in the upper course of the Paraíba River (PB), East Axis of the PISF. The evaluation of multiple uses was carried out through the analysis of the permits issued for the Poções and Epitácio Pessoa reservoirs in 2019. Water allocation scenarios were undertaken considering the presence and absence of the PISF waters, based on the application of the AcquaNet model. The most significant water demands identified were, in Poções reservoir, public supply (1), and in Epitácio Pessoa reservoir, public supply (1) and irrigation (583). The water allocation scenarios showed deficits in meeting public supply and for irrigation in the simulations with and without PISF waters; however, in the scenarios involving PISF or when it provided a greater flow, these deficits were reduced. The results of this research provide information that contributes to decision-making for sustainable water management and to ensure the multiple uses of water, contributing to the improvement of the quality of life of the beneficiary population.</jats:p>"

The data obtained were subjected to an analysis of variance, test of separation of means and a correlation analysis. The results obtained indicate that the beans analyzed are an excellent source of essential amino acids (Histidine, threonine, valine, methionine, lysine, isoleucine, leucine and phenylalanine) and non-essential amino acids (Aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, proline, cysteine, tyrosine and arginine). The most prominent amino acids in Mexican bean varieties were: Glutamic acid, proline, aspartic acid, serine, lysine, and leucine. Regarding antioxidant activity, the most outstanding concentrations ranged from 91.18 to 96.76% inhibition. The bean varieties with the highest accumulation of amino acids, proteins, Fe, Zn and antioxidant activity were: 1) Black-eyed (23); 2) Peruvian (154); 3) Flor de Junio (150); 4) Pinto Saltillo (155). Finally, it was found that the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an excellent vehicle for the biofortification of Fe and Zn, which can contribute significantly to combat malnutrition problems and health of vulnerable communities in the urban and rural sectors of Mexico, as well as in the developing countries of the world.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>All around the world, one of the leading – according to area of cultivated fields – oleic crops is soybean, which has a high demand for moisture. Given the significance of this crop and negative impact of drought on its yield, integrated research of the influence of insufficient water supply on the intensity of physiological-biochemical processes in those plants is necessary for identifying and understanding the drought-tolerance mechanisms of soybean, as well as symbiotic systems created with its participation, and also for search for ways to adapt it to this stressor. Therefore, our objective was determining the specifics of formation and functioning of the symbiotic systems of soybean and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, following treatment with succinic acid (0.01 g/L) and 24-epibrassinolide (0.00001 g/L), subject to different levels of watering. Our studies revealed that pre-sowing treatment of the seeds with a solution of 24-epibrassinolide with their subsequent inoculation with B. japonicum Т21-2 resulted in the most pronounced stimulation of formation and functioning of the symbiotic systems of soybean in the optimal growing conditions. At the same time, during water shortage, the intensity of nitrogen fixation was the highest in the plants grown from seeds that had been successively treated with the acid and the inoculant. We confirmed that water deficit led to significant increase in the overall content of phytohormones of cytokinin nature in the soybean root nodules, depending on the way the seeds were treated. However, the largest pool of cytokinins was seen in the plants that had been treated with succinic acid against the background of both optimal and insufficient water supply. Treatment of the seeds with 24-epibrassinolide caused significant excess of content of zeatin riboside over the content of zeatin during the flowering stage, whereas in the stage of pods formation it led to an opposite effect – excess of zeatin over zeatin riboside. Fourteen days-long water deficit decreased the content of chlorophylls in the leaves and grain productivity of the plants of all variants of the experiment. The use of growth regulators managed to alleviate the negative impact of stress and protect the pigment complex from ruination. Treatment of the seeds with solutions of succinic acid and 24-epibrassinolide provided the growth of soybean grain productivity regardless on water-supply level. The most efficient was 24-epibrassinolide. Therefore, use of 24-epibrassinolide for pre-sowing treatment of the soybean seeds provided formation of effective symbiotic systems with high nitrogen-fixing activity and caused a number of specific changes in the pattern of accumulation of free and complex forms of cytokinins in the root nodules of those plants. At the same time, the treatment provided the highest concentration of photosynthesis pigments in the soybean leaves, and as a result produced the greatest increase in grain productivity of plants of all the variants, regardless of levels of water supply. In turn, use of succinic acid produced the highest level of nitrogen-fixing activity in the case of the lowest number of root nodules in the conditions of insufficient water supply, and also caused significant accumulation of cytokinins in the nodules, compared with other studied variants against the background of both optimal and insufficient water supply. Therefore, it did result in increase in soybean grain productivity, but this was lower than in the plants treated with 24-epibrassinolide.</jats:p>"

An analysis of existing literature reveals a significant gap in extending manufacturing DTs to the SC system level without incorporating structural and process aspects of DT models.

This paper analyses the organisation of sexual exploitation by entrepreneurial organised crime groups selling sex in the United Kingdom. Based upon 30 interviews with 23 law enforcement forces in England and Wales and five interviews with Adult Service Website Operators; it identifies how an ecosystem is built that ensures (a) profit generation and (b) avoidance of legal prosecution. Our analysis not only illustrates how a market ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ ecosystem is generated through mutually convenient ‘organiser’, ‘marketer’ and ‘buyer’ relationships, but also how the roles of these actors ensure sexual exploitation continues.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec>",

This research was conducted to evaluate the effects of geometrical variables (slope and length of furrow) and flow control (inflow rate and cut-off time) on application efficiency (AE) and the uniformity of water distribution in a closed-end furrow irrigation system. The length, slope, inflow rate, and cut-off time are considered as the decision-making variables for developing the multi-objective genetic algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting. For this purpose, three irrigation furrows with the closed-end system were considered. The optimization algorithm for calculating the objective functions involves maximizing the minimum water depth and minimizing the infiltration depth in a modeling loop. The optimization algorithm was linked to the WinSRFR software to calculate the objective functions. The results showed that the best combination of inflow rate and the cut-off time for 75 mm of required water depth was 1.9 L/s/m and 150 min, respectively, which increased AE and distribution uniformity to 79 and 78%. Furthermore, the AE in the closed-end furrow irrigation system is higher (30–50%) than the open-end method in different scenarios.</jats:p>",

By comparing the equilibrium solutions of the scenarios with and without blockchain, we uncover the value of blockchain in tracing wine products. Our findings show that blockchain adoption can increase WSC prices under certain conditions. We derive the threshold for a third-party BTS service fee that determines blockchain adoption for tracing wine products and reveal the moderating effect of consumer traceability preferences and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the investigation of who should lead the implementation of BTS finds that the equal cost sharing between the manufacturer and the retailer results in no difference in BTS implementation leadership. Otherwise, the manufacturer always benefits from taking the lead in the implementation of BTS, and the retailer should undertake a leadership role in BTS implementation if they need to bear higher costs.</jats:p>"

This study constructs four strategic government green subsidy models, wherein the nongovernment subsidy, government subsidy for green agricultural producers, subsidy for green consumers, and dual subsidies. Based on Stackelberg’s game theory, this study analyzes the impact of differentiated green subsidies on heterogeneous agricultural product supply chain decision-making. The results show that the government will provide green subsidies only when the input cost coefficient of green quality is within a certain threshold. Consumers’ preference for green agricultural products will improve the level of green quality. The dual subsidy strategy of the government has the highest social welfare and can stimulate the motivation of green production. When considering the subsidy expenditure, the green consumer subsidy strategy can achieve a higher level of green quality and promote the consumption of green agricultural products. The government should combine different subsidy target effects and subsidy effects to provide appropriate green subsidy strategies. According to the corresponding subsidy strategy, the producers and retailers of heterogeneous agricultural products carry out green investment, reasonable pricing, and precision marketing.</jats:p>",

The present study sought to characterize the pulmonary arterial morphology and pulmonary blood supply in patients of tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA) on CT angiography. Materials and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed our departmental database to identify patients with TOF-PA evaluated using CT angiography. The images were analysed to detect the presence of main and branch pulmonary arteries and pulmonary arterial confluence, presence of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs), laterality and relation with pulmonary arterial morphology, and presence of patent arterial duct and associated intra- and extracardiac anomalies. Results. TOF-PA was identified in 177 patients (114 (64.4%) males; median age: 9 months). Pulmonary arteries were confluent in 142/177 (80.2%) patients. According to Somerville classification, type II pulmonary atresia was the most frequent pattern seen in 127/177 (71.8%). Based on McGoon’s ratio, pulmonary arteries were adequate for surgery in 123/177 (69.5%) patients. Patent arterial duct was present in 84/177 (47.5%) patients while MAPCAs were present in 124 (70.1%) patients, of which 72/124 (58.1%) patients had at least 1 essential MAPCA supplying either lung. According to Congenital Heart Surgeons’ Society classification, type B pulmonary arterial anatomy was the most prevalent, seen in 103/177 (57.6%) patients. Conclusion. TOF-PA is associated with marked morphologic variability in the pulmonary arterial arborization to supply the lungs. Cardiac CT angiography can accurately delineate the pulmonary arterial morphology, sources of pulmonary blood supply, and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with TOF-PA which aids in planning appropriate surgical management including decisions regarding the need for unifocalization of MAPCAs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As consumers’ green awareness continues to grow, the level of a product’s eco-friendliness and the quality of its marketing have become significant factors in shaping consumers’ purchasing decisions. The power structures within the supply chain, as well as corresponding government subsidy policies, are also key elements influencing sustainable strategies for the green supply chain. In a green supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one e-commerce platform, two sales models exist within the online e-commerce platforms: reselling and agency selling. This paper establishes and analyzes three distinct Stackelberg game models, namely: manufacturer-led model without subsidy (<jats:italic>bm</jats:italic>), manufacturer-led model with subsidy (<jats:italic>sm</jats:italic>), and platform-led model with subsidy (<jats:italic>sp</jats:italic>). The results are shown as follows, with the rise of consumers’ environmental awareness, more consumers opt for green products, inspiring the manufacturer to increase its optimal greenness and platform to enhance its optimal marketing efforts level. Notably, government subsidies provide a significant stimulus. An increase in the green technology cost coefficient leads to a decline in the manufacturer’s profits across all three modes. Intriguingly, the manufacturer’s profits are always highest in the sp mode. As the marketing efforts cost coefficient increases, the platform’s profits decrease in the bm and sm modes. In contrast, in the sp mode, the platform’s profits increase rather than a decrease. The choice of mode primarily depends on the platform’s marketing efforts cost coefficient. When this coefficient exceeds a threshold, the platform chooses the sp mode. However, due to the relatively low marketing efficiency in this scenario, the manufacturer prefers the sm mode. For the government, the sp mode involves agency selling, serves as an effective mechanism to redistribute subsidies, thereby yielding the maximum social welfare benefits. Management insights are provided for the manufacturer and platform managers to make decisions about the degree of greenness and marketing efforts level, along with insights for governments to optimize subsidy policies.</jats:p>"

Due to environmental and health concerns, the use of lead has been restricted in the last years. As lead-free brass alloys are progressively implemented in the industry, challenges arise due to their differing properties from traditional leaded brass alloys. One of the main challenges in automated continuous cutting processes is the worse chip breakability of lead-free brass alloys leading to longer and tangled chips. Hence, the impact of a high-pressure cutting fluid supply, as well as the impact of a chip-breaking geometry and the combined effect of both, has been investigated at different feeds. The three brass alloys CuZn37 (CW508L), CuZn38As (CW511L), and CuZn42 (CW510L) were studied at varying cutting fluid supply pressure levels and feed rates in a radial cutting operation. Cutting forces were measured, and chips were analyzed. No overall systematic impact of the cutting fluid supply pressure on the cutting forces was observed. In conclusion, increased pressure levels, a chip-breaking geometry, and an increased feed rate enhance the chip breakability of the investigated alloys.</jats:p>",

Our results indicate that the authorization strategy is optimal for the OEM when consumer’s preference for refurbished products is not sufficiently high. Unlike conventional research, an increase in the production cost of a new product leads to different choices for the OEM. Specifically, the OEM prefers a non-authorization strategy in the reselling channel and an authorization strategy in the agency selling channel.

However, under the OEM’s non-authorization strategy, the platform’s choice is determined by the commission fee and the production cost of the new product. </jats:p>",

We find that the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than that absent uncertainty. With a sufficient degree of uncertainty, it is optimal to supply a level of reserves that is abundant (on the flat portion of the demand curve) absent shocks. The optimal mean spread between the market interest rate and administered rates under uncertainty may be higher or lower than that absent uncertainty. Our model is consistent with the observation that the variability of interest rate spreads is a function of the level of reserves.</jats:p>"

Limiting exposure to them within the population remains a pressing food safety challenge. Prevention and timely detection are crucial for minimising mycotoxin contamination in food and feed. Therefore easy-to-use, rapid, eco-friendly and low-cost screening methods are increasingly implemented. Early-stage end-user engagement in the technological development process aids and guides the research towards increased societal impact. To investigate these end-user needs, the limitations of the currently used methods and the expectations towards a novel approach were mapped among stakeholders in a comprehensive survey. Stakeholders along the food supply chain (agricultural, food processing, retail, food safety and control, laboratories) were identified in five European countries and contacted. A total of 63 participants completed the survey, which was followed-up by an interview. The results of the survey revealed that different end-user groups have different priorities. Important limiting factors for agricultural, processing and retail stakeholders of the current methodologies include the complexity of sample preparation, high cost and time-to-results. Complementing the accredited laboratory tests with a pre-screening device would be especially interesting for agricultural producers (87.5% of the participants are interested) and food processors (80%), since there is an increasing demand for on-site detection of contamination. On the other hand, food control authorities and commercial laboratories indicated higher priority towards low quantification limits and multi-compound methods. The time to get the results was found to be more important than the testing cost (important aspect for 74.6 versus 66.7%). Overall, the findings of this study are critical input for end-user-targeted development of novel mycotoxin detection platforms.</jats:p>",

The agency or reseller mode is operated by the platform. Affected by the delivery time, the offline demand is affected by the online channel, which is called the cross‐channel spillover effect (CCSE). Building game models for analysis, we derive the following major results: First, how the commission rate affects the optimal production quantity depends on CCSE. CCSE has no impact on (decreases) the platform's optimal delivery time in the agency (reseller) mode. Besides, the platform's optimal profit decreases with a positive CCSE but increases with a negative CCSE in the agency mode. But in the reseller mode, it always increases with CCSE. Second, the financial constraint decreases the optimal production quantity and extends the optimal delivery time. Third, the agency mode always leads to a larger market share and longer delivery time than the reseller mode. The manufacturer should choose the reseller mode (agency mode) under a high (low) slotting fee. Last, the manufacturer and platform cannot realize coordination by using only the agency or reseller mode. However, considering the manufacturer‐led Stackelberg game, the reseller mode can do so, while the agency mode cannot. Further, considering a retailer and a third party under the omnichannel strategy, the reseller mode can always coordinate them, and the agency mode can only do so at a low interest rate of the loan.</jats:p>",

With the prolongation of prefabricated buildings’ supply chain (PBSC) and an increase in risk factors, project delays and even interruptions occur occasionally. The difficulty of supply chain management is increasing. Supply chain resilience (SCR) as a risk management tool has gradually attracted the attention of scholars. This paper uses the grounded theory to identify the influencing factors of prefabricated buildings’ supply chain resilience (PBSCR) based on the dynamic capacity theory. By collecting questionnaires from relevant stakeholders in Shenyang and Hangzhou, a structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the research hypothesis. The capacity effect relationship of the PBSC was constructed. The results show that resilient capability has the highest direct effect on the improvement in PBSCR, and collaborative capability has the highest total and indirect effect on the improvement in PBSCR. The critical paths to improving PBSCR were then identified. Suggestions were made based on the calculated effect relationships. This paper is expected to improve PBSCR, enrich the research on supply chains in the construction field, and help better realize the stable development of prefabricated buildings.</jats:p>"

As a result, P concentration in ZnTe thin films was found to increase with increasing the InP flux, and high P concentration up to 6.6 × 1019 cm−3 was confirmed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analyses. However, In incorporation was also observed in the ZnTe:P thin films, despite that the detected In concentration by SIMS was more than one order of magnitude lower than the P concentration and almost two order of magnitude lower than those grown by the simultaneous MBE. Photoluminescence measurement of ZnTe:P thin film grown under alternating source supply showed a P-related acceptor bound exciton (Ia) peak at 2.37 eV, and the intensity of Ia emission increased after the annealing treatment, indicating the activation of P acceptor. The annealing also decreases the resistivity of the film. The results clearly indicate that the alternating source supply growth is effective to obtain ZnTe:P thin films with better P doping properties.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, a paradigm shift in power generation is being witnessed, with increasing investment in renewable energy sources. Despite this progress, efficient energy storage is still limited. Given this challenge, pumped storage technology can be one of the viable solutions. This involves storing gravitational energy by pumping water into a reservoir at a higher altitude, which is later converted into electrical energy using a turbine. This paper studies a pump hydro storage system (PHS) operation in water supply systems (WSSs), with the aim of minimizing operating costs and evaluating its effectiveness. Replacing conventional pumps with pump-as-turbines (PATs) provides a flexible and cost-effective approach. The proposed methodology aims to optimize the operation of these PATs considering dynamic energy prices. The developed computational model was applied to different operational scenarios and analyzed in terms of cost-effectiveness. The results show that the lower the average ratio between time-differentiated purchase and fixed sell energy tariffs, the greater the optimization potential of using PAT. In the WSS case study analyzed, energy cost reductions of 43.4–68.1% were achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of PHS in WSS particularly for energy tariffs with large variations.</jats:p>",

PESTEL-based concept development provides information about positive, negative and neutral external factors of the macro-environment and their influence on supply chains. The primary data were collected at a stakeholder workshop and gaps in understanding the critical details were closed through expert interviews. The information gathered was organised using a data management software and coded by following a deductively formed system based on predefined PESTEL categories (political, economic, social, technological, ecological, legal). Stakeholders that used the method on intermediate carbon carriers (ICC) grappled with identifying the obstacles that hinder the market uptake of innovations. The workshop revealed a substantial demand for additional information. Infrastructural aspects were considered key to adequately understanding all of the segments along a supply chain. Using PESTEL alone, without taking infrastructural aspects into consideration, meant that the macro-environment that surrounds and affects the ICC supply chain remained a black box. This paper developed docking-related approaches to the basic PESTEL method in order to improve its output for the development of strategic concepts and to improve the market uptake of bio-economy-centred innovations.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The expanded PESTEL method (hereinafter PESTEL + I) significantly shifted the emphasis of strategic decisions to the marketing of individual innovations compared to the basic method.

Simulating a dynamic resilience of the nexus system can provide opportunities for pre‐disturbance effective prevention and post‐disturbance recovery from the cascading failures. Previous dynamic resilience simulating is often based on the linear assumption which is not applicable for the WHE nexus system that involves nonlinear processes. To improve simulation accuracy of the dynamic resilience of the WHE nexus system, a novel nonlinear dynamic resilience model that incorporates both a WHE nexus model and a second‐order Volterra (SOV) model is proposed. The WHE nexus model simulates amount of impact propagated by an original disturbance event on each subsystem, while the SOV model captures nonlinear relationship between the amount of impact and a corresponding dynamic resilience. The proposed model was applied to the Liuchong River Basin, China, under different dry year scenarios. The results show that the dynamic resilience simulated through the SOV model performs better than that through a first‐order Volterra model which is suitable for a linear system, with Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiencies of water supply, hydropower generation, and environment conservation subsystems increasing by 36.8%, 70.9%, and 17% respectively. Among the WHE nexus system, the water supply subsystem is found to be the least resilient. Moreover, the proposed nonlinear model is more suitable for simulating and predicting dynamic resilience when a severer water resources drought occurs. The proposed model helps to guide resilience management of water resource system by combining nexus and resilience thinking.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this study is that there are two methods for designing firefighting piping: the hydraulic calculation method and the conventional piping method. In the field, the conventional piping method according to the ‘Fire Safety Performance Standards for Sprinkler Equipment’ [Appendix 1] is preferred. There is no mention of the basis and physical meaning of the number of heads for each water supply pipe diameter in the conventional piping method, and the types of pipes that can be used have also increased. Since there was no confirmation as to whether it was appropriate to calculate the number of heads according to [Appendix 1] for each type of pipe, an attempt was made to establish a basis through comparison of regulations in each country and hydrodynamic calculations.\r\nThe research method was to confirm the basis of the ‘Fire Safety Performance Standards for Sprinkler Equipment’ [Appendix 1] through analysis of relevant standards in the US, UK, and Korea. Based on the flow rate in the pipe, the mass flow rate-based head and the number of pipe heads were calculated and compared. As for the type of pipe, KS D 3507, which is the most commonly used, was used as a standard, and KS D 5301 and 3595 pipes were compared to determine whether the number of heads was appropriate. In addition, in order to check the limits of branch piping based on the flow speed limit of branch piping (6 ㎧) and the flow speed limit of other piping (10 ㎧), 25A (25 Su), 32A (30 Su), 40A (40 Su), we checked for changes by increasing the number of branch pipes to 50A (50 Su).\r\nThrough this study, it was confirmed that the basis for the method for calculating water supply pipe diameter by number of sprinkler heads is in NFPA 13. Based on the pipe flow rate, the number of heads was calculated by comparing the head number based on mass flow rate for the head and pipe. Using KS D 3507 as the calculation standard in [Appendix 1], it was confirmed that KS D 5301 and 3595 pipes can be sufficiently used as a result of comparative comparison considering the degree of irradiation. In addition, as a result of increasing the number of branch pipes, it was determined that it was appropriate to use branch pipes up to 40A, and it was confirmed that there was no change as the number of branch pipes increased.\r\nThrough comparison of the standards and the number of heads based on mass flow rate, the basis of ‘Fire Safety Performance Standards for Sprinkler Equipment’ [Appendix 1] was confirmed, and it was confirmed that all KS D 3507, 5301, and 3595 are applicable. In the case of KS D 3595, there are 60 Su and 75 Su as names corresponding to 65A, so it was judged that flexibility in design could be achieved.</jats:p>",

Optimizing manual experience based scheduling plans can help water utilities rationally allocate water plants and pump stations, ensuring the safety, stability, and economy of the water supply system. However, there is a lack of real-time, rational, and optimized scheduling methods. To address this, we proposed a novel intelligent scheduling framework based on deep learning. In this framework, two neural network models, multi-heads convolutional gated recurrent unit network (MH-CGRU) and multi-head gated recurrent unit network (MH-GRU), can effectively extract key features from the WDNs. Operating data were used as decision variables to predict and generate scheduling orders for water plants and pump stations, respectively. The rationality of the orders is verified by combining a high precision online hydraulic model and the evaluation of the operational status of the WDNs. This system has been deployed in a real WDN and put into practical application. From June to November of 2022, the total adoption rate of all orders reached 96.29%, with the average deviation between predicted and actual control targets being less than 5%, and energy consumption decreased by 3.05% compared to the previous year.</jats:p>",

The LLC resonant converter can be used as the key power conversion link in the marine DC power supply system due to its ability to realize electrical isolation in a high-power environment and soft switching within a wide load range. Aiming at the problem of sudden changes in voltage gain at a high switching frequency under light load conditions and the problem of insufficient voltage gain under heavy load conditions due to the parasitic parameters of power devices (mainly referring to the junction capacitor), this paper first proposes a full operating range performance optimization design method. By adding an auxiliary circuit that can be opened according to the operating conditions and a multi-objective particle swarm parameter optimization method that considers the converter loss and voltage gain under heavy load conditions, the performance of the LLC resonant converter can be improved in a full range of operating conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by an experimental prototype and compared with the conventional methods and existing solutions to highlight the superiority of the proposed method in this paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Yellow River Basin (YRB) has undergone profound climate and land-use change. These transformations are anticipated to affect the availability of water resources, potentially causing substantial perturbations to the equilibrium between water availability and societal needs. Consequently, research is warranted to explore the ramifications of climate and land-use change on the water provision service, particularly their impacts on the delicate equilibrium between supply and demand. To quantify the water supply–demand relationship, this study introduces the water supply and demand index (WSDR). This study examines the impacts of climate and land-use change on the actual evapotranspiration, water yield, and WSDR in the YRB from 1995 to 2019. According to the results, the YRB experienced an increase in forest land by 4.72%, grassland by 1.71%, and a substantial surge of 595.36% in construction land; however, cropland witnessed a decrease of 5.95%. The climate exhibited a discernible wetting trend (3.38 mm/year, p &lt; 0.01). The actual evapotranspiration significantly increased by 2.45 mm/year (p &lt; 0.01), but this increase was not substantial enough to result in a decline in the water yield, since precipitation also increased. The annual water demand depth demonstrated a statistically significant increasing trend (0.13 mm/year, p &lt; 0.01), but this increase was not sufficient to cause a decrease in the WSDR, since the water yield also increased (0.94 mm/year). Land use had a significantly negative effect on the water yield and WSDR, but this negative effect was offset by the positive effects of climate variability. At the basin scale, there exists a surplus of water resources (WSDR &gt; 0). Nevertheless, regions grappling with water resource deficits (WSDR &lt; 0) have witnessed an increase from 18% in 1995 to 26% in 2019. This indicates that the primary water resource problem in the YRB is the uneven spatial distribution of water resources. Hence, implementing spatial management strategies at larger scales may be instrumental in mitigating water scarcity in the region. These findings can serve as a valuable reference for the management of water resources, as well as for basin planning and construction.</jats:p>"

Some common issues in food supply chains are lacking efficient traceability of product origins and distributions. Blockchain is an emerging technology for the agricultural supply chain which could monitor food quality and safety by digitally tracking data and processes of material resources. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things (IoT) system is used for diagnosis and control in smart agriculture such as crop growth observation that can produce good quality and sustainable farm production. This work proposes a framework of the integration of blockchain with IoT to improve the reliability of food supply chain (FSC) by focusing on optimizing the consensus algorithm of blockchain.

After incubation, the pulse‐treated LNA bacteria contained more proteins and polysaccharides (0.00064, 0.0012 ng cell<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) than the continuous‐treated LNA (0.00014, 0.00014 ng cell<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), conferring endurance and rapid response to pulses. Compared to LNA, HNA keystone taxa had stronger correlations with the primary glucose metabolism step, glycolysis, and occupied leading positions to explain the random forest model. They are essential to introduce glucose into the element cycling of the whole community under both treatments. Our work outlines a systematic bacterial response to carbon input.</jats:p>",

However, very few people know about maternal belief, experience about breast milk supply, and how it impacts breastfeeding practice. The aim of the study is to identify the prevalence and association between mothers’ belief and experience of insufficient breast milk supply with mother’s knowledge regarding breast feeding.  Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on (1,000) participants who took six months postpartum in the primary health care centers (PHCC) and Raparin Teaching Hospital for children (RTHC) in Erbil city /Iraq. Data were collected via direct interview. The question used in the interview were developed after a review of the relevant literature. Frequency, percentage, and Chi-square were used for the purpose of data   analysis.  Results: In general, the study showed the prevalence of mothers' belief regarding insufficient breast milk supply was 59.8%. Also, the prevalence of a mother’s experience was 78.6%. Mothers who had a poor level of knowledge regarding breastfeeding got the highest percentage, 62.2%. However, it showed the highly significant association between mothers’ knowledge and mode of the last delivery with mothers’ belief of insufficient breast milk supply. Moreover, there was a highly significant association between mother’s experience with socio economic status.  Conclusion: The majority of the mothers had belief and experience of insufficient breast milk supply (IBMS). The current study showed a significant association between mothers’ belief with mother’s knowledge regarding the benefits of breastfeeding.</jats:p>",

In addition, despite the consumption of more than half of these resources in the agricultural sector, a rate between 0 and 15% of the price of the products has always been received from the farmers. Considering the concept of virtual water and the water content of products in the form of green water, blue water and gray water, the present research has calculated the economic value of virtual water of agricultural products with the approach of maximizing water use efficiency. The investigated sample includes eight cities (counties) of Sanmenxia, Jiaozuo, Nanyang, Shangqiu, Puyang, Luohe, Luoyang and Kaifeng and six agricultural products (wheat, barley, potato, rapeseed, tomato and corn). A fuzzy dynamic programming model has been used to evaluate the objective function. The results showed that the maximum and minimum economic value of water content (sum of surface and groundwater) of the products were estimated for Kaifeng and Shangqiu regions equal to 1.16 and 0.86 Yuan/m3, respectively.</jats:p>",

Transpiration‐driven hydrovoltaic power generator (HPG) has been demonstrated to be a promising energy harvesting strategy with the advantages of negative heat and zero‐carbon emissions. Herein, this work demonstrates a fiber‐based stretchable HPG with the advantages of high output, portability, knittability, and sustainable power generation. Based on the functionalized micro‐nano water diffusion channels constructed by the discarded mask straps (MSs) and oxidation‐treated carbon nanomaterials, the applied water can continuously produce electricity during the spontaneous flow and diffusion. Experimentally, when a tiny 0.1 mL of water encounters one end of the proposed HPG, the centimeter‐length device can yield a peak voltage of 0.43 V, peak current of 29.5 µA, and energy density of 5.833 mW h cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. By efficiently integrating multiple power generation units, sufficient output power can be provided to drive commercial electronic devices even in the stretched state. Furthermore, due to the reversibility of the electrical output during dynamic stretching‐releasing, it can passively convert physiological activities and motion behaviors into quantifiable and processable current signals, opening up HPG's application in the field of self‐powered wearable sensing.</jats:p>",

This study aims to identify the challenges leading to supply inadequacy and uneven distribution, while proposing interventions to enhance water supply for households. The study employed surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions to gather comprehensive data on domestic water supply issues in rural communities in Bontoc, Philippines. The findings reveal two primary issues in these rural communities: supply inadequacy and unequal distribution. Supply inadequacy is attributed to factors such as wasteful water use, water scarcity during prolonged dry seasons, limited water sources, and population growth. Uneven distribution results from factors like landslides, illegal tapping, irregular water quality, insufficient monitoring of quantity and pressure, and inadequacies in the water distribution network layout. The study suggests several crucial actions for the local government unit (LGU) of Bontoc. These include augmenting water sources, implementing regular water supply monitoring, ensuring timely repairs, replacing old pipes, optimizing distribution pipeline layouts, enhancing water pressure, and rigorously enforcing municipal water ordinances. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of household water management practices, such as responsible consumption, supply conservation, and recycling. The effective implementation of these interventions, through collaboration between the LGU and households, has the potential to ameliorate the constraints in domestic water supply and distribution. This collaborative approach is essential for improving supply management and addressing the current challenges faced by domestic water consumers.</jats:p>"

Here, we analyze the cradle-to-gate energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of current and future nickel-manganese-cobalt and lithium-iron-phosphate battery technologies. We consider existing battery supply chains and future electricity grid decarbonization prospects for countries involved in material mining and battery production. Currently, around two-thirds of the total global emissions associated with battery production are highly concentrated in three countries as follows: China (45%), Indonesia (13%), and Australia (9%). On a unit basis, projected electricity grid decarbonization could reduce emissions of future battery production by up to 38% by 2050. An aggressive electric vehicle uptake scenario could result in cumulative emissions of 8.1 GtCO2eq by 2050 due to the manufacturing of nickel-based chemistries. However, a switch to lithium iron phosphate-based chemistry could enable emission savings of about 1.5 GtCO2eq. Secondary materials, via recycling, can help reduce primary supply requirements and alleviate the environmental burdens associated with the extraction and processing of materials from primary sources, where direct recycling offers the lowest impacts, followed by hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 61, 51, and 17%, respectively. This study can inform global and regional clean energy strategies to boost technology innovations, decarbonize the electricity grid, and optimize the global supply chain toward a net-zero future.</jats:p>",

In the current research, the Total Outflow (TO) of the Mahabad Dam reservoir has been estimated under six scenarios including the Monthly Cumulative Rainfall (MCR), Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), Stream Flow (SF), Mean Temperature (T), Pan Evaporation (Ep), Sediment Flushing Gate Outlet (SFGO), Penstock Outflow (PO), Evaporation Losses (EL), Cumulative Non-Scheduled Discharge (CNSD), Live Storage Volume (LSV), Water Surface Area (WSA), Monthly Water Level (MWL), Total Allocated Water (TAW), and Generated Power (GP) variables for the 2001–2021 period. Estimation of TO is accomplished via individual and wavelet-developed (W-developed) data-mining approaches, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), wavelet-ANNs (WANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and wavelet-GEP (WGEP). The obtained values of RMSE for WGEP1–WGEP6 models account for 5.917, 2.319, 4.289, 8.329, 10.713, and 9.789 million cubic meters (MCM), respectively, based on the following scenarios: reservoir inlet elements, reservoir outlet elements, consumption, storage characteristic, climate, and energy.

Microvascular reperfusion was calculated as the percentage increase in DCS‐derived CBF that occurred with recanalization. The adequacy of reperfusion was defined by persistent CBF deficit, calculated as: baseline CBF deficit ‐ microvascular reperfusion.

However, patients with good functional outcomes had a smaller persistent CBF deficit (median: 1%; IQR: ‐11%–16%) than patients with poor outcomes (median: 28%; IQR: 2%–50%), p=0.02. Smaller persistent CBF deficit was also associated with smaller infarct volume (p=0.004).

We propose a health information topic modeling analysis framework that integrates deep learning methods and clustering techniques to model the supply‐side and demand‐side topics of health information and to quantify the thematic alignment of supply and demand. To validate the effectiveness of the framework, we have conducted an empirical analysis on a dataset with 90,418 pieces of textual data from two prominent social networking platforms. The results show that the supply of health information in general has not yet met the demand, the demand for health information has not yet been met to a considerable extent, especially for disease‐related topics, and there is clear inconsistency between the supply and demand sides for the same health topics. Public health policy‐making departments and content producers can adjust their information selection and dissemination strategies according to the distribution of identified health topics, thereby improving the effectiveness of public health information dissemination.</jats:p>",

Aiming at the optimal configuration and control of the metro hybrid energy storage system (HESS), an energy management strategy (EMS) based on dual DC/DC architecture and voltage droop method is proposed. And then the control parameters are adjusted in segments by combining the DC bus voltage and values of SOC of LiB and SC. What's more, a hardware‐in‐loop (HIL) simulation platform of Metro DC power supply system is built to verify the control strategy. The experimental results show that HESS could stabilize the metro voltage within a safe voltage of 580 V and achieve 100% braking energy recovery by optimal energy distribution between two different types of energy storage systems, which are only 79.9% and 39.2% in other single energy storage system by contrast. At the same time, the HIL simulation platform can be used to verify the control effect of different configuration capacities and different control strategies of the HESS, helping to provide the optimal solution of HESS for actual subway lines.</jats:p>",

This situation is particularly dire in protracted crises where insecurity, dysfunctional health facilities, poor infrastructure and prohibitive costs hinder equitable access to the commodity. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan, with the guidance of its partners, procured and installed a pressure swing adsorption central oxygen supply plant to address the shortfall. The plant aimed to ensure a more sustainable and technologically appropriate medicinal oxygen supply system for the country and to bridge the humanitarian and development divide, which had always been challenging. This article discusses the key issues, challenges and lessons associated with the procurement and installation of this plant. The major challenges encountered during the procurement and installation of the plant were the time it took to procure and install in the face of urgent needs for medicinal oxygen and its short and long-term sustainability. Lessons learnt include the need for exhaustive and evidence-based considerations in deciding on which source of medicinal oxygen to deploy in protracted crisis settings. The successful installation and operationalization of the plant demonstrated that it is possible to bridge the humanitarian-development divide amidst the complexities of a protracted crisis and an ongoing pandemic. The Ministries of Health, with the support of its partners, should assess and document the impact of this and other similar central oxygen production plants in protracted crisis settings regarding their sustainability, cost, and effectiveness on medicinal oxygen supply. The Ministry of Health of South Sudan should expedite the finalization and operationalization of the longer-term public-private partnership and continue to monitor the quality of oxygen produced by this plant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title/>\n               <jats:p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires a high metabolic turnover to allow for constant expansion. We and others have previously shown that primary human AML blasts rely on fatty acid (FA)-oxidation for survival and proliferation. (Shafat MS, et al. 2017, Jones CL, et al. 2018). The liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism (Hodson L, and Gunn PJ. 2019). Given that AML is a FA dependent tumor, we have studied the interactions between AML and the liver, and specifically how these affect lipid metabolism, the availability of pro-tumoral FFA and ultimately the mechanism by which this supports AML growth.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To understand the role of lipid metabolism we used two syngeneic models of AML (HOXA9/Meis1 or MN1). When engrafted with AML cells, mice body weight during the latter stages of disease. After sacrifice, the size of epididymal and inguinal fat pads were significantly reduced in mice with AML compared to controls. Mice with AML also had elevated free fatty acid (FFA) and reduced glucose in the plasma. We and others have shown that AML induces lipolysis of white adipose tissue for uptake by blasts and resulting in tumor expansion (Shafat MS, et al. 2017, Ye H, et al. 2016). Since the liver is the master regulator of available FA in the plasma, we isolated livers from AML engrafted mice. Transcriptomics revealed down-regulation of genes involved in FA uptake and metabolism. RT-qPCR of RNA isolated from liver samples confirmed these results showing down-regulation of FA transport proteins, (FABP1, SLC27A2, SLC27A5, and CD36) and FA metabolism genes (CPT1, ACADM, and HMGCS2). Furthermore, primary hepatocytes isolated and cultured with AML conditioned media showed a down-regulation of FA uptake and metabolism genes. These data support the hypothesis that AML secretes a factor that alters lipid metabolism in the liver.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To discover the factor that AML secretes, and which regulates FA uptake and metabolism in the liver, a proteome profile of the serum from AML engrafted mice was compared to conditioned media from AML cultured cells. Pathway analysis revealed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IL-1B and Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as possible key factors involved in liver FA metabolism (Jing Y, et al. 2019, Kaibori M, et al. 2002). In vitro gene expressions analysis of primary hepatocytes revealed that addition of HGF to the medium, but not Il-1b or G-CSF, inhibited expression of FA uptake genes. In addition, using Seahorse mitochondrial stress kit we confirmed that primary hepatocytes decreased FA oxidation when cultured with AML conditioned media or HGF. Next, we confirmed that AML derived HGF was responsible for inhibition of hepatocyte FA genes by using a neutralizing antibody to HGF which blocked the transcriptional changes previously observed in hepatocytes cultured in AML conditioned media. This showed that AML derived HGF downregulates hepatocyte FA uptake and metabolism. Finally, to determine the role of AML in the uptake of FA by hepatocytes, cultures of primary murine hepatocytes were pretreated with AML conditioned media or HGF with and without neutralizing antibody. A BODIPY conjugated long chain FA was then added to the culture. Images analysis showed hepatocytes had reduced lipid uptake in the presence of AML condition media or HGF, but this was restored with the addition of HGF neutralizing antibody.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Here we report that AML inhibition of lipid uptake in the liver, through an HGF dependent mechanism, increases the availability of plasma FA and forms a fundamental part of the AML disease. Ongoing work to develop our understanding of how AML increases access to FA to aid proliferation, may aid in the development of new therapeutics to target liver metabolism in combination with other AML therapies.</jats:p>",

Currently, the hydrogen energy supply chain is still in its development stage and requires a comprehensive comparative analysis of various hydrogen production technologies as well as storage and transportation methods to ensure the optimal application route for hydrogen energy. In this study, GaBi 10 software is used to conduct a comparative and evaluative analysis of the potential environmental impact associated with hydrogen energy application. The life cycle assessment encompasses all stages of the hydrogen supply chain, including production, transportation and utilization. The results indicate that hydrogen production from wind power has the lowest global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). Due to the high energy consumption of the liquefaction process, liquid hydrogen transportation is currently associated with the largest carbon emissions among all modes of hydrogen transport. However, if renewable energy sources are utilized to power hydrogen liquefaction, significant reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved. An evaluation of the carbon footprint associated with the completed hydrogen supply chain indicates that hydrogen produced from renewable sources is cost-effective for use in gas-fired boilers from an environmental perspective. </jats:p>",

We critically conducted a narrative literature review to identify procedural and practical issues in the current vaccine supply chain. The search was conducted across various academic disciplines, including biomedical science, life science, law and social science, using resources such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Westlaw. After screening 731 articles, 55 studies were selected for review. The narrative review revealed several critical barriers that hinder vaccine supply in less-developed countries (LDCs) as follows: (1) WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) waiver requests may not be granted due to its stringent consensus rule; (2) the current compulsory license system may not work due to the complexity of IP rights covering COVID-19 vaccine technologies; (3) only a few LDCs have domestic companies capable of manufacturing vaccines, and (4) political and economic tensions among countries exacerbate existing barriers to vaccine distribution in LDCs. Based on these findings, we proposed a comprehensive compulsory license system, which combines TRIPS’s compulsory license system with the third-party beneficiary mechanism under Common Law. This integrated approach offers a balanced solution that ensures fair compensation for vaccine developers while facilitating broader vaccine access.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to use reliability indicators (RI) to simulate management scenarios in the Lurin River Basin. First, flow rates for the period 1969–2019 were calculated using the EvalHid HBV hydrological model and SIMGES, both from the AQUATOOL decision support system, to simulate demands. The estimation of agricultural demand IRs was made under three conditions: that the deficits for one, two, and 10 years should not exceed 20–40, 40–60, and 80–100% of the annual demand. The goodness-of-fit indices obtained for flow calibration were 0.716, 0.89, and 0.901 for Nash index (NSE), Nash natural logarithm (Ln NSE), and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R), representing the values of satisfactory, very good, and good, respectively. Agricultural demands present annual deficits of 59–96, 92–138, and 333–688% for one, two, and 10 years, so a 50 m3 reservoir is proposed to meet the IR. Thus, the information generated could be used to improve water resource management in the Lurin Basin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Shortening food supply chains attracts increasing support from policymakers, to improve returns to farmers and stimulate rural development. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the impacts of short food supply chains on local economies. To address this, the article quantifies the impacts of short food supply chains on local economies, using the Keynesian-based Local Multiplier 3 method (LM3), applied to a unique dataset of 122 farm businesses from five European Union countries (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom). Estimations cover 305 market chains, comprising both short and long food supply chains, in which sampled farmers participate. The results indicate that the revenues from farm production remain largely within local economies, generating a substantial multiplier effect (LM3 &gt; 2). This effect stems from purchases of farm inputs locally including, in the first instance, hiring local labour, as well as the expenditures of local suppliers that re-spend part of their revenues within the local area. The multiplier effects of short food supply chains are similar to long food supply chain equivalents as both use largely local labour and source tradable inputs locally. In shaping food chain policy a broader set of socioeconomic benefits to local development from selling through short food supply chains should be considered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has brought about enormous economic and environmental benefits, promoting sustainable development. However, due to the intermittency and volatility of PV power, the high penetration rate of PV power generation may pose challenges to the planning and operation of power systems. Accurate PV power forecasting is crucial for the safe and stable operation of the power grid. This paper proposes a short-term PV power forecasting method using K-means clustering, ensemble learning (EL), a feature rise-dimensional (FRD) approach, and quantile regression (QR) to improve the accuracy of deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of PV power. The K-means clustering algorithm was used to construct weather categories. The EL method was used to construct a two-layer ensemble learning (TLEL) model based on the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), CatBoost, and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The FRD approach was used to optimize the TLEL model, construct the FRD-XGBoost-LSTM (R-XGBL), FRD-RF-LSTM (R-RFL), and FRD-CatBoost-LSTM (R-CatBL) models, and combine them with the results of the TLEL model using the reciprocal error method, in order to obtain the deterministic forecasting results of the FRD-TLEL model. The QR was used to obtain probability forecasting results with different confidence intervals. The experiments were conducted with data at a time level of 15 min from the Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Center (DKASC) to forecast the PV power of a certain day. Compared to other models, the proposed FRD-TLEL model has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in different seasons and weather types. In probability interval forecasting, the 95%, 75%, and 50% confidence intervals all have good forecasting intervals. The results indicate that the proposed PV power forecasting method exhibits a superior performance in forecasting accuracy compared to other methods.</jats:p>"

However, the deployment of this infrastructure entails considerable uncertainty. Here we explore the global feasible supply of steel and cement within Paris-compliant carbon budgets, explicitly considering uncertainties in the deployment of infrastructure. Our scenario analysis reveals that despite substantial growth in recycling- and hydrogen-based production, the feasible steel supply will only meet 58–65% (interquartile range) of the expected baseline demand in 2050. Cement supply is even more uncertain due to limited mitigation options, meeting only 22–56% (interquartile range) of the expected baseline demand in 2050. These findings pose a two-fold challenge for decarbonizing the steel and cement industries: on the one hand, governments need to expand essential infrastructure rapidly; on the other hand, industries need to prepare for the risk of deployment failures, rather than solely waiting for large-scale infrastructure to emerge. Our feasible supply scenarios provide compelling evidence of the urgency of demand-side actions and establish benchmarks for the required level of resource efficiency.</jats:p>"

However, it is unclear how BIM can facilitate supply chain resilience in prefabricated buildings. This study aims to construct a conceptual framework to better understand the influencing paths of BIM on supply chain resilience in the context of prefabricated buildings. It employs an integrative review method to identify key factors influencing the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain and explore the effects of BIM on these factors. The role of BIM in linking these factors was verified through an empirical case. The results show that BIM resources and capabilities can enhance supply chain resilience by influencing participant factors (assembly construction capability, design capability) and partnership factors (information sharing, cooperation, coordination, and trust). This study incorporates supply chain resilience and BIM technology into a conceptual framework in the context of prefabricated buildings, providing new theoretical insights for future supply chain management.</jats:p>"

This paper introduces a novel approach, the AdaBoost–BPNN model, to overcome the limitations of traditional data-driven estimation methods, such as a low estimation accuracy and poor generalization ability. The proposed model employs a back propagation neural network (BPNN) for the preliminary estimation. Subsequently, an AdaBoost–BPNN model is developed as a strong learner using the AdaBoost integration algorithm. Each BPNN sub-model serves as a weak learner within the AdaBoost framework. The final output of the strong learner is obtained by combining the individual outputs from the weak learners using weighting factors. This adaptive adjustment of weighting factors enhances the accuracy of SOC estimation. The proposed SOC estimation algorithm is evaluated and validated through experimental analysis. Throughout the paper, theoretical analysis is conducted, and the proposed AdaBoost–BPNN model is validated and verified using experimental results. The results demonstrate that the AdaBoost–BPNN model outperforms traditional methods in accurately estimating SOC under various conditions, including constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, dynamical stress testing (DST), US06, a federal urban driving schedule (FUDS), and pulse discharge conditions.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, cost reduction effort (CRE) and fairness concern have become even more significant on the logistics operation for e‐commerce supply chain because of changing market conditions and consumer demands. Considering CRE and fairness concern, we propose a Stackelberg game model where the manufacturer acts as a leader to analyze how a manufacturer or a retailer strategically decides between two logistics service strategies, i.e., the manufacturer‐provided logistics service and the retailer‐provided logistics service. When the retailer provides logistics service in the absence of fairness concern, a “win‐win” outcome can be achieved. However, profit does not always increase in proportion to the logistics service cost factor when fairness concern is considered. Additionally, there is a situation where the optimal logistics service strategy for the manufacturer and the retailer is contrary to each other in different ranges of fairness concern intensity when the logistics service provider both has CRE and fairness concern. As a consequence, it becomes important for both the manufacturer and the retailer to balance their fairness concern and consider the effectiveness of CRE when making decisions about adopting logistics service strategy.</jats:p>",

Technological advancements are leading to a more intelligent and digitally enabled cold chain logistics system. However, the high loss rate of fresh agricultural products in China poses a significant threat to the country’s food security. Therefore, it is imperative to explore innovative solutions, such as blockchain, to address the challenges of traditional cold chain logistics. In this paper, inspired by the prospect theory and evolutionary game theory, we propose an evolutionary game model to analyze the behavioral strategies of the tripartite of n-level cold chain participants, consumers, and government. Using MATLAB software, the numerical simulation of the game path of this tripartite theory is conducted, and the influence of variable parameters on the evolutionary process and outcomes of the system is analyzed. The results the following: (1) The development of an effective cold chain supply chain system can be divided into three stages, and blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in creating a seamless cold chain environment. The cost of blockchain adoption, government rewards, as well as penalties can significantly influence the behavioral choices of the three stakeholders. (2) The behavior of individual cold chain participants has a strong negative externality, which can impact the behavior of others. We also find that the larger the scale of the cold chain, the lower the probability of default by the participants. (3) The government’s adoption of blockchain technology and the implementation of effective incentive policies can foster the successful development of the cold chain blockchain infrastructure. Our research contributes to the theoretical understanding of cold chain logistics decision making and policy creation for the tripartite stakeholders, including cold chain participants, consumers, and government. Our findings can serve as a valuable reference for scientific decision making and policy formulation to encourage the development of a robust cold chain supply chain system.</jats:p>"

Current literature emphasizes a nuanced integration of supply and demand factors to better understand this gap. In this research, we examine the interconnectedness of supply and demand factors both conceptually and methodologically by augmenting existing measures of local supply with a demand-side factor—community-level preferences for contraceptive methods. Using novel data from Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) in seven sub-Saharan African countries, we test whether the available supply of locally preferred methods at nearby service delivery points (SDP) explains variation in women’s uptake of contraception beyond the more typical measure of contraceptive stockouts. Findings from logistic regression analyses (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 32,282) suggest that demand and supply can be understood as tightly interconnected factors which are directly affected by local social preferences. The odds of women using modern contraception increase significantly when locally preferred methods are available, and this is true even after controlling for the availability of methods in general. The new measure tested in this research centers women and their specific desires in a manner consistent with the promotion of contraceptives as an important human right.</jats:p>"

With the advancement of intelligent technologies, unmanned robots collaborating with the Internet of Things (IoT) play increasingly crucial roles in the realm of smart agriculture; they have become effective means to ensure agricultural safety and supply security. However, in the pursuit of unmanned agronomic applications, there is an urgent challenge: these intelligent systems generally show low accuracy in target detection when relying on visual perception due to fine-grained changes and differing postures of crops. To solve this issue, we proposed a novel multi-target detection approach via incorporating graph representation learning and multi-crossed attention techniques. The proposed model first utilizes a lightweight backbone network to accurately identify the characteristics and conditions of crops. Then, the higher-order graphic feature extractor is designed to comprehensively observe fine-grained features and potential graphic relationships among massive crops, enabling better perception capabilities of agricultural robots, allowing them to adapt to complex environments. Additionally, we can address bilevel routing by combining ghost attention and rotation annotations to handle continuous posture changes during crop growth and mutual occlusion. An extensive set of experiments demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms various advanced methods of crop detection, achieving identification accuracies up to 89.6% (mAP) and 94.7% (AP50). Ablation studies further proved the preferable stability, of which the parameter size is only 628 Mbyte, while maintaining a high processing speed of 89 frames per second. This provides strong support for application of the technique in smart agriculture production and supply cyber security.</jats:p>"

Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) is a promising Internet of Things (IoT) business model pattern for data exchange. The current centralized IoT S2aaS models are not suitable for IoT big data exchange due to the issues on privacy disclosure, single point of failure, data security, performance, etc. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized framework for IoT S2aaS for smart supply chain, which can ensure the IoT solution owners have full control of their data and securely exchange data with data consumers without intermediaries. We introduce the system model and the layered architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme, smart contract is used to perform the whole process of IoT S2aaS. We implement a software prototype on Ethereum. Experiment results show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed solution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three decades ago, supply chain uncertainty was recognized as a significant conceptual problem that must be resolved to successfully satisfy supply and demand activities. For this reason, firms have developed several workable approaches and techniques (including lean, agility, and resilient framework) in response to the need to maintain such activities in the face of uncertainty. Despite this, the current pandemic’s onset has hampered supply chain management, indicating that current solutions fall short of being sufficient to shield firms from being impacted. Therefore, it raises the question of what we have learned from decades of research and studies to prepare us for such adversities. And what plans must the firms have put in place to address this disaster? To focus on this, the current study intends to explore supply chain uncertainty trends and patterns, to emphasize the future orientation. Using the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020) protocol, 884 peer-reviewed journal articles were selected from the Web of Science database and analyzed using bibliometric analysis through MS Excel and VOSviewer software (version 1.6.18). There are two ways the results are presented. First, performance analysis revealed that 2335 writers had written 884 publications (1993–2022), which had an average 32.2 citation level across 176 journals. Second, the science mapping analysis included well-known methods, such as citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-word analysis, and co-authorship analysis. The original contribution of this study lies in the identification of four clusters through the analysis, namely, overall impact of uncertainty, demand uncertainty, challenges uncertainty, and uncertain strategy. This led to recommendations for future research that practitioners could use.</jats:p>"

In light of this, a novel framework is proposed in this study to evaluate sustainability, including three key indicators: resilience, reliability, and vulnerability. To address stressors that may lead to system failure, a multisectoral water allocation optimization is undertaken. In order to account for the future implications of climate change on the hydrological cycle, a simulation step, is incorporated, utilizing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) under various emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), prior to integrating the streamflow data into our proposed optimal framework. To calibrate and validate historical data (2014–2019) and simulate future streamflow patterns (2025–2085), the Sistan Basin, located in an arid region of Iran, is analyzed as a case study. In light of the anticipated adverse impacts on the water supply system, certain adaptation measures, such as demand shrinkage scenarios, are considered to further appraise the proposed framework. Based on the final output, it is evident that the agricultural and industrial sectors, being the primary water consumers, are more susceptible to negative impacts resulting from the reduction in system sustainability. This susceptibility is primarily attributed to their highest vulnerability and comparatively lower reliability.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the socially efficient entry does not increase the supplier’s profits significantly, which allows the downstream incumbent to deter socially efficient entry through an exclusive supply contract. This result holds even in the simplest framework, which is composed of a single seller, buyer, and entrant.</jats:p>",

In this context, seawater desalination is an adaptive strategy that has provided increasing water allotments to agriculture for the last decade, to replace decreasing conventional resources. Farmers are concerned about the agronomic effects of this substitution and its economic consequences. This study focuses on the potential agronomic impacts of the progressive replacement of the irrigation water from the Tagus–Segura transfer (TST) with desalinated seawater (DSW) on the main crops of south-eastern Spain. To that end, five main agronomic concerns were selected and analyzed under three water supply scenarios using increasing rates of DSW (0, 50, and 100%). The results indicated that, in addition to other economic or environmental considerations, sufficiently relevant agronomic aspects exist that need to be considered when replacing the TST supply with DSW. This study evidences the risks of phytotoxicity and soil alkalinization, due to the increase in boron concentration and the imbalance between monovalent and divalent cations in the DSW, respectively, and also a slight increase in the cost of fertilizers. In addition, the irrigation water salinity effect on production and total irrigation requirements was negligible, as both water sources present sufficiently low salinity. The detrimental effects were mitigated under a partial replacement scenario, so the blended use of DSW with conventional resources seems the most recommendable option for its agricultural management, rather than irrigating with DSW alone.</jats:p>"

Studies are scarce on reservoirs (hiding places) and routes of entry of S. aureus into the food supply chain in Ethiopia. To fill these gaps, we evaluated the role of cows (milk), meat, equipment, and food handlers on the abundance and AMR of S. aureus in five geographical areas in central Oromia, Ethiopia. We isolated S. aureus from 10 different ecologies per area in 5 areas and tested their sensitivity to 14 antimicrobials of 9 different classes. We ranked the 5 areas and 10 ecologies by computing their multiple AMR index (MARI) at a cut-off value of 0.2 to determine ‘high-risk’ ecologies for AMR. We recorded as MDR if an isolate had resistance to ≥3 antimicrobial classes. We used a circos diagram to analyze if isolates with identical AMR patterns were shared between different ecologies. S. aureus is prevalent in central Oromia (16.1–18.3%), higher in dairy farms than in abattoirs, and varied among 10 ecologies (p &lt; 0.001) but not among 5 areas (p &gt; 0.05). Of the 92 isolates, 94.6% were penicillin-resistant. Their AMR prevalence was above 40% for 9 of 14 antimicrobials. All isolates (100%) had AMR in at least one antimicrobial class (range = 1–9; median = 5), indicating MDR was prevalent. The prevalence of MDR S. aureus varied (p &lt; 0.05) among areas and 10 ecologies; the highest was in slaughter lines. All isolates had a MARI of &gt;0.2, indicating drug overuse, and S. aureus’s AMR burden is high in central Oromia. Dairy farms had higher MARI values (0.44) than abattoirs (0.39). Of 10 ecologies, the highest and lowest MARI values were in the beef supply chain, i.e., slaughter line (0.67) and butcher’s hand (0.25). Of the 68 different AMR patterns by 92 isolates against 14 antimicrobials, 53 patterns (77.9%) were unique to individual isolates, indicating they were phenotypically dissimilar. MDR S. aureus was widespread in central Oromia in dairy and meat supply chains, contaminating milk, meat, equipment, and workers in farm and abattoir settings. In the absence of strict regulations and interventions, MDR S. aureus can be disseminated from these epicenters to the public.</jats:p>"

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) is used for predicting integrated inflows into the Hatnur reservoir from the Burhanpur and Purna watersheds of the Upper Tapi River basin, while outflows are simulated using a rule curve. The influence of watershed complexities on hydrological model parameters and the watershed processes are investigated using extensive multisite and multivariable calibration (1998–2007) and validation (2008–2013) approaches, including sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The sensitive parameters are related to curve number (CN), groundwater, slope, and main channel characteristics. The annual streamflow (m3/km2/mm of rainfall) in the Burhanpur watershed is 568.7, which is 4.2 times higher than the Purna watershed's streamflow of 136.2. The hypsometric analysis, areal rainfall, and flow duration curves revealed a substantially different streamflow pattern and a larger coefficient of variation in the spatial distribution of water balance components over sub-watersheds in the Burhanpur watershed compared to the Purna watershed due to diverse topographic features. The developed model would be useful for planning controlled releases from the terminal reservoir to mitigate hazards in the downstream reaches of the Tapi River basin.</jats:p>",

It examines factors such as the number and layout of air supply and exhaust outlets, analyzing their impact on smoke spread, tunnel temperature, visibility, and airflow. The results demonstrate that the full transverse exhaust method effectively controls smoke emissions in raised highway tunnels. It limits smoke spread, reduces tunnel temperature, and effectively controls the fire‐affected area. The number and layout of outlets significantly influence smoke dispersion, with fewer exhaust outlets providing better smoke control and optimizing the tunnel environment. However, insufficient outlets disrupt gas flow stability. The position of exhaust outlets affects smoke distribution, and caution is advised to prevent directing fresh air flow toward the fire. Opening an equal number of exhaust outlets on one side of the fire source yields superior smoke extraction results, reducing tunnel ceiling temperatures and minimizing risks to personnel and structures. Though stabilization may take longer, this configuration proves advantageous. The study offers valuable insights and practical guidelines for implementing the full transverse smoke control method in real‐world scenarios.</jats:p>",

The scientific and rational allocation of water resources has become a key factor in ensuring sustainable development. The Henan Yellow River water supply zone occupies a crucial position in the socioeconomic development of Henan Province. Currently, there is a shortage of water resources with relatively low utilization rates. To alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand, a study on the optimization of water resources (with p = 90%) for the years 2025 and 2030 was conducted. In this study, we constructed a multi-objective optimization model with the objectives of maximizing economic benefits, minimizing total water shortage, and maximizing water use efficiency. The second-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was utilized to solve this model. The results indicate that by 2025, the optimized allocation of water resources will correspond to 17.663 billion m3, reducing the average water shortage rate in the research area to 9.69%. By 2030, the optimized allocation of water resources will further increase to 18.363 billion m3, bringing down the average water shortage rate to 8.34%. Concurrently, the supply structure of the research area will significantly improve after optimization. This is manifested through an increase in the proportion of surface water supply and a substantial rise in the proportion of supply from other water sources, while the proportion of groundwater supply noticeably decreases. These research findings can serve as a reference for the rational utilization and distribution of water resources in the future and can also offer insights for optimizing water resource allocation in other regions.</jats:p>"

However, the complex nature of the topic has resulted in a dearth of research on its key elements and formation mechanisms. To bridge this knowledge gap, we implemented grounded theory and conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 interviewees, which led to the identification of six key elements of supply chain resilience through open coding, axial coding, selective coding, and theoretical model saturation testing. These elements are product supply resilience, resource resilience, partner resilience, information response resilience, capital resilience, and knowledge resilience. Drawing from the key elements and the three phases of supply chain resilience (readiness, response, and recovery), we illustrated its formation mechanism and constructed a theoretical model of the influencing factors and pathways of supply chain resilience. We devised a questionnaire based on the coding results and confirmed its reasonableness and validity with a small sample of 109 questionnaires. Subsequently, a large sample of 409 questionnaires was used to test and validate the theoretical model using structural equation modeling, demonstrating that the identified key elements positively impact supply chain resilience. In sum, our paper enriches the comprehension of supply chain resilience by identifying its key elements and elaborating on its formation mechanism.</jats:p>"

In this study, 80 sets of groundwater samples were collected from three aquifers of the Liuzhuang coal mine (northern Anhui Province, China), and a total of eight indicators were selected for quantitative analysis of the chemical components of water. Conventional mathematical and statistical methods and Piper trilinear diagrams show that the cations in the groundwater samples of the mine area are mainly K+ + Na+ (92.4%), while the anions in the Cenozoic and Carboniferous aquifers are mainly Cl−, reaching 57.2% and 55.2%, respectively, and the anions in the Permian aquifer are mainly HCO3- (52.6%). Most of the water chemistry types are Cl-Na, HCO3-Na, and HCO3-Cl-Na. Analysis on the basis of Gibbs plots showed that the aquifer system in the mine area is primarily controlled by the water–rock interaction. The results of ion ratio analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis showed that the dissolution of hydrochloric acid and alternating cation adsorption is more prominent in the Cenozoic and Carboniferous aquifers, while desulfurization is more significant in the Permian aquifer.</jats:p>",

From a theoretical perspective, HGSF implemented as a type of SFSC could help deliver synergies. A pivotal question is how HGSF can be combined with SFSC and the benefits and drawbacks of such combination. Using an HGSF program which was implemented as an integral part of a free preschool lunch pilot in South Central China, this paper shows that HGSF and SFSC (in its full term) could be combined through one structured demand intervention. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative materials. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions with government and preschool staff, parents or caregivers, cooks, World Food Programme representatives and other stakeholders involved in the pilot program. The quantitative part used both small panel data and cross-sectional data from 106 smallholders. This study analyzes the design, implementation, good practices, benefits and constraints of the HGSF-SFSC model. We find that direct purchase from smallholder farmers was linked with higher income and production and dietary diversity. Moreover, this study identifies several constraints of the current HGSF-SFSC model. The policy implications for sustaining and scaling up the current pilot are discussed in the paper.</jats:p>",

The reduction in substrate supply to the developing fetus that causes FGR not only alters cardiac growth and structure but may have deleterious effects on metabolism and function. Using a sheep model of placental restriction to induce FGR, we investigated key cardiac metabolic and functional markers that may be altered in FGR. We also employed phase‐contrast magnetic resonance imaging MRI to assess left ventricular cardiac output (LVCO) as a measure of cardiac function. We hypothesized that signalling molecules involved in cardiac fatty acid utilisation and contractility would be impaired by FGR and that this would have a negative impact on LVCO in the late gestation fetus. Key glucose (GLUT4 protein) and fatty acid (<jats:italic>FATP</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>CD36</jats:italic> gene expression) substrate transporters were significantly reduced in the hearts of FGR fetuses. We also found reduced mitochondrial numbers as well as abundance of electron transport chain complexes (complexes II and IV).

Although the Sanhekou Reservoir is still under construction, the periodic wetting-drying events may result in the release of inorganic phosphorus from the soil into the water once it is completed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the background soil values and estimate the phosphorus release fluxes of the Puhe River, Wenshuihe River, and Jiaoxihe River of the reservoir. We would like to provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent management and ecological protection of the reservoir based on this study. The Chang–Jackson chemical continuous extraction method was used to determine the forms of inorganic phosphorus in the soil, and fluorescence data were obtained by excitation–emission matrix combined with parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC). The results showed that there were four types of phosphorus in the soil of the reservoir, including calcium-bound phosphate, aluminium-bound phosphate, iron-bound phosphate, and occluded phosphate. The total quantities of these phosphorus types were measured to be 6.71 × 104, 1.14 × 104, 0.91 × 104, and 0.49 × 104t, respectively. Additionally, it was observed that there was 2.12 × 104 t of bioavailable phosphorus present in the soil.</jats:p>",

Finally, the efficacy difference of bactericidal properties against Escherichia coli suspensions between EGCG and its complex was evaluated as the criteria. Furthermore, comparative studies were performed to gauge the antimicrobial activity of EGCG and its complex at equivalent concentrations. The results demonstrated that the optimal experimental conditions for the complex reaction were a pH of 7, at 40 °C, in a reaction time of 60 min and a reactant ratio of 1:2. By the molar ratio method, the reactant ratio was determined as n(EGCG):n(Cu2+) = 1:2, and the complex reaction was at the phenolic hydroxyl group on the benzene ring of EGCG. Compared to EGCG, the complex demonstrated significant enhancement in bactericidal properties against E. coli and has lower chromaticity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Astragalus membranaceus is a traditional Chinese medicine derived from the roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge., which has the same medicinal and edible uses in China. It is also widely used in daily food, and its pharmacological effects mainly include antioxidant effects, vascular softening effects, etc. Currently, it is increasingly widely used in the prevention of hypertension, cerebral ischemia, and stroke in China. Formononetin and its glucopyranoside (ononin) are both important components of Astragalus membranaceuss and may play important roles in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study conducted metabolic studies using formononectin and its glucopyranoside (ononin), including a combination of the in vitro metabolism of Formonetin using rat liver S9 and the in vivo metabolism of ononin administered orally to rats. Five metabolites (Sm2, 7, 9, 10, and 12) were obtained from the solution incubated with formononetin and rat hepatic S9 fraction using chromatographic methods. The structures of the five metabolites were elucidated as (Sm2)6,7,4′-trihydroxy-isoflavonoid; (Sm7)7,4′-dihydroxy-isoflavonoid; (Sm9)7,8,4′-trihydroxy-isoflavonoid; (Sm10)7,8,-dihydroxy-4′-methoxy-isoflavonoid; and (Sm12)6,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxy- isoflavonoid on the basis of UV, NMR, and MS data. Totally, 14 metabolites were identified via HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn analysis, from which the formononetin was incubated with rat hepatic S9 fraction, and the main metabolic pathways were hydroxylation, demethylation, and glycosylation. Then, 21 metabolites were identified via HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn analysis from the urine samples from SD rats to which ononin was orally administered, and the main metabolic pathways were glucuronidation, hydroxylation, demethylation, and sulfonation. The main difference between the in vitro metabolism of formononetin and the in vivo metabolism of ononin is that ononin undergoes deglycemic transformation into Formonetin in the rat intestine, while Formonetin is absorbed into the bloodstream for metabolism, and the metabolic products also produce combined metabolites during in vivo metabolism. The six metabolites obtained from the aforementioned separation indicate the primary forms of formononetin metabolism, and due to their higher contents of similar isoflavone metabolites, they are considered the main active compounds that are responsible for pharmacological effects. To investigate the metabolites of the active ingredients of formononetin in the rat liver S9 system, network pharmacology was used to evaluate the cardiovascular disease (CVD) activities of the six primary metabolites that were structurally identified. Additionally, the macromolecular docking results of six main components and two core targets (HSP90AA1 and SRC) related to CVD showed that formononetin and its main metabolites, Sm10 and Sm12, may have roles in CVD treatment due to their strong binding activities with the HSP90AA1 receptor, while the Sm7 metabolite may have a role in CVD treatment due to its strong binding activity with the SRC receptor.</jats:p>"

Additionally, pandemics and crises caused SC disruptions for enterprises. Thus, an enterprise’s SC must constantly be ready to face various obstacles and unpredictable environmental changes. In an era of growing technological advancement, enterprises and their strategies are transforming toward sustainable and resilient SC.  For this reason, this study embraces the notion of utilizing technologies such as Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) as branches of intelligence techniques of Industry 4.0 (Ind 4.0) and, thereafter, Industry 5.0 (Ind 5.0). Thus, the study contributes to constructing an appraiser model for appraising the enterprises that employ these technologies and techniques in their SC to be sustainable resilience in another meaning resilience supply chain (ReSSC). This model utilized best worst method (BWM) under the governing of Single-valued triangular neutrosophic sets (SVTNSs) to generate an appraiser model. Whereas SVNSs applied in the comparative analysis as a comparative model with the cooperation of AHP, TOPSIS, and WSM to validate our constructed model. The findings of the appraiser model based on MCDM merging with SVTNSs and the comparative model based on MCDM integrated with SVNSs agreed that the optimal key indicator six is securing of data (KI6); otherwise, Key Indicator three is transparency (KI3). Also, these models agreed to recommend enterprises from optimal to worst as En1&gt; En4&gt; En2&gt; En3. From the results of the two models, En1 is the most sustainable and resilient.

Our findings are summarized as follows. First, the negative effect of the disruption of intermediate imports grows exponentially as its duration and strength increase due to downstream propagation. Second, the propagation of the economic effect is substantially affected by the network topology of importers, such as the number of importers (affected nodes) and their degree of upstreamness in supply chains, whereas the effect of their degree centrality is heterogeneous depending on their degree of upstreamness. Finally, the negative effect of import disruption can be mitigated by the reorganization of domestic supply chains, even when conducted only among network neighbors. Our findings provide important policy and managerial implications for the achievement of more robust and resilient global supply chains.</jats:p>"

The heterogeneity of the karst aquifer medium makes it vulnerable to external influences. Here, samples of surface water and groundwater in a typical karst groundwater system of Jinan (China) were collected in December 2021, and the sample data were analyzed to further elucidate the hydrogeochemical processes. Results showed that the predominant water chemical type is HCO3-Ca, with a lesser proportion of type HCO3·SO4-Ca and SO4-Ca. The dominant water–rock interactions comprise the dissolution of carbonate minerals, gypsum, and halite and ion exchange. Dissolution/precipitation of calcite, dolomite, and gypsum determines the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, and SO42-. In terms of spatial distribution, the indirect and direct recharge areas are dominated by calcite dissolution, followed by dolomite dissolution, and are prone to ion exchange. The hydrogeochemical formation mechanism of the discharge area is more complicated by other hydrochemical processes and anthropogenic activities. These results provide guidance for global karst groundwater resource management and pollution prevention.</jats:p>",

The effect of pulsation on stability is described on the basis of the pulsation factor, which takes into account the component that precedes the switching moment. The paper suggests also taking into account the component that follows the moment of switching.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The establishment of a civil-military integration supply chain system is the cornerstone of China’s strategic development in military-civilian integration. It is essential to explore cooperative innovation and development between upstream civilian enterprises and downstream military enterprises within the supply chain to optimise resource allocation and promote the sustainable use of civil-military resources. This exploration is a prerequisite for accelerating the formation of the civil-military integration supply chain system and holds significant importance for realising the internal synergy between the civilian industry and the military industry. However, utilizing the evolutionary game model as a foundation, this study delves into the impact of absorption capacity, transformation and integration capability, network synergy, and change and innovation capacity on the vertical cooperation and innovation behaviour within the supply chain of civil-military integration enterprises. Firstly, civilian enterprises are more cost-sensitive concerning collaborative innovation investments compared to military enterprises. Excessive costs can discourage collaboration between civilian and military entities. Secondly, strong exploratory and absorptive capabilities, along with network synergies, can enhance the benefits of cooperation and innovation among these enterprises, but they also introduce the risk of opportunistic “free-rider” behaviour. Thirdly, the dynamics of the technology and product chains are influenced by an excess supply for civilian enterprises, while the opposite is true for military enterprises. Finally, a strong capacity for transformation and integration fosters cooperative and innovative behaviours among enterprises, with civilian enterprises exhibiting greater responsiveness. This study brings new research perspectives to the forefront, exploring vertical cooperation and innovative development within supply chain enterprises, particularly through the lens of supply and demand dynamics. Additionally, it offers practical recommendations aimed at helping the government expedite the establishment of integrated military-civilian supply chains and foster the synergistic development of the two key sectors: the military and civilian economies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system, which led to the blackout of entire cities and the termination of district heating, highlighted the risks and disadvantages of relying on large-scale district energy supply for communities. In this context, it is important to consider the development of the energy supply of communities in the direction of their energy independence. The purpose of the article is to form a list of electricity generation and heat supply technologies for increasing the energy independence of individual territorial communities, which are appropriate for implementation in Ukraine. The article considers the criteria for the analysis and selection of technologies for distributed power generation and heat supply. An analytical overview of the following power generation and heat supply technologies is presented: solar and wind power plants, gas piston and gas turbine plants, generators, batteries, co- and trigeneration plants, biofuel power plants and heat-generating boilers, heat pumps and electric boilers, and their grouping is performed according to the established criteria. All the considered technologies contribute to reducing the external supply of communities with energy resources and reducing losses during the transmission and distribution of electricity. Technologies that use renewable energy sources and local fuels are appropriate for implementation in communities in accordance with the availability of sufficient amounts of resources. Still, in most cases, they are not able to fully provide communities with electrical and thermal energy due to their insufficient quantity and high cost of equipment, such as batteries and heat pumps. Decisions regarding the implementation of a specific technology of distributed generation should be made after a thorough analysis of the conditions and possibilities of the energy supply of each individual community. This article is aimed at discussing the options of increasing energy independence and ensuring the reliability of the energy supply of territorial communities in Ukraine. Keywords: distributed generation, power generation, heat supply, renewable energy sources, cogeneration, biofuels, heat pumps.</jats:p>"
