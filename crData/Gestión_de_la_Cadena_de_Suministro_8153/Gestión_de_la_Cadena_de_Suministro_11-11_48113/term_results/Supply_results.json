      "abstract": "<jats:p>For any business to compete successfully in the modern, globalised business environment, it needs to mobilise its suppliers and customers to co-operate in order to reduce unnecessary costs and inefficiencies between them and to ensure the best value for the final customer. The focus is on management of the supply chain as a whole (or a system) and maximum value for the final customer of the supply chain, instead of on management for the maximum benefit of one of the parties in the supply chain. If the supply chain is seen as a system of organisations with one aim (value for the final customer), it is logical that a problem in one part of the supply chain must affect the workings and efficiency of the system or supply chain as a whole.This article reports on an exploratory empirical study to illustrate the effect of problems at one party in the supply chain on the whole supply chain. The study was done at automotive component manufacturers. To determine how problems at one place permeate through the whole supply chain, correlation testing was done between supply-side, internal operations, and distribution or customer-side problems. The study found that problems experienced at one place in the supply chain had a negative impact throughout the supply chain. Automotive supply chains should therefore be managed more as a system, taking into consideration the effect of decision making and actions at one part of the supply chain on other parts of the supply chain. There should be a supply chain wide co-operative effort to find solutions to inefficiencies at all places in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Now more than ever, businesses need to improve the efficiency of their supply chains in order to maintain a competitive advantage. The principles of lean manufacturing and just-intime (JIT) inventory control that were renowned for helping companies like Toyota, Dell and Walmart to rise to the top of their respective industries are no longer adequate. Leading companies are applying new technologies and sophisticated analytics to make their supply chains more responsive to customer demand. This challenge is driven by fierce competition, fluctuating market demand and rising customer requirements that have led to customers becoming more demanding with increased preferences. The article is based on theoretical reviews and suggests guidelines for the implementation of an automotive supply chain model for a demand-driven environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is estimated that about two-thirds of global coal is used for power generation and that, in the next 20 years, over 70% of the demand for coal will come from China and India. Coal accounts for approximately 41% of the world's electricity generation. Demand for thermal coal is influenced by factors that include availability, prices of competing products such as oil, gas and nuclear power, and the demand for electricity. The aim of this article is to provide an exposition of supply chain dynamics within the South African coal mining industry and to argue for a more efficient and collaborative supply chain. The authors attempt to investigate at local and global level, the current trends pertaining to the level of reserves, production and consumption of coal. The article further demonstrates the shortcomings of current logistics in meeting the demand for coal in both domestic and export markets. The article draws from secondary data sourced from academic papers, government and agency documents in the exposition of the coal mining supply chain. The paper concludes by recommending the need for a scientific study on supply chain constraints facing the coal mining industry in South Africa.</jats:p>"

A competitive advantage can be achieved by means of low cost or by means of differentiation. However, organisations have to implement the correct supply chain strategy. Returns on investment can be compromised if organisations implement an incorrect supply chain strategy. The objective of the article is to analyse the differences between theoretically implied and implemented supply chain strategies within selected organisations. The differences between supply chain strategies implied by literature and those implemented by selected organisations are analysed by determining how the organisations are managing their supply chain drivers. Organisations with lean supply chains should manage their supply chain drivers to achieve efficiency, while organisations with agile supply chains should manage their supply chain drivers with responsiveness towards customers' needs in mind. Non-probability sampling was used to include 13 organisations in the research. Six organisations are implementing different supply chain strategies to what literature principles are suggesting to them based on specific supply chain characteristics. An analysis is done on how these six organisations are managing their supply chain drivers.</jats:p>"

The storage facility within the FSL should contribute to the prevention of evidence contamination or degradation thereby also leading to improved service quality and output to its customers. The proper delivery of evidence can lead to the conviction of suspects and to the freedom of the innocent.

Therefore, the system ought to consider how to appropriately send finished jobs in batches to reduce transportation costs while considering the processing sequence of jobs to reduce production cost. This paper studies such a supply chain scheduling problem that one manufacturer produces with a single machine and deliveries jobs within limited transportation times to one customer. The objective function is to minimize the total sum of production cost and transportation cost. The NP hard property of the problem is proved in the simpler way, and the pseudo-dynamic programming algorithm in the literature is modified as the MDP algorithm to get the optimal solution which is associated with the total processing times of jobs.</jats:p>"

Logistics presents an area in which these organisations can improve customer service and reduce costs, and strategies in support thereof such as the outsourcing of logistics activities, should be considered. However, it is critical that logistics outsourcing is done diligently to avoid potential problems for the organisation and to achieve the best possible benefits. In South Africa little research has been done regarding current outsourcing practices of local manufacturers. In this article literature on international logistics outsourcing as well as research on some of the logistics outsourcing practices of South African manufacturers is discussed. The findings of a questionnaire survey of South African manufacturers provided information on their logistics outsourcing practices and problems. Prominent issues seem to include inadequate managerial involvement in the logistics outsourcing process, as well as insufficient time spent on many of the important aspects of the outsourcing agreement, the transitioning of resources and ongoing management of the outsourced relationship. It is concluded that a thorough outsourcing process should be followed in order to achieve the benefits of logistics outsourcing.</jats:p>"

A case study is presented where third-year students were engaged in a real-life project in collaboration with industry, exposing them to collaborative learning, questionnaire design, surveys, analysing and evaluating results, literature review and report writing. The project was carried out in phases where students were assessed after each phase. The paper analyses the assessment of students and their perception of the value of the project. It is concluded that an integrated teaching and learning approach will increase students’ interest in the subject, understanding of theoretical concepts, research skills, business skills and life skills.</jats:p>"

Corresponding coefficients are estimated and can be applied to other studies and sophisticated timber market models. Results show that timber supply in China increases at a slightly higher rate than timber demand, but timber consumption is projected to triple between 2008 and 2020, which will result in significant growth of timber imports (also nearly tripling by 2020).</jats:p>",

This paper makes a contribution by examining the level of service quality, specifically from a tangibles, reliability and responsiveness perspective, thereby identifying service quality gaps which need to be closed, with a view to raising service quality levels in the industry. The SERVQUAL instrument has been used to measure service quality levels administered to 500 of the industry’s active customers, i.e. organisations utilising the services of the freight transportation industry. The targeted respondents were managers responsible for logistics in their organisations. It was found that gaps existed between expectations and perceptions of service quality on 14 of the 15 measured items. Recommendations are made as to how the industry can improve its service quality levels.</jats:p>"

This study uses multiple regression analysis subjecting variables to backward stepwise regression with a view to assessing the impact traffic law enforcement has had on fatalities in Botswana after the review of the Traffic Act of Botswana in 2008. The study uses secondary data and interview data obtained from law enforcers. The findings reveal that the enforcement of the new road laws has achieved little in the reduction of fatalities. Increasing the minimum driver licensing age may be a panacea to road accidents. Licensed drivers in the age group 30 to 45 years have the lowest rate of fatalities. The study questions the ability of punitive policies (i.e. road fines) to reduce fatalities. It offers that driver behaviour should be studied to come up with relevant policies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A supply chain is a system, consisting of material suppliers, production facilities, distribution services and customers. These are all linked together through the downstream feed forward flow of materials and the upstream feedback flow of information. Several organizations have adopted the concept of â€œLeanâ€ to improve the performance and position in the market place and. The â€œAgileâ€ manufacturing has been recently emerged as a customer demand driven option. It defines as using market knowledge and virtual corporation to exploit profitable opportunities in a volatile marketplace, leanness stands for developing a value stream to eliminate all waste, including time and to ensure a level schedule. Leagile is one suitable way to exploit the both approaches, lean and agile. It requires the selection and setting up of a material flow decoupling point. The positioning of the decoupling point, therefore, depends upon the longest lead-time and at the same time customer is prepared to tolerate this time lag and the point at which variability in product demand dominates. Downstream from the decoupling point all products are pulled by the customer demand, that is why that part of supply chain is market driven. Upstream from the decoupling point the supply chain is essentially forecast driven. This review paper will explore the approaches of lean, agile and leagile decoupling point to suggest the most suitable supply chain practices, processes and procedures. Several factors are needed for lean and agile practicesâ€™ success; not only is it necessary to implement most of the technical tools but an organizationâ€™s culture needs transforming too.</jats:p>"

Surprisingly, very little is known about the innovation system in the logging industry—especially about how it relates to biomass supply. Failure to understand how logging contractors adopt and implement biomass production technologies could lead to failed innovation efforts, unmet development goals, and a lack of properly equipped contractors. This article presents results from a series of case studies of highly innovative logging contractors in Maine. All of the firms had some experience producing biomass within their operations. The firms had also used multiple biomass harvesting technologies. This study highlights the variation in challenges that led to the adoption (or rejection) of biomass as a product innovation—with particular emphasis on harvesting technologies. A major finding of this study was the need for a high degree of collaboration between landowners, logging contractors, and biomass consuming facilities in the innovation process. The future development of the biomass industry is highly dependent on contractors adopting biomass harvesting and related technologies. The innovation process of logging firms is an area that is not sufficiently studied, and this research provides valuable insight into this important component of the forest biomass industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the importance of transport to the social and economic development of a country, very little, if any, work appears to have been done in South Africa to assess the impact of transport policy in achieving its aims and objectives. Two policy areas that have wide social and economic impacts are the public transport industry and the development of the national roads network. Public transport, or more specifically commuter bus transport policy, is aimed at improving the mobility and affordability of the travelling public while at the same time increasing the transparency of the subsidy system through a tender and negotiated contract regimen. The policy on national roads directly impacts the general economy as an estimated 88% of all freight tonnage (excluding the dedicated iron ore and coal lines of Transnet Freight Rail) is moved over the road network of South Africa with the national roads linking the main economic centres of the country. This research assesses the impact of these two areas of policy making by comparing policies for commuter bus transport and primary (national) roads for two policy periods, namely, 1986 to 1994 and 1994 to 2004. The research methodology used is that of the mixed-methods research procedure explained more fully in the article and the annexure to the paper. The research arrives at conclusions in respect of the impact of the policy on the problems and issues in the two separate sectors of transport during the policy periods analysed. It also draws conclusions on the policy-making process used as well as identifying deficiencies in the process. Finally it makes recommendations to address these inadequacies.</jats:p>"

Much of this increased food production will be from emerging developing countries. Sustainable intensive food production systems employing new genetic and precision technologies will be essential for this purpose. Food prices are likely to remain at a higher level and be more volatile than in the past and this will impact most on vulnerable poor people in the developing world. This is a major concern and should be a priority for action both nationally and internationally. So, while it is feasible to deliver the forecast of 70% increase in food supplies required by 2050, this will only be sustainable if the significant challenges of resource limitation and climate change are met, and the environmental and social impacts minimised.</jats:p>",

Different social environments and systems of municipal government meant that tap water was accepted by urban society in different ways. In the settlements, the supply of tap water was the foundation for the formation of a modern community. In the Old City, the introduction of tap water for the most part had a different effect: it manifested the ways in which traditional and new lifestyles conflicted and mingled with each other. Yet, in any case, as tap water entered the lives of the people from the end of the Qing to the Republican period, new ideas of health and hygiene associated with tap water were gradually accepted, and modern urban lifestyles gradually took shape.</jats:p>",

Automatic identification systems (AIS) are a priority to decision makers as they attempt to obtain the best blend of equipment to ensure greater loss prevention and higher reliability in data capture. However there is a risk of having too simplistic a view of adopting AIS, since no one solution is applicable across an industry or business model. This problem is addressed through an exploratory, descriptive study, where the nature and value of AIS adoption by grocery retailers in the Johannesburg area is interrogated. Mixed empirical results indicate that, as retailers adopt AIS in order to improve their supply chain management systems, different types of applications are associated with various constraints and opportunities. Overall this study is in line with previous research that supports the notion that supply chain decisions are of a strategic nature even though efficient management of information is a day-to-day business operational decision.</jats:p>"

A deformation phenomenon occurring in business activity, called the bullwhip effect which comes from the demand information is not fully shared among the members of a supply chain, conducts the upstream manufacturer to excessively anticipate the demand capacity of the downstream retailer. The manufacturer improperly decides the amount of the products not only to raise the inventory cost on the way of poorly handling the actually downstream demand, but also to lose the chance of business deals due to its backordering. To cope with the bullwhip effect by taking into account the holding and backorder costs, an evolutionary method based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to estimate the critical parameter, mean downstream demand, is proposed and computer validated in this paper such that the estimated inventory level could be close the really batch ordering of the manufacturer.</jats:p>"

Previous studies, utilizing a global sequence framework, are now considered to have underestimated the influence of local autocyclic forcing, manifested through high sedimentation rates, extensional delta-top tectonics and mutli-phase crustal shortening. Integration of shelf margin trajectories, biostratigraphy and structural kinematics has enabled a revised tectono-stratigraphic framework consisting of 10 major 3rd order sequences to be established in the Late Miocene to Present section. Regional compressional pulses are at the origin of some of these sequences, with syntectonic sequences showing onlap terminations on the flanks and/or thinning on the top of inverted structures and significant dislocations in the shelf edge trajectory.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A rigorous reassessment of the biostratigraphic framework has necessitated a revision of the sequence definitions and the synethsis of these observations is detailed. Two sequence boundaries are now calibrated to two major global eustatic falls (11.7 and 5.73 Ma). The 11.7 Ma event, a period of tectonic quiescence, is linked to a ~15 km basinward shift of the shelf edge trajectory without any clear sub-aerial erosion on the emerged shelf. The 5.73 Ma event, also a period of tectonic quiescence, is linked to a more modest basinward shift of the shelf edge, but accompanied by widespread canyon incision along most of the margin, and a major incision of the fluvial system feeding the Champion Delta.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Establishing a chronostratigraphic framework in deltaic sequences deposited on active margins requires a combination of pragmatism and caution.

In addition, the link between freight transport and GDP will decouple as more sustainable approaches to economic development, and therefore freight transport, are necessitated by economic and environmental realities. A commodity-based model, taking into account the underlying drivers of containerisation, is proposed here as a more realistic forecast of container demand.

This paper selects different research papers and articles to present the empirical evidence regarding supply chain integration, its impact on business performance and the challenges associated with it.A sample of 21 research papers was selected in the analysis/findings section and discussion section to discuss the impact of supply chain integration on business performance and the challenges associated with the integration of supply chain among different channel partners. The time period of 1995-2011 was selected and only those journal articles/research papers were selected that were published within this period.Different research papers provided an empirical proof that supply chain integration led to better business performance but few of them discussed challenges associated with it. There was only one paper of Awad &amp; Nassar (2010b) that prominently addressed those challenges. This identified a research gap to be filled and weakened the argument that supply chain leaded to better business performance because how it could be argued when the business challenges associated with supply chain integration were not analyzed and assessed efficiently in the previous research. The author also researched and found papers that held an opposite view regarding supply chain integration. Therefore, more empirical research was proposed and advised to be conducted in this area and it was concluded that further research was crucial to understand the importance of supply chain integration, its impact on business performance and its challenges.As for limitations, it was a secondary research that was one of the main research limitations. Secondly, more research papers and journal articles could be researched or reviewed. Therefore, the findings of this paper cannot be widely generalized.The findings of this research paper could encourage researchers and managers to conduct more research for addressing impact of supply chain integration on business performance and its challenges.</jats:p>"

Subsequently, the influence of independent input parameters on surface finish is investigated in order to optimize their effects. Three techniques—traditional analysis, Pareto ANOVA analysis, and the Taguchi method—are employed. Initially mild steel AISI 1030 has been selected as the work material. The results indicate that the cutting fluid supply strategy has insignificant influence on the surface finish of turned parts. However, the amount of cutting fluid in MQL showed some influence. Further research on two additional materials, aluminum 6061 and alloy steel AISI 4340, reveals that the surface roughness for different work materials is influenced differently by the cutting fluid supply strategies and there is a scope for optimizing the cutting fluid supply strategy in terms of both method and the amount of cutting fluid. This will reduce the amount of cutting fluids used and consequently, their negative impact on the environment, by avoiding unnecessary applications.</jats:p>"

Failure events and the relations between them are the basis for the FEIS database. This database draws upon information on failure events which have occurred in practice at water utilities in Austria and on a literature review and survey of guidelines. The FEIS, which is accessed online, is currently used by six Austrian water utilities for development and test purposes. It provides both graphical visualization of the failure network and analytical indicators to evaluate failure events. In this way, it supports the utilities in identifying corrective actions in order to minimize the probability of failure occurrence and to limit the damage to the system once a failure has occurred.</jats:p>",

High national freight logistics costs, significant road infrastructure challenges and environmental impact concerns of a road-dominated freight transport market have, however, fuelled renewed interest in intermodal transport solutions. In this article, a high-level business case for domestic intermodal solutions in South Africa is presented. The results demonstrate that building three intermodal terminals to connect the three major industrial hubs (i.e. Gauteng, Durban and Cape Town) through an intermodal solution could reduce transport costs (including externalities) for the identified 11.5 million tons of intermodalfriendly freight flows on the Cape and Natal corridors by 42% (including externalities).</jats:p>"

Using census feature classification codes, driving speed limits were assigned to all road segments to calculate haul times to a specific biorefinery location. The feedstock farm gate cost, transportation costs, resource availability and geographic distribution were incorporated to derive feedstock supply curves. To better understand how variation in transportation costs affects the feedstock delivered costs, a sensitivity analysis is conducted incorporating a range of diesel prices.</jats:p>"

Even though South Africa is not a country affected by large-scale disasters such as earthquakes, the impact of disasters in South Africa is aggravated significantly by the vulnerability of people living in informal settlements. Humanitarian logistics, as a ‘new’ sub-field in the supply chain management context, has developed significantly recently to assist in disaster situations. This paper provides an overview of the South African humanitarian logistics context. Even though humanitarian logistics plays a critical role in the aftermath of disasters, it extends far beyond events that can typically be classified as ‘disasters’. Therefore the implication of the South African humanitarian logistics context on future research and collaboration opportunities in South African humanitarian logistics is also discussed. Finally, two recent case studies in the South African humanitarian logistics environment are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Worldwide, there has been a rapid growth in the use of pipelines to transport energy products. Due to the strategic nature of energy products that are transported by pipelines, the importance of risk awareness, assessment and management cannot be over-emphasised. With the risk of pipeline disruptions increasing globally, energy pipeline organisations are compelled to incorporate measures that should help to identify and address areas that can lead to energy pipeline disruptions. The incorporation of such measures for any organisation is premised on an understanding and appreciation of the risks involved. Given the strategic importance of energy pipelines, the main purpose of this paper is to establish whether the South African energy pipeline sector and the public at large appreciate the risks associated with energy pipelines. Thus, the paper seeks to ascertain awareness of the risks associated with the energy pipeline's physical environment, not only from the energy pipeline operators, but also from communities who are exposed to such risks. Data for the study was collected from energy pipeline operators and from a selected residential area in Johannesburg using both structured and unstructured questionnaires. The findings show that the corporate energy sector in South Africa is aware of risks associated with energy pipeline supply chains while the general public's awareness is very low.</jats:p>"

This article builds on previous research examining democratic consolidation by developing a theoretical model to explicate the multilevel relationships between the openness of national media systems and citizens’ perceptions about press freedom in emerging democracies. We combine individual-level public opinion data from the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Survey with institutional data from Freedom House to examine institutional and individual predictors of perceived supply and citizen demand for press freedom. The results of the analyses demonstrate a relationship between characteristics of national media systems and citizen perceptions and preferences about press freedom, although individual factors such as educational attainment, reliance on print media, evaluations of media and state performance, and regime support play a more meaningful role in shaping perceptions about press freedom. Theoretical implications for understanding citizen attitudes about press freedom and their relationship with democratization are discussed. </jats:p>",

Pioneered by Muhammed Yunus in the 1970s, the concept of making small loans to groups of poor entrepreneurs has become a mainstream tool of development and poverty reduction agents around the globe. However, little research has been done at this time into the microeconomic mechanics of small scale finance, especially the different outcomes of the loan depending on what sector of the economy the debtor is engaged in. A simulation designed to pursue further understanding of this subject, and conducted in partnership with Opportunity International, a micro-finance NGO, and the Westmont Investment Club, reveals whether different outcomes of a micro-loan were caused by a debtor's location in the production chain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The city of Santa Monica, California, faced several challenges with its water supply. After detecting methyl‐tertiary butyl ether in some of the wells, the city began researching treatment options and worked with the state regulatory agency to design a water plant with adequate treatment barriers. Even though MTBE was an unregulated contaminant when detected in 1996, the well field was classified as “extremely impaired” by the California Department of Public Health. As a result, a progressive design‐build method of design and construction was used to expedite the schedule and maintain flexibility throughout the project. As the city began to develop a project procurement plan, restrictions on importing water to southern California were being considered or implemented. It therefore became urgent for the city to quickly restore its sustainable groundwater supply. The integrated approach the city selected for design and construction of the water treatment infrastructure offered flexibility in implementing a technical solution in a complex regulatory setting and provided a competitive price and an aggressive schedule. Information in this article may help guide other utilities through planning, design, and construction for water treatment facilities with high‐profile contaminants. The use of progressive design‐build, which is becoming more popular with utilities in the United States, was also beneficial, and may help other utilities decide whether to use such a model on future projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The Seine watershed has long been the food-supplying hinterland of Paris, providing most of the animal and vegetal protein consumed in the city. Nowadays, because of the land specialisation of agriculture made possible by the shift from manure-based to synthetic nitrogen fertilisation, the Seine watershed, although it exports 80% of its huge cereal production, still provides most of the cereal consumed by the Paris agglomeration. The meat and milk supply originate, however, mainly from regions in the North and West of France, specialised in animal farming and importing about 30% of their feed from South America. As it works today, this system is responsible for a severe nitrate contamination of surface groundwater resources. Herein two scenarios of re-localising Paris's food supply are explored, based on organic farming and local provision of animal feed. We show that for the Seine watershed it is technically possible to design an agricultural system able to provide all the plant- and animal-based food required by the population, to deliver sub-root water meeting the drinking water standards and still to export a significant proportion of its production to areas less suitable for cereal cultivation. Decreasing the share of animal products in the human diet has a strong impact on the nitrogen imprint of urban food supply.</jats:p>"

Semisynthetic, approximately isocaloric diets containing 3% soybean oil were supplemented with either 7 or 100 mg Zn/kg diet and with 22% beef tallow (BT) or sunflower oil (SF). In Experiment 1, which compared the dietary fat level and the fat source in a factorial design of treatments, all diets were fed ad libitum to 6 × 8 animals, whereas intake of the high‐Zn BT and SF diets was restricted in Experiment 2 (5 × 6 rats) to the level of intake of the respective low‐Zn diets. The low‐Zn SF diet consistently depressed food intake and final live weights of the animals to a greater extent than the other low‐Zn diets, while intake and growth were comparable among the animals fed the high‐Zn diets. The marginal Zn deficit per se did not alter plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations nor hepatic concentrations of triglyceride, cholesterol and phospholipids. The fatty acid pattern of liver phospholipids did not indicate that chain elongation and desaturation of fatty acids was impaired by a lack of zinc. It was concluded that dietary energy and fat intake, and fat source have a greater effect on plasma and liver lipids than a moderate Zn deficiency. Marginally Zn‐deficient diets enriched with sunflower oil as a major energy source cause a greater growth retardation than diets rich in carbohydrates or beef tallow.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article lays out two broad criteria for crafting a particular brain drain policy at the state level. The first, which we are calling “supply or demand,” asks whether a state experiencing brain drain is below average in high-tech labor demand or above average in high-tech labor supply (the latter concept measured by university enrollments). It is argued that the answer to this question matters a great deal to the policy response. The article then proposes a second, related framework for crafting brain drain policies, which is used widely in the world of business. This is whether a state should “make” or “buy” its own high-tech workers. Benchmarking data and a new review of state policy programs are then used to compare what states are doing with what they ought to be doing in light of their particular situations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural and urban runoffs may be major sources of pollution of water bodies and major sources of bacteria affecting the quality of drinking water. Of the different pathways by which bacterial pathogens can enter drinking water, this one has received little attention to date; that is, because soils are often considered to be near perfect filters for the transport of bacterial pathogens through the subsoil to groundwater. The goals of this study were to determine the distribution, diversity, and antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from low flowing river water and sediment with inputs from different sources before water is discharged into ground water and to compare microbial contamination in water and sediment at different sampling sites. Water and sediment samples were collected from 19 locations throughout the watershed for the isolation of pathogenic E. coli. Heterotrophic plate counts and E. coli were also determined after running tertiary treated water through two tanks containing aquifer sand material. Presumptive pathogenic E. coli isolates were obtained and characterized for virulent factors and antimicrobial resistance. None of the isolates was confirmed as Shiga toxin E. coli (STEC), but as others, such as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to show the diversity E. coli populations from different sources throughout the watershed. Seventy six percent of the isolates from urban sources exhibited resistance to more than one antimicrobial agent. A subsequent filtration experiment after water has gone through filtration tanks containing aquifer sand material showed that there was a 1 to 2 log reduction in E. coli in aquifer sand tank. Our data showed multiple strains of E. coli without virulence attributes, but with high distribution of resistant phenotypes. Therefore, the occurrence of E. coli with multiple resistances in the environment is a matter of great concern due to possible transfer of resistant genes from nonpathogenic to pathogenic strains that may result in increased duration and severity of morbidity.</jats:p>"

This paper portrays the beliefs of customer about the upstream supplier/ manufacturer and its influence on the sale of white goods and consumer electronics in Oman by using a questionnaire containing questions about the supplier/ manufacturer. Discriminant analysis has been used for predicting a function that throws light on the likely sales. The model was successful in finding a discriminating function that throws light on the effect of supplier/ manufacturer’s profile on the sales of CED products in Oman region. It was able to predict the effect of the specific factors about the supplier/manufacturer’s on the prospective sales of CED products. The sample survey had been administered to 120 customers chosen randomly, 60 from Hyper Markets and 60 from specialized stores in Oman dealing with CED products. Many researchers have dealt with the supply chain problems pertaining to transportation and inventory for the upstream activities. Procurement problems are also taken up but from the perspective of manufacturer. This paper is an attempt to deal with procurement issues from the perspective of the customer.</jats:p>"

An important consideration in such complex supply chains is to maintain system performance at high levels for varying demands that may be sensitive to product price. To examine the price-centric behavior of the customers, the concept of price elasticity of demand is addressed. The proposed approach includes many realistic features of typical supply chain systems such as production planning and scheduling, inventory management, transportation delay, transportation cost, and transportation limits. In addition, the proposed system can be extended to meet unsatisfied demand in future periods by backordering. Effects of the elasticity in price demand in production and inventory decisions are also examined. The supply chain model is formulated as a convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Reformulations are presented to make the problem tractable. The differential equations are reformulated as difference equations, and unbounded derivatives in the nonlinear objective function are handled with an approximation, with guaranteed bounds on the loss of optimality. The approach is illustrated on a multiechelon, multiproduct supply chain network. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study is to design and evaluate the performance of the supply chain for biocrude production from activated sewage sludge in wastewater treatment facilities. Experimental results indicate that feeding wastewater activated sludge with high sugar load and establishing a high carbon‐to‐nitrogen ratio in the wastewater can enhance biocrude yield and quality from the sludge. The biocrude will be further refined and converted to biodiesel. The optimization part, of the optimization‐simulation framework that we propose, uses a mixed integer program to identify locations for sugar plants as well as the assignment of wastewater treatment plants to sugar plants and refineries. The objective is to minimize total supply chain related costs. We use the solution from the optimization model (the structure of the supply chain) to build a discrete‐event simulation model. The simulation captures the seasonal and random nature of biomass supply. We use a case study that designs the supply chain for biocrude in Mississippi given the availability of lignocellulosic biomass, the locations of harvesting sites, location of wastewater treatment plants, and location of refineries. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 139–147, 2013.</jats:p>",

The study evaluates the effects of local biomass availability and road network properties on the greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions of these two supply chains. The local forest biomass availability around the case study locations, truck transportation distances, and road network properties were analyzed by GIS methods to produce accurate and site-dependent data for the transportation emission calculations. The GHG emissions were then assessed by LCA methods. The total transportation distance to Rovaniemi was 22% larger than to Mikkeli, but the transportation derived GHG emissions were 31% larger. The results highlight the fact that local conditions should always be taken into account when assessing the sustainability of biomass-based energy production.</jats:p>",

We discussed a therapy concept that combines skin cell spray transplantation with a novel wound dressing based on artificial hollow fiber membrane capillaries. In skin cell‐based therapy development, autologous skin progenitor cells are isolated from a healthy skin area and sprayed onto the wound. A medical device was introduced that uses perfused capillaries, known from clinical plasma separation, as a temporarily applied extracorporeal wound capillary bed. The functions of the dressing are comparable with those of dialysis; the capillaries, however, are applied externally onto the wound. Perfusion with a clinical peripheral nutrition and buffer solution can provide wound irrigation, wound debris removal, cell nutrition, pH regulation, and electrolyte balance while potentially serving to address delivery of regenerative factors and antibiosis. An innovative active skin wound dressing that provides cell support and stimulates regeneration by wound irrigation is discussed.</jats:p>",

Matched employer–employee data allow us to examine the effect of worker and firm characteristics on hours worked. We find that in addition to the demographic and human capital characteristics of workers, firm‐level characteristics and worker awareness of how to refuse overtime are important in explaining variation in hours worked.</jats:p>",

In this article, the authors take a close look at three such verbs: provide, supply, and present. Corpus analysis shows that these three verbs display different structural preferences with respect to the for-, to-, and with-patterns. To explain these preferences, the study investigates pragmatic principles (following Mukherjee on provide) and the role played by semantic factors. An examination of the semantics of the verbs and the lexically motivated constructional semantics of the to, for, and with-patterns shows (a) that the three constructions are not interchangeable and (b) that the preferential differences among the three verbs find an explanation in the compatibility between lexical and constructional semantics. The description is mainly based on data from the British National Corpus. </jats:p>",

A systematic conservation plan was produced, highlighting river conservation areas (river types, fish species and connectivity areas), moderate‐impact management areas (groundwater‐surface water interaction and recharge areas) and river rehabilitation areas. The proposed river selections would achieve the biodiversity targets of 33 (66%) of the 50 river types; feasible rehabilitation would increase this to 92%. The greatest groundwater‐surface water interaction and recharge (30 to &gt; 50 mm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) values are concentrated around the mountainous regions of the Little Karoo. This is because the main aquifers in the mountains, table mountain group (TMG) quartzites, yield naturally good quality water for human consumption. River reaches of unacceptable surface water quality were classified as degraded water resource delivery areas where the poor water quality was primarily due to saline return flows from irrigation and the impacts of other anthropogenic activities including abstraction of freshwater which otherwise would have diluted the return flows. Only the middle reaches of the Gouritz and Groot Rivers represent a possible win–win situation for both the environment and human use. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The AC–DC power supply for LED lighting application requires a long lifetime while maintaining high‐efficiency, high power factor and low cost. However, a typical design uses electrolytic capacitor as storage capacitor, which is not only bulky but also with short life span, thus hampering performance improvement of the entire LED lighting system. In this article, a SEPIC‐derived power factor correction topology is proposed as the first stage for driving multiple lighting LED lamps. Along with a relatively large voltage ripple allowable in a two‐stage design, the proposal of LED lamp driver is able to eliminate the electrolytic capacitor while maintaining high power factor and high efficiency. To further increase the efficiency of LED driver, we introduced and used the twin‐bus buck converter as the second‐stage current regulator with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dimming function. The basic operating principle and the deign consideration are discussed in detail. A 50‐W prototype has been built and tested to verify the proposal.

When argon or Ar-CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>is injected into LF, the voltage is lower and the electric current amplitude are more stable than those of the normal solid graphite electrode heat, and it’s the most stable for the heat refining with φ(Ar)/φ(CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>)=85/15 injection.</jats:p>"

We aimed to quantify the role of WASH in the risk of\n            <jats:italic>Schistosoma hematobium</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>Schistosoma mansoni</jats:italic>\n            , and hookworm infection in school-aged children; to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of helminth infection due to WASH; and to spatially predict the risk of infection. We generated predictive maps of areas in West Africa without piped water, toilet facilities, and improved household floor types, using spatial risk models. Our maps identified areas in West Africa where the millennium development goal for water and sanitation is lagging behind. There was a generally better geographical coverage for toilets and improved household floor types compared with water supply. These predictions, and their uncertainty, were then used as covariates in Bayesian geostatistical models for the three helminth species. We estimated a smaller attributable fraction for water supply in\n            <jats:italic>S. mansoni</jats:italic>\n            (PAF 47%) compared with\n            <jats:italic>S. hematobium</jats:italic>\n            (PAF 71%). The attributable fraction of\n            <jats:italic>S. hematobium</jats:italic>\n            infection due to natural floor type (PAF 21%) was comparable to that of\n            <jats:italic>S. mansoni</jats:italic>\n            (PAF 16%), but was significantly higher for hookworm infection (PAF 86%). Five percent of hookworm cases could have been prevented if improved toilet facilities had been available. Mapping the distribution of infection risk adjusted for WASH allowed the identification of communities in West Africa where preventive chemotherapy integrated with interventions to improve WASH will yield the greatest health benefits.\n          </jats:p>",

The concentrations of all nutrients except Mn and Zn were identical in all treatments. The objectives of the experiment were to establish critical Zn and Mn levels in both nutrient solutions and leaves of cucumber grown hydroponically, to assess the impact of gradual Zn and/or Mn accumulation in the external solution on nutrient uptake and gas exchange, and to find whether Mn and Zn have additive effects when the levels of both ions are excessively high in the root zone. The first symptoms of Mn and Zn toxicity appeared when the concentrations of Mn and Zn in the leaves of cucumber reached 900 and 450 mg kg<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> in the dry weight, respectively. Excessively high Mn or/and Zn concentrations in the leaves reduced the fruit biomass production due to decreases in the number of fruits per plant, as well as the net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, but increased the intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels. Initially, the Mn or Zn concentrations in the recirculating nutrient solution increased rapidly but gradually stabilized to maximal levels, while the corresponding concentrations in the leaves constantly increased until the end of the experiment. The uptake of Mg, Ca, Fe, and Cu was negatively affected, while that of K and P remained unaffected by the external Mn and Zn levels. The combination of high Mn and Zn seems to have no additive effects on the parameters investigated.</jats:p>",

Ruxolitinib (INC424), a potent and selective oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has recently demonstrated rapid and durable reductions in splenomegaly and improved disease-related symptoms, role functioning, and quality of life in 2 phase 3 studies in patients with MF. Both studies met their primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with ≥35% reduction in spleen volume at 24 weeks (COMFORT-I) and at 48 weeks (COMFORT-II): 41.9% vs 0.7% (ruxolitinib vs placebo, P &lt;.0001) and 28.5% vs 0% (ruxolitinib vs best available therapy, P &lt;.0001), respectively. The most common grade ≥3 hematologic adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia and anemia, which were manageable and rarely led to discontinuation (COMFORT-I: n=1 each; COMFORT-II: thrombocytopenia, n=1; anemia, n=0). Because of the limited available treatment options and medical need, ruxolitinib has been made available through an individual supply program (ISP) outside the United States.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Patients with PMF, PPV-MF or PET-MF who are determined by their physicians to be in need of treatment are considered for eligibility, irrespective of JAK2 mutation status. As in the COMFORT studies, the starting dose of ruxolitinib is determined on the basis of baseline platelet count and can be adjusted for efficacy and safety. Dose changes during treatment are registered, and AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) are monitored throughout the study.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To date, 231 patients have been screened at more than 150 study sites in 28 countries, including Canada, Australia, and locations in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.

To date, the proportion of patients with the JAK2V617F mutation enrolled in this ISP (68.5%) is higher than that for the general MF population (50–60%) and may reflect the tendency of physicians to include more JAK2V617F-positive patients in the ISP, even though ruxolitinib has demonstrated comparable efficacy in both patient types (Verstovsek S, et al. N Engl J Med. 2010;363(12):1117–1127).

However, the impact of WBPA on blood flow to ischemic legs has not been investigated.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Hypothesis:</jats:bold>\n            WBPA enhances blood supply in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia and in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Methods and Results:</jats:bold>\n            After unilateral femoral artery excision, wild type mice were assigned to either the WBPA (n=15) or control (n=13) group. WBPA was applied at 150 cpm for 45 min under anesthesia once a day. WBPA significantly increased blood flow recovery at 7 and 14 days after surgery as determined by laser doppler perfusion imaging. Sections of ischemic adductor muscle stained with anti-CD31 antibody showed a significant increase in capillary density in WBPA-treated mice compared with control mice, suggesting that WBPA promotes angiogenesis at a microcirculatory level. WBPA increased the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in adductor muscle. The pro-angiogenic effect of WBPA on ischemic limb was blunted in eNOS-deficient mice, suggesting that the stimulatory effects of WBPA on revascularization are eNOS-dependent. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed significant increases in molecules involved in angiogenesis, such as VEGF, FGF2, SDF-1, PDGF-B in ischemic hindlimb by WBPA. Protein array analysis showed that WBPA induced changes in the expression profile of serum angiogenesis-related proteins. Facilitated blood flow recovery was observed in a mouse model of diabetes despite no changes in glycemic control. Clinically, 10 patients (age, 69±7 years, 9 men) with PAD underwent single session of WBPA treatment at 140 cpm for 45 min. WBPA significantly improved the ischemic/non-ischemic ratio of blood flow in the lower extremity from 0.74±0.21 to 0.87±0.21 (p&lt;0.05).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold>\n            WBPA increased blood supply to ischemic lower extremities through activation of eNOS signaling and upregulation of pro-angiogenic growth factor in ischemic skeletal muscle. WBPA is a potentially suitable non-invasive intervention to facilitate therapeutic angiogenesis.\n          </jats:p>",

For this purpose, helper function provided by concurrent CD4+ T cells should be evidently considerable. In this study, to achieve the enhanced anti-leukemia functionality mediated by redirected CD8+ T cells using WT1-specific TCR gene transfer, we in detail examined functionalities mediated by similarly redirected CD4+ T cells using the identical TCR gene transfer.[Methods] HLA-A*24:02-restricted and WT1235-243-specific codon-optimized TCR α/β genes were inserted into the novel retroviral vector encoding shRNAs for endogenous TCRs (WT1-siTCR vector). (1) Cognate antigen-responsive cytokine production mediated by WT1-siTCR transduced CD4+ T cells was assessed using cytokine beads array and ELISA assay. (2) Expression of CD40L and OX40 on redirected CD4+ T cells stimulated by WT1 peptide ligation was assessed using flow cytometer. (3) Impact caused by redirected CD4+ T cells on each magnitude of WT1-specific cytotoxicity, target-responsive proliferation and transition to central memory T-cell phenotype of WT1-siTCR transduced CD8+ T cells was measured using 51Cr-release assay, CD107a assay, intracellular IFN-γ assay and CFSE assay. (4) Chemokines produced by redirected CD4+ T cells stimulated using WT1 peptide was comprehensively assessed using real-time PCR. Consequent chemotaxis of redirected CD8+ T cells toward those stimulated redirected CD4+ cells was validated using transwell experiments. (6) Finally, anti-leukemia reactivity against autologous leukemia cells mediated by patients' redirected CD8+ T cells was similarly examined in the presence or absence of such autologous CD4+ T cells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>[Results]</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>First, in this study, those redirected CD4+ T cells hardly became positive for intracellular FoxP3, a crucial marker for regulatory T cell phenotype. In response to the WT1 peptide, WT1-siTCR transduced CD4+ T cells produced Th1 cytokines; IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α, in the context of HLA-A*24:02, which also needed HLA class II molecules on target cells. Magnitudes of WT1-responsive CD107a expression, IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity mediated by WT1-siTCR transduced CD8+ T cells were efficiently enhanced in the presence of redirected, but not non-redirected CD4+ T cells. Similarly, in the presence of those redirected CD4+ T cells, redirected CD8+ T cells expressing WT1-specific TCR increased in number and the transition to central memory T-cell phenotype (CD45RA−CD62L+) of those CD8+ T cells was stimulated in response to the stimulation with WT1 peptide. WT1 peptide ligation stimulated those redirected CD4+ T cells to express membrane-bound OX40, which is involved in the formation of central memory CD8+ T cells. WT1 peptide ligation also stimulated the redirected CD4+ T cells to produce chemokines; CCL3 and CCL4. Redirected CD8+ T cells expressed the receptor for these chemokines, CCR5; efficient migration of redirected CD8+ T cells toward redirected CD4+ T cells stimulated with WT1 peptide was obviously observed in transwell experiments. Finally, redirected CD4+ T cells isolated from patients with leukemia successfully provided Th1 helper function to autologous redirected CD8+ T cells to enhance the anti-leukemia reactivity; cytotoxicity, proliferation and formation of central memory T cells, in response to autologous leukemia cells, in vitro.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>[Conclusion]</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Although further investigations are warranted, concurrently adopted WT1-siTCR introduced CD4+ T cells seems feasible to enhance the efficacy of WT1-targeting redirected T-cell-based adoptive therapy for treatment of human leukemia.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
