      "abstract": "<jats:p>The theory that perverse supply curves for cash-crop commodities exist in subsistence economies is very firmly held by Prof. Boeke according to whom this theory is borne out in particular by the native rubber industry of Indonesia. An analysis of the relationship of rubber and rice prices to exports of native rubber in two main producing regions of Indonesia clearly shows that where the peasant rubber producer has alternative opportunities he reacts in an entirely 'normal' manner to changes in the price of rubber relative to rice.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses the concept of using treated municipal sewage for all municipal purposes, and presents the experiences of Chanute and Lyndon, Kansas, as striking examples. In both instances, the municipality itself made the decision to re‐use its sewage as the best possible solution to the water supply problem. Recognition of the future need for water reuse is forcing public agencies to consider new concepts of water quality management. It may even become feasible to practice complete recovery of the water component of municipal sewage, the pure water that makes up 99.9 per cent of sewage (by weight). It is assumed here that sewage treatment includes the activated‐sludge process and chlorination, followed by conventional water treatment. There are, however, a number of physical, microbiologic, and chemical factors pertinent to the question of water reuse and public health. Those factors discussed in this article include the following: physical quality; bacterial pathogens; fungal pathogens; enteric viruses; parasitic protozoa; parasitic worms; infectious disease; undesireable chemicals; inorganic chemicals; and, organic compounds.</jats:p>",

Construction costs and contract details are provided, along with a discussion of demineralization equipment and the electrodialysis process, power costs, filter life and deposition problems, and detailed operating costs.</jats:p>",
