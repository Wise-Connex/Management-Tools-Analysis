All respiratory muscles show an equal distribution of fast-twitch (FTa and b) fibres with the exception of the expiratory intercostal muscles which have few FTb fibres. The inspiratory muscles have a uniformly small fibre size, in contrast to the expiratory intercostal muscle fibres which are large. The fibre size of the inspiratory muscles is maintained with ageing, whereas that of the expiratory intercostal muscles appears to be reduced after the age of 50 yrs. Capillary supply is most abundant in the expiratory muscles followed by DIA and the inspiratory intercostal muscles. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) it is unknown whether a reduction in fibre size of the thoracic respiratory muscles is caused by extreme use due to increased ventilatory work, or by disuse due to an increased involvement of the extrathoracic respiratory muscles. Histochemical characteristics suggest that, in normal humans, the load on the inspiratory muscles is relatively small during contractions, whereas the expiratory intercostal muscles are exposed to severe continuous activity with a heavy load.</jats:p>",

While water treatment technology can successfully process poor quality source waters containing in excess of 2000 fecal coliforms/100 mL to produce potable water that meets the accepted drinking water standards, there is serious concern that the barriers to microbial breakthrough in the finished water may prove to be dangerously thin. Any momentary break in the treatment train could allow substantial levels of microorganisms to enter the final product—potable water.</jats:p><jats:p>The burden of water quality enhancement should be a shared responsibility among all discharges and downstream users of these irreplaceable resources. Much can be accomplished through the application of a multiple barrier approach in wastewater treatment, controlled storm water releases, and water supply enhancement. Dischargers must seek to minimize pathogen releases, reduce particulate dispersion, and diminish organics in effluents. These factors impact heavily on the effectiveness of wastewater disinfection. Furthermore, with passage downstream to the water intake, these organic residuals may be the precursors of disinfection by‐products created during drinking water treatment. Some water supply operations must revise their treatment practices to provide better protection from the passage of protozoan cysts and enhance the removal of organics before applying disinfection. Disinfection of water supply is critical and will only be consistently effective in a clean processed water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The effect of increasing oxygen supply on the perfused systemic heart of Octopus vulgaris (Lam.) by using oxygenated or haemocyanin-containing perfusates was investigated. Providing aerated blood or seawater solutions of haemocyanin that were comparable with blood in oxygen-carrying capacity improved the performance of the isolated heart compared with that of hearts perfused with aerated sea water. Aortic outputs were similar to in vivo values (44 ml min-1 g-1) at close to in vivo values of preload and afterload owing to an increase in both heart rate (from 24.0 to 38.4 beats min-1) and stroke volume (from 0.69 to 1.10ml g-1). Coronary flow fell in these conditions, becoming 2.5 % of the aortic output (against 24% with aerated sea water). A parallel increase in coronary resistance was found. Oxygenated sea water also improved the performance of the heart, mainly by improving the stroke volume. Both with haemocyanin solutions or blood and with oxygenated sea water, the isolated heart was able to do more work at lower preloads compared with the hearts perfused with aerated sea water. Power output was linearly related to total oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. The major site of oxygen consumption was the coronary bed. Haemocyanin released about 70 % of the bound oxygen as it passed through the ventricular wall.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous international comparisons of workforce skills by the National Institute have focussed on the relative shortage of craft skills in Britain. The present study is concerned with the next higher level of supervisory and technician skills; on the basis of visits to factories and technical colleges in Britain, France and Germany, and analysis of labour force statistics, it compares and contrasts the provision and deployment of these intermediate skills in manufacturing industry in the three countries. At supervisory level only Germany undertakes a significant amount of training and to standards adequate to the increased complexity and technical demands of modern manufacturing. At technician (Higher National) level, the numbers acquiring comparable qualifications in Britain and France are substantially higher than in Germany: in part this reflects the allocation of a large proportion of technical support functions in German industry to craft-trained personnel. After examining the relative distribution of training costs between employers, individuals and the public authorities in the three countries, the paper makes proposals for a more cost-effective mix of craft- and technician-level skills in British manufacturing which might, in the process, reduce the need for over-qualified personnel to ‘plug the gaps’ in skills among shopfloor workers and supervisors.</jats:p>",

In terms of percent receiving water services, the urban areas made good progress: 77% in 1980 to 82% in 1990. In the rural areas progress was even greater, 30% had water services in 1980 versus 63% in 1990. There was also considerable progress in institutional terms. A positive trend towards better linkage betweeen authorities dealing with water supply and sanitation and those dealing with economic development, was one. Another was the awareness of the need for community involvement. In some cases progress was hampered by fragmentation of governmental authorities dealing with water and sanitation at the rural and/or urban level. In the 1990s an important issue will be financing the infrastructure needed to bring water and sanitation services to those not already covered and to an increasing population. Institutional issues will continue to be important as well.</jats:p>",

The comparison allows for a sensitivity test of results to different values for demand and supply elasticity. The main finding is that the values of the gross annual research benefits calculated for the NLCE specification are larger than those calculated for the linear specification with price‐elastic supply but are smaller with price‐inelastic supply. The analysis suggests that the use of an NLCE specification and a pivotal shift due to research is usually preferable to use of a linear supply curve with pivotal shift.</jats:p>",
