      "abstract": "<jats:p>The moisture content was determined periodically (April to November) in non-podzolic outwash sand supporting a 17-year-old fully stocked red-pine plantation and in parts of the same plantation reduced 50 % by thinning. The diameter increment of average trees was recorded by ring-band dendro-meters. The water supply in the 4-ft root zone of thinned plantations averaged nearly 10% or 500 tons/acre. This soil gained moisture from rainfall during the critical midsummer period. Soil of the fully-stocked stand had a high moisture content early in the growing season because of a delayed thaw. Early in July, decrease in moisture below the field capacity of 7% coincided with retarded diameter growth of trees, probably because of restricted capillary transfer and moisture depletion in the vicinity of absorbing roots. 50% thinning reduced the growing stock beyond permissible limits and was favourable to weed growth.
