      "abstract": "<jats:p>In water supply systems, pressure management in most cases is proven to be the most cost-effective activity related to water loss control. As an advanced method of pressure control, it is possible to use variable frequency drives for centrifugal pump control. Pressure regulation can be performed with constant pressure or with proportional pressure control. The application of proportional pressure control is particularly applicable in water supply systems as the operating pump performance is constantly adapting the pressure to the actual demand. Along with lower leakage losses, it also results in lower energy consumption and the elimination of non-stationary phenomena, thereby extending the pump lifetime. Therefore, the paper presents a theoretical discussion of the proportional pressure control. Possible savings are shown on the numerical example of water supply system of the city of Velika Gorica.</jats:p>",

Demands of the markets are as assumed to be random variables with normal distribution and the disruption of the chain is formulated by defining different scenarios. Having substitutable facilities and extra production capacities makes it possible to overcome the negative effects of demand fluctuations and disruption of facilities. First we determine the optimal number, location and capacity of facilities in the first and third tiers and the best flow of material and product throughout the chain in a way to maximize the expected profit from the chain. Then to reduce the difference between the performances of the chain in different scenarios, we propose the ISP-Robust technique based on P-Robust technique to make the model robust. We discuss the differences and advantages of this technique in comparison to the P-Robust technique. We illustrate our method using data from the petrochemical industry.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, a series of tests was carried out to measure tensile strength, bending and adhesion; in addition, dynamic mechanical analyses, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analyses were also conducted. A change in the mechanical and physical properties of these materials after water exposure could be observed. Furthermore, the surface preparation and remaining contaminants, e.g. rust, can affect the adhesion properties of the sealant. The plan is to develop a formulation of a matched material based on the results of these tests and the existing knowledge about the behaviour of sealing materials. The proposed in-pipe robot consists of three main subsystems: a control station, a mobile robot (similar to a vehicle) and a maintenance unit with a redevelopment system. An operator controls the movement of the cable-tethered robot system remotely from outside the construction side.</jats:p>",

The oil majors, multinational corporations, which constitute the mainframe of private sector participation in the industry now have to deal with a whole host of new players within their supply chains, with serious implications for procurement management. One such implication will be challenges posed by sustainability risks (Olatoye 2011; Toye 2010).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Sustainability risks are those risks posed by aspects of an organisation's business or operational practices to its sustainability aspirations, expectations or obligations. Traditionally, sustainability risks in the supply chain have been focused on the environmental indicators – thus explaining lingoes like ‘green purchasing’, ‘eco-procurement’ etc (Russel 1998; Erdmenger 2003). However, the enactment of the Act also coincides with increasing emphasis on social as well as economic indicators of sustainability performance (Olatoye 2012).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This state of affairs raises issues on what both procurers and suppliers of services under the Nigerian content regime should envisage in the emergent industry structure. This is all the more so as the procurers of services are not just subject to Nigerian local laws but also a regime of international sustainability requirements, the so-called international corporate responsibility (Michael 2005).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative and associated standards and principles, this paper draws a chart of the dimensions of commitments which both the supply and demand sides of local content services must look at, as they cement their relationships. It concludes by demonstrating that Nigerian enterprises desirous of taking advantage of the Act will need to look beyond that Act and even the Nigerian legal regime for an understanding of the standard of practices which would be acceptable to their service procurers.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, the ability of the chain to deliver high(er) levels and standards of animal welfare is subject to two critical conditions: (a) the innovative and adaptive capacity of the chain to respond to society’s demands; (b) the extent to which consumers actually purchase animal-friendly products. Despite a substantial literature reporting estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare, there is a belief that in practice people vote for substantially more and better animal welfare as citizens than they are willing to pay for as consumers. This citizen-consumer gap has significant consequences on the supply chain, although there is limited literature on the capacity and willingness of supply chains to deliver what the consumer wants and is willing to pay for. This paper outlines an economic analysis of supply chain delivery of improved standards for farm animal welfare in the EU and illustrates the possible consequences of improving animal welfare standards for the supply chain using a prototype belief network analysis.</jats:p>"

The technology applied at the waterworks consisted of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) dosing and rapid sand filtration followed by sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) disinfection. The treated water fulfilled the requirements for iron, arsenic and usually for manganese as well; however, it contained ammonia and dissolved gases. The aim of the investigation was to find out how the current technology could be modified in order to meet the drinking water requirements. In the first experimental setup, treated water of the waterworks was aerated and directed to the biological reactor, where ammonia was converted into nitrate. In the second experimental setup, the untreated water was first aerated, followed by a biological reactor (sand filter), KMnO4 dosing and a second sand filtration stage. Both experiments were successful; the treated water fulfilled the iron, manganese, arsenic and ammonia limits. Furthermore, the studied technologies were capable of removing dissolved gases. Modification of the current technology according to the second experimental setup is suggested, for two reasons: the KMnO4 dose could be decreased to one-third of the current value, and the explosive methane gas could be removed in the first treatment step.</jats:p>",

But how do managers know that the firms supply chain is performing efficiently and effectively? Continuous measurement to obtain feedback and implementation of improvements based on the retrieved information is the answer to that. Balanced scorecard, which was developed by Kaplan and Norton, was a milestone for performance evaluation in supply chain management, which asserted in measuring performance not just from financial perspective, but to determine by focusing on the customer, internal process, and learning &amp; growth. Since then to present, the scorecard has been evolved to further generations to correspond with the rapid changing economic situation.The following case study on Danone Dumex Sdn Bhd was conducted on a purpose to appraise a practical international business supply chain by using first generation balanced scorecard as a gauge. Danone Dumex was chosen as evaluation target due to the nature of business, which is a manufacturing firm that requires multinational logistics. For the research method, company report was reviewed, personal interview to a supply chain director was performed, and extensive information sources were revised and filtered. From the assessment, for customer, financial, and internal process perspective, Danone Dumex had an outstanding performance. This is attributable to their business strategy of customer above all, and based on that, the firm has established a prominent standard in quality control and market forecasting system, and implemented to its supply chain by utilizing customized SAP. Meanwhile, their less emphasis on learning and growth perspective should be reconsidered in a long-run, as its competitors are improving on the same direction as Danone Dumex is heading.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a Stackelberg-type manufacturer-vendor-consumer profit distribution game model was constructed. Furthermore, by adopting income-sharing contract as the instrument to measure profit distribution, the profit distribution equilibrium between energy-distributor-dominant and the energy generation-dominant supply chains were studied in this paper. By doing so, a theoretical conclusion was drafted that the dominant enterprises in the sector gained access to more profit through the biased policy privilege that granted to them for many years; and the income distribution factors of these dominant enterprise ensured a maximized profit for the entire energy supply chain. Finally, the correctness of the concluded result was verified through calculations on the numerical examples.</jats:p>"

In recent decades the use of the classical Torricelli or orifice equation has been questioned in the sense that some experimental results clearly demonstrated that the assumption of a leak outflow proportional to the square root of the head drop can yield unsatisfactory results. To investigate this behaviour, an experimental activity has been carried out at the Water Engineering Laboratory of the University of Perugia, Italy. Part of the results of the carried out tests are presented in this paper for a leak in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. Leak laws based on the assumption of a leak area variation with the pressure are compared and validated by strain measures close to the leak.</jats:p>",

By descriptive statistical analysis of these data, we find the disruption has secular and hysteretic effect on the supply chain. Furthermore, T test is used to testify the contracts effectiveness on the supply chain under disruption conditions. These analytical results show that quantity discount contract and revenue sharing contract can effectively relieve the negative influence on the supply chain when disruptions happen, since they not only enhance the total profit but also stabilize the fluctuation of the supply chains total inventory, whereas the contracts do not perform well in satisfying the market demand shortage.</jats:p>"

The procedure consists of two steps: (1) generation of hourly water demand coefficients which respect, for each hour of the day, pre-assigned means and variances; and (2) introduction of the cross-correlation at different time lags through the application of a method which implies the reordering of the data generated at step 1. The procedure was applied to a case study of the Ferrara water distribution system with the aim of generating cross-correlated synthetic series of hourly water demand coefficients for the 19 water districts making it up. It was observed that the application of the method for introducing the cross-correlation (step 2) causes numerical problems when a large number of water districts are involved and the cross-correlations are considered at many time lags; this problem is solved by carrying out an appropriate regularization of the observed cross-correlation matrix. The results obtained show that overall the proposed procedure constitutes a valid tool for generating synthetic water demand time series with pre-assigned characteristics in terms of means, variances and cross-correlation at different time lags.</jats:p>",

Geostatistical methods (like kriging or cokriging) may result in an unrealistic groundwater level map if only a few measured data are available. In this paper a new, grid-based, deterministic method (GSGW-model) is introduced. The aim of the model is to calculate groundwater depth within the required accuracy from sparse data of monitoring wells. The basic principle of the GSGW-model is that the groundwater table is a smoothed replica of the ground surface. Hence, changes in the groundwater level between two grid points are calculated as a function of the digital elevation model (DEM) and soil properties. The GSGW-model was tested in the Nyírség region (Hungary). Results were compared with those gained by ordinary kriging and cokriging. It has been concluded that kriging overestimates the groundwater level in the low part of the test area, where wetlands are located, while the maps produced by the GSGW-model are a better fit of the real variability, providing more reliable estimates of groundwater depth in GWDTE-s as well.</jats:p>",

Although YouTube is rightly acknowledged as one of the pivotal forms of social networking to have emerged in the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to its specific impact on the form and content of music video. From its tentative beginnings in the 1970s, music video quickly established itself as one of the principal—and most powerful—components of the popular music industry. This chapter examines the ways in which the creative opportunities provided by YouTube’s overt democratization of modes of video production, presentation, and consumption have had economic, aesthetic, and political repercussions on popular music practices and have fundamentally shifted traditional understandings of supply and demand.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When a fire-flow condition occurs and a nodal demand is excessive or when a pipe breaks, a water distribution system (WDS) may temporarily become deficient and unable to satisfy all nodal demands. Thus, estimation of the influences of failure conditions on the network is needed. A method for analyzing the hydraulic condition of the network in such a situation is proposed. The method, which is constructed based on the amount of supply on each consumption node, is called node flow analysis (NFA). Given the limitations of the NFA method proposed earlier for determining optimal solutions, such as inflexibility of the approach toward more complicated problems and its time-consuming process, this paper presents the honey-bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm for maximizing the total supply of the Two-loop and Hanoi water distribution networks (WDNs) under a failure condition. The proposed method is much faster and simpler to use than the NFA method. Consequently, obtained results confirm the higher accuracy of the proposed method to conditions of WDNs under local pipe breakage. In addition, results make one aware of the effects of each pipe breakage on consumption nodes and in the entire network under two scenarios for maximizing total supply in the network.</jats:p>",

In Sydney, Australia, people walk farther to the train than to the bus, the distributions of walking distances are different for each mode, and the trip and demographic characteristics of train and bus users are different. Given the decision to walk to public transport, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and labor force status and trip characteristics such as trip purpose, time of day and week, fare and ticket type, and trip duration are not significant in explaining walking distance to each mode of public transport. The mode of the public transport trip is the most important determinant of walking distance, reflecting the different supply and spacing of each mode. For instance, there are many more bus stops than train stations. The differences between train and bus users suggest that accessibility initiatives for public transport might not be the same for each mode.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The collection and distribution of drinking water resources generally require large quantities of energy, that vary according to factors related to the characteristics of the served area, as well as to design and management choices. Energy intensity indicators (energy per unit of volume) are insufficient to assess the weight of different factors that affect the energy consumption and appear not suitable for the comparison of different water supply systems. The key step of this work is to define a methodology for assessing the energy efficiency of water supply systems. In particular, water losses in water distribution systems, generally assessed in relation to the quantity of high quality water dispersed in the environment, are herein considered in relation to their energy content. In addition to the evaluation of energy balance using the approach proposed by Enrique Cabrera et al. in ‘Energy audit of water networks’ (see J. Water Res. Plan. Manage.136 (6), 669–677) an overall efficiency indicator WSEE (Water Supply Energy Efficiency) is then proposed. Its decomposition finally leads to the definition of further indicators, which may help to assess how the structure of the network, leakage rate and/or pumps affect the energy efficiency of the water system. Such indicators can be used to compare different water supply systems and to identify the impact of individual interventions. The proposed energy analysis was applied to two case studies in Northern Italy.</jats:p>",

Designed in a 28 nm CMOS technology, a chain of 16 inverters using the proposed circuit shows a period jitter up to three times smaller than that of an equally long chain of basic inverters.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electric power supply companies increasingly rely on enterprise IT systems to provide them with a comprehensive view of the state of the distribution network. Within a utility-wide network, enterprise IT systems collect data from various metering devices. Such data can be effectively used for the prediction of power supply network vulnerability. The purpose of this paper is to present the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)-based Sensor Web integration solution that we have developed with the purpose of enabling prediction of power supply network vulnerability, in terms of a prediction of defect probability for a particular network element. We will give an example of its usage and demonstrate our vulnerability prediction model on data collected from two different power supply companies. The proposed solution is an extension of the GinisSense Sensor Web-based architecture for collecting, processing, analyzing, decision making and alerting based on the data received from heterogeneous data sources. In this case, GinisSense has been upgraded to be capable of operating in an ESB environment and combine Sensor Web and GIS technologies to enable prediction of electric power supply system vulnerability. Aside from electrical values, the proposed solution gathers ambient values from additional sensors installed in the existing power supply network infrastructure. GinisSense aggregates gathered data according to an adapted Omnibus data fusion model and applies decision-making logic on the aggregated data. Detected vulnerabilities are visualized to end-users through means of a specialized Web GIS application.</jats:p>"

Dutch water companies in collaboration with the KWR Watercycle Research Institute have joined forces and developed a data standard and central database to store and analyse failure data. As of early 2012, 66,000 km of network are monitored, providing around 2,500 records on failure annually.

In order to immediately answer to people’s needs while managing an emergency, any intervention should be more proactive and take into account renewable technologies that can be applied in anemergency situation. Very few examples of renewable energy systems in emergency situations are presented in the literature and this gap needs to be filled. This paper presents the results of a project on Storage Integrated Solar Thermal Collectors, specifically studied for this kind of situations, carried out during the post-emergency and rehabilitation phases, after the earthquake in Abruzzi (2009).  The overall objective of the project was to promote the advance and innovation of sustainable energy systems for the participatory use of renewable sources in post-emergency and rehabilitation phases. To raise the awareness and study the impact on social perception of renewable energy use, a special program was launched by CIRPS (Inter University Research Center on Sustainable Development of “Sapienza” University of Rome) along with L’Aquila municipality within the local population, just a few days after the earthquake. A “learning by doing” methodology was applied to carry out a participatory project, involving the local population and civil society organizations. Conclusions about the analysis of the project outcomes are presented and a set of measures aiming at increasing the renewable energy rates of displaced camps and rehabilitation phase are finally proposed.</jats:p>"

As guidelines and performance measures are increasingly used for public reporting and payment, the necessity for a strong evidence base has become more urgent and compelling. To achieve the intended positive effects of quality measurement and minimise potential unintended consequences, measures should be based on the best evidence for the focus of measurement. While outcome measurement is increasingly preferred, many measures continue to focus on process steps distal from the desired outcome, even when there is evidence for a more proximal intervention or intermediate outcome that can be linked to the desired outcome. Guidelines are a critical step in the supply chain to performance measures and ultimately evidence-based improvement processes. The quality of the guideline and the evidence review has significant downstream implications for measure development. The complexity of guidelines may also limit the ability to translate into feasible performance measures. The degree of specificity in the guideline has implications for the precision of the measure specifications. Measurement is impeded by the lack of specificity in guidelines, such as imprecise “high risk” population designations and insufficient information regarding periodicity. Though potentially useful for clinical care, extensive use of exceptions in guidelines makes them difficult to operationalize into measures. To ensure that guidelines can be readily adaptable for performance measurement, greater communication and collaboration is needed between the guideline and measurement communities. Ideally, guidelines would be developed with experts in performance measurement and clinical decision support at the table to ensure that evidence synthesis and guidelines can effectively serve the needs of measurement and improvement.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

OS is proven to have a significant phosphorus adsorption capacity; significant phosphorus removal was achieved in vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (VSSFs) that were filled with OS and used to treat swine wastewater. In the VSSF system, OS adsorption and precipitation played the greatest role in phosphorus removal, and the phosphorus distribution in the substrate layers was attributed to the vertical flow state of wastewater in the system. Ca–P was the predominant form of phosphorus in the system. Overall, the study results showed that OS could be used for phosphorus removal in CWs. OS also allowed for reuse of a waste substance, making the overall system more environmentally friendly.</jats:p>",

Auto and coaggregation studies were performed by both qualitative (DAPI staining) and semi-quantitative (visual coaggregation) methods and biofilms produced by either pure or dual-cultures were quantified by crystal violet method. Results from the semi-quantitative visual aggregation method did not show any immediate auto or coaggregation, which was confirmed by the 4′,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining method. However, after 2 hours, Methylobacterium showed the highest autoaggregation of all four isolates. The Methylobacterium combinations showed highest coaggregation between dual species at extended period of times (72 hours). Biofilm formation by pure cultures was negligible in comparison to the quantity of biofilm produced by dual-species biofilms. The overall results show that coaggregation of bacteria isolated from drinking water was mediated by species-specific and time-dependent interactions with a synergistic type of biofilm formation. The results of this study are therefore a useful step in assisting the development of potential control strategies by identifying specific bacteria that promote aggregation or biofilm formation in drinking water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

The study involves a comprehensive literature review, followed by an analysis of survey data (based on a sample of 108 large manufacturing companies in Brazil), using cluster analysis, factor analysis and binary logistic regression. In this study, we not only investigate the major effects of supply chain objectives and decision areas as predictors of the logistics complexity of manufacturing but also investigate their second order interactions. Statistically significant relationships were found between logistics complexity-related contextual conditions and objectives and decision areas involving the supply chain. The managers of large companies who were surveyed considered different objectives and decision areas to be critical to the achievement of supply chain excellence when their companies had different levels of logistics complexity.</jats:p>"

However, these techniques efficiently remove arsenic from drinking water but require toxic and expensive chemicals and generate a large amount of exhaust sludge, which is not always regenerable. In this study a novel Fe-Mn-Si oxide material was prepared from environmentally friendly and low-cost materials through a co-precipitation process. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to study adsorption kinetics, adsorption capacity and the effect of temperature and pH on the adsorption of arsenic on Fe-Mn-Si oxide. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 9.62, 10.18, and 10.50 mg/g at 25, 35, and 45 °C, respectively. The results compare favorably with those obtained using other adsorbents. The used Fe-Mn-Si oxide could be regenerated using a NaOH solution; 73.4% of the adsorbed arsenic was desorbed by 0.2 N NaOH. Results from this study demonstrate the potential usability of Fe-Mn-Si oxide as a good arsenic-selective adsorbent.</jats:p>",

In this study, using a rural quadrangle in eastern Connecticut, we have developed a database system that is tied to a geographic information system that can be used to help manage and assess ground water conditions. The data in the database were derived using available water completion reports and water quality reports. Data query schemes were developed to screen for data entry and reporting errors. The information maintained in the database has been analyzed to derive products on well yield, well depth, and water elevation. These products are beneficial to town planners, local sanitarians, developers, homeowners, and drillers.

This method allows the user to compare flow patterns of a supply area and distinguish consistent from inconsistent changes in them. The so-called consistent changes are mainly caused by modifications in the characteristics of the population. The so-called inconsistent changes are generally related to new large volume customers, new types of water use and/or changes in leakage. Detailed knowledge of the supply area allows quantitative statements to be made about leakage. The method presented here is simple, not computationally intensive, independent of any model assumptions and easily implemented. The automated application of this method on long time series, called CFPD block analysis, is applied on data from three different areas. These applications illustrate, respectively, the identification and pinpointing (in time) of a small leak, the independent quantification of concurrent different types of changes with opposite signs in a supply pattern, and the difficulties of interpretation in cases in which climate has an overwhelming influence on demand patterns. In each case, discriminative quantification and visualization by the CFPD method result in features and trends in complicated time series becoming apparent at a glance.</jats:p>",

Such a detailed inventory provides a better understanding of water use and facilitates the evaluation of savings and targeting of individual end‐use retrofits associated with water conservation practices based on cost‐effectiveness.

Coagulant doses were from 0 to 9 mg/L of chitosan, and from 0 to 18 mg/L of aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), used as a comparative base. The THM formation was measured in filtered water after 48 hours of oxidation. The results showed that chitosan can provide effective removal of turbidity, apparent color, absorbance at 254 nm and chlorophyll a (M. aeruginosa cells), presenting better results than aluminum sulfate. No THM were detected after oxidation with chlorine, regardless of the coagulant used, suggesting that the use of chitosan as coagulant, for the studied waters, did not contribute to THM formation.</jats:p>",

Achieving water efficiency has, in the last decade, become an increasingly important part of policy programmes to ensure resource resilience and future supply. This study originated from a growing body of literature which purports differences in environmental behaviour in urban and rural residents. It presents initial findings from surveys conducted in two communities in Sussex, England. The objective of the study was to investigate and compare collective views on water efficiency by comparing users in different geographical contexts. The survey conducted in a rural and urban community started with the general assessment of basic household demographics and characteristics before investigating both water and energy use. Questions include factors that encourage or discourage water efficiency behaviour, views on information-led water efficiency interventions and limitations to the adoption of water efficient technologies. The paper concludes by discussing the differences and similarities found and the extent to which the findings are usable in water efficiency policies and processes, although it is worth highlighting that this study is the first set of a series of studies and is limited in its breadth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Engineering feedstock supply systems that deliver affordable, high-quality biomass remains a challenge for the emerging bioenergy industry. Cellulosic biomass is geographically distributed and has diverse physical and chemical properties. Because of this feedstock supply systems that deliver cellulosic biomass resources to biorefineries require integration of a broad set of engineered unit operations. These unit operations include harvest and collection, storage, preprocessing, and transportation processes. Design decisions for each feedstock supply system unit operation impact the engineering design and performance of the other system elements. These interdependencies are further complicated by spatial and temporal variances such as climate conditions and biomass characteristics. This paper develops an integrated model that couples a SQL-based data management engine and systems dynamics models to design and evaluate biomass feedstock supply systems. The integrated model, called the Biomass Logistics Model (BLM), includes a suite of databases that provide 1) engineering performance data for hundreds of equipment systems, 2) spatially explicit labor cost datasets, and 3) local tax and regulation data. The BLM analytic engine is built in the systems dynamics software package Powersim™. The BLM is designed to work with thermochemical and biochemical based biofuel conversion platforms and accommodates a range of cellulosic biomass types (i.e., herbaceous residues, short-rotation woody and herbaceous energy crops, woody residues, algae, etc.). The BLM simulates the flow of biomass through the entire supply chain, tracking changes in feedstock characteristics (i.e., moisture content, dry matter, ash content, and dry bulk density) as influenced by the various operations in the supply chain. By accounting for all of the equipment that comes into contact with biomass from the point of harvest to the throat of the conversion facility and the change in characteristics, the BLM evaluates economic performance of the engineered system, as well as determining energy consumption and green house gas performance of the design. This paper presents a BLM case study delivering corn stover to produce cellulosic ethanol. The case study utilizes the BLM to model the performance of several feedstock supply system designs. The case study also explores the impact of temporal variations in climate conditions to test the sensitivity of the engineering designs. Results from the case study show that under certain conditions corn stover can be delivered to the cellulosic ethanol biorefinery for $35/dry ton.</jats:p>",

Data collected throughout a 4-year operation period showed that artificial mixing by air injection may be adequate for the complete destratification of the reservoir. The air injection method had a low energy demand, estimated to be around 55 Wh/103m3/d. Upon air injection start-up, water column homogenization occurred relatively quickly, as deduced by the values of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration recorded at various sampling points within the reservoir. After the 1st week of operation, the oxygen concentration at 20 m depth increased from nearly zero to 2 mg/L, and doubled 1 week later, reaching equilibrium after 30 d of continuous operation.

Customers, suppliers, materials, and capital are all available around the globe. So it's natural that companies would go beyond national borders to get access to them. But in doing so, there is always the question of how to do it efficiently and effectively. This can lead to questions that can be complex to answer. For instance, should a company buy from intracountry vendors or from those in other countries? The company has to consider the issues of different currencies, different employment laws, different taxes, and different operating regulations. Each of these—and many other factors—may impact the decision from a financial perspective. Yet for many companies, this is a decision made by the supply chain. The question is, are they the right group to make this decision? © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The response characteristics and stability of one are key points for the performance of the whole system. However, it is complex to analyze the dynamic characteristics and control design. In this paper, the dynamic model of full-bridge DC-DC converter is presented, and transfer functions of the converter are derived by using state-space averaging method. And then the improved PI controller is designed. Finally, a laboratory prototype circuit with input voltage 220V, output voltage 600V is implemented and results are shown to confirm the validity of the designed switching device.</jats:p>"

There are several endeavours on developing robust water quality models for water distribution systems. In this paper, two variants of the EPANET 2 water quality model have been assessed to inform future research. The models are the multiple species extension EPANET-MSX and the pressure-dependent extension EPANET-PDX. Water quality analysis was conducted on a hypothetical network considering various operating pressure conditions. Different kinetic models were employed to simulate water quality. First order, limited first order and zero order models were used for predicting chlorine residual, disinfection by-products (DBPs) and water age respectively. Generally, EPANET-MSX and EPANET-PDX provided identical water quality results for normal operating conditions with adequate pressure but different results for pressure-deficient networks. Also, a parallel first order model with fast and slow reacting components was used for chlorine decay and DBPs using the EPANET-MSX model for a network operating under normal pressure conditions.</jats:p>",

The simulation result shows that the 24-pulse rectifier unit can reduce the harmonic current injected to the power system greatly, and abate the effects on the utility grid compared with the 12-pulse rectifier unit. The 24-pulse rectifier can smoothen the output voltage, reduce the harmonic content and improve the quality of DC power supply.

We are, however, increasingly facing major persistent threats, which despite being known for a few decades are still far from being solved – or are even still increasing. On the individual business level, this has four major implications: increased social pressures; possible reputational damage; exposure to resource wars; and front‐running competitors adjusting their value chain strategies. In supply chain governance this leads to four main types of strategies: do it yourself; join forces; the 5C‐approach and harmonising. The key question is: is this sufficient? Imagine 2022 – where will we be 10 years after Rio 2012? Is a rapid and structural transition to a circular and fair global economy possible, using this path of self‐governance for products traded in the global economic arena? This will strongly depend on four key factors: rapid growth of <jats:italic>consumer</jats:italic> demand; ‘<jats:italic>all‐inclusiveness</jats:italic>’ of these supply chain governance approaches; successful uplifting <jats:italic>production practices</jats:italic> of all suppliers; and addressing the <jats:italic>major issues</jats:italic> of unsustainability. Here we see various serious weaknesses, like the lack of third‐order evaluation and biases causing some of the more recent issues to be overlooked and less visible supply chains. The challenge is to develop a form of ‘meta’‐governance, including new approaches by governments, combining public policy strategies with the demonstrated virtues of self‐governance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Formations of haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloketones (HKs) from chlorination and chloramination from Jinlan Reservoir water under different treatment conditions were investigated in this study. Results showed that monochloramine rather than chlorine produced significant lower concentrations of HANs and HKs. In chlorination, the formation of HANs and HKs increased with the reaction time and chlorine dose. Addition of bromide significantly enhanced the total HANs yields but reduced total HKs formation due to the unavailability of bromine-containing HKs. HANs yields increased as the temperature was raised, yet HKs yields increased first and decreased later with temperature. As for the influence of pH, the HKs yields generally increased as the pH decreased, yet no obvious pattern was observed for HANs formation. On the other hand, in monochloramination, the yields of HANs and HKs generally increased with reaction time, temperature and the monochloramine dose. Higher HANs and HKs yields formed at low pH, and the addition of bromide significantly increased the total HANs yields. Range analysis further revealed that avoiding the bromide contamination, lowering the chlorine/monochloramine dose as well as reducing the reaction time were the effective ways to control HANs and HKs formation for drinking water sourced from Jinlan Reservoir water.</jats:p>",

In this regards, the reliability of supply is a major component. This study was conducted using the investigative research approach method; 5000 questionnaires which were randomly distributed round the township  of Ilorin and 4658 (93.16%) were returned. Among them, 2350 respondents said that they have their own wells dugged in their respective homes, 1100 respondents had their taps running at specific periods of the week, 750 individuals said that they have boreholes available, 308 people declared that they make use of the streams and rivers running around their areas while about 150 of the remaining buy water from the water vendors so they cannot tell the exact source of the water. It was discovered that majority of the residential areas in Ilorin do not depend on the tap water supply rather they depend on dugged wells and bore holes. Int. J. Agril. Res.

Extending this perspective across different tiers in the healthcare supply chain, we investigate <jats:italic>how</jats:italic> organizations in different tiers in the supply chain (i.e. hospitals, distributors and manufacturers) respond to institutional pressures when implementing IOS. How institutional dynamics unfold across multiple tiers of a supply chain is an uncharted area of research, and we take the theory‐building case study approach using data collected from ten organizations. Because organizations are embedded in their respective tiers, our within‐tier analyses are equivalent to cross‐organization analyses. In this regard, the cross‐case analyses occur at two different levels: at each tier level (i.e. across multiple hospitals, multiple distributors and multiple manufacturers) and across the supply chain (i.e. across all three tiers). The study shows <jats:italic>how</jats:italic> different institutional pressures such as coercive, mimetic, and normative manifest across the tiers. It also demonstrates <jats:italic>how</jats:italic> a differential mix of endogenous and institutional pressures lead to mixed organizational responses across the tiers. The propositions developed from the study enrich institutional theory arguments within the information systems and supply chain management disciplines. They highlight how the IOS implementation dynamics within and across different tiers in a supply chain result in heterogeneous rather than isomorphic consequences, thereby exposing the “iron cage” of institutionalization.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The proposed method strongly reduces the inspection time that is typically required by traditional leak detection methods. In fact, it can successfully inspect pipes that are hundreds of meters long. In this work, two different configurations of the system are described: one can be used for detecting leaks in ‘already-installed’ metal pipes; whereas the other is suitable to be employed for detecting leaks in ‘newly-installed’ pipes made of any material. The performance of both these system configurations was assessed through an extensive, on-site experimental campaign, carried out with the collaboration of one of the largest European water operators, Acquedotto Pugliese S.p.A. (AQP). Representative results, related to both configurations, of three experimental cases (ECs) are reported and commented on.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The occurrence of discoloured water at the tap is one of the most frequent reasons for customers to complain. Water discolouration arises from the re-suspension of loose deposits (LD) that accumulate in drinking water pipes, due to velocity increase. Because of its typical brownish/reddish colour, discoloured water is traditionally perceived as a consequence of cast-iron pipe corrosion, even in networks devoid of cast-iron pipes. Current approaches for LD sampling imply the use of high flow velocities within the range of those used for pipe self-cleaning (0.40 m/s) and/or pipe cleaning (1.50 m/s). Although useful for quantitative identification of critical zones and diagnosis of LD accumulation, the application of such high-velocities as routine methodologies for LD sampling may be difficult to perform on the field and provide samples with materials other than discolouration causing LD. In this study, sampling velocities from 0.02 to 0.52 m/s yielded relatively large samples (up to 2 g dry weight), thus allowing for extensive qualitative LD analysis and testing. Sample representativeness was analysed through the characterisation of LD key-constituents total iron (Fet) and volatile solids (VS). Turbidity decay trends showed the flocculent behaviour of discolouration causing LD.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The analysis of water distribution networks has to take into account the variability of users' water demand and the variability of network boundary conditions. In complex systems, e.g. those characterized by the presence of local private tanks and intermittent distribution, this variability suggests the use of dynamic models that are able to evaluate the rapid variability of pressures and flows in the network. The dynamic behavior of the network also affects the performance of valves that are used for controlling the network. Pressure reduction valves (PRVs) are used for controlling pressure and reducing leakages. Highly variable demands can produce significant fluctuation of the PRV set point, causing related transient phenomena that propagate through the network and may result in water quality problems, unequal distribution of resources among users, and premature wear of the pipe infrastructure. A model was developed in previous studies and an additional module for pressure control was implemented able to analyze PRVs in a fully dynamic numerical framework. The model was demonstrated to be robust and reliable in the implementation of pressure management areas in the network. The model was applied to a district of the Palermo network (Italy). The district was monitored and pressure as well as flow data were available for model calibration.</jats:p>",

It was shown that the combination of the treatment processes considered efficiently removed the dissolved organic matter, including its specific fractions. Most of the dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON), biodegradable DOC and DON, as well as assimilable organic carbon were removed by coagulation/sedimentation. However, the coagulation process was not likely to be optimised for the removal of all molecular weight compounds. The breakdown of high molecular weight compounds into others of low molecular weight, as well as the production of biodegradable organic matter during ozonation, proved to enhance their removal efficiency by subsequent biological activated carbon filtration. The specific trihalomethane formation potential decreased during treatment, indicating a decrease in reactivity of DOC with chlorine across the treatment train. Fractionation experiments demonstrated that high and medium molecular weight organics were likely to be the main precursors for the formation of trihalomethanes. However, other disinfection by-products (such as haloacetic acids) should also be controlled, as the chlorine demand pattern did not necessarily follow that of trihalomethane formation.</jats:p>",

There is, however, considerable uncertainty over the future supply of unpaid care for older people by their adult children. The future of family care is particularly important in countries planning to reform their long-term care systems, as is the case in England. This article makes new projections of the supply of intense unpaid care for parents aged 65 and over in England to 2032, and compares these projections with existing projections of demand for unpaid care by older people with disabilities from their children. The results show that the supply of unpaid care to older people with disabilities by their adult children in England is unlikely to keep pace with demand in future. By 2032, there is projected to be a shortfall of 160,000 care-givers in England. Demand for unpaid care will begin to exceed supply by 2017 and the unpaid ‘care gap’ will grow rapidly from then onwards. The article concludes by examining how far this unpaid ‘care gap’ is likely to be met by other sources of unpaid care or by developments in new technology and examines the implications of the findings for long-term care policy.</jats:p>",

Besides, the design greatly reduces the amount of components which is especially appropriate for the installation in a constriction space. To give a test for the interface circuit, the microcontroller ATmega16 is used to read the 12-bit parallel angle position data of resolver. The test result shows that the interface circuit can not only work well but also obtain an accuracy of angle position within 0.1°.</jats:p>"

When each district is supplied by its only water source the districts can be defined as i-DMAs (isolated District Meter Areas) because they are completely cut off from the rest of the water network. This isolation of the i-DMAs may decrease hydraulic performance of the water system reducing its topologic (network loops) and hydraulic (diameter sections) redundancy. Traditionally the design of WNS is carried out by empirical or simulation assisted trial-and-error approaches that are difficult to apply to large water distribution systems. In this paper an original methodology for automatic sectorization of water networks is proposed. The methodology is based on Shortest Path techniques that allow defining a tree graph of the network with dissipated power used as weight of the pipes (or links). Once the districts are found, a swapping phase follows which is achieved by using a genetic algorithm (GA) that allows refining the choice of nodes that belong to each district. The objective function of the GA is based on network mean pressure. The methodology was tested, using different performance indices, on two real water supply systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Supply chain orientation (SCO), or the implementation of a supply chain management philosophy, consists of two distinct, yet interdependent elements, namely strategic SCO and structural SCO. Strategic SCO involves integrating an SCM philosophy into the firm's strategy development, while structural SCO encompasses operational‐level behaviors and actions that reflect such a philosophy. This study extends the research on SCO by developing hypotheses on the contingent effects of strategic SCO and structural SCO on a firm's operational and customer‐focused performance. Drawing on the strategy‐structure‐performance framework, the study proposes that strategic SCO and structural SCO positively affect different dimensions of performance and that structural SCO plays a mediating role in the relationship between strategic SCO and performance. These relationships are tested using primary survey data and archival data from 183 manufacturers in the Midwestern US. Results confirm that strategic SCO is associated with both operational performance and customer‐focused performance, but structural SCO is only related to operational performance. Structural SCO acts as a mediator in linking strategic SCO with operational performance and customer‐focused performance and mediation effects are strengthened at higher levels of environmental dynamism.</jats:p>",

Because most patients are asymptomatic, this disease is generally diagnosed incidentally during radiologic examination. Aneurysm rupture develops in 14% to 80% of cases, depending on the aneurysmatic segment's diameter and location, as well as other etiologic factors. Mortality rates associated with rupture range between 20% and 70%. Thus, early diagnosis and timely initiation of medical interventions are critical to improve survival rates. Here, we present a male patient, age 69 years, with a hepatic artery aneurysm that was detected incidentally. The 3-cm aneurysm was detected on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and extended from the common hepatic artery to the hepatic trifurcation. A laparotomy was performed using a right subcostal incision. After dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament, the common, right, and left hepatic arteries, as well as the gastroduodenal artery, were suspended separately. Then, the aneurysmatic hepatic artery segment was resected, and the gastroduodenal artery stump was ligated. An end-to-end anastomosis was formed between the left and common hepatic arteries, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis formed between the right hepatic artery and splenic artery using a splenic artery transposition graft. Postoperative follow-up examinations showed that both hepatic arterial circulations were good, and no splenic infraction had developed.</jats:p>",

Parameters determined included; pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) using both in-situ and standard laboratory procedures. Heavy metal contents such as nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg) were also determined using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP MS). Using the water quality index (WQI) tool, all the parameters indicated considerable degrees of pollution with an average classification number of 75.63 in Class III which indicated that the BMR water was slightly polluted. DO ranged between 2.06 and 12.5 mg/L with a mean value of 5.96 mg/L while BOD ranged between 3.08 and 6.32 mg/L with a mean value of 4.6 mg/L, among many other parameters analyzed. Also, the presence of heavy metals was recorded, but did not appear to be much of a threat with the exception of Fe. Most of the pollutants identified were mainly from infrastructural development and agricultural activities. For domestic uses, cleaner water would be required and this would need substantial investment in treatment, while for recreational, livestock and crop irrigation purposes, the water quality would be acceptable at the present level.</jats:p>",

Literature review have suggested the performance of KM adoption in SC may be affected by various influencing factors but it is always difficult for the practitioners to improve all aspects at the same time. The aim of this study is to identify Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of KM adoption in SC. This study presents a favourable method combining fuzzy set theory and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to segment the critical factors for successful KM adoption in SC. The empirical case study analysis of an Indian hydraulic valve manufacturing organisation is conducted to illustrate the use of the proposed framework for identifying the CSFs of KM adoption in SC. According to the results of the empirical study, six CSFs of KM adoption in SC are identified out of 25 influencing factors, these are top management support, communication and collaboration techniques, employee involvement, employee training and education, communication among the SC members and trustworthy teamwork to exchange knowledge within SC which will help to improve effectiveness and efficiency of KM adoption in SC. The decision makers can apply a phased implementation of these CSFs to ensure the effective KM adoption in SC under the constraints of available resources. This proposed method provides a more accurate, effective and systematic decision support tool for identifying CSFs of KM adoption in SC. </jats:p>",

To meet human survival needs within the refuge chamber, this paper made experiments on potassium superoxide oxygen production performance factors, including humidity test, carbon dioxide concentrations test, surface spray wet test and so on. Through tests the amount and the rate of oxygen production, and the removal efficiency of carbon dioxide of potassium superoxide in different situations are obtained. And through a human survival experiment, the potassium superoxide oxygen board can satisfy the human body needs is validated.

Recent domestic and international market demand for beef and leather that are not linked to deforestation led the largest Brazilian meatpackers to adopt policies to reject supplies from ranches with recent deforestation. However, increased and sustained enforcement of such policies will be needed to reduce deforestation in these supply chains over the long-term. We sought to map the Brazilian cattle product supply chain to determine the proportion of the market, and of cattle production, that may be susceptible to market demands for deforestation-free supplies. Beef, leather and live animal exports are the most valuable products from the cattle industry, with export values tripling between 2001 and 2009, and with China, Russia and the U.S. as the largest importing countries. The markets for dairy and tallow (beef fat) are predominantly domestic. We find that around 40% of beef and 85% of leather production serve markets that have expressed concerns over environmental impacts of their purchases, while the clandestine market, which is not susceptible to market environmental demands, is estimated to comprise about one quarter of the Brazilian cattle slaughter. Demand for Brazilian cattle products is growing, and while market-driven efforts to reduce deforestation linked to legal slaughter have shown success, improved governance and other measures will be needed to tackle the environmental impacts of the clandestine industry. </jats:p>",

Resonant converters are preferred t utilize soft switching techniques such as zero current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching (ZVS). An attempt has been made to overcome the disadvantages in 2nd and 3rd resonant converter topologies; hence a fourth order resonant topology is used in this paper for CCPS application. In this paper a novel fourth order LCLC based resonant converter has been explored and mathematical analysis carried out to calculate load independent constant current. This topology provides load independent constant current at switching frequency (fs) equal to resonant frequency (fr). By changing switching condition (on time and dead time) this topology has both soft switching techniques such as ZCS and ZVS for better switching action to improve the converter efficiency. This novel technique has special features such as low peak current through switches, DC blocking for transformer, utilizing transformer leakage inductance as resonant component. A prototype has been developed and tested successfully to charge a 100 μF capacitor to 200 V.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>If increased sediment supply to a river channel exceeds its transport capacity, deposition necessarily occurs as the bed adjusts to accommodate the increased supply. Both the mean and spatial patterns in bed elevation and grain size may change and an ability to understand their relative importance is needed to predict bed response. We report on an experiment in a field‐scale flume in which sediment supply is increased to a gravel bed with alternate bars. Sediment was recirculated in the experiments, but augmented in two steps, after which the bed was allowed to reach a new steady state. The transport rate at the end of the experiment was three times larger than at the start. High‐resolution sediment flux and topographic measurements, grain size derived from photographs, and hydrodynamic modeling allow us to document the topographic and textural response of the bed to increased sediment supply. The spatial patterns of bed topography and texture were forced by the flume setup and the initial and final steady states included long stationary alternate bars with associated grain size sorting. The transient bed contained several scales of shorter wavelength migrating bedforms superimposed on, and temporarily replacing the stationary alternate bars. Bed topography and textural patterns adjusted to increased sediment supply over different timescales. Bed slope and mean stress increased directly with sediment supply rate to produce a new transport steady state in a time about 2.5 times the minimum needed to deposit the required sediment wedge, indicating a trap efficiency of about 40% for the aggrading wedge. Adjustments in local topography and sorting, primarily in the form of smaller, migrating bars, continued for a period approximately equal to that required to initially reach transport steady state.

This study discusses the effects of the crises on lower‐level supply chain members in the context of the textile and garment industry in emerging markets. The fieldwork for this research and the integration of new United Nations data provide evidence for the vulnerability of those supply chain members that provide only commoditized basic services that do not depend on talent skills or resource availability. Most of these, less sophisticated supply chain members are located in non‐BRIC emerging economies, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and so on. We present a framework that is transferable across industries. The framework is useful for managers when evaluating the feasibility and reliability of different suppliers from emerging and developing countries in particular. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Each WDS efficiency was annually assessed, although in particular cases, shorter time periods (6 and 4 months) were applied depending upon local conditions, data availability, etc. The main common characteristic found was that some data needed to perform water balance calculations were missing (e.g. regarding the level of unbilled authorized use, unauthorized use, and customer meter inaccuracies). Moreover, a fixed-charge billing policy was adopted by the local utilities in all six cases, underestimating the impact of the high non-revenue water (NRW) values. This policy results in misleading, low values of unrecoverable revenues, although water losses remain high. Thus, water utilities are not motivated to develop NRW reduction strategies. Nevertheless, the analysis revealed that real losses represent the main NRW component in all case studies, thus respective reduction strategies should focus on them. Wherever WDS monitoring, simulation and leakage reduction measures were established, lower NRW values occur.</jats:p>",

To develop this WSP, we used an adapted version of the methodology proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The new method included a preliminary weighting procedure to assess the relative importance of different parts of the system, and a more systematic estimation of the magnitude of control measures. These modifications allowed the definition of a variety of risk reduction strategies. The risk assessment step was performed during participatory workshops with members of the local water company. The Initial Risk for the entire system was 30.2%, with variations among processes, subprocesses and components. More than 60% of the hazardous situations identified require control measures to reduce the risk below an acceptable threshold. If all control measures were successfully implemented, the Final Risk could be lowered to 17.7%. Methodological changes introduced allowed a more detailed analysis of the risks and can be an important improvement of the assessment procedure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With continued emphasis on sustainability-driven design, reverse logistics is emerging as a vital competitive supply chain strategy for many of the global high-tech manufacturing firms. Various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and multi-product manufacturing firms are enhancing their reverse logistics strategies in order to establish an optimal closed-loop supply chain through which they can introduce refurbished variants of their products back into the market. While a refurbished product strategy helps to mitigate environmental impact challenges as well as provide additional economic benefits, it is limited to an existing product market, possibly a subset of the existing market, and fails to commercialize/target new markets. In addition to refurbishing, the alternatives available for utilizing End-Of-Life (EOL) products are currently restricted to recycling and permanent disposal. In this work, the authors propose employing a new EOL option called “resynthesis” that utilizes existing waste from EOL products in a novel way. This is achieved through the synthesis of assemblies/subassemblies across multiple domains. The “newly” synthesized product can then be incorporated into the dynamics of a closed-loop supply chain. The proposed methodology enables OEMs to not only offer refurbished products as part of their reverse logistics strategy, but also provide them with resynthesized product concepts that can be used to expand to new/emerging markets. The proposed methodology provides a general framework that includes OEMs (manufacturers of the original product), retailers (distributors of the original product and collectors of the EOL products) and third-party firms (managers of the EOL products) as part of a closed-loop supply chain strategy. The proposed methodology is compared with the existing methodologies in the literature wherein a third-party supplies the OEM only with refurbished products and supplies products unsuitable for refurbishing to another firm(s) for recycling/disposal. A case study involving a multi-product electronics manufacturer is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.</jats:p>",

We have identified that the arterial blood supply to the last pair of branchial arches, which carries the teeth, issues from the hypobranchial artery. Surprisingly, the arteries supplying the pharyngeal jaws show an asymmetric branching pattern that is modified over ontogeny. Moreover, the blood vessel pattern that serves each jaw can best be described as a sinusoidal cavity encircling the bases of both the functional and replacement teeth. Capillaries branching from this sinusoidal cavity enter the pulp and constitute the intrinsic blood supply to the attached teeth. The role of these blood vessels during tooth development (whether instructive or nutritive) remains to be determined and requires further study. However, we have provided a firm morphological basis that will aid in the interpretation of experiments addressing this question.</jats:p>",

Those due to water meter under-registration were evaluated by means of a mathematical model able to analyse the complexity of intermittent supply systems with private tanks. This supply scheme is very common in the Mediterranean area where unexpected water shortage often happens and intermittent water supply is a common practice. In order to analyse such complex systems, a demand model, reproducing the effect of private tanks, and an apparent losses module were developed and coupled with an hydraulic network model based on the Global Gradient Algorithm (GGA). In distribution networks pressure reduction valves (PRVs) are often used by water utilities to control the pressure and reduce background losses. These practices could influence the performance of water meters. For this reason, a PRV model was implemented and integrated with the demand and the hydraulic network models to better estimate the effect of pressure management on real and apparent losses. The comprehensive model was applied to a real case study. The proposed modelling approach was used to identify regions of the network with high apparent losses. Furthermore, the model may be used to predict the results of a water meter replacement plan and of the installation of devices that could affect apparent losses.</jats:p>",

The first AOC bioassay was developed in 1982 and is based on growth of two bacterial strains (Pseudomonas fluorescens P17 and Spirillum spp. NOX) in drinking water relative to their growth on acetate. Much research was subsequently conducted to modify, simplify and increase the speed of the assay which resulted in a number of alternative AOC assays. Application of these assays raises legitimate questions about the comparison of AOC data from different studies. In the present study, a round-robin test was performed to evaluate the correlation between three established AOC methods. A total of 14 water samples, covering a wide range of AOC concentrations, were analyzed with the original ‘van der Kooij’ method, the ‘Werner &amp; Hambsch’ method and ‘Eawag’ method. Good correlations were found between AOC concentrations measured with the various methods. The data suggest an acceptable compatibility between different AOC methods, although deviations between the methods call for careful interpretation and reporting of AOC data.</jats:p>",

Grasses dominate inputs into open-land streams, whereas tree litter is predominant in forested streams. We set out to elucidate whether the activity and structure of microbial communities on decomposing leaves are determined by litter quality (i.e., grass or tree leaves colonized) or whether changes during riparian succession affecting litter standing stocks on the stream bed play an overriding role. We used 15 outdoor experimental streams to simulate changes in litter supplies reflecting five stages of riparian succession: (i) a biofilm stage with no litter, (ii) an open-land stage characterized by grass litter inputs, (iii) a transitional stage with a mix of grass and tree litter, (iv) an early forested stage with tree litter, and (v) an advanced forested stage with 2.5 times the amount of tree litter. Microbial activities on tree (\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Betula pendula</jats:named-content>\n            ) and grass (\n            <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Calamagrostis epigejos</jats:named-content>\n            ) litter were unaffected by either the quantity or type of litter supplied to the experimental streams (i.e., litter standing stock) but differed between the two litter types. This was in stark contrast with bacterial and fungal community structure, which markedly differed on grass and tree litter and, to a lesser extent, also among streams receiving different litter inputs. These patterns reveal distinct responses of microbial community structure and activity to the bulk litter available in streams but consistent responses to the litter type colonized.\n          </jats:p>",

The concentrations of the components of the culture medium which were determined by a 23 full factorial design evaluated the interactions and effects of the independent variables of the sucrose, asparagine and corn steep liquor in relation to carbon and nitrogen sources, on the production of chitosan regarding biomass. The best results were observed at the central point [asparagine 0.025%, sucrose 0.15% and 0.45% of corn steep liquor, ratio C:N=2:6], and produced maximum yields of 16.95 g/L biomass and  2.14 g/L chitosan, after 96 h of submerged fermentation. However, the lowest level of sucrose, asparagine and corn steep liquor produced a low amount of biomass (10.83 g/L) and chitosan (0.60g/L). The infrared spectrum absorption of the chitosan produced by  C. elegans showed bands regarding OH-axial stretching between 3406 and 3432 cm−1, superimposed on the NH stretching band with axial deformation of the amide C=O group at about 1639 cm−1, NH angular deformation at approximately 1560 cm−1; axial deformation of amide-CN at around 1421 cm−1, symmetrical angular deformation in CH3 at 1379 cm−1, -CN axial deformation of amino groups from 1125 to 1250 cm−1 and polysaccharide structure bands in the range of between 890–1150 cm−1. The crystallinity index of chitosan was 60.92%, and its degree of deacetylation was 75.25%. A low percentage of a supply of sucrose and asparagine with corn steep liquor offered higher yields of biomass and chitosan production at low cost.</jats:p>"

The distribution of Nd concentrations in open ocean surface waters (0–100 m) is generally assumed to be controlled by lateral mixing of Nd from coastal surface currents and by removal through reversible particle scavenging. However, using <jats:sup>228</jats:sup>Ra activity as an indicator of coastal water mass influence, surface water Nd concentration data available on key oceanic transects as a whole do not support the above scenario. From a global compilation of available data, we find that more stratified regions are generally associated with low surface Nd concentrations. This implies that upper ocean vertical supply may be an as yet neglected primary factor in determining the basin‐scale variations of surface water Nd concentrations. Similar to the mechanism of nutrients supply, it is likely that stratification inhibits vertical supply of Nd from the subsurface thermocline waters and thus the magnitude of Nd flux to the surface layer. Consistently, the estimated required input flux of Nd to the surface layer to maintain the observed concentrations could be nearly two orders of magnitudes larger than riverine/dust flux, and also larger than the model‐based estimation on shelf‐derived coastal flux. In addition, preliminary results from modeling experiments reveal that the input from shallow boundary sources, riverine input, and release from dust are actually not the primary factors controlling Nd concentrations most notably in the Pacific and Southern Ocean surface waters.</jats:p>",

Recent studies show that paleoenvironmental (allogenic) signals preserved in stratigraphy may be contaminated by internally generated (autogenic) sedimentation patterns; however, it is unclear how the magnitude of autogenic dynamics is related to allogenic forcings. Utilizing statistical methods, we quantify basin‐filling trends in three laboratory experiments where input water and sediment flux were varied. We use the compensation index and compensation time scale to estimate the strength of compensation, defined here as the tendency to fill topographic lows faster than would result from random deposit stacking, and to estimate the time scales over which autogenic processes operate. In the experiments, topography of channelized deltas formed by noncohesive sediment was monitored in a basin experiencing temporally and spatially uniform relative subsidence. Each experiment resulted in construction of a stratigraphic package in excess of 25 channel depths thick. We find that compensation strength in the experiments is not influenced by absolute magnitudes of water and sediment flux but does increase as a function of the ratio of water to sediment flux. A compensation time scale, defined as the maximum depth of a system's channels divided by the long‐term deposition rate, accurately defines the maximum time scale at which autogenic dynamics occur in all experiments. When applied to field‐scale systems, we predict that autogenic dynamics occur out to time scales between 5 and 150 kyr.</jats:p>",

Here we present a promising novel approach for a curative strategy that may be accessible for all insulin-dependent diabetes patients. We designed a subcutaneous implantable bioartificial pancreas (BAP)—the “β-Air”—that is able to overcome critical challenges in current clinical islet transplantation protocols: adequate oxygen supply to the graft and protection of donor islets against the host immune system. The system consists of islets of Langerhans immobilized in an alginate hydrogel, a gas chamber, a gas permeable membrane, an external membrane, and a mechanical support. The minimally invasive implantable device, refueled with oxygen via subdermally implanted access ports, completely normalized diabetic indicators of glycemic control (blood glucose intravenous glucose tolerance test and HbA1c) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for periods up to 6 months. The functionality of the device was dependent on oxygen supply to the device as the grafts failed when oxygen supply was ceased. In addition, we showed that the device is immunoprotective as it allowed for survival of not only isografts but also of allografts. Histological examination of the explanted devices demonstrated morphologically and functionally intact islets; the surrounding tissue was without signs of inflammation and showed visual evidence of vasculature at the site of implantation. Further increase in islets loading density will justify the translation of the system to clinical trials, opening up the potential for a novel approach in diabetes therapy. </jats:p>",
