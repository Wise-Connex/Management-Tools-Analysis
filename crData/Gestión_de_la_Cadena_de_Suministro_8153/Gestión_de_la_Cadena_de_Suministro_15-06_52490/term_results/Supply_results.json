Information sharing is thus increased with key dyadic partners representing, for example, unique offerings and high market shares as percentage of total expenditure/sales.

Further, the paper contributes to the existing literature on barriers of information sharing in supply chains by identifying barriers specific to multi-tier information sharing. “Meta-information” (i.e. information about the shared information) is needed to overcome some of the barriers of sharing information in cases of weak, pooled interdependencies in the supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Similar to previous empirical research, this exploratory study indicates that companies, in general, refrain from sharing information beyond dyadic ties. Supply chain managers would instead mostly focus on stronger, reciprocal interdependencies and emphasise dyadic information sharing. To further guide managers, a demand profiling framework considering market share and demand uncertainty is presented. It may be interesting to engage in multi-tier information sharing in particular cases where strong interdependence exists between three or more partners.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– This study contributes to existing research on information sharing in supply chains by empirically studying information sharing in an extended supply chain, applying interdependence theory as its analytical framework and unearthing several barriers that are specific to multi-tier information sharing.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Since the implementation of its first version of the WSP, EPAL has been working on the optimization of its methodology regarding identification and evaluation of hazards/hazardous events and risk assessment. The main objective of this optimization is the prioritization of capital investments and implementation of mitigation actions, within the integrated risk-based management of the company. For this purpose, the initial risk assessment matrixes were optimized with the integration of new specific multicriteria tools to evaluate risks associated with different types of operational assets. The final risk assessment took into account the strategic importance of each individual asset within EPAL's supply system. The new risk assessment methodologies have helped decision-making and prioritization of capital investments and also allowed EPAL to better pinpoint the critical issues to address in its supply system.</jats:p>",

In addition to allowing consumers to evaluate the best products from an energy point of view, it sets targets to make the products increasingly more efficient. In this context, buildings that can currently obtain the energy efficiency label are also included, demonstrating to customers the concern for sustainability. However, there are still many products and systems that can be labeled but for which legislation has not yet been enacted, including water supply systems. Owing to the different characteristics of the systems and the different possibilities for efficiency improvement, it is necessary to develop indicators that actually represent the reality of each system and make it possible to compare them. Thus, this study proposes the use of certain indicators for classification of the systems. A classification by sector benchmarking is also proposed in Brazil, and an example is presented for the classification of Brazilian systems based on four indicators obtained by the National Sanitation Information System.</jats:p>",

The paper first looks into the history and organization of the Red Cross, analyzing in more detail the deployment of the Spanish Red Cross in the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Five clues to the performance of the Red Cross are identified: a global, multi-level organization; modularity; standardization; knowledge management; and flexible funding mechanisms. These findings are then put into the framework of humanitarian logistics. Finally, the possible extension of the findings to business operations is discussed.DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n1p1-15 URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n1p1-15</jats:p>"

Recognizing the theme as incipient in Brazil, there are few published studies, mainly in relation to journals, with a total of 44 papers focused specifically on the topic. The literature review indicates that the understanding of the topic includes recurrent discussions with environmental or economic dimensions. However, a comprehensive definition of the concept, i.e., including social issues, is lacking. Therefore, this creates a research gap and an opportunity for Brazilian researchers to contribute to the gradually developing field.DOI: 12660/joscmv8n1p29-45URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n1p29-45</jats:p>"

Observations over time, documents such as contracts, joint agreements, meeting agendas and minutes, personal conversations, and in-depth interviews were mainly used, with quantitative measurement of operational performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The complete solution to eliminate waste and improve the existing system is provided, as well as the ordering process solution in the form of service level models. The results of the study proved supply management coordination to be a pioneering approach in reducing inventory, reducing the safety stock at the buyer’s facility, improving the forecasts, lowering the product delivery lead-times, and establishing an information system throughout the three tiers of the supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The paper draws upon real-life data from a three echelon supply chain in the manufacturing industry.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One of the most challenging tasks of water supply utilities is planning the timing and quantity of new water supply sources as demand for water consumption grows. Many water supply utilities target on meeting 100% of their customers' needs based on scenario‐based deterministic demand projections numbers even though there are uncertainties in both supply and demand values. This may result in under or overly conservative approach in assessing future needs. In this article, a level‐of‐service concept is introduced to capture a utility's willingness to accept a given level of risk, plan for it, and invoke a management strategy during extreme events than build a facility to accommodate those in planning for new water supply sources. Accounting for uncertainties in both supply and demand help quantify reliability by achieving a prescribed level of service. The major benefit of such an approach for planning future water supply is that it allows policy makers to evaluate the use of adaptive water management strategies and develop supply in an incremental fashion as demand warrants it. For example, if a given level of service cannot be reliably met with the existing system at a future time <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>, an incremental water supply project would come online to bring the required reliability level up but no more.</jats:p>",

In addition to the freedom of design such as elimination of design constraints, material saving, and free complexity, AM offers other potential benefits to the manufacturing industry as well. One of the most immediate potentials of AM is the possibility of more efficient logistics. This paper aims at describing the characteristics and requirement of a Supply Chain (SC) as well as the changes AM will bring into the current structure of supply chain. Insights are provided on the transformative effects of AM on traditional businesses, and how these changes impact the configuration of a supply chain. The potential for using simulation tools to evaluate AM supply chain have been discussed. Further, two examples of Agent Based Simulation (ABS) and System Dynamics (SD) have been provided to show the application of simulation models. The ABS results show the possibility of lead time reduction in AM based supply chain. In addition, the SD model illustrates the potential for less ‘pipeline’ effect in AM compared to traditional supply chain.</jats:p>",

In this study, the authors examined whether water-saving equipment could solve these problems. This paper focused on toilet bowls that consumed a large amount of water, and on showers for which heat consumption was high. In Vietnam, the main heat source for showers is the electric water heater, typically having a power consumption of 2500–4500 W. Although the current diffusion rate of such water heaters is just 13%, their use will spread widely in the future. These heaters have already placed a peak load on electricity consumption in winter when a large amount of energy is consumed for heating water, and they will become a significant factor in blackout risks as their use becomes commonplace nationwide. It is clear that the introduction of water-saving showers will allow not only a more efficient use of water resources, but will also mitigate against the risk of blackouts.</jats:p>"

This FE modeling method allows a supply power prediction of the oil coolant for precision ball screw unit. Then based on predictions, influencing tendencies from oil cooling strategy (oil supply temperature and volume flow rate) onto the time-varying supply powers of oil coolant are investigated. The research results demonstrate that: Firstly, the supply power of oil coolant has the increasing tendency with the time increase. Besides, the steady scale of oil supply power is in proportion to the oil supply volume flow rate, and in inverse proportion to the oil supply temperature. Finally, the maximum steady supply cooling power brings the guidance for the capacity selection of recirculation cooler for the precision ball screw unit.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, expansion of unconventional oil and gas production has prompted significant interest in potential impacts on drinking water resources. In many cases, water quality investigations rely on access to landowner water wells to develop baseline data prior to drilling; respond to spills, complaints, or incidents; or evaluate potential impacts due to drilling, completion, hydraulic fracturing, water management, or well operation. However, differences in water well construction, operation, maintenance, and wellhead protection practices can complicate sampling efforts and introduce artifacts that might confound interpretation of results and definition of baseline conditions. The frequency of sampling and the types of analyses also vary from site to site, ranging from basic field parameters such as conductivity, pH, and water level to comprehensive analyses of organics, inorganics, radionuclides, gases, stable isotopes, and microorganisms. Regulatory agencies may also specify required analytical parameters and monitoring frequency. This paper highlights some of the challenges associated with deriving baseline data from different types of wells and provides preliminary data on the use of chemical fingerprinting to differentiate sources of waterborne contaminants.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately children are facing hindrance either in economic term or in social term that forced them into labor work. Getting better idea of the real determinants of child labor can only provide the better policy options to tackle this menace. The major objective of the study is to highlight the supply-side determinants of child-labor in case of Punjab, Pakistan. Using data of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2007-08 for Punjab, the study examined the supply side determinants of child labor in Punjab. A binary logistic model was used for empirical analysis. Major findings of the study unveiled that although, low family income, family size, and physical access to the institutions are pushing children to child labor but more significantly mother’s education and household head’s education are the major factors that force parents to put their children to work. In line with aforementioned findings, some suitable policy implications were given for government to counter this substantial barrier to the nation’s growth.</jats:p>"

The aim was to investigate the presence of emerging contaminants which are not currently routinely monitored or regulated as part of the European Communities Drinking Water Regulations SI 278 of 2007 but are known or anticipated to occur in drinking water supplies. A monthly sampling and analysis programme was carried out to examine the presence of seven groups of potential emerging contaminants in two Irish drinking water supplies. The seven groups selected were: herbicides, molluscides, endocrine disrupters, perfluorinated chemicals, disinfection by-products, personal care products, and heavy metals. The investigation showed that the majority of the seven selected groups of contaminants were not detected at either drinking water site. Results from the first site (water treatment plant (WTP) 1) showed elevated levels of musk xylenes, a member of the personal care products suite of tests. The specific compound detected was galaxolide, a polycyclic musk found in perfumes, soaps, cosmetics and detergents. Results from the second site (WTP 2) showed elevated levels of oestrone, a member of endocrine disrupter steroid suite of tests. Oestrone is one of three types of oestrogen made by the body and is produced by the ovaries as well as by adipose tissue and the adrenal glands. Results from both sites showed that of the seven groups of contaminants chosen for examination most were not detected. The musk xylene compound galaxolide was detected on one occasion at a level just above the guideline limit and oestrone a component of the endocrine disrupting chemicals steroid suite of tests was found on two occasions throughout the study.</jats:p>",

It looks at the technical and strategic role of logistics, and the physical obstacles that had to be overcome in Vietnam. The US had highly sophisticated war machinery that was deployed in a country that lacked not only the transportation infrastructure (roads, ports, airports) but also had extreme terrain and climate conditions. On the other hand the Vietnamese had a well-oiled supply chain which often was carried on bicycles and literally on the backs of humans not only along the Ho Chi Minh Trail but throughout the north and south of Vietnam. On the US side helicopters played an important transportation role substituting land transport with air transport. The war effort escalated so rapidly that there was literally no time for logistics advancement operations and prepositioning of assets which resulted in a parallel run of war fighting and logistics operations. Naval operations had to provide their own landing crafts due to the lack of deep seaports with adequate lifting equipment. At the same time airlifts required runways and aircontrol facilities which needed to be provided by the US. Even the US Department of Defense (DOD) food supply chain was supported from abroad while local war fighters could live off the land. The Vietnam War logistics effort reached over to neighboring countries, and Thailand played an important role with its naval and airbases close to Sattahip, U-Tapao and northern parts of Thailand. There are valuable lessons to be learned for both military logistics as well as private sector supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chloramine has often been used as a chlorine alternative for trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) control. However, nitrogenous disinfection byproduct (N-DBP) formation and nitrification in distribution have always been major concerns in chloramination practices. On Kinmen Island, the high organic nitrogen content in raw water may increase the nitrogenous DBP formation. Simulated distribution system tests were conducted to explore the DBP formation kinetics in the distribution system. Lower haloacetonitrile (HAN4) formation (0.26 μg L−1) with chloramination than with chlorination (10.48 μg L−1) was observed from the 24 hours of reaction time. The nitrogen sources contributing to the dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) formation kinetics were explored with 15N-chloramination. The results showed that nitrogen sourced from organic nitrogen was more dominant in DCAN formation with low chloramine dosage. This suggests that chloramine contributes to less DCAN formation in practice, especially for short distribution systems. In summary, the results provide evidence that simultaneous post-chloramination and pre-chlorination would be a feasible disinfection strategy applied to control regulated THM and HAA formation on Kinmen Island.</jats:p>",

It has great environmental compatibility as compared to conventional disinfection methods. In this study, the effects of the electrode materials and working conditions were investigated. The experimental results show that the type 1 (iridium oxide-coated anode and cathode) electrode system generated a high concentration of free available chlorines (FACs) because iridium has higher electrocatalytic activity than ruthenium. When the applied voltage increases, the acceleration of oxidation reactions in the electrochemical cell resulted in the increased generation of FACs. The solution inflow rate is approximately inversely proportional to the residence time of the salt solution in the electrochemical cell. A long residence time can induce a higher FAC generation. In addition, the production of FACs is increased with the decreasing electrode open ratio (a/A). With a/A &amp;gt; 0 and a lower inflow rate, the FAC concentration tends to approach a maximum value because of by-product generation. The ozone species generated in the electrochemical cell were determined by the maximum voltage. The electrode open ratio affected the ozone generation rate due to the mixing effect of cathode products.</jats:p>",

To save water and obtain higher production, the use of polystyrene (PS) beads has been proposed as a granular filter element because it is a granular element with a low specific mass. By being lightweight, this material requires a lower water velocity during backwash. The PS beads were applied in a descending rapid filter and compared to a conventional sand and anthracite filter, and its hydraulic performance was evaluated during the backwash with air and water interspersed. Although it presents a high fluidity, with lower rates (compared to conventional filters) of backwash, this fact does not necessarily represent an economy of backwash water, because it requires more time for cleaning. It was also observed that there is an optimal value for the removal of particles collected during the filtration without loss of material.</jats:p>",

Moreover, decreasing milk prices and increasing production costs have recently induced many farmers to open automatic vending machines, dispensing raw milk for direct sale to local consumers. In order to contribute to the environmental assessment of alternative systems, this study estimated CO2 emissions related to the transport from production farms to point of sale, for three brands of fresh milk currently sold in the Umbria region (Italy), starting from the food miles indicator as a simple concept, easily understood by consumers. These brands differ in the origin of milk (national, regional and local) and distribution channels (large-scale retail channels for national and regional brands and vending machines for the local one). Thus, we estimated the emissions generated by the transport of the fresh milk consumed by regional households. In agreement with previous studies about CO2 emissions of foreign milk supply chains, the analysis showed that the production system of regional-branded milk, sold by retail channels, is the most efficient in terms of the environmental impact of transport.</jats:p>"

This way, international R&amp;D partnerships arise as an important theme of discussion in literature and in practice. Through a systematic literature review of 31 papers published in management journals from 2002 to 2014, this study brings first a description of the main concepts in international R&amp;D partnerships, then the best practices for the theme proposed and the gaps in the area’s knowledge.

Bioenergy represents a promising replacement for conventional energy, due to reduced environmental impacts and broad applicability. Sustainable energy challenges, however, require innovative manufacturing technologies and practices to mitigate energy and material consumption. This research aims to facilitate sustainable production of bioenergy from forest biomass and to promote deployment of novel processing equipment (mobile bio-refinery units). The study integrates knowledge from the renewable energy production and supply chain management disciplines to evaluate economic targets of bioenergy production with use of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The decision support system method employs two phases: (1) classification of potential biomass harvesting sites via decision tree analysis and (2) optimization of the supply network through a mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the costs of upstream and midstream supply chain segments. While mobile units are shown to reduce biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain costs, production and deployment of the units is limited due to undeveloped bioenergy supply chains and quality uncertainty. It is reiterated that future research must address process-related and systemic issues in pursuit of sustainable energy technology development.</jats:p>",

But the possibilities of creation of new monetary unions are discussed. It is spoken about NAFTA (Canada, Mexico and the United States) or MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela). The aim of this paper is to assess the similarity of demand and supply shocks in the countries of NAFTA and MERCOSUR, and to compare it with the countries of the Euro Area. For these aims, correlation and structural vector autoregression methods are used. Methods are based on Blanchard and Quah (1989) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993). We confirm the existence of core states and periphery states in the Euro Area with some exceptions. If we compare supply and demand shocks, we find more similarity in the case of supply shocks in the countries of the Euro Area. According to the results, the countries of NAFTA are more appropriate for the creation of monetary union than the countries of MERCOSUR. The countries of NAFTA achieve high correlation coefficients of supply and demand shocks (except Mexico for supply shocks).</jats:p>",

It can thus be profitably used for network design under conditions of uncertain future demands. The methodology adopted consisted of: (a) multi-objective design optimization performed in order to minimize construction costs while maximizing the resilience index; and (b) retrospective performance assessment of the alternative solutions of the Pareto front obtained, under demand conditions far from those assumed during the design phase. Two case studies of different topological complexity were considered. Results showed that the resilience index, which is one of the most effective indirect indices of reliability, represents a very good measure of robustness as well.</jats:p>",

The consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for piped water supply using the contingent valuation (CV) method with different starting point bids was investigated for the Pavlodar Region, Kazakhstan. The results showed that households with access to groundwater (well or borehole water users) perceived this as of good quality. Consumers without access to groundwater used open-source, standpipe or delivered water for which they had to travel and spend time or to pay. Open source water and standpipe water quality was perceived as bad or satisfactory. More than 90% of the consumers were willing to pay for better water quality and regular water supply. The mean WTP was estimated to be about 1120 in bids and about 1590 KZT per household per month in open-ended question format (150 KZT is ~1 USD as of January 2012). The results can be used to better identify the proper technological choice and the level of service to be provided making rural water projects both sustainable and replicable at a larger scale.</jats:p>"

This paper investigates the feasibility of solving the groundwater pollution inverse problem by using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The approach consists first in training an ANN to solve the direct problem, in which the pollutant concentration in a set of monitoring wells is calculated for a known pollutant source. Successively, the trained ANN is frozen and is used to solve the inverse problem, where the pollutant source is calculated which corresponds to a set of concentrations in the monitoring wells. The approach has been applied for a real case which deals with the contamination of the Rhine aquifer by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) due to a tanker accident. The obtained results are compared with the solution obtained with a different approach retrieved from literature. The results show the suitability of ANN-based methods for solving inverse non-linear problems.</jats:p>",

Several methodologies have been suggested by different researchers for placement of sensors in WDNs which can provide early warning. Owing to the cost of both placing and maintaining the sensors, the number of these must be limited. This constraint makes the sensor deployment locations crucial in early warning systems. In this paper various methodologies suggested for sensor placements have been broadly classified based on the number of performance objectives as single and multi-objective sensor location problems. Various objectives and their significance in the context of sensor placement strategy have been discussed. A complete review of literature is presented to understand complexities in the sensor design problems and to determine the directions in which research is heading. Several challenges for the design of robust sensor network for large WDNs with less computational efforts are discussed and recommendations are presented.</jats:p>",

Several methods are available to facilitate the evaluation steps. This paper deals with a rural water supply problem in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Three different MCDM methods – weighted summation, analytical hierarchy process, and novel approach to imprecise assessment and decision environments – were used to evaluate the suitable water supply alternative. The ranking of alternatives obtained from these MCDM techniques produced similar results. Among five water supply alternatives evaluated, rainwater harvesting systems and deep tube wells scored first and second, respectively, for all three evaluation methods. In addition, sensitivity analyses were carried out for the MCDM techniques and these results did not show drastic variations either. This finding implies that while selection of MCDM technique is important, when evaluating similar problems more emphasis should be given to defining the problem comprehensively and thus selecting the relevant criteria and priorities to factor into the decision problem.</jats:p>",

This paper looks at how financial markets influence the development industry, its business strategies, and the nature and location of its products. Adopting a supply-side account, the paper inquires into the rising role of financial markets as a source of funding for a consolidating development industry and its influence on the geography of housing in Brazilian cities. It develops the concept of resonance by combining two yet unrelated strands of literature on the study of financial markets (cultural economy and conventionalist economics). Narratives co-authored by the stock market community and development firms management over each individual firm, and the discursively linked strategic moves of developers, are shown to resonate, at the meso-level of the industry, into shared social representations (or conventions) on how to best assess and interpret the value of development firms. Analysing the wave of Initial Public Offerings occurring in the mid 2000s, the paper highlights that narratives of quick capital gains associated with the removal of the land banking bottleneck faced by developers supported a convention giving priority to the growth in total output, and contributed to the observed changes in the forms, scales and locations of housing projects in Brazilian cities. As discrepancies between the promises of returns for shareholders and actual financial results emerged, the growth convention unravelled, making way for other narratives and strategic moves to resonate anew and possibly change again the geographies of housing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water distribution networks (WDNs) play a crucial role in the well-being of human populations and economic prosperity. It is essential that they cope with abnormal operating conditions and recover functionality quickly. Traditionally, WDNs are designed using cost and reliability objectives, but there is a lack of consensus on the definition and quantification of reliability which typically is a computationally intense process. Subsequently, various reliability-like metrics, called resilience indices, have been developed and demonstrated in the design of WDNs. Few studies exist that thoroughly evaluate the performance of the previously developed resilience metrics. This paper investigates three resilience metrics by evaluating their performance on three benchmark WDNs for several simulated mechanical failure states. The metrics studied are: (a) resilience index, (b) network resilience index (NRI), and (c) modified resilience index (MRI). The metric MRI performed better overall but NRI produced cheaper designs that performed better in the case of WDN-I. It is recommended that a better metric that incorporates different dimensions of resilience, such as robustness and redundancy, should be developed in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a result of slow patient recruitment and high patient costs in the United States, clinical trials are increasingly going global. While recruitment efforts benefit from a larger global footprint, the supply chain has to work harder at getting the right drug supply to the right place at the right time. Certain clinical trial supply chains, especially those supplying biologics, have a combination of unique attributes that have yet to be addressed by existing supply chain models. These attributes include a fixed patient horizon, an inflexible supply process, a unique set of service‐level requirements, and an inability to transfer drug supplies among testing sites. We provide a new class of multi‐echelon inventory models to address these unique aspects. The resulting mathematical program is a nonlinear integer programming problem with chance constraints. Despite this complexity, we develop a solution method that transforms the original formulation into a linear integer equivalent. By analyzing special cases and through numerical study of both real‐life and simulated examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution and develop insights into inventory positioning and the cost drivers in clinical trial supply chains. </jats:p>",

Results show that consumers’ welfare would experience a sharp decrease though the impacts on farmers are trivial. Also, results indicate that the key to success the reform without political backlash in the short‐run is the cash transfer program under which the government redistributes part of the reform's benefits among consumers. Per capita compensation payments would be equal to 51.50 and 46.09 US$ per year for a typical rural and urban person, respectively. Moreover, the results provide more detailed information about the market characteristics and the payments both in nationwide and regional scale as well as in different income groups.</jats:p>",

The use of biomass in large centralised systems requires the establishment  of delivery channels to provide the desired feedstock with the necessary attributes, at  the right time and place. In terms of time to deployment and cost of the solution,  co-combustion/co-gasification of biomass and coal are presented as transition and  short-medium term alternatives towards a carbon-neutral energy sector. Hence, there is  a need to assess an effective introduction of co-combustion/co-gasification projects in the current electricity production share.

Companies have an obligation to improve their product quality and have extensive and close cooperation with other companies involved in the supply chain of products. Supply chain quality management (SCQM) is a systematic approach to improve the performance that integrates supply chain partners and uses the opportunity in the best way, establish linkages between upstream and downstream flows, and investigate on creating value and satisfaction of intermediaries and final customers. Furthermore, achieving competitive advantages enables an organization to create a remarkable position in market and differentiate itself from competitors. This paper aims to understand the relationships between SCQM and competitive advantage. Sixty-eight experts of 25 companies in Sahami Alyaf (SA) supply chain has been participated in this research. The research method used for this article is descriptive correlation. To assess the relationships between the criteria, canonical correlation analysis was used. The result shows that the SCQM and competitive advantages have a meaningful relationship. It also shows that most important variable in the linear combination of SCQM and competitive advantages are “customer focus and quality,” respectively.</jats:p>",

For assessing agricultural activities at the paddy and upland fields on groundwater quality during an irrigation period, multiple water quality items were measured in several water types, including groundwater, river water, and paddy water. Water quality indicators, such as major dissolved ions, a number of trace elements, and some isotopes were measured. The concentrations of nutrients and some elements related to the environmental standards indicated that pollution in the groundwater in the fan was not severe. Concentrations of the tracers (Mg, Na, δD, δ18O) in the shallow groundwater were low along the Tedori River and increased with distance from the river; this trend would be caused by dilution effect by the river water. It was also shown that the paddy field also affects groundwater quality by the infiltration of irrigation water.</jats:p>",

The inhibitory effect of these molecules on the growth of Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus strophaeus and the Gram-negative strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa has also been examined. Furthermore, to determine the relationship between inhibition and attachment, the degree of binding of these photo-sensitizers to these bacteria was determined. The results show that TAPP is more effective than ZnTAPP in the photo-oxidation of phenol and photo-inactivation of the bacteria. In addition, the degree of binding of TAPP to these bacteria was more than that of ZnTAPP.</jats:p>",

Small- and medium-sized zooplankton was the dominant prey in the 2003-2006, in particular copepods prevailed in the food of walleye pollock (41.5 %), pacific herring (48.3 %), and sand lance (71.7 %) juveniles, which in turn were the prey for pollock, herring and cod yearlings and other predators. On the contrary, large-sized zooplankton was more abundant in the 2007-2012, so arrowwarms ( Sagitta sp.), large-sized copepods (in particular Calanus marshallae ), euphausiids (mainly Thysanoessa raschii ), hyperiids, and pteropods were the prey for young fish: C. marshallae - for juveniles of pollock (40-45 % by weight) and capelin (32-34 %), Th. raschii - for yearlings of pollock (51 %) and herring (36-46 %), cold-water hyperiid T. libellula - for adult pollock (24 %), juvenile cod (9-18 %) and juvenile herring (9-11 %), whereas portion of fish in the diets was insignificant. In the warm period (2003-2006), juvenile pollock, herring, sand lance and capelin were zooplankton-eaters with the diets similarity 67 %, while yearlings of pollock and juveniles of cod, herring, sandfish, and atka mackerel were fish-eaters preying upon pollock juveniles. In the cold period (2007-2012), the diets of juvenile pollock, juvenile and adult capelin, and juvenile sand lance were also similar at 85-70 % but they preferred large-sized copepods and euphausiids ( C. marshallae and Th. raschii ), while yearlings of pollock, yearlings and adults of herring, and juveniles of sand fish and cod had the diets of 70 % similarity with Th. raschii prevalence. Feeding intensity was high for all species: the mean stomach fullness was 150-200 ‱ for pollock juveniles and yearlings, 200-250 ‱ for cod juveniles, 200-258 ‱ for sand lance juveniles, 302 ‱ for herring juveniles, and 178-250 ‱ for juvenile atka mackerel. The fullness had diurnal rhythm with three peaks: at noon - up to 179 ‱, in evening - up to 213 ‱, and at night - up to 204 ‱ (the data for walleye pollock juveniles in «cold» years only). Daily food ration of juvenile pollock is estimated as 6.7 % of its body weight in the «warm» years and 7.0 % in the «cold» years.</jats:p>"

However, such an RFID-based track and trace system raises new security and privacy challenges due to the restricted resource of tags. In this paper, we refine three privacy related models (i.e., the privacy, path unlinkability, and tag unlinkability) of RFID-based track and trace systems, and clarify the relations among these privacy models. Specifically, we have proven that privacy is equivalent to path unlinkability and tag unlinkability implies privacy. Our results simplify the privacy concept and protocol design for RFID-based track and trace systems. Furthermore, we propose an efficient track and trace scheme, Tracker+, which allows for authentic and private identification of RFID-tagged objects in supply chains. In the Tracker+, no computational ability is required for tags, but only a few bytes of storage (such as EPC Class 1 Gen 2 tags) are needed to store the tag state. Indeed, Tracker+ reduces the memory requirements for each tag by one group element compared to the Tracker presented in other literature. Moreover, Tracker+ provides privacy against supply chain inside attacks.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Deforestation and forest degradation account for around 12–15% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are largely driven by agricultural expansion. In the absence of formal regulation, voluntary initiatives have been established to meet demands from consumers and environmental NGOs. This paper examines what explains the effectiveness of supply chain initiatives to reduce deforestation, comparing four supply chain initiatives in two countries: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil in Indonesia and the Roundtable on Responsible Soy, the Soy Moratorium and the Cattle Agreement in Brazil. The first two are certification schemes, incentivizing more sustainable production, while the latter two are moratoria under which certain actors no longer purchased from companies that engaged in deforestation after a certain date. The moratoria benefitted from a concentration of power among actors risking loss of customers and able to demand changes in behavior from their suppliers. Certification schemes of multi-stakeholder initiatives are based on consensus and have lower requirements for reducing deforestation. For all initiatives a risk of leakage – deforestation by others, for other purposes, or elsewhere – remains. Little seems to be known regarding the possibilities farmers have to alter production practices, potentially hampering the development of public policies to complement the private initiatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Union and its Member States are seeking to decarbonize their energy systems, including the electricity sector and, at the same time, pursue market integration. However, renewable energy (RE) deployment and the liberalization of the energy-only market have raised concerns at the national level about the security of electricity supplies in the future. Some actors consider the lack of sufficient investments in generation capacities a threat to supply security. As a consequence, it was proposed that capacity markets solve these problems. The underlying assumption is that the market design is the only determining factor for investments in security of supply options. In this article, we question this narrow view and identify further determinants of the investment decisions of electricity market participants. Based on the insights of institutional sociology and economics, we understand the market to be a social institution that structures the behavioural expectations of market participants. Derived from the theoretical conceptualization and based on qualitative literature review and own work, we find four determinants for investment behaviour beyond the formal market design: Material opportunities, strategic actor behavior and identity, focusing events and discursive expectations about the future. With this perspective, we discuss the introduction of a European Energy Union as a possible tool that might have a great impact on the more informal determinants such as expectations about the future and the construction of a European energy narrative.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a proposed control strategy is presented to improve the performance of the pulse width modulation (PWM) boost type rectifier when operating under different supply voltage conditions (balanced, unbalanced, and distorted three-phase supply voltages). The proposed control strategy is divided into two parts, the first part is voltage controller and the second part is current controller. In the voltage controller, Repetitive Controller (RC) is used to reduce the even order harmonics in the regulated output dc voltage so small output capacitor (filter) is used instead of large capacitor. RC also reduces the even order harmonics which appear in the reflected dc current (IMAX), this leads to reduce the odd order harmonics which appear in the input currents. While in the current controller, Enhanced Phase Locked Loop (EPLL) technique is used to obtain sinusoidal and balanced three phases, to construct the reference currents, which are in phase with the fundamental supply voltages. Therefore, the supply-side power factor is kept close to unity. A proportional controller is used to give excellent tracking between the line and the reference currents. The complete system with the proposed control strategy are simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The results for the complete system using repetitive voltage controller are obtained and compared to the results of the system with the conventional voltage controller (Proportional-Integral (PI) controller connected in series with a Low Pass Filter (LPF)). The results with the repetitive controller show better response and stable operation in the steady state under different input voltage conditions, as well as in the transient response under changing the load condition.</jats:p>",

However, the academic literature needs empirical studies on SC resilience capable of investigating the inter-organizational components of flexibility along different tiers. Therefore, this paper analyzes the main lack of flexibilities in three Brazilian automotive SCs that limit their resilience and therefore their capacity to better support and meet the demand changes in the marketplace. A multi-tier case study approach is adopted. Research findings identify lack of flexibilities in different tiers that inhibit the SC resilience as well as manufacturing and SC flexibilities that build SC resilience. The findings also highlight that the same SC may have the flexibility to be resilient for one of its products but not for another product, what sheds new lights on the academic literature. Finally, flexible SCs should be designed to increase SC resilience to cope with mishaps as significant demand changes.</jats:p>",

As potable water is considered to be a primary need, water service has usually been managed without examining the economic and environmental sustainability of supply processes. Currently, due to increases in energy costs and the growth of environment preservation policies, reducing water leakage, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) production have become primary objectives in reducing the environmental footprint of water service. The present paper suggests the implementation  of some performance indicators that show the interdependence of water loss, energy consumption and GHG emission. These indicators are used to compare a few possible mitigation scenarios involving water loss reduction and increasing the system’s energy efficiency. The proposed indicators were applied to a complex urban water supply system serving the city of Palermo (Italy).</jats:p>"

In 2000, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared a part of it a World Heritage Site. Actually, the Palmeral is a historic irrigation system with rows of palm trees flanking rectangular fields and serving as a windbreak and shade for the cultivation of wheat, alfalfa, fruit trees and vegetables. This system and its cultivation methods were mainly developed during the Islamic period and maintained after the Christian Reconquista in 1265 until recently. The main canal Acequia Mayor supplies irrigation water from the Vinalopó River which is then distributed through secondary canals to the different subsystems and fields as well as for domestic purposes. With an average slope of 1:260 (4‰) the main canal has a flow capacity of about 600 L/s. Owing to the topography, the canal must overcome a number of vertical drops where hydraulic energy must be dissipated. Beside the drop structures, at the same time watermills generate water power for flour production. These watermills have been built since the Islamic era and operated until the last century, when they were abandoned or converted for other uses. There are some descriptive publications and documents dealing with the mills, but there has not yet been any attempt to conduct a technical survey and interpretation. This study explores the remains of 11 watermills and determines the dimensions and technical parameters of this hydro-system. The mills were equipped with turbine-type horizontal waterwheels with hydraulic heads between two and more than 15 m. The observations allow conclusions on mill operation, power yield and flour production. A comprehensive description of this early example of waterpower generation in a multipurpose system is undertaken.</jats:p>",

Though there has been a great deal of research into the theoretical optimization of large-scale power systems, research into the use of an existing power system as a foundation for this growth has yet to be fully explored. Current successful and robust power generation systems that have significant renewable energy penetration — despite not having been optimized a priori — can be used to inform the advancement of modern power systems to accommodate the increasing demand for electricity. Leveraging ongoing research projects at Oregon State University and the National Energy Technology Laboratory, this work explores how an accurate and state-of-the-art computational model of the Oregon/Washington (OR/WA) energy system can be employed as part of an overarching power systems optimization scheme that looks to inform the decision making process for next generation power supply systems. Research scenarios that explore an introductory multi-objective power flow analysis for the OR/WA grid will be shown, along with a discussion of future research directions.</jats:p>",

Three kinds of nanofiltration (NF) membranes (HL, DL and TS80 with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 100–500) and three kinds of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes (GE, GH and GK with MWCO of 1,000–3,000) were used to evaluate the draw solution recovery. The formed second layer, micelles, MWCO and charged valent were determined to be the dominant mechanisms for diluted draw solution recovery. The results show that coupling non-ionic surfactant with 0.02 M Na3PO4 can be regenerated with recoveries as high as 60% and 96% when using UF-GE and NF-TS80, respectively. The overall performance demonstrates that coupling surfactant with highly charged phosphate is promising as draw solutes for application to FO.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy use in the water sector in China have not received the same attention as emissions from other sectors, but interest in this area is growing. This study uses 2011 data to investigate GHG emissions from electricity use for urban water supply in China. The objective is to measure the climate cobenefit of water conservation, compare China with other areas on a number of emissions indicators, and assist in development of policy that promotes low‐emission water supply. Per capita and per unit GHG emissions for water supplied to urban areas in China in 2011 were 24.5 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq) per capita per year and 0.213 kg CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq per cubic meter, respectively. Comparison of provinces within China revealed that GHG emissions for urban water supply as a percentage of total province‐wide emissions from electricity use correlate directly with the rate of leakage and water loss within the water distribution system. This highlights controlling leakage as a possible means of reducing the contribution of urban water supply to GHG emissions. An inverse correlation was established between GHG emissions per unit water and average per capita daily water use, which implies that water demand tends to be higher when per unit emissions are lower. China's high emission factor for electricity generation inflates emissions for urban water supply. Shifting from emissions‐intensive electricity sources is crucial to reducing emissions in the water supply sector.</jats:p>",

One of the possibilities to realise a contactless power supply (CPS) is by integrating the primary actuator into the guide rail of an electromagnetic guiding system (MGS). The secondary actuator is mounted on the elevator car. During the energy transmission, load dependent non-linear losses occur in the guide rail. The additional losses, which are caused by the leakage flux penetrating into the guide rail, cannot be modelled using the classical approach of iron losses in the equivalent circuit of a transformer, which is a constant parallel resistance to the mutual inductance. This paper introduces an approach for modelling the load dependent non-linear losses occurring in the guide rail using additional variable discrete circuit elements</jats:p>",

The concentration of dissolved oxygen is an important indicator of water quality because aquatic life lives on the dissolved oxygen in the water. The hydraulic structures can be accepted as the key components in increasing dissolved oxygen concentration because of the strong turbulent mixing associated with substantial air bubble entrainment at these structures. Closed conduit is a classic example of a hydraulic structure where aeration occurs. This work focused on determining the effect of conduit length on air-demand ratio and aeration efficiency in free-surface gated circular conduits. Experimental results showed that the Froude number had an important effect on the air-demand ratio and the aeration efficiency. The effect of the conduit length on the air-demand ratio and the aeration efficiency changed depending on the Froude number. It was demonstrated from the results that a free-surface gated circular conduit flow system had high efficiency in transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. Moreover, a formula for the aeration efficiency was presented relating the aeration efficiency to the conduit length and the Froude number.</jats:p>",

The telehandler (forklift) did not pierce the plastic of the IBC directly (as was expected to be the case) but rather one of the tynes caught on the underside of the metal base plate (pallet belly plate), despite numerous controls being in place at the time of spill (to limit the risks of damaging the IBC), revealing a previously unreported mechanism for a fluid spill from handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and related chemicals. The investigation team used a root cause analysis (RCA) technique, based on the fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram, which was undertaken with 12 expert contributors (from the project) to identify the underlying cause: The inspection process was inadequate.

Using European panel data (EU-SILC) from 2003 to 2009 and multi-level models, this study analyses the effect of family policies on fathers’ working hours. The results indicate that fathers work less than childless men if they live in countries that offer well paid, non-transferable parental leave for fathers, short parental leave for mothers and generous family allowances. The effects, however, are strongly contingent on fathers’ educational levels. Whereas short maternal leaves are associated with shorter working hours among highly educated fathers, generous family allowances and father friendly parental leave schemes reduce the working hours of less educated fathers. </jats:p>",

Pump characteristics and efficiency curves can be given in tabular format or as analytical functions of flow. Degradation of pump efficiency at lower rotational speed is taken into account, as well as motor and variable speed drive efficiencies at partial loads. The optimal solution provided by the tool was compared to measurements in two case studies. Our case studies showed 6.1–8.5% reduction in energy usage using the optimal parallel pumping control strategy compared to the currently used strategy, where all running pumps have the same frequency.</jats:p>",

Optimal analytical conditions were found to be 0.10 M borate buffer (pH 6.2), 2.5 × 10−5 M GA, an accumulation potential of – 0.1 V (Versus SCE), an accumulation time of 80 s and a scan rate of 60 mV/s. The peak current is proportional to the concentration of lead and cadmium over the range of 0.50–70.00 ng mL−1 and 0.20–35.00 ng mL−1, respectively, and the detection limit is 0.014 ng mL−1 and 0.011 ng mL−1 for lead and cadmium, respectively, for a 80 s adsorption time.

Nevertheless, there is a debate between corn ethanol and sugar ethanol .regarding the appropriateness to produce fuel instead of food in highly fertile regions. This industry is also severely criticized regarding its socio-environmental practices. We analyzed three cases  identified as featuring best practices in this industry in Brazil. Two of the companies are located in the state of São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, the most important region in sugar-ethanol production. The third is situated in the Brazilian Midwest, a region with fast growth in this industry. In this region, cattle, soy and corn have been substitute by sugarcane plantation. The results suggest that, when a company in this industry pursues a sustainable approach to its operations, it is possible to mitigate environmental impacts and to improve local social conditions. Such practices are potential sources of competitive advantage. However, clear gaps are still present regarding integration and collaboration along the supply chain. Nevertheless, sustainable business policies have also created new business opportunities. The continuous challenge is to develop synergetic operational capabilities that are able to mitigate environmental impacts, to decrease operational costs and to add value to the products.DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n1p45-56URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n1p46-56</jats:p>"

Based on policy documents and semi-structured interviews with representatives of five organizations active in producing, processing and retailing food in Sweden, an attempt is made to answer the following three questions: How do key actors in the Swedish food supply chain define and operationalize the concept of agricultural sustainability? Who/what influences these organizations’ sustainability policies and their respective positions on agricultural biotechnology? What are the organizations’ views and perceptions of biotechnology and its possible role in creating agricultural sustainability? Based on collected data, it is concluded that, although there is a shared view of the core constituents of agricultural sustainability among the organizations, there is less explicit consensus on how the concept should be put into practice or what role biotechnology can play in furthering agricultural sustainability.</jats:p>"

Here we examined the evidence for this link in two eurythermal decapods, the Giant tiger shrimp (<jats:italic>Penaeus monodon</jats:italic>) and the European crayfish (<jats:italic>Astacus astacus</jats:italic>). We found that both species have a temperature resistant cardiorespiratory system, capable of maintaining oxygen delivery up to their upper critical temperature (Tcrit). In neither species was Tcrit reduced in hypoxia (60% air saturation) and both species showed an exponential increase in heart and gill ventilation rates up to their Tcrit. Further, failure of action potential conduction in preparations of <jats:italic>A. astacus</jats:italic> motor neurons coincided with Tcrit, indicating that compromised nervous function may provide the underlying determinant for Tcrit rather than oxygen delivery. At high temperatures, absolute aerobic scope was maintained in <jats:italic>P. monodon</jats:italic>, but reduced in <jats:italic>A. astacus</jats:italic>. However, <jats:italic>A. astacus</jats:italic> also displayed reduced exercise intensity indicating that impaired muscle performance with resulting reduced tissue oxygen demand may explain the reduced scope rather than insufficient oxygen supply capacity. This interpretation agrees with early literature on aquatic ectotherms, correlating loss of nervous function with impaired locomotion as temperatures approach Tcrit.</jats:p>"

It is also the region with the largest food production and export in Vietnam, especially rice. Thanks to endowment of natural conditions, human, land and the increased application of advanced technology in the cultivation and production, Mekong Delta has produced higher and higher volume of rice, ensuring the food safety for the whole country. Faced with difficulties and more fierce competition, however, it is necessary to ensure a more stable life for farmers and increase the competiveness of this region. Many programs and polices have been implemented yet no significant results have been achieved. A solution which captures the concern of researchers is the supply chain of rice. To successfully apply scientific methods in managing and operating supply chain of rice, understanding the practice of the region is of importance. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a basis for the application of tools and mathematical models to solve problems of the supply chain of rice in Mekong Delta.</jats:p>"

Sanitary losses, especially among combat medics taking the wounded from the battlefield, were the most crucial. During the war, military hospitals were established throughout the territory of the USSR where over 22 million of wounded were treated. 85% of them returned to the Army. The role of blood transfusion stations staff who supplied front and rear medical facilities by blood and its components is invaluable. The objective of the article - to illustrate the role and importance of medical service and its part - medical institutions dealing with blood and blood components collection, storage, processing and supply to military units, hospital, performing transfusions for the wounded. Archival materials and statistical data gained from various publications, wartime and postwar, were used. The gained data confirm the invaluable role of these services in providing medical aid to the wounded and the sick during the Great Patriotic War, as well as describe reorganization and flexible tactics of the blood service staff in accordance with the Great Patriotic War periods in supplying medical service with blood and its components. Blood service staff training and management measures allowed to uninterrupted supply front and rear medical institutions with blood. Blood service in different periods of the Great Patriotic War had undergone significant management changes in the section of the donation, processing and supply of medical facilities with blood, enabling to attract huge crowds of people in the USSR to donate blood, to ensure an uninterrupted, adequate supply of troops with blood.</jats:p>"

Previous research largely focused on the context of decentralized network structure. However, the supply network is a centralized network because of the existence of the focal firm. The existence of the focal firm may influence the impact of relational capital outcomes. Hence, the objective of this research is to determine the type of network structural positions required to obtain a reasonable relational capital outcome in upstream supply network. This study found that network structural positions, i.e. degree centrality contributed to firms’ level of relational capital trust. Hence, a firm embedded in upstream supply network benefits differently in terms of relational capital through different degree of embeddedness. The firm resources should be re-aligned to match the benefits of the different network structural positions.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes an eco-efficiency model for product life cycle management within the extended supply chain (ESC) for food industry. Eco-efficiency (EE) has the potential to incorporate both environmental and economic improvement by companies of ESC, and we explore the use of EE in the design process.  It is noteworthy that it is an imperative in the current competitive market that companies must be able to manage their entire production chain taking into account environmental issues as an important factor in their decision-making processes. Therefore, it is believed that EE can integrate and strengthen a company’s functions and assist its decision-making processes as well as implement improvements within its ESC. In this context, it is expected that the proposed model will be able to deliver a validation process based on EE strategies as well as map environmental aspects and its impacts. In addition, the proposed model aims to consider economic aspects along the product ESC and to present elements which can help companies to promote improvements within its supply chain by considering a more environmentally friendly perspective.</jats:p>"

This paper presents the performance comparison of PWM inverter to Power Factor Corrected (PFC) converter with PWM inverter based High-voltage High-frequency power supply for ozone generator system. The conventional inverter has front end bridge rectifier with smoothing capacitor. It draws non-sinusoidal current from ac mains; as a result input supply has more harmonics and poor power factor. Hence, there is a continuous need for power factor improvement and reduction of line current harmonics.  The proposed system has active power factor correction converter which is used to achieve sinusoidal current and improve the supply power factor. The active PFC converter with PWM inverter fed ozone generator generates more ozone output compared to the conventional inverter. Thus the proposed system has less current harmonics and better input power factor compared to the conventional system.  The performance of the both inverters are compared and analyzed with the help of simulation results presented in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Suppliers of consumer packaged goods are facing an increasingly challenging situation as they work to fulfill orders from their retail partners’ distribution facilities. Traditionally these suppliers have generated forecasts of a given retailer's orders using records of that retailer's past orders. However, it is becoming increasingly common for retail firms to collect and share large volumes of point‐of‐sale (POS) data, thus presenting an alternative data signal for suppliers to use in generating forecasts. A question then arises as to which data produce the most accurate forecasts. Compounding this question is the fact that forecasters often temporally aggregate data for consolidation or to produce forecasts in larger time buckets. Extant literature prescribes two countervailing statistical effects, information loss and variance reduction, that could play significant roles in determining the impact of temporal aggregation on forecast accuracy. Utilizing a large set of paired order and POS data, this study examines these relationships.</jats:p>",

There is a need to evaluate the contribution of these family physicians to the district health system.Aim: To develop a methodology for describing the correlation between family physician supply and district health system performance, clinical processes and outcomes, and to measure this correlation at baseline.Method: A cross-sectional study was undertaken that analysed data at an ecological level for the period of 01 April 2011 to 31 March 2012. This was a pilot project analysing data from the first year of a 4-year project. The correlations between family physician supply and 18 health system indicators were assessed within a logic model. The supplies of other categories of staff were also measured.Results: Although most of the correlations with family physicians were positive, the study was unable to demonstrate any strong or statistically significant correlations at baseline. There were significant correlations with other categories of staff.Conclusions: This study developed a methodology for monitoring the relationship between family physician supply using routinely collected indicators of health system performance, clinical processes and outcomes over time. Additional research will also be needed to investigate the impact of family physicians and triangulate findings as this methodology has many limitations and potential confounding factors.</jats:p>"

Irkutsk Regional Blood Transfusion Center expedition service reporting forms, branch statistical reports, accounting records of blood supply service facilities of Irkutsk Region for 2014 were analyzed.Results. To ensure the proper supply of Irkutsk region healthcare facilities with platelet concentrate, the main activities for stock management were determined: (1) key customers interaction management - by exploring the need for platelets and developing a mechanism for request planning for the next 7-9 days; (2) advance request execution - by donor acquisition, platelet concentrate production management, interaction with other institutions of the blood supply service; (3) platelet donation campaign. Regional management system for platelet stock was developed.Conclusion. Regional management system for platelet stock consists of 7 elements: (1) constant interaction with key customers: daily monitoring of healthcare facilities’ needs for platelet concentrate and planned advance requests for platelet concentrates; (2) anticipatory appointments for donors for platelet apheresis; (3) formation of platelet donors registry; (4) providing pediatric dosages of platelet concentrates for pediatric healthcare facilities; (5) combination of different ways of platelet concentrates preparation (production of platelet concentrates recovered from regular blood donors blood allows to create a «safety net» for emergencies); (6) arranging the planned production of platelet concentrates for Irkutsk at the branches of Irkutsk Regional Blood Transfusion Center, as well as in other Irkutsk Region regional blood supply service facilities; (7) promotion of platelet donation in blood supply service facilities.</jats:p>"

This model is attempted to integrate ITSP and stochastic RC programming into a general framework and apply the ITSP-RC for power management and CO2 emission reduction management, such that the developed model can tackle uncertainties described in terms of interval values and probability distributions over a two-stage context. Moreover, it can reflect dynamic and randomness of the energy systems during the planning horizon. The developed method has been applied to a case to solve CO2 emission management problem in electric supply environmental management. A number of scenarios corresponding to different adoption rate levels of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology are examined. With the RC programming, regional energy systems would have a stable financial budget. The result suggests that the methodology is applicable for reflecting complexities of large-scale energy management systems and addressing CO2 emissions reduction issue with the planning period.</jats:p>",

Such systems can be characterized by interconnectedness and feedback. Applying risk assessment to the results of System Dynamics models is a challenge. Though in some cases the resulting time series data generated by a simulation may appear approximately random at a specific scale, there is often a high-degree of auto-correlation within the data series due to the deterministic nature of generation and feedback loops inherent in the system. This paper presents proposed Dynamic Risk Assessment Method (DRAM) that allows for the estimation of risk for system dynamics data series that appear to be approximately random. DRAM is based on standard risk assessment methods and is simple both to calculate and apply. In this article, the proposed method is applied to determine the risk connected with hypothetical costs of illness stemming from water supply system contamination with Cryptosporidium.</jats:p>",

Significantly low contract prices, which are offered in an effort to remain competitive in global trade, often lead to labor exploitation. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act went into effect in 2012 to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from supply chains of manufacturing and retail companies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of implementation of this Act in the apparel industry. A quantitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the website disclosures of 204 US‐based apparel retail and manufacturing companies, focusing on the presence, type, length, accessibility, and content of their disclosures. The findings of this study provide insights for manufacturers, retailers, and marketers regarding how they can publicize their socially responsible efforts, particularly regarding slavery and human trafficking issues in their supply chains.

However, despite continued increases in woody cover between the 1980s and the 2000s, giraffe recruitment and survival rates have declined and density has dropped to only 0.3–0.4 giraffes km<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>. We used a decision table to investigate how four extrinsic factors may have contributed to these declines: food supply, predation, parasites, and poaching, which have all been previously shown to limit Serengeti ungulate populations. Lower recruitment likely resulted from a reduction in diet quality, owing to the replacement of preferred trees with unpalatable species, while decreased adult survival resulted from illegal harvesting, which appears to have had a greater impact on giraffe populations bordering the western and northern Serengeti. The Serengeti giraffe population will likely persist at low‐to‐moderate densities until palatable tree species regain their former abundance. Leslie matrix models suggest that park managers should meanwhile redouble their efforts to reduce poaching, thereby improving adult survival.</jats:p>",

To exploit the full potential of hydro energy in balance with the optimal hydraulic performance and water supply service, multi-objective management tools are needed. This paper presents the application of four management tools: (1) an energy audit to evaluate the potential hydro energy in the water pressurised systems of Alcoy; (2) multi-criteria decision-making methods for the selection of the preferred energy-efficient operation of a system with a pump-storage reservoir and hydro-turbines in the Algarve; (3) a numerical dynamic tool for optimal turbine operation in the water distribution of Langhirano; and (4) an urban water optioneering tool to estimate the hydropower potential of the external aqueduct network in Athens. These methods showed that through an integrated approach the WSS can be optimised for both hydraulic performance and hydro energy production.</jats:p>",

The project provides funding for two diversions of the San Francisco River, supplementing the supply of local water in four Brazilian states. The Piranhas-Açú and Jaguaribe basins will become the largest recipients of these water deliveries. In this paper, we propose methodologies to state in monetary terms the technical coefficients of water use for the economic sectors associated with urban supply (US) and agricultural irrigation (AI) in different regions of these basins. These coefficients show that for the US economic sectors, at a certain level of urbanization the productivity of water is decreasing. The coefficients of AI obtained are much lower than those of US. The coefficients of AI, when calculated by crop, showed that there is generally an inadequate crop mix in the two basins. When this is associated with the low efficiency of water use, the result is a low economic value per cubic metre of water allocated to the sector. This implies, for both sectors, a need for incentives to use water in a more efficient way.</jats:p>",

Therefore, heat used for fuel reforming becomes larger than heat supplied to reformers, and reformer heat tends to be absorbed. In this paper, transient behavior of reformers in SOFC systems with anode off-gas recycle, in the case of increasing fuel supply, is analyzed by numerical simulation. As a result, it is suggested that reformer temperature decreases from several to several tens of K, when heat is absorbed from the reformer, which is small scale, lightweight and has low heat capacity, for several seconds. In addition, methane flow rate outputted from the reformer increases, and carbon deposition occurs, depending on conditions.

The Spatial Data Infrastructure paradigm has been discussed since the early 1990s. The concept has evolved significantly since then but has almost always examined data from the perspective of the supplier. It has been a supplier driven focus rather than a user driven focus. The current research being conducted is making a paradigm shift and looking at the supply of spatial data as a supply chain, similar to a manufacturing supply chain in which users play a significant part. A comprehensive consultation process took place within Australia and New Zealand incorporating a large number of stakeholders. Three research projects that have arisen from this consultation process are examining Spatial Data Supply Chains within Australia and New Zealand and are discussed within this paper.\n                    </jats:p>"

They cause the voltage and current ripple at the source and load, and introduce electromagnetic interferences. Also, they affect the efficiency of the power source. The aforementioned issues are particularly relevant in battery powered electronics. In order to minimise these unwanted effects, it is necessary to introduce a power supply architecture between the load and the source that should filter and/or regulate the currents and voltages. This architecture could be made solely of passive components or could use DC–DC regulators. The present work classifies and characterises the most relevant architectures available. A novel switched power supply architecture for pulsed loads with adaptive input current is also introduced. A mathematical analysis of the conditions and characteristics that the regulated architectures should fulfil to obtain the maximum performance in terms of efficiency and green electronics is provided.

In the SC literature, many researchers and practitioners have studied the design of upstream supplier network. Very few studies have documented the design of downstream network comprising distributors, warehouses, retailers, etc. and current study attempts to contribute to this limited literature. In addition, this study also tries to understand the influence of downstream SC, if any, on top management strategies. Finally, it assesses the SC quality using the standard set of factors and provides insights for its improvement. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Single case study approach has been utilized to understand the configuration of downstream SC. A distillery in southern part of India which distributes a variety of liquor products across the market has been chosen for this study. Different data collection approaches have been adopted to understand the distribution channels prevailing in the market. In addition to the internal documents, semi-structured interviews were conducted with salesmen employed by the distillery for different group of outlets, top management of the distillery, outlet owners and counter sales person. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Different distribution channels constituting the downstream SC network of the industry in the market studied have been identified to be retails and bars, institutions, clubs, modern trade, maximum retail price and Mysore Sales International Limited. Each of the distribution channels has clearly defined their boundaries for reaching different segment of consumers. Significant influence of the existing distribution channels on strategic decisions such as new product development and pricing were noticed. Interesting inferences were obtained on the relationships existing between the distilleries and different distribution channels. Insights were also gathered on the regulatory role played by the government between the manufacturers and distributors. Few marketing and promotional strategies adopted by companies to strengthen their downstream relationships with distribution channels and, in turn, with consumers have also been discussed. The quality of alcoholic beverage SC has been assessed and was found to perform on par with the set standards of quality in robustness factors and enabling factors. Training factor needs to be further improved by providing salesmen with exposure to best practices. Effort also needs to be taken to improve in the complicating factors, i.e. the testability and time. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study is limited to the experience of a single alcoholic beverage manufacturer in the Karnataka state in India. SC of alcoholic beverage industry in India varies across states and depends on State Government regulations. Hence, the obtained results and inferences cannot be generalized across the industries and geographies. Future studies can be carried out in different locations across the country to understand the structure and dynamics of downstream SC in this industry. Scope also exists to study how the deficiencies identified in the SC can be improved and how alcoholic beverage firms entering India adapt to the prevailing SC structure. Comparative study of downstream SC of different industries can also be conducted. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Academicians and practitioners can consider this paper as a source to understand the configuration of downstream SC of alcoholic beverage industry. More than that, this study provides a counter-intuitive inference for researchers and practitioners that choice of distribution channels have influence on the strategic decisions such as pricing and product development. Therefore, it becomes necessary to factor in the target distribution channel at the product design phase itself. This study may also help in performing a comparative study of downstream SC – especially the distribution network of different industries and identify best practices that can be adopted across the industries. Application of the standard set of factors from the food SC quality assessment literature have been demonstrated in this study to assess the downstream SC of the alcoholic beverage industry studied. In addition, this study provides several insights by detailing the structure of the SC for other alcoholic beverage manufacturers who are planning to enter Indian market. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – According to author’s knowledge, it is believed that this is the first study to report the configuration of downstream SC of the alcoholic beverage industry specifically from India apart from describing their influence on strategic decisions of the company.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Here, we have examined the consequences of the exposure to different DHA levels and of the <jats:italic>in utero</jats:italic> depletion of FABP7 on early rat brain development. Neurodevelopment was evaluated through the contents of two proteins, connexin 43 (Cx43) and cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), both involved in neuroblast proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The dams were fed with diets presenting different DHA contents, from deficiency to supplementation. DHA brain embryos contents already differed at embryonic day 11.5 and the differences kept increasing with time. Cx43 and CDK5 contents were positively associated with the brain DHA levels. When FABP7 was depleted <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> by injections of siRNA in the telencephalon, the enhancement of the contents of both proteins was lost in supplemented animals, but FABP7 depletion did not modify phospholipid compositions regardless of the diets. Thus, FABP7 is a necessary mediator of the effect of DHA on these proteins synthesis, but its role in DHA uptake is not critical, although FABP7 is localized in phospholipid‐rich areas. Our study shows that high contents of DHA associated with FABP7 are necessary to promote early brain development, which prompted us to recommend DHA supplementation early in pregnancy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This will not only help meeting the increasing worldwide demand for proteins, but could contribute towards mitigating the threat imposed to the environment by current agricultural practices in higher‐economy countries (dependence on fossil fuel energy and harmful emissions). Among the legumes, fava bean (<jats:italic>Vicia faba L</jats:italic>.) is a valuable crop. It is a rich source of proteins, fiber, and other non‐nutrient compounds considered beneficial for health. Although a popular source of proteins in many parts of the world, especially in the Middle East, Mediterranean area, and South America, it has yet to be fully exploited in markets where meat is the predominant source of proteins in the diet. Here, fava bean cultivation could not only make a valuable contribution towards protein self‐sufficiency, but could potentially play a role in alleviating the rise in chronic diseases. In addition, fava bean enables symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and can provide a more environmentally friendly substitution for industrial N‐fertilizers with associated improvements in resource efficiency and production costs. From both a food security and environmental sustainability perspective, encouraging both production and consumption of fava bean is a timely and important target. This review focuses on the potential of fava bean as a functional food ingredient to partially replace meat in the human diet.</jats:p>",

We examine the consequences of various climate change scenarios and adaptive management options on water supply by integrating the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and Water Evaluation and Planning models. We show how integrated modeling is useful in projecting the likely effects of management options using limited information. Our study indicates that constructing more reservoirs can alleviate the current water shortage and groundwater depletion problems. However, this option is not necessarily the most effective measure to solve water supply problems; instead, improving irrigation efficiency and changing cropping structure may be more effective. Furthermore, measures to increase water supply have limited effects on water availability under a continuous drought and a dry‐and‐warm climate scenario. We conclude that the combined measure of reducing water demand and increasing supply is the most effective and practical solution for the water shortage problems in the study area.</jats:p>",

To overcome these issues, we develop an approach to generate stated preference data and combine them with revealed preference data to estimate price elasticities from various types of water entitlement sales in the southern Murray‐Darling Basin, Australia. Our results suggest that price elasticities of demand and supply of high security water entitlements are inelastic in the relevant market price range between AUD $1,700 to $2,100 per mega‐liter, and that supply is relatively more inelastic than demand. For lower reliability water entitlements, the price elasticity of demand is estimated to be even more inelastic than high security water entitlements. The price elasticity of supply for general security water entitlements is similar to high security water entitlements, while the supply of low reliability water entitlements is extremely inelastic for our data set. The comparison between the stated and revealed preference data provides strong evidence of support for a data fusion approach; nevertheless, some differences in water sale preferences were found for irrigators choosing not to sell all of their water. The consistency of our results signals support for the use of this methodology in other water basins around the world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The sustainable production and supply of raw materials (“nonenergy raw materials”) and primary energy carriers (“energy raw materials”) is a core element of many policies. The natural resource base for their production and supply, and the access thereto, are limited. Moreover, raw material supply is high on environmental and social impact agendas as well. A broad, quantitative framework that supports decision makers is recommended so as to make use of raw materials and primary energy carriers more sustainably. First, this article proposes a holistic classification of raw materials and primary energy carriers. This is an essential prerequisite for developing an integrated sustainability assessment framework (ISAF). Indeed, frequently, only a subset of raw materials and primary energy carriers are considered in terms of their source, sector, or final application. Here, 85 raw materials and 30 primary energy carriers overall are identified and grouped into seven and five subgroups, respectively. Next, this article proposes a quantitative ISAF for the production and supply of raw materials and primary energy carriers, covering all the sustainability pillars. With the goal of comprehensiveness, the proposed ISAF integrates sustainability issues that have been covered and modeled in quite different quantitative frameworks: ecosystem services; classical life cycle assessment (LCA); social LCA; resource criticality assessment; and particular international concerns (e.g., conflict minerals assessment). The resulting four areas of concerns (i.e., environmental, technical, economic, and social/societal) are grouped into ten specific sustainability concerns. Finally, these concerns are quantified through 15 indicators, enabling the quantitative sustainability assessment of the production and supply of raw materials and primary energy carriers.</jats:p>",

PI is coproduced with pristinamycin II (PII), a member of streptogramin type A antibiotics. The PI biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned and characterized. However, thus far little is understood about the regulation of PI biosynthesis. In this study, a TetR family regulator (encoded by\n            <jats:italic>SSDG_03033</jats:italic>\n            ) was identified as playing a positive role in PI biosynthesis. Its homologue, PaaR, from\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Corynebacterium glutamicum</jats:named-content>\n            serves as a transcriptional repressor of the\n            <jats:italic>paa</jats:italic>\n            genes involved in phenylacetic acid (PAA) catabolism. Herein, we also designated the identified regulator as PaaR. Deletion of\n            <jats:italic>paaR</jats:italic>\n            led to an approximately 70% decrease in PI production but had little effect on PII biosynthesis. Identical to the function of its homologue from\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">C. glutamicum</jats:named-content>\n            , PaaR is also involved in the suppression of\n            <jats:italic>paa</jats:italic>\n            expression. Given that phenylacetyl coenzyme A (PA-CoA) is the common intermediate of the PAA catabolic pathway and the biosynthetic pathway of\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -phenylglycine (\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -Phg), the last amino acid precursor for PI biosynthesis, we proposed that derepression of the transcription of\n            <jats:italic>paa</jats:italic>\n            genes in a Δ\n            <jats:italic>paaR</jats:italic>\n            mutant possibly diverts more PA-CoA to the PAA catabolic pathway, thereby with less PA-CoA metabolic flux toward\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -Phg formation, thus resulting in lower PI titers. This hypothesis was verified by the observations that PI production of a Δ\n            <jats:italic>paaR</jats:italic>\n            mutant was restored by\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -Phg supplementation as well as by deletion of the\n            <jats:italic>paaABCDE</jats:italic>\n            operon in the Δ\n            <jats:italic>paaR</jats:italic>\n            mutant. Altogether, this study provides new insights into the regulation of PI biosynthesis by\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">S. pristinaespiralis</jats:named-content>\n            .\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>\n            A better understanding of the regulation mechanisms for antibiotic biosynthesis will provide valuable clues for\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Streptomyces</jats:named-content>\n            strain improvement. Herein, a TetR family regulator PaaR, which serves as the repressor of the transcription of\n            <jats:italic>paa</jats:italic>\n            genes involved in phenylacetic acid (PAA) catabolism, was identified as playing a positive role in the regulation of pristinamycin I (PI) by affecting the supply of one of seven amino acid precursors,\n            <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>\n            -phenylglycine, in\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</jats:named-content>\n            . To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the interplay between PAA catabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis in\n            <jats:named-content xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" content-type=\"genus-species\" xlink:type=\"simple\">Streptomyces</jats:named-content>\n            strains. Considering that the PAA catabolic pathway and its regulation by PaaR are widespread in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes, it could be suggested that PaaR-dependent regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis might commonly exist.\n          </jats:p>",

In this paper, we quantify the logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum in China under different scenarios. We analyze three scenarios of corn stover logistics from northeast China and three scenarios of sweet sorghum stalks logistics from Inner Mongolia in China. The case study estimates that the logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk to be $52.95/dry metric ton and $52.64/dry metric ton, respectively, for the current labor-based biomass logistics system. However, if the feedstock logistics operation is mechanized, the cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk decreases to $36.01/dry metric ton and $35.76/dry metric ton, respectively. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis to identify the cost factors that cause logistics cost variation. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that labor price has the most influence on the logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk, with a variation of $6 to $12/dry metric ton.</jats:p>"

Climate change is defined as a pattern of weather change through a periodictime that ranges in decades. Literature review suggested that climate-changed locations impacted the arrival of the tourists. The affected elements are shortening duration of snow cover, reduction of the number of days with snowfall, glacier retreat. The dramatic changes lead to the reduction of recreational activities such as skiing, glacier hiking, and ice tubing, that all of these come with higher maintenance cost. Apart from it, the melting of permafrost destabilizes the ground conditions, making activities of Alpanism such as hiking, walking, rock climbing routes becoming more dangerous of rockfall to the tourists and even to the local settlements. Climate change would have four impacts on tourism development: direct impacts, indirect and long-term impact, lifestyle change, and induced impacts. Hence, this study attempted to study the relationship amongst the variables.</jats:p>"

Here we timed the accumulation of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content>s during wheat grain maturation relative to changes in metabolite and transcript pools in different conditions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) availability. We found that the N/S supply ratio modulated the duration of accumulation of S–rich <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content>s and the rate of accumulation of S–poor <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content>s. These changes are likely to be the result of distinct relationships between N and S allocation, depending on the S content of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content>. Most developmental and nutritional modifications in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> synthesis correlated with the abundance of structural gene transcripts. Changes in the expression of transport and metabolism genes altered the concentrations of several free amino acids under variable conditions of N and S supply, and these amino acids seem to be essential in determining <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> expression. The comprehensive data set generated and analyzed here provides insights that will be useful in adapting fertilizer use to variable N and S supply, or for breeding new cultivars with balanced and robust <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GSP</jats:styled-content> composition.</jats:p>",

As a representative of the globally abundant marine <jats:italic>Synechococcus</jats:italic>, strain WH8102 was grown in 16 chemostats up to 52  d at a fixed growth rate with nitrogen–phosphorus ratios (N : P<jats:sub>supply</jats:sub>) of 1–50. Initially, the phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the vessel decreased when the respective nutrient was limiting. Cell growth generally stabilized, although several chemostats had apparent oscillations in biomass. We observed extensive plasticity in the elemental content and ratios. N : P<jats:sub>cell</jats:sub> matched the supply values between N : P<jats:sub>supply</jats:sub> 5 and 20. The C : P<jats:sub>cell</jats:sub> followed a similar trend. In contrast, the mean C : N<jats:sub>cell</jats:sub> was 6.8 and did not vary as a function of supply ratios. We also observed that induction of alkaline phosphatase, the fraction of P allocated to nucleic acids, and the lipid sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol : phosphatidyglycerol ratio inversely correlated with P availability. Our results suggest that this extensive plasticity in the elemental content and ratios depends both on the external nutrient availability as well as past growth history. Thus, our study provides a quantitative understanding of the regulation of the elemental stoichiometry of an abundant ocean phytoplankton lineage.</jats:p>",

Based on a literature review and an interview survey of farmers, this study incorporated the water parallel pricing system of China within a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, where the drought of 2000 is simulated. The 16 provincial irrigation water supplies and  their subsidies were also estimated and introduced into this CGE model. The results demonstrated that the effects on the macro-economy were insignificant. However, the effects on agricultural production, particularly on farming production mainly cultivated in northern areas, were significant. Most farming production sectors employed more capital and labor to prevent losses in output from drought. Agricultural labor was shifted from non-farming agricultural production sectors into farming. Both urban and rural households suffered severe losses in welfare and food consumption, even though they benefited from the additional income. Moreover, rural households suffering the worst losses were located in both northern and southern areas.</jats:p>"

The results of the analysis showed significant differences among the pathways with climate change impact varying from −621 kgCO2e/t to 1924 kgCO2e/t. Landfilling of food waste resulted in the highest impacts and diversion to feed animals resulted in net benefits. The moisture content of the waste proved to be an important factor while the bio-degradability and nutrient value also had an influence.

With 16 Basic Health Units and 6 pharmacists who serve SUS in 26 medication dispensing units (which is to analyze the prescription with the identification of the subject being treated, as this determines the paths taken in this process). Of these units, 6 are managed by a third-party company. In this scenario and considering the period of October, November and December 2011 we found the record of 177 items coming from judicial mandates and 132 items constant from the standardized list. The total number of tablets, dragees, capsules, ampoules or verified units is 3,627,445, of which 1,420,110 units are linked to standardized lists, 2,162,941 units to the Prefectural sub-stock and 44,394 to judicial mandates. However, when transformed into monetary acquisition values, the 44,394 units represent R$ 418,930.28 and the remaining 3,583,051 units, R$ 460,051.19. While each unit originating from two judicial processes is equivalent to R$ 9.44; The standardized values ​​are equivalent to the unit value of R$ 0.13. Virtually all requests are granted on a preliminary basis, or that imply the delivery of medication, without prior defense by the manager. Another result of this study is that the judicial mandates require the Municipalities to bear expenses that in large part should be borne by the States or by the Ministry of Health. Conclusions: It is proposed to reanalyze the dosages of some standardized medications with the possibility of including some judicially requested items. I suggest or study that prescribing doctors, advocates, promoters and judges deepen the study of legislation on the demands and responsibilities of each instance of government. The management opens actions of planning, execution, support and evaluation of results.</jats:p>"
