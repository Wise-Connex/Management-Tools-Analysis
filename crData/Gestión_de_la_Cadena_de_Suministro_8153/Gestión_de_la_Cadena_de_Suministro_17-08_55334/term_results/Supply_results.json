The current study was undertaken to identify and determine the risk factors in PPPs for water supply projects in Iran. After identifying the risk factors using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), the risk priority number of each was assessed. This identified the most critical risk factors, which were then categorized into experimental, legal, financial, and technological subcategories. The fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique and FMEA method were then blended and the FSE technique was modified for measuring the overall risk level. The computational results show that the levels of risk were ranked as follows (highest to lowest): financial, experimental, technological and legal. The level of risk in the financial subcategory was 6.11, in the experimental was 6.05 and in the technological and legal was 5.94 and 5.83, respectively. The overall risk level in PPPs for Iranian water supply projects considering linguistic variables as the criteria was 5.98, which is high. This level of risk confirms the applicability and suitability of the model.</jats:p>",

Notwithstanding concerns about doping and the role of the criminal underworld in sport, relatively little is known about the supply of doping products. Against this backdrop, we analyze the supply of doping products by revisiting and building on the central findings of an empirical study of supply and demand in Italy and argue, first, that supply and demand come together to form a “market”; second, that this market is “quasi-illegal”; and third, that this conceptualization can help inform policymaking in Italy and elsewhere and might have bearing on future research in criminology and other disciplines.</p>",

Demand planning allows supply chain members to focus on the consumer and create optimal value. In demand planning, Point-of-Sale (POS) data are an essential input to the process thereof; however, literature suggests that POS-based demand planning is often overlooked by demand planners in practice.Objective: The main purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which South African clothing retailers use POS data in demand planning.Method: This study followed the grounded theory approach based on the collection of qualitative data. The data collected was analysed following the grounded theory analysis using codes that resulted in various categories which then developed into themes.Findings: Findings suggest that companies within the clothing retail industry make considerable use of POS data and is a fundamental input factor in the demand planning process. However, this study also found that POS data cannot be applied in the planning for all types of clothing products, and that there are variables other than POS data that form a critical part of the demand planning process.Conclusion: POS data plays a fundamental role is the demand planning process and should be accurately collected and used with other qualitative and quantitative factors as an input factor to the demand planning process. The role of POS data in demand planning is expected to grow as customers are becoming increasingly demanding concerning customer service levels.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the proposed optimization algorithm is for tuning the PI controller and reducing the harmonics level. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is introduced for tuning the gain of the controller and the voltage variation of power converter by using PWM pulses. It regulates the DC-link voltage as per the signal harmonics and the active power loss of the system is reduced. Therefore, the accurate compensation current is injected by the SAF devices. The proposed ABC-PI controller-based harmonic compensation method is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink platform. Then, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and the power factor are evaluated. The results of the proposed method are compared with PI controller and PSO-PI controller. The proposed method has fast DC-link voltage response, low THD and good power factor. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Reverse logistics (RL) practices have previously been viewed as a cost drain, but have received greater attention from practitioners because of increasing competition and dwindling margins.Purpose: The purpose of this generic qualitative study was to uncover the main internal and external drivers and barriers of RL within major South African grocery retailers.Method: Eleven face-to-face, semi-structured interviews and one telephonic interview were conducted with participants from four large grocery retailers.Findings: Optimising profitability and cost reduction goals are the identified internal drivers, whereas the main external driver was to reduce the organisations’ environmental impact. A lack of information systems – such as enterprise resource planning systems or warehouse management system software – and infrastructure were revealed as the main internal barriers for organisations’ RL practices, whereas supplier non-compliance and transportation inefficiencies were the main external barriers exposed.Managerial implications: In order to optimise the efficiency of the reverse flow, managers are recommended to devote more capital to RL infrastructure, develop policies to manage supplier behaviour, focus on RL as a revenue generating stream as well as implement information systems to manage the entire reverse flow.Conclusion: All participating grocery retailers follow similar RL processes. Growth in RL practices as well as infrastructure to perform those practices is a future priority for all the reviewed grocery retailers. RL is no longer only a key cost driver, but also provides organisations with many additional opportunities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although recycling is considered the core of a circular economy for returning materials to the supply chain, its procedures are poorly understood. Waste recycling is considered a big source of energy saving and a promoter of CO2 recovery. Besides that, it generates jobs and changes markets worldwide. The Brasilian National Policy on Solid Waste (PNRS) recognizes Waste Pickers as the major social agent in the recycling process responsible for putting Brasil among the ten largest paper-recycling countries in the world. This paper presents an analysis of Brasilian recycling chains of paper and plastics and the main challenges for expanding recycling from Municipal solid waste. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary source related to the recycling supply chain of paper and of the following plastics—High Density Polyethylene (HDPE),Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polypropylene(PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate(PET) and Polystyrene(PS). Enterprises of various sizes, including informal ones and WPs associations/cooperatives, were visited, in the five Brasilian geographic regions, during the years of 2013 and 2014. A nomenclature was defined for the various enterprises that operate in the Brasilian recycling chain. Each node of the plastic and paper recycling chain was described. The main bottleneck observed in these chains is the lack of continuous programs of selective collection with an emphasis on environmental education processes in the 5570 Brasilian municipalities. Several possibilities not only to promote waste recycling but also to increase the productivity of the sorting process are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>The counties traversed by Yala River Catchment in Kenya have been constrained by acute shortages of water resources because of the declining stream flows, which is occasioned by environmental changes, increasing population and changing land uses. This study applied Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model to evaluate past trends and simulate current demand scenarios for the purposes of planning by authorities in regard to future use. The study used historical data (1970-2015) to assess water supply and demand in the catchment for the period 2016 to 2045 by simulation. Calibration and validation were each performed on 10-year streamflow datasets (1991-2000 and 2001-2010 respectively), drawn from 4 gauging stations. Simulations were then conducted for the scenarios namely: Reference (at 2.8% growth rate), High Growth (3.2%), High Growth (3.5%), and Moderated Growth (2.2%). The categories of water demand evaluated in WEAP included: Domestic-Institutional-Municipal, Agriculture, and Industry uses. In a 5-year time-step, WEAP demonstrated resultant increase in water demand for year 2020 by 7.46% from 2016 at Reference Scenario. WEAP further simulated a gradual increase in water demand during subsequent years. This trend would continue for the rest of the scenarios but with variations occasioned by adjustment of variables in WEAP such as population growth rates, monthly variations, annual activity levels, water use rates, water losses and reuse rates, industrial production units, agricultural acreages, and varied demand sites. In conclusion, there were demonstrated substantial increases in water demands within individual scenarios between 2016 to 2045, but these increases were significantly different scenario-by-scenario. The study recommends that supply and demand measures be employed with the aim of regulating activity levels, losses and consumptions so as to meet demands in case any of the studied scenarios would be applicable.</p>"

However, it has been found that it affects the approach to developments in company approaches to sustainable supply chain management within that industry. This article presents the results of an in-depth comparative case study analysis, drawing on 23 interviews with managers of 10 companies from the textile industry. The analysis demonstrates that specific modes of collaboration can both enable an effective SSCM and diminish barriers for policy implementation. The width and depth varies between a collaborative management approach for an effective internal SSCM versus industry collaboration and buyer supplier collaboration to address external barriers and enablers.</jats:p>"

This approach, however, leads to a conflict with the sustainability principle. At the basic level it could be defined as a question: ‘Is the market eager to pay the sustainability cost?’ If it is, then the cost of sustainability shall be determined and explicated in the price of water unit delivered to the customer. If not, sustainability is then jeopardized. The solution to this conflict may be a test from a responsible aspect for the current generation towards water resources. This paper aims to research the management of water resources methods from the aspect of sustainability under the conditions of uncompleted and uncertain information. In this paper, the model for water resources availability forecasting is analysed from the aspect of different influences.</jats:p>",

Today’s successful operation of manufacturing processes views logistics as a high priority to ensure maximum utilization of resources. The material supply of manufacturing processes in the automotive industry is usually based on supermarkets and milk runs. This paper proposes an integrated supply model of manufacturing processes, which includes facility location and assignment. After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to formulate the problem of supermarkets and milk run based supply of machines. The model seeks the optimal location of buffers as well as the optimal assignment of buffers and machines so as to minimize the material handling costs while taking into account order limits of machines and capacities of resources. Next, we demonstrate an enhanced black hole algorithm dealing with multi-objective supply chain model to find the optimal structure of the system. Numerical results demonstrate how the proposed model supports the efficiency, flexibility and reliability of the manufacturing process.</jats:p>"

After a careful literature review, this paper introduces a mathematical model to formulate the problem of supply chain design for blending technologies. The integrated model includes the optimal purchasing strategy depending on the characteristics of components to be mixed in the desired proportion and the costs of supply. The integrated model will be described as a linear programming problem.

Numerous challenges exist in establishing human resource management strategies aligned with strategic operations planning and growth strategies. We generalize the problem of managing talent from a supply–demand standpoint through a resource acquisition lens, to an industrial business case where an organization recruits for multiple roles given a limited pool of potential candidates acquired through a limited number of recruiting channels. In this context, we develop an innovative analytical model in a stochastic environment to assist managers with talent planning in their organizations. We apply supply chain concepts to the problem, whereby individuals with specific competencies are treated as unique products. We first develop a multi-period mixed integer nonlinear programming model and then exploit chance-constrained programming to a linearized instance of the model to handle stochastic parameters, which follow any arbitrary distribution functions. Next, we use an empirical study to validate the model with a large global manufacturing company, and demonstrate how the proposed model can effectively manage talents in a practical context. A stochastic analysis on the implemented case study reveals that a reasonable improvement is derived from incorporating randomness into the problem.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product family design generally aims at overhead reduction due to component commonality meeting various customer needs. Quantity discount is one of the most crucial factors to consider cost reduction effects. However, it also contains the risk of drastic profit decrease when a demand or supply capacity unexpectedly changes. This research aims at proposing an optimal design method of product family with assessment of robustness of expected profit. First, this paper discusses the structure of the optimal design problem of product family considering quantity discount in supply chain. The modeling of quantity discount faces a problem of discontinuous of design spaces. The discontinuity of a design space makes optimization more difficult. This research proposes a method to solve it with reasonable calculation cost by utilizing branch and bound and linear programming. A case study of designing a product family of drip coffee maker demonstrates the application of the proposed method in order to verify it.</jats:p>",

In the simulation part of the proposed approach, an analytical groundwater flow model is used to simulate the flow process in the subsurface. This model is then integrated with two different optimization models where differential evolution (DE) and harmony search (HS) optimization algorithms are used. The objectives of both models are to determine the best dewatering system configuration by considering locations and pumping rates as decision variables. During the search process, the constraints related to drawdown and well locations are included in the optimization by using the penalty function approach. The performance of DE- and HS-based solution approaches is evaluated on a hypothetical excavation site for different well numbers. Identified results indicated that the DE-based solution approach provides slightly better results than those obtained by using the HS-based solution approach.</jats:p>",

These trends changed the distribution process: delivery distances are decreasing, the product variety is increasing, and more products are being sold in smaller quantities. Therefore, the concept of supply chain resilience has gained more recognition in recent years. The scientific literature analysis conducted by the authors indicate several capabilities that influence supply chain resilience. Collaboration, flexibility, redundancy and integration are the most influential capabilities to supply chain resilience. However, the authors identify that the combination of these capabilities to supply chain resilience is under researched. The authors indicate that by combining these capabilities with the upcoming technologies of industry 4.0, supply chain resilience can be achieved. In the future, the authors are planning to conduct further research to identify the influence of these capabilities to supply chain resilience, to quantify supply chain resilience, and to provide further practices of industry 4.0 concept usage for supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

Considering that, supply chain management, as part of enterprise management, cannot ignore the risks and the need for implementation of an adequate risk management strategy. Supply chain, as well as inter-organizational network, is the source of competitive advantage. However, inadequate risk management within a supply chain can lead to interruptions of the chain and to the lack of results at the level of the whole supply chain, as well as at the level of individual partners. Upstream supply chain represents the part of supply chain from suppliers to producer. The objective of this paper is to analyse how and to what extent the structure and the number of partners in this part of the supply chain influence (increase or decrease) supply chain vulnerability. The authors analyse the factors which most commonly affect to upstream supply chain and threaten its functioning. By analysing the supply chains from different area, the authors suggest that the size of the supplier's base can be treated as the resistance factor, but also as a factor of vulnerability.</jats:p>"

High levels of informality have impacts on the benefits that workers receive, especially their pension benefits. I use Argentinean panel data from 1995 to 2008 to construct a structural discrete choice model which estimates the population’s labor path and their pension eligibilities. I find evidence that low-educated workers have difficulties to obtain a pension by the age of 65 and even by age 70. Policy experiments show that if the parameters are fixed as in the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model, there is a slight reduction in the years worked in the formal sector and the percentage of workers who obtain a Full pension. If the pension requirements (minimum age and years contributing) are stricter, there is an increase in the years spent in the formal sector but it is not sufficient to achieve the benchmark level of pension coverage. If the requirements are looser, there is a reduction in the amount of time spent in formality to contribute up to the new threshold.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Providing sustainability of the food supply is becoming increasingly challenging in today’s rapidly changing global economic environment. Food security remains a serious problem, especially in developing countries where the challenge of the sustainable food supply is exacerbated by the rapid rise in the population, limited access to food intake, vulnerability, price volatilities, protection measures imposed by the government, and other distorting influences. Russia is classified as a middle-income country that is nationally self-sufficient in its food supply. However, amid the economic recession and restrictions on foreign trade in food, many households in Russia are becoming increasingly vulnerable to food insecurity. In the case of Russia, this paper aims to assess the sustainability of the food supply, and identify the factors that affect food security. In order to establish the impact of socio-economic variables on food security at the macroeconomic level, a regression model was estimated. The study has identified the factors that influence food security in terms of agricultural production, food self-sufficiency, and foreign trade. The relationships between the regressands and corresponding regressors have been discovered, in view of alternations between positive and negative influences on the dependent variables. Additionally, a significance of the relationships has been measured. The results of the regression analysis suggest that the sustainability of the food supply in Russia is threatened by inflation and a degrading purchasing power of the population from people shifting towards cheaper products of lower quality, while exporters seek higher profits outside the country and thus create food shortages in the domestic market.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that an integrated wetland and urban lake performs better than the urban lake alone. The improved performance was particularly significant in terms of physical parameters such as turbidity, suspended solids, total solids (TS) and nutrients (particularly nitrogen).

Then, the Shannon entropy and weights for a multi-attribute decision-making process are used to calculate the degree of hydrologic alteration. This method is applied to the Xiaoqing River in the city of Jinan, China. The results indicate that the diversities of the monthly mean flow and annual extreme flow show decreasing trends that are attributable to human impacts, while the diversities of the timing of annual extreme, high and low flows, and the rate and frequency of flooding show increasing trends. Meanwhile, the overall degree of hydrologic alteration of the Xiaoqing River in Jinan is 0.747, which belongs to a change in the height. Thus, we suggest that the timing and volume of inter-basin water transfer should be reasonably regulated and that the regulation of peak flooding times and peak flow should be strengthened to make them conform to ecological characteristics during the water resource management of the Xiaoqing River.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the growing and turbulent market of the current world both in national and in international relations, the need for reviewing and assessment of the resiliency of suppliers as one of the new concepts in supply chain management has been prioritized. In addition, globalization, increasing the regulations of governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers’ request and pressure regarding environmental issues has led organizations to evaluate the measures necessary to implement green supply chain management, to improve their environmental and economic performance. The subject of selecting and evaluating suppliers on green supply chain with resilience capability first requires the identification of the supplier evaluation criteria so that it considers the resiliency of the supply chain concurrent with the concepts of green supply chain. Secondly, right tools should be used for the decision. Considering all the criteria and indicators in conditions of uncertainty encourages the development and application of methods, such as fuzzy theory and grey systems theory. In this research, a comprehensive model for evaluating green resilience supply chain network is provided. In order to apply both quantitative and qualitative criteria, the possibility of making the target based criteria dimensionless along the cost or benefit criteria, the use of experts’ opinions in the allocation of weights to the criteria and indicators using grey numbers, grey relational analysis are developed and improved. In the end, the implementation of the proposed model is explained step by step in a case study and the future conclusions and recommendations are suggested.</jats:p>"

The results show that the location of stagnation points varied markedly in different areas after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam, with the large extent of downward movement during flood periods due to the hydrodynamic enhancement of the Yangtze River in the North Branch, while the movement range was smaller in the South Branch. Along with the runoff changes, the variation extent from big to small is North Channel, South Passage and North Passage, while the rank order changed as South Passage, North Channel and North Passage as valued by the tidal changes. After the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam, the movement range of stagnation points reduced because of the reduction in river discharge. Thus, it can be considered that the turbidity maximum zone has a decreasing trend which might lead to changes in geomorphic features of the Yangtze Estuary.</jats:p>",

This analytical solution was verified by comparing with experimental results, and the predicted pressure distribution around the defective pipe is proved to be consistent with numerical simulations using the finite element method. From the parametric analysis, the infiltration rate increases as the defect position changes from top to bottom on the pipe, and the effect of defect position is not significant if the water head above the defect is 10 times greater than pipe radius. An approximated solution for estimating the groundwater flow infiltration rate through a circular orifice on the pipe is proposed as well. From the verification and parametric studies, this proposed analytical solution is proved to be an efficient approach for the estimation of groundwater infiltration through a defective pipe.</jats:p>",

For the food industry, energy cost in the supply chain of perishable food is quite high because of cold-chain transport and storage. Therefore, the efficacies of cold chain management and inventory control are the key factors that increase the efficiency of food supply chain and make it more ecological. This research analyzes the degradation process of perishable food and determines the optimal temperature of the cold chain as well as the optimal price to maximize the channel profit. We prove that there is an optimal price with a certain temperature and develop an efficient search algorithm to find the optimal temperature. We also perform sensitivity analyses to test which parameters affect the channel profit significantly. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed models.</jats:p>"

To date, area-based matrix models have been applied assuming either even-aged or uneven-aged forest management. However, both management systems may be applied simultaneously due to land-use constraints or the rationality of combining the systems, which is called any-aged management. We integrated two different Markov chain models, one for even-aged and another for uneven-aged forest management, in an area-based approach to analyze wood supply from any-aged forest management. We evaluate the impacts of parameterizing the model based on available data sets, namely permanent and temporary Finnish National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots and a plot-level simulator to determine transitions due to different types of thinning treatments, and present recommendations for the related methodological choices. Our overall observation is that the combined modelling chain simulated the development of both the even- and uneven-aged forest structures realistically. Due to the flexibility of the implementation, the approach is very well suited for situations where scenario assumptions need to be varied according to expected changes in silvicultural practices or land-use constraints, for example.</jats:p>"

The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer’s optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a “diamond-shaped” supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer’s profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts—in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units—alleviate this coordination problem. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

I expand on the Fisher (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#jbl12163-bib-0021\" />) framework by offering a more comprehensive understanding of when it pays off for firms to deploy resources to achieve supply chain fit. I argue that it is simplistic to assume that perfect supply chain fit will always lead to improved financial performance because the benefits generated by perfect supply chain fit might be offset by the resources deployed to achieve that fit. In order to execute this research I use archival and survey data to evaluate the moderating effects of six dimensions of environmental uncertainty (e.g., munificence, market dynamism, technological dynamism, technical complexity, product diversity, and geographic dispersion) on the relationship between supply chain fit and financial performance.</jats:p>",

As a consequence, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope techniques are not popular for determining algal growth rates. To counter these issues, this study used BG11 medium to cultivate Microcystis in the laboratory. First, the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values of the culture medium and the algae are determined. Then, based on changes in isotope fractionation before and after cell division, a function μ = 1.32(1 + x)−0.52 relating growth rate and stable isotope fractionation is established. By substituting stable isotope values from Taihu Lake water and Microcystis into this function, the growth rate of the Microcystis in Taihu Lake is calculated to be 0.64 d−1 in May and 0.12 d−1 in September, with an average growth rate of 0.42 d−1. By incorporating most of the above-mentioned factors influencing isotope fractionation, this method can determine the growth rate of algae based directly on the stable isotope fractionation relationship, enabling simple and practical determination of algae growth rates.</jats:p>",

To this end, a groundwater flow model was developed and the sharp-interface approximation combined with the Ghyben–Herzberg equation was used. A correction factor that accounts for the hydrodynamic dispersion occurring at the brackish zone was also incorporated in the analysis. The model results show that under the current pumping strategy, the saltwater intrusion front extent is vast, posing a serious threat to the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation in the area. The management goal is to find the alternative pumping scenarios for the existing well network that will prevent further spreading of saltwater intrusion. Several water management scenarios were developed, taking into account the effects of climate change, the increase in water supply demand and the expected population growth. The results indicate that controlling the propagation of seawater intrusion in Katapola necessitates the periodic deactivation of most of the pumping wells and the design of alternative plans in order to meet the increasing water demand.</jats:p>",

Specifically, I investigate whether the decrease in the rate of return to women's work discourages them from participating in the labor force by simulating expected net payroll tax rates and dependent benefits. Dependent benefits may reduce the net return to women's work, as they usually pay the full payroll tax without receiving marginal benefits for additional earnings if they claim benefits based on their husbands' earnings records. The results show that high net payroll tax rates reduce married women's work incentives, particularly those near retirement age. (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> H24, H55, J22)</jats:p>",

Anthropologists and cultural historians have pointed out that, in a western European context, this also entailed the marginalization of the slaughterhouses, which were excluded from urban life and made anonymous and invisible. This article examines the case of the Moscow public abattoir (1886–88) and argues that, instead of being marginalized, it emerged as one of the city's landmarks due to its important symbolic role in the Russian discussions on modernization and ‘Europeanness’.</jats:p>",

This paper presents how data on networks and their immediate environment together with graph analysis can be used to estimate the severity of pipe failure consequences. A case study concerning a large water and wastewater utility revealed that ca. 14% of the water distribution pipes and ca. 25% of the sewers had potentially severe failure consequences with regard to at least one factor considered. The most detrimental failure modes connected to these pipes were identified. An assessment of the most important information needs revealed that a number of crucial source data sets were missing. The results can be used to support asset management decisions aiming at risk alleviation, e.g. when estimating the resources needed for network maintenance, condition inspections or renovations and when planning excavation works.</jats:p>",

The assumption is applied through a comparison of 10 years of financial data (2006–2016) from point source water supplies (accompanied by Emergency Expenditure – EMMEX investments – emergency water trucking, treatment and distribution) and piped water supply systems in two districts of the Ethiopian Central Highland region of Amhara. This study concluded that on average point source water supplies accessing shallow groundwater were non-functional for an average of 60 months in a project period of 10 years. To supplement the water supply demand during the non-functionality period, emergency water trucking and treatment was provided over a 10 year period at a per capita cost of USD 2,257. In comparison, the per capita cost of piped water supplies was USD 65 for a project period of 20 years. The study concluded that piped water supplies are less expensive than point source supplies when CAPEX and emergency water supply provision costs are considered under a life cycle cost analysis.</jats:p>",

Studies that seek to generalize the characterization of performance curves of centrifugal pumps are extremely useful. A study was carried out on the dimensionless characteristics of the operating conditions of centrifugal pumps for preliminary design estimations of water supply systems aiming at energy efficiency. The research consisted of the analysis of performance curves of centrifugal pumps from which data was collected regarding the point of maximum yield (PMY). The curves and the equations obtained were made dimensionless so that the information could be extrapolated to other situations. A case study was conducted in the Water Supply System of Vale Campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) to demonstrate the application of those equations and curves developed. The dimensionless equations were useful to determine which discharge should be adopted so that the system would be more efficient hydro and energetically and, also, to determine how much more energy would be consumed in the case of alteration of the point of operation of the pump by a throttling valve.</jats:p>",

Usually, the limited budget of the creator is manually divided into several perks (reward options), that should fit various market demand and further bring different monetary contributions for the campaign. Therefore, it is very challenging for each creator to design an effective campaign. To this end, in this paper, we aim to enhance the funding performance of the newly proposed campaigns, with a focus on optimizing the product supply of perks. Specifically, given the expected budget and the perks of a campaign, we propose a novel solution to automatically recommend the optimal product supply to every perk for balancing the expected return of this campaign against the risk. Along this line, we define it as a constrained portfolio selection problem, where the risk of each campaign is measured by a multi-task learning method.  Finally, experimental results on the real-world crowdfunding data clearly prove that the optimized product supply can help improve the campaign performance significantly, and meanwhile, our multi-task learning method could more precisely estimate the risk of each campaign.</jats:p>",

A decline in Indonesia's position is due to saturation of the Indonesian coffee export destination countries which results in declining demand for export of Indonesian coffee. The quantity of Indonesian robusta coffee supplied to the international market depends on secured supply of domestic raw materials and the efficiency of supply chain network. Efforts to ensure the domestic coffee supply is done through efficiency analysis on each member of the supply chain that forms the supply chain network. Efficiency measurement in supply chain network is performed using the New DEA Model developed by Liang et al. The measurement technique of DEA is gradually the efficiency of the production unit (product flow) of each actor (seller and buyer) on the supply chain. The efficiency level of each actor can determine the efficiency of the supply chain network. This is because of the relationship of input and output between seller and buyer so that the final output of supply chain network will produce. New DEA model is more appropriate to use in supply efficiency mechanism that can be cooperative.</jats:p>"

Influent and final disinfected effluent from the city's wastewater treatment plant, as well as 11 receiving water stations, were monitored for indicator organisms (i.e. total and fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, male-specific bacteriophage (MS2), and the Bacteroidales) and several pathogens (i.e. Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium oocysts, infectious Cryptosporidium, and Norovirus GI and GII). QMRA annualized risks of infection for selected pathogens enteric viruses, Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Estimated median annualized risk for recreational exposure in either disinfected secondary and/or filtered disinfected secondary effluent is on the order of 1.1 × 10−3 per person per year (pppy) for enteric viruses and would be roughly one order of magnitude lower if local receiving water dilution of the treatment plant effluent was taken into account. Estimated median annual risk for recreation exposure in disinfected secondary effluent is 1.8 × 10−3 pppy for Cryptosporidium and 1 log10 less with filtration during the summer months. The estimated median annual risk for landscape exposure (e.g. golfing) to secondary disinfected effluent is 7.6 × 10−7 pppy for enteric viruses. Estimated median annualized risk is 1.7 × 10−7 pppy for enteric viruses and 3.0 × 10−5 to 3.6 × 10−6 pppy for parasites for use of secondary disinfected effluent with irrigated agriculture. Estimated annualized risks for recreational exposure to the local receiving waters were approximately 10 to 1,000 times greater than direct recreational exposure to the final filtered and disinfected effluent. All risk estimates associated with exposure to final treated plant effluent (i.e. secondary filtered and disinfected) were close to or lower than the California level of acceptable annual risk of infection of 10−4 pppy for recreational exposure. Risk estimates provide further evidence to support the use of seasonal treatment limits requiring summer filtration for public health protection.</jats:p>",

The Smart PLS software is used to compute content validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and predictive relevance model. The companies in Pakistan are less oriented towards environment and supply chain. However, due to the pressure from institutes, they are persuaded to adopt GSCM practices in their operations, which eventually boost their performance. The outcome of GSCM practices results in saving the environment, creating a better social image, cost reduction and profitability which would enable managers to be able to know strategic orientations (both environmental and SCM) rather than depending on the issues of institutional pressures and monitoring directions of strategies for Green SCM.</jats:p>"

This key performance indicator, entitled demand–supply mismatch (DSM), captures the fact that low variation in inventory productivity relative to variation in demand is indicative of the superior synchronization of demand‐ and supply‐side operations. Applying the Fama and French (1993) three‐factor model augmented with a momentum factor (Carhart 1997), we find that zero‐cost portfolios formed by buying the two lowest and selling the two highest quintiles of DSM stocks yield abnormal stock returns of up to 1.13%. These strong market anomalies related to DSM are observed over the entire sample period and persist after controlling for alternative inventory productivity measures and firm characteristics that are known to predict future stock returns. Further, we reveal that DSM is indicative of lower future earnings and lower sales growth and provide evidence that the observed market inefficiency results from investors’ failure to incorporate all of the information that inventory contains into the pricing of stocks. </jats:p>",

Through an in-depth, comparative study of two Chinese IT service providers for Japanese clients, this article explores how the work and employment relations in the supplier firm are shaped by the institutional contexts of both the supplier firm and the lead firm as well as by the nature of the global supply chain in which they are located. The article shows how the intersection of global supply chains and local institutional environments creates potential gaps between what is required by the lead firms and what is feasible within the supplier firms. Therefore, managers in the supplier firm have to negotiate ways of managing these expectations in the light of their own institutional constraints and possibilities. We identify three forms of adaptation made by the suppliers that we describe as wholesale adaptation, ceremonial adaptation and minimal adaptation to lead firms’ expectations. We argue that these interactions and forms of adaptation can be extended and explored more generally in global supply chains and provide the basis for a fruitful integration of institutional approaches with global supply chain analysis. </jats:p>",

Changes in left ventricular stroke volume and heart rate correlate to MBV but not to CBV. These results suggest the increased CBV after the ITP strains is brain specific, suggesting cerebral vasodilatation. Within the strains, cerebral oxygen saturation only decreases in sVM, indicating strong increment rather than decrement in ITP may be more challenging for the brain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most recommerce providers have moved to a quality‐dependent process for the acquisition of used products. They acquire the products via websites at which product holders submit upfront quality statements and receive quality‐dependent acquisition prices for their used devices. Motivated by this development of reverse logistics practice, the aim of this study is to analyze the product assessment process of a recommerce provider in detail. To this end, we first propose a sequential bargaining model with complete information which captures the individual behavior of the recommerce provider and the product holder. We determine the optimal strategies of the product holder and the recommerce provider in this game. We find that the resulting strategies lead to an efficient allocation, although the recommerce provider can absorb most of the bargaining potential due to his last mover advantage. In a second step, we relax the assumption of complete information and include uncertainty about the product holder's valuation of the product. We show the trade‐off underlying the recommerce provider's optimal counteroffer decision and analyze the optimal strategy, using a logistic regression approach on a real‐life dataset of nearly 6,000 product submissions. The results reveal a significant improvement potential, compared to the currently applied strategy. </jats:p>",

Two main estimation methods are proposed. The first (the direct method) is used to measure the value of government‐provided, legal‐tender coin supply only. Two varieties of the direct method are proposed. Additionally, an indirect method is proposed which relies on a combination of information about nominal GDP with an assumption regarding the evolution of velocity in time, and which can be used to calculate coin supply and M2. Both methods rely on benchmark values known for certain years, but no particular benchmark is determinant for the results. The new methodologies set out here may serve as a blueprint for a similar reconstruction of coin and money supply series for other economies for which analogous data are available.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, we analyze a small open overlapping-generations model in which fertility and an old agent’s labor supply (retirement time) are endogenized with pay-as-you-go pension and child allowances. We find that how the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate affects the fertility rate depends on whether an old agent retires. When an old agent fully retires, then the size of the interest rate and fertility rate determine the effect of the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate on the fertility rate. When an old agent works, the pay-as-you-go pension tax rate certainly reduces the fertility rate. In addition, how child allowances affect the fertility rate depends on whether an old agent works. If an old agent retires fully, then an increase in the child allowance tax rate increases the fertility rate. When an old agent works, this is not necessarily true, which suggests that an old agent’s labor status should be taken into account when we evaluate the effects of the social security system on economic variables. In addition, we examine the effect of the social security tax rates on welfare and provide numerical examples.</jats:p>",

Based on laboratory experiment, field investigation and numerical simulation, the spatial distributions of suspended sediment (SS) under the gravity-flow, jacking-flow and back-flow patterns were quantitatively analysed. An annular flume experiment was conducted to determine the critical starting shear stresses of the sediments in the flood and dry seasons. By numerical experiment, the SS transport under different flow patterns was explored. Several results stand out. (1) The critical starting shear stresses of the sediments in the flood and dry seasons were 0.35 N·m−2 and 0.29 N·m−2, respectively. (2) Due to the strongest flow disturbance and scouring effect, SS under the gravity-flow pattern was characterized by the highest loads. The lowest SS was observed during the jacking-flow pattern, which could be attributed to the lowest water level gap between the lake and external rivers. The loads ranged from 0.053 kg·m−3 to 0.068 kg·m−3. (3) Under the back-flow pattern, SS in the north lake was evidently influenced by the Yangtze River, and the mean value was approximately 0.12 kg·m−3. With the gradually weakened back-flow impact, the SS load was decreased from the north to the middle of the lake.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the automotive industry, many firms source key components from different suppliers, even though the components may function interdependently. In this study, we investigate how component level interdependence impacts quality performance and analyze how various operational factors moderate this relation. We synthesize information from several case studies to model the quality challenges faced by an automotive firm. For several sub‐assemblies that go into its products, the firm sourced key components from two different suppliers. The sub‐assemblies would fail whenever a component fails, but due to interdependent operations, failure of one component could cause the failure of the other. The firm found it challenging to improve the suppliers' quality performance as it was difficult to trace the failures to specific components. Our analysis reveals that – (i) the impact of interdependence is governed by the supply chain structure: reducing the interdependence between components improves quality when suppliers provide the components, but reducing interdependence worsens quality when the firm manufactures the entire sub‐assembly; and (ii) the relation between interdependence and quality performance is moderated by factors such as penalties, production costs, and interdependence costs. Additionally, we find that quality performance is lower when the firm outsources the components than when the firm manufactures the entire sub‐assembly. We identify coordinating mechanisms that leverage incentives and penalties to bridge the quality performance gap. </jats:p>",

A multilevel factorial design was used to determine the relevant ranges of the two factors for optimization. A 22 central composite design (CCD) was then used to develop mathematical correlation models for the optimum operating conditions. The main effect of PACl dose was the most significant factor on all the responses. For permeability, both the main effect of FRT and FRT–PACl dose interactions were found to be insignificant. The optimum PACl dose and FRT for the feed water were 20 mg/L and 14 min, respectively. Corresponding permeate turbidity, UV254 and permeability were 0.15 ± 0.01 NTU, 0.003 ± 0.001 cm−1 and 62.0 ± 9.52 Lm−2 h−1 bar−1, respectively. Experimental validation runs confirmed the reliability of the predicted optimal conditions thus implying that CCD models can be used to predict/optimize the quality and quantity of permeate from hybrid coagulation–ultrafiltration systems for potable water treatment.</jats:p>",

What is required is the review, explore and channelize and have a good market structure essential for the success of the programs implemented by the government which are designed for uplift of population in whole. Indian market is dominated by unorganized retailing due to which there is heavy loss and escalation in the prices of commodities. This study is focused on determining the existence of different supply chains in the Bidar district of Karnataka involved in marketing of mangoes. The study is conducted by the structured questionnaires for the different intermediaries. It involve knowing the existing marketing chains in the district, Problem faced by the intermediaries involved in the marketing of mangoes and fruits in general and the value addition to the products, post-harvest facilities present in the district involvement of the APMC for fruit marketing and its reach and profit to the famers. There are no post-harvest facilities and separate APMC regulated fruit market, co-operative marketing facility is not there and involvement of intermediaries is escalating he price of the produce and producers share in consumer price is very less.</jats:p>"

The study is performed using an hourly resolved model based on a linear optimization algorithm. The geographical, technical and economic potentials of different forms of RE resources enable the option of building a super grid between different North American regions. North America (including the U.S., Canada and Mexico in this paper), is divided into 20 sub-regions based on their population, demand, area and electricity grid structure. Four scenarios have been evaluated: region-wide, country-wide, area-wide and an integrated scenario. The levelised cost of electricity is found to be quite attractive in such a system, with the range from 63 €/MWhel in a decentralized case and 42 €/MWhel in a more centralized and integrated scenario. Electrical grid interconnections significantly reduce the storage requirement and overall cost of the energy system. Among all RE resources, wind and solar PV are found to be the least-cost options and hence the main contributors to fossil fuel substitution. The results clearly show that a 100% RE-based system is feasible and a real policy option at a modest cost. However, such a tremendous transition will not be possible in a short time if policy-makers, energy investors and other relevant organizations do not support the proposed system.</jats:p>"

Based on various sources, in this research is calculated the magnitude of the demand in this capital of cattle that came from different geographic spaces. Through the analysis of the prices of these commodities are determined the periods of meat shortage experienced in this capital during this century and are explained the factors that caused these crises.</jats:p>"

Experimental results demonstrated that membrane fouling could be mitigated by extending the pre-adsorption time. The molecular weight (MW) distribution of water samples was determined by liquid chromatography – organic carbon detector (LC-OCD) and results showed that the mechanism of PAC controlling fouling was attributed to a decrease in the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of raw water via extending the pre-adsorption time. Fouling indexes (FIs) were used to evaluate membrane fouling potential and the results showed that polysaccharides (PS) and proteins (PN) were greatly responsible for membrane fouling. Therefore, prolonging the PAC pre-adsorption time and decreasing the PS and PN content in raw water are the main measurement for the alleviation of membrane fouling when PAC is used as the pretreatment in waterworks.</jats:p>",

Quantification of loss was based on weight or volume, consistent with direct measurement methods of the Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard 2016 and qualitative techniques were used to identify the drivers of the loss and contextualise the findings. Postharvest loss was found to be between 40.3% (55.34 t) and 55.9% (29.61 t) of the total harvestable product. It was determined that between 68.6% and 86.7% of undamaged, edible, harvested tomatoes were rejected as outgrades and consequently discarded due to product specifications. Between 71.2% and 84.1% of produced tomatoes were left in the field and not harvested. This study highlights significant factors contributing to high levels of food loss and waste. Edible products are being removed from the commercial food supply chain, rejected as outgrades deemed cosmetically defective due to market-based decisions. With only 44.1% and 59.7% of the harvestable crop reaching the consumers of the two supply chains, respectively, it is perhaps more appropriate to describe a food “waste” chain as opposed to a food “supply” chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The San Francisco Bay Area is no stranger to the emerging water challenges of climate change and population growth. As California bounces back from one of the most severe droughts in the state's history, utilities are forced to look for more resilient ways to manage their water resources. In the search for enhanced water reliability and resiliency, water providers must identify viable and innovative ways to increase water supplies and decrease demands. These decisions will be highly dependent on local characteristics, and the population dynamics that greatly affect supply, demand, and adaptation capacity in each region. This article explores the evolving supply and demand dynamics in 26 interconnected water utilities in the Bay Area. These utilities reflect not only the challenges that much of the state is facing due to the ongoing drought, but also the stresses of a growing population and shifting socioeconomic characteristics. The region has made significant investments in water efficiency and conservation that have helped increase resilience during the current drought, but conservation can only go so far and many uncertainties remain about future directions for supply and demand management. We explore: (1) how the supply and demand landscapes have evolved in these utilities over the past few decades, (2) what the main drivers have been, and (3) identify opportunities for the region to move forward in response to changing dynamics. The result is a holistic perspective that can help inform water managers and policy makers in preparation for the future. <jats:italic>WIREs Water</jats:italic> 2017, 4:e1240. doi: 10.1002/wat2.1240</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Engineering Water &gt; Planning Water</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Human Water &gt; Rights to Water</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Science of Water &gt; Water and Environmental Change</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

The analyses covered accurate data of water usage (recorded every 1 minute) in the city on the day of the final match. The obtained results were compared with the data for the same days of the week (Sundays) but with no such important events. A completely different trend in water usage was documented during the television broadcast, including: exponential and short-term increases and decreases in water demand immediately after the end of the successive parts of the football match. The deviations in water usage from the normal trend for the same day of the week and the same hours ranged from −318 to more than 550 m3·h−1 (calculated on an hourly basis). Therefore, water usage can be a good indicator of the interest of audiences in television programmes, particularly in those gathering millions of viewers, such as broadcasts of global sporting events.</jats:p>",

We study this phenomenon by focusing on requirements and mechanisms for internal supply chain integration (SCI). Using qualitative interview data, we examine how managers in manufacturing firms integrate internal supply chain activities. We elaborate and extend the information processing view by studying why organizations integrate (integration requirements) and how integration mechanisms are associated with different integration requirements. Four patterns of integration requirement–mechanism linkages emerged from our study, depicting integration mechanisms that are associated with a particular integration requirement, and those that are not. We provide a detailed examination of the multidimensional nature of integration requirements, as well as an increased understanding of how integration mechanisms are used to manage different integration requirements. These findings offer deeper insights into organizational integration, enhancing the understanding of integration in the context of internal supply chains, while also contributing to the literature on organizational design. For supply chain managers, these findings describe ways in which organizational design decisions can support internal SCI efforts with varying aims.</jats:p>",

Under high supply aggradational conditions, this can result in spatially non‐uniform stratigraphic patterns, and the morphodynamic influence of heterogeneous stratigraphy during subsequent degradational periods is poorly understood and has not been studied through physical modelling. A flume experiment was conducted to analyse channel response where alternate bars were developed in a gravel–sand mixture under constant discharge and sediment supply before two supply increases led to the development of heterogeneous stratigraphy beneath alternate bars. The supply was then reduced back to the initial supply rate, causing degradation through that self‐formed stratigraphy. Stratigraphic samples were collected, and the bed topography and flow depth were measured frequently, which were used with a two‐dimensional hydrodynamic model to characterize flow conditions. Migrating alternate bars stabilized during the first equilibrium phase, creating bed surface sorting patterns of coarse bar tops and fine pools. During the first supply increase, the bars remained stable as the pools aggraded. During the second supply increase, the pools aggraded further, causing the boundary shear stress over the bar tops to increase until the bars gained the capacity to migrate and eventually stabilize in new locations. As aggradation occurred, the original sediment sorting patterns were preserved in the subsurface. During the degradational phase, the pools experienced incision and the bars eroded laterally, but this lateral erosion ceased when coarse sediment previously deposited during the bar‐building phase became exposed. The results suggest that if a sediment supply increase is capable of filling the pools, it can cause stable bars to migrate and the bed to be reworked. These findings also show that heterogeneous stratigraphy can play an important role in determining whether bars persist or disappear after a sediment supply reduction.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the leakage power increases dramatically as the supply/threshold voltage continues to scale down. These two issues pose severe reliability problems for complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Because both the NBTI and leakage are dependent on the input vector of the circuit, we present an input vector control (IVC) method based on a linear programming algorithm, which can co-optimize circuit aging and power dissipation simultaneously. In addition, our proposed IVC method is combined with the supply voltage assignment technique to further reduce delay degradation and leakage power. Experimental results on various circuits show the effectiveness of the proposed combination method.</jats:p>"

Chlorine assisted disinfection is common and economical, but can generate disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that may be of health concern. DBPs are formed due to the reaction of chlorine with naturally occurring organic and inorganic substances in water. Currently, various innovative technologies are being developed as alternative approaches for preventing DBPs during water treatment. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a novel combination of high efficiency flow filtration and UV disinfection treatment system for the removal of Bacillus globigii (B. globigii) spores in water. The filtration system consists of a charged membrane filter (CMF) that not only helps to remove suspended particles but also reduces the impact of other impurities including bio organisms. In order to get most performance details, the CMF was evaluated at clean, half-life, and end of life (EOL) conditions along with 100% UV transmittance (UVT). In addition, the effectiveness of the UV system was evaluated as a stand alone system at 100% and 70% EOL intensity. The study was conducted at the US EPA's Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Facility in Cincinnati, OH, using B. globigii, a surrogate for B. anthracis spores. This non-chemical environmentally-friendly CMF/UV combination system and the stand alone UV unit showed greater than 6.0 log removal of B. globigii during the tests.</jats:p>",

The main advantage of the proposed resonant circuit is the absence of a high-permeability dynamic transformer. A high-frequency pulsating voltage gain can be achieved through a double resonance phenomenon. Both resonant tailing behavior and higher harmonics are suppressed by the improved resonant circuit, which also contributes to the generation of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, the proposed circuit can realize impedance matching and can also optimize the transduction efficiency. The complete design and implementation procedure for the power supply is described and has been validated by implementation of the proposed power supply to drive a portable EMAT. The circuit simulation results show close agreement with the experimental results and thus confirm the validity of the proposed topology. The proposed circuit is suitable for use as a portable EMAT excitation power supply that is fed by a low-voltage source.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the electronic devices manufactured are used in daily life and with the miniaturization process of these devices, in the day to day life there is a risk of drop impact failure. It has been important to analyze and ensure the reliability of any electronic devices under every type of loading. Drop impact is not only loading that can affect reliability, but the simultaneous thermal load, moisture, convection is also acting. Smaller devices like cell phones, laptops, tablets are more prone to accidental impact loads which create board interconnects failure by frequent drop occurrence. Therefore, a multi-dimensional approach is taking place in research to study product reliability. In this paper, comprehensive study of drop and shock test is done on Quad Flat No-lead (QFN) package board of two different thickness. The computation setup is done with thermal analysis by providing power to die of the package which creates non-uniform temperature distribution during the drop testing analysis. This way drop test is coupled with a thermal load which is more realistic analysis. Our study depends on young’s modulus, density, CTE, thermal conductivity, specific heat and Poisson’s ratio of the material. Therefore, Experimental work includes material properties characterization of two boards to get temperature dependent Coefficient of thermal expansion, poison’s ratio and young’s modulus values using Thermal mechanical analyzer (TMA), the Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and Universal testing machine. Finite element analysis (FEA) method is used for computational analysis. Effect of impact loading for two boards has been done to investigate board and solder joint reliability due thickness and layer stack-ups in PCBs in environmental condition and at elevated temperature. For computational analysis, the assembly is subjected to the drop test per JEDEC standards. [12] The main purpose of this work is to study the impact of drop test with the powered package and how the reliability of any assembly changes with changing the stiffness of printed circuit board. The comparison of the boards has been made to understand the effect of PCB layer stack-ups, thickness, and temperature effect on the reliability of solder interconnects by considering the stress-strain generation that is induced in the PCBs during the drop test.</jats:p>",

A sample of 415 companies’ data was collected from the Chinese manufacturing industry. There are five predictors, including green distribution, green purchasing, green manufacturing, green information system, and eco-design, that were measured for the GSC practices. The GSC practices were measured by five predictors, including green distribution, green purchasing, green manufacturing, green information system, and eco-design. By using exploratory analysis and linear multiple regression analysis, the findings show that except for green distribution, rest of the independent variables have been found to be positively significant to predict enterprise performance. However, the green purchasing has revealed the greatest impact on enterprise performance. Therefore, senior management of the enterprises should implement green practices in their supply chain to increase the overall performance. In future, researchers can conduct comparative studies between manufacturing industry and other industries. In addition, they may bring in some other independent variables, including green logistics, co-operation with customers, and green transportation system. In this research, we estimate the economic and environmental performances together as enterprise performance. But in future, researchers may also calculate the economic and environmental performances separately. </jats:p>",

The study assessed the effect of different factors on Escherichia coli quantities in DW in household water storage containers in suburban and rural villages in Laos and Thailand. Higher E. coli concentrations in DW were found in Laos compared to Thailand, especially in households without toilets (in Laos) and in rural rather than in suburban villages. In suburban Laos, house material, storage container types and lack of toilets were significantly associated with E. coli contamination of DW, whereas in rural Laos, corresponding significant factors were rain-fed water, containers with lids and lack of toilets. In suburban Thailand, rain-fed water, storage container types and container cleaning frequency were significantly associated with DW contamination, while house materials, manually collected rainwater and container cleaning frequency were associated with contamination in rural Thailand. Socio-demographic characteristics were less associated with E. coli contamination of DW in this study. Treatment of household stored water (e.g. boiling), regular cleaning of rain jars as well as the provision of household toilets, especially in Laos, can provide barriers against E. coli contamination of DW.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Variability on the physical characteristics of feedstock has a relevant effect on the reactor’s reliability and operating cost. Most of the models developed to optimize biomass supply chains have failed to quantify the effect of biomass quality and preprocessing operations required to meet biomass specifications on overall cost and performance. The Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) model estimates the harvesting, collection, transportation, and storage cost while considering the stochastic behavior of the field-to-biorefinery supply chain. This paper proposes an IBSAL-SimMOpt (Simulation-based Multi-Objective Optimization) method for optimizing the biomass quality and costs associated with the efforts needed to meet conversion technology specifications. The method is developed in two phases. For the first phase, a SimMOpt tool that interacts with the extended IBSAL is developed. For the second phase, the baseline IBSAL model is extended so that the cost for meeting and/or penalization for failing in meeting specifications are considered. The IBSAL-SimMOpt method is designed to optimize quality characteristics of biomass, cost related to activities intended to improve the quality of feedstock, and the penalization cost. A case study based on 1916 farms in Ontario, Canada is considered for testing the proposed method. Analysis of the results demonstrates that this method is able to find a high-quality set of non-dominated solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, population ageing is accelerating, i.e., the share of older persons in the population is increasing. The population ageing can have considerable impacts on economic growth, energy use and related carbon emissions, affecting sustainable development. A few studies have analyzed the issue by econometric methods, decomposition and CGE modeling. To facilitate understanding of the simulated results from empirical studies, we developed an analytical general equilibrium model to study the population ageing impact on energy-related emissions, focusing on the long-term potential of economic development by considering the interactions between key productive resources, including labor, capital, and energy. Based on a special case of Cobb–Douglas production function, we show that population ageing can result in considerably less emissions at a lower rate than the ageing in the long term. For example, the reduced global emissions in 2050 can be equivalent to one-recent-year emissions in Japan in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. We also find that the price elasticity of energy supply is the most important parameter to determine the potential impact of population ageing on energy use and related emissions. In the future, the price elasticity of energy supply may become more inelastic than today due to strict climate policy and increasing extraction cost of fossil fuels. Hence, the ageing impact on emissions may be diminishing over time.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two L‐Band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiometer missions, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) currently provide sea‐surface salinity (SSS) measurements. At this frequency, salinity is measured in the first centimetre below the sea surface, which makes it very sensitive to the presence of fresh water lenses linked to rain events. A relationship between salinity anomaly (ΔS) and rain rate (RR) is derived in the Pacific intertropical convergence zone from SMOS SSS measurements and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) RR. It is then used to develop an algorithm to estimate RR from SMOS SSS measurements. A heuristic function is developed to correct the SMOS‐estimated negative RR due to measurement noise. Correlation between SMOS and SSMIS RR and between SMOS and Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) RR are high when SMOS and SSMIS passes are less than 15 min apart (r = 0.7 at 1° × 1° resolution), showing a good quality of SMOS RR retrievals. When the time shift between SMOS and SSMIS passes increases, the correlation between SMOS and IMERG RR diminishes. This suggests that L‐band radiometry can provide information complementary to GPM missions to improve RR products interpolated at high temporal resolution. The retrieval is successfully tested on SMAP SSS. We also check that our algorithm provides reliable estimates of RR when averaged at a monthly time‐scale.</jats:p>",

However, there is limited evidence regarding how governance mechanisms influence the generation of value from collaboration. Furthermore, how a particular buyer or supplier position provides benefits to partners is unclear. In this paper, we examine the roles of management control information as both a governance mechanism and a source of dynamic capabilities, and its interaction with relational variables to create and capture value following a demand-side perspective. Two separate studies are developed using multigroup structural equation modelling, which analyse buyer and supplier positions played by the firm as a complex supply chain node. The results demonstrate that the characteristics of information sharing have different impacts on value, depending on the role played in the relationship. Although timely information sharing appears to be the key source of operative and financial value in downstream relationships, disaggregated information sharing generates additional strategic advantages in upstream relationships. The presence of different control-trust frameworks mediates the process of value generation, leading to different managerial and theoretical implications.</jats:p>"

Three research modules include analyses of forest biomass utilization residues that originated from: (1) harvesting activities, (2) non-extracted stands and (3) sawmills. A regional case study focusing on tree species of commercial importance (pine, oak and fir) in the 10 provinces with the highest timber production located in the north and central-south part of the country, is analyzed. After applying the methodology, the theoretical potential of available woody biomass for energetic use amounts to 6,357,482 m3. When applying the sustainability constraints, the technically feasible supply of forest woody biomass for energetic use sums up to 5,798,722 m3, which relate to a technical energy potential of 45.96 PJ for 2013. Moreover, a biomass energy flow chart showing energy values for each analyzed source and species is presented. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out for each cost involved in utilizing the resulting available woody biomass for energetic use. In the absence of national studies which include forest operations and bioenergy transformation to calculate the sustainable energy potential, the developed methodology adds innovation for assessing woody biomass availability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Short food supply chain (SFSCs) initiatives have developed throughout Europe as an alternative to the long industrialized chains characterizing the contemporary global food industry. They are often driven by small‐scale actors belonging to different phases of the chain (producers, retailers, consumers) and rooted in specific territorial contexts. Innovative organizational models of SFSCs are attracting interest in the academic field (Jarosz, 2008, Khan and Prior, 2010, Aubry and Kebir, 2013) and beyond (RUAF, 2015). This work contributes to the debate with a focus on the logistics of SFSCs in urban and peri‐urban areas across Europe, specifically on the role of local intermediaries in facilitating connections between urban consumers and peri‐urban and rural farmers. The structure of three small/medium enterprises (SMEs) acting as local SFSC intermediaries has been analyzed by a research network involving researchers and entrepreneurs in a mutual learning process. The aim was to identify the main business objectives of local intermediaries in SFSCs, the elements that from the SMEs point of view characterize SFSCs and their vision of sustainability. A simple theoretical model has been developed to look at leadership of SFSCs in urban and peri‐urban areas. The research process provided interesting insight into the contribution that qualitative research can give to SMEs’ reflection on their organizational model (Zakic et al., 2014).</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We propose a new model that captures the farmers’ expectations through the storage approach, instead of using Nerlove's basic model. As an innovation, we add the effects of efficiency and technological change directly, thus achieving a more powerful and informative estimation than with the usual dynamic model. Moreover, we consider the effect of climate and construct a sowing and harvesting calendar for each country and each crop to measure the supply more precisely. We also analyze the effects of agricultural prices and their volatility, of commercial policy and of changes in inventories on the suppliers’ decisions. Finally, we examine the differences in these determinants depending on the level of development of the countries. [EconLit citations: Q11, Q16, Q18].</jats:p>",

From 2001 until 2014, there was little additional public investment in the municipal water supply system. In the summer of 2014, we attempted to reinterview all 1500 households in our 2001 sample to determine how they had managed to deal with the growing water shortage and the deteriorating condition of the piped water infrastructure in Kathmandu and to compare their coping costs in 2014 with those we first estimated in 2001. Average household coping costs more than doubled in real terms over the period from 2001 to 2014, from US$5 to US$12 per month (measured in 2014 prices). The composition of household coping costs changed from 2001 to 2014, as households responded to the deteriorating condition of the piped water infrastructure by drilling more private wells, purchasing water from both tanker truck and bottled water vendors, and installing more storage tanks. These investments and expenditures resulted in a decline in the time households spend collecting water from outside the home. Our analysis suggests that the significant increase in coping costs between 2001 and 2014 may provide an opportunity for the municipal water utility to substantially increase water tariffs if the quantity and quality of piped services can be improved. However, the capital investments made by some households in private wells, pumping and treatment systems, and storage tanks in response to the delay in infrastructure investment may lock them into current patterns of water use, at least in the short run, and thus make it difficult to predict how they would respond to tariff increases for improved piped water services.</jats:p>",

However, the soil physical conditions and soil hydrological processes of different agroforestry systems are still unclear. Thus, in this study, rubber (<jats:italic>Hevea brasiliensis</jats:italic>) monoculture, rubber and <jats:italic>Clerodendranthus spicatus</jats:italic> agroforestry system (RCS) and rubber and <jats:italic>Amomum villosum</jats:italic> agroforestry system (RAV) were developed from a degraded land that had similar backgrounds of terrain and management measures for 50 years. Conventional methods were applied, and dye tracer experiments were conducted to measure the soil physical conditions and determine the water movement in soil. After 5 years' growth, both RCS and RAV could effectively promote the soil physical conditions and optimize soil structure by improving the proportion of the three soil phases. Favourable soil properties, multiple‐layered canopies and ground cover in agroforestry systems could promote the formation of three‐dimensional hydraulic redistribution in soil profile. The infiltration of rainfall into the soil was enhanced; meanwhile, surface runoff and soil erosion were mitigated, and then more water was transported, redistributed and stored into the different soil layers by the more dominant preferential flow, water exchange and lateral flow in soil profiles. These water supply mechanisms could allow planting intercrops with rubber trees to uptake water from different water sources and coexist in an agroforestry system. Our results highlighted that rubber‐based agroforestry systems are a useful management practice to maximize the utilization of land and water resources.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the source localization technique of magnetoencephalography (MEG) has played a prominent role in cognitive neuroscience and in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychological disorders. However, locating deep brain activities such as in the mesial temporal structures, especially in preoperative evaluation of epilepsy patients, may be more challenging. In this work we have proposed a modified beamforming approach for finding deep sources. First, an iterative spatiotemporal signal decomposition was employed for reconstructing the sensor arrays, which could characterize the intrinsic discriminant features for interpreting sensor signals. Next, a sensor covariance matrix was estimated under the new reconstructed space. Then, a well-known vector beamforming approach, which was a linearly constraint minimum variance (LCMV) approach, was applied to compute the solution for the inverse problem. It can be shown that the proposed source localization approach can give better localization accuracy than two other commonly-used beamforming methods (LCMV, MUSIC) in simulated MEG measurements generated with deep sources. Further, we applied the proposed approach to real MEG data recorded from ten patients with medically-refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) for finding epileptogenic zone(s), and there was a good agreement between those findings by the proposed approach and the clinical comprehensive results.</jats:p>"

Provenance analysis indicates that the sediments were mainly derived from the Yellow River and the island of Kyushu. Since the last glacial, clay‐sized sediments transported from the Yellow River to the study site were strongly influenced by sea‐level fluctuation. During low sea‐level stage (∼34–14 ka BP), the paleo‐Yellow River mouth was positioned closer to the northern Okinawa Trough, favoring large fluvial discharge or even direct input of detrital sediments, which resulted about four times more flux of clay‐sized sediments supply to the study area as during the relatively high sea‐level stage (∼14–0 ka BP). The input of Kyushu‐derived clay‐sized sediments to the study site was mainly controlled by the Kuroshio Current and Tsushima Warm Current intensity, with increased input in phase with weakened Kuroshio Current/Tsushima Warm Current. Our study suggests that the Kuroshio Current was very likely flowed into the Okinawa Trough and thus influenced the fine‐grained sediment transport in the area throughout the last glacial and deglacial. During ∼34–11 ka BP, the Kyushu clay‐sized sediment input was mainly controlled by the Kuroshio Current. Since ∼11 ka BP, the occurrence of Tsushima Warm Current became important in influencing the Kyushu fine‐grained sediment input to the northern Okinawa Trough.</jats:p>",

It has been suggested that the deep Atlantic water mass structure changed significantly during the last glacial/interglacial cycle. However, deep SCW source‐proximal records remain sparse. Here we present three coherent deep SCW paleocurrent records from the deep Argentine continental margin shedding light on deep water circulation and deep SCW flow strength in the Southwest Atlantic since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Based on increased sortable silt values, we propose enhanced deep SCW flow strength from 14 to 10 cal ka B.P. relative to the early deglacial/LGM and the Holocene. We propose a direct influence of deep northern component water (NCW) on deep SCW flow strength due to vertical narrowing of deep SCW spreading, concurrent with a migration of the high‐energetic LCDW/AABW interface occupying our core sites. We suggest a shoaled NCW until 13 cal ka B.P., thereby providing space for deep SCW spreading that resulted in reduced carbonate preservation at our core sites. Increased carbonate content from 13 cal ka B.P. indicates that the NCW expanded changing deep water properties at our core sites in the deep Southwest Atlantic. However, southern sourced terrigenous sediments continued to be deposited at our core sites, suggesting that deep SCW flow was uninterrupted along the Argentine continental margin since the LGM.</jats:p>",
