The institutional landscape is undergoing a profound transformation towards (probably) greater coherence between research entities, resource‐sharing projects and task sharing. Academic interlibrary loan and document supply activity has decreased steadily since 1997, with an annual average downward trend of 8 per cent to 10 per cent. To survive as a document supplier, INIST has reinforced its position as a “one‐stop shop”, steadily moving from a library to a broker strategy; in 2010, INIST launched a new platform called Refdoc.

It has been concluded that the policy of unplanned water release during the dry year 2007, when little attention was paid to the possibility of a continuation of the drought, contributed to the remarkable lack of surface water storage during 2008, another dry year. For better management and planning, this paper presents theoretical models to evaluate the occurrence probability and return period for extreme droughts, assuming that drought deficits are Beta distributed. Droughts of a short length (2–3 years) and deficits that exceed a threshold deficit (Do) are the most frequent droughts in the central Jordan region. Regardless of the drought deficit magnitude and the drought length, the return period of any drought condition is nearly 4 years. This paper recommends the application of large-scale sustainable solutions to reduce the gap between the demand on water and supply in Jordan during drought conditions. Furthermore, it is recommended that water losses from the clean water distribution systems be reduced below the existing loss rate, that large-scale rainwater capturing techniques are employed, and that large-scale desalination practices are applied to the readily available brackish and seawater in Jordan.</jats:p>",

When the sum of retailers order quantities is beyond suppliers' inventories, suppliers might apply order allocation mechanism to solve the difficulty. The allocation mechanism is not considered in most of previous studies on the bullwhip effect. This paper develops the supply chain simulation software based browser/server technology, which can build tree-shape supply chain structure considering allocation mechanism. Two experiments are designed and implemented in order to isolate the effect of different order allocation mechanisms on bullwhip effect. The studies show that <jats:italic>BWV</jats:italic> differs from allocation mechanisms. For three types of supply chain members, the change tendencies of <jats:italic>BWV</jats:italic> with two allocation mechanism are similar. The paper also demonstrates that distributors have effect more obviously on bullwhip effect than other two roles with different allocation mechanism.</jats:p>"

The replacement of that aggregation theory with one more congenial to microeconomic observations opens possibilities for an accord about the aggregate labor supply elasticity. The new aggregation theory drops features to which empirical microeconomists objected and replaces them with life-cycle choices. Whether the new aggregation theory ultimately indicates a small or large macro labor supply elasticity will depend on how shocks and government institutions interact to put workers at interior solutions for career length. </jats:p>",

Using a unique data set of credit card mailings, we directly explore the supply of unsecured credit to consumers with the most conspicuous default risk--those with a bankruptcy history. On average, over one-fifth of personal bankruptcy filers receive at least one offer in a given month, with the likelihood being even higher for those who filed for bankruptcy within the previous two years. However, offers to bankruptcy filers carry substantially less favorable terms than those to comparable consumers without a bankruptcy history, with higher interest rates, lower credit limits, a greater likelihood of having an annual fee, and a smaller likelihood of having rewards or promotions. In addition, our analysis of credit terms typically disclosed only in the fine print suggests that offers to filers tend to include more hidden costs.</jats:p>"

This paper is an experiment on autoclaved sludge brick, which is mainly made of sludge from the water-supply plants, fly ash, lime, sand and cement, integrated with the manufacturing process of autoclaved fly ash brick. By orthogonal optimal process, we get the optimal parameters for making sludge bricks as follows: W<jats:sub> sludge</jats:sub> : W <jats:sub>ash</jats:sub> : W<jats:sub> lime</jats:sub> = 15%: 45%: 15%, stirring intensity being 1400r/min, forming and curing condition being the constant temperature and humidity Curing Box (60 °C, humidity 95%), and autoclave curing condition being 1.2Mpa (time 10h). With the optimal parameters, the compressive strength of the produced bricks reaches 20.8Mpa, and its flexural strength reaches 5.4 Mpa. Besides, stirring conditions, forming and curing conditions together with the influence of curing conditions on autoclaved sludge bricks’ mechanical properties are discussed.</jats:p>"

By their very nature, such segment profitability measures may unwittingly neglect complementarities. Such complementarities have been widely recognized on the demand side due to brand recognition, predatory pricing, or interdependent products. We develop a model showing that important supply-side complementarities can also be prevalent. In particular, when a firm relies on a self-interested supplier for inputs used across multiple segments, the wholesale price it pays depends on the average profitability of its segments. Taking such interaction between upstream pricing and the firm’s downstream reach into account, the model shows that: (1) segment profit calculations can understate or overstate the value added by the segment depending on the segment’s relative contribution margin, and (2) the firm sometimes benefits from devoting resources to less profitable segments and perhaps even from serving seemingly unprofitable markets and/or customers.</jats:p>",

Utilizing administrative data linking Workers’ Compensation claim records to wage records from an Unemployment Insurance payroll tax database, I explore a different explanation and implement tests for “income effects” that exploit the fact that claimants no longer experience a distorted price of non-employment after an employment-limiting benefit ends. A pair of legislative changes to a Workers’ Compensation benefit rate show little or no evidence of income effects and moderate evidence of income effects, respectively.</jats:p>"

It has coordinated its support for development of repositories and open access in the OpenAccess.se programme that ran from 2006 to 2009. The conclusion is that a national library can successfully act as a catalyst for closer cooperation between the main bodies of research and research libraries in advancing an Open Access agenda and developing a digital research information infrastructure. This is because it is usually placed directly under the government and thus closer to national policy making. It is often perceived as unbiased in relation to the different interests of the various parties involved.

This article explores a promising strategy for grounding the relevant intuition and for rendering its content more precise. It applies the criteria of David Miller's connection theory of remedial responsibility to different forms of supply chain governance as characterized by the Global Value Chains (GVC) framework. The analysis suggests that the criteria for identifying MNEs as remedially responsible for bad working conditions in their direct suppliers are fulfilled in many cases, even though differentiations are required with regard to the different supply chain governance structures. MNEs thus have a duty to make sure currently bad working conditions in their suppliers are changed for the better. Moreover, since production in supply chains for structural reasons continuously generates remedial responsibility of MNEs for bad working conditions in their suppliers, it puts the prospective responsibility on them to make sure that their suppliers offer acceptable working conditions. Further, it is suggested that the remedial responsibility of MNEs might require them to make financial compensation to victims of bad working conditions and in grave cases initiate or support programs to mitigate disastrous effects suffered by them. </jats:p>",

While most approaches stress technological solutions, scholars and policy-makers tend to overlook economics, labour market issues, and industrial relations. Applying agency theory from behavioural economics, this article analyses threats to the US supply chain and opportunities for efficient solutions. Using data from a sophisticated web-based survey of owner-operator cost-of-operations, it shows that drayage drivers are among the lowest paid truck drivers and workers in the US. We provide evidence that low pay is associated with both safety and security risk. Low-wage labour and subcontracting present challenges to US and foreign supply-chain security because the market attracts workers who have few other employment options. In this environment, principals and agents currently make inefficient and inequitable contracts because markets do not reflect the complete costs associated with low-probability/high-impact events like cargo theft and transport security.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the development of dew harvest systems for use in semi-arid coastal region of north-west India, chronically short of drinking water. These were developed to ameliorate drinking water problem, especially of people living near the coast where groundwater is of poor quality and surface sources scarce.  Although dew is much smaller in magnitude (20-30 mm) than the rains (300 mm) it is a more reliable source. Dew occurs over a season of seven months (October to April), rain over four (June - September). Dew nights number ~ 100, rainy days 15-20. There is much greater year to year variation in rainfall than in the dew amount. A R&amp;D program of over four years led to development of three types of systems - condenser-on-roof (CoR), condenser-on-ground (CoG) and Roof-as-Condenser (RaC). The CoR, CoGs employ condenser made of plastic film insulated on the underside. CoRs are constructed over the roof of buildings, CoGs on open ground.  The RaCs use metal roof of buildings itself as condenser. The CoR and CoGs give higher output, require higher investment. The RaCs give lower output; require only a small investment in collection and storage.  Examples of working installation are presented.  Rain and dew seasons in the region are complementary. Although engineered specifically to harvest dew, these also harvest rain, providing varying amounts of potable water through the year. Benefits to the region, learning accrued and partnerships created in the course of work are also briefly discussed.</jats:p>"

This study used the Sub-Regional Timber Supply model to analyze the regional aggregate forest biomass feedstock potential and the impacts of additional pulpwood demand on the regional roundwood market through 2030. Two scenarios examined the impacts of building a biorefinery facility of 20 and 50 million gallons annual capacity in the state in 2015. The third scenario investigated the impacts of an Energy Information administration (EIA) reference case. The projection results suggest that there is sufficient hardwood pulpwood supply for a 50 million gallon biorefinery facility in Tennessee. It is possible to meet the increased demand of the EIA reference case without affecting the hardwood pulpwood market in the short run, but not in the distant future. The additional demand for softwood pulpwood will affect the softwood market substantially, but the impacts on the hardwood market are comparatively small. Hence, it is more feasible to increase the use of hardwood pulpwood for renewable energy rather than softwood pulpwood. These results will be very helpful in sustainably supplying forest biomass for bioenergy production in Tennessee.</jats:p>",

This work was carried out to review the public health sector supply of modern contraceptives in rural Nigeria in order to make recommendations on how to improve the supply of modern contraceptives in this area. The study reviewed secondary data from country documents and literature obtained from Pubmed, Popline, and Global Health databases; as well as websites of USAID/DELIVER Project, Measure DHS and Federal Ministry of Health. The study revealed that a wide range of contraceptives are included in the essential drug list to be used in secondary facilities, while only a few ones are selected to be used in primary facilities which serve the majority of rural population. Forecasting is done using issue data from the central warehouse because facilities are not generating reliable consumption data. Inventory control is poor in rural facilities, and these facilities do not follow the established inventory control guidelines. The study therefore demonstrates that the current essential drug list should be reviewed in order to include injectables for use in primary facilities, strengthen the current forecasting, data reporting and inventory control system.</jats:p>"

The results show that it is very useful for designing and developing the new heat recovery unit with high efficiency, energy conservation, and environmental protection by analyzing the feature feasibility of condenser heat recovery system. The control of entering-condenser water temperature is recommended for higher chiller efficiency and operating steadily, the water system designs of preferential loading and side stream are for more heat recovery.</jats:p>"

The study reviewed secondary data from country documents and literature obtained from Pubmed, Popline, and Global Health databases; as well as websites of USAID/DELIVER Project, Measure DHS and Federal Ministry of Health. The study revealed that a wide range of contraceptives are included in the essential drug list to be used in secondary facilities, while only a few ones are selected to be used in primary facilities which serve the majority of rural population.

Thus, a model to strategically source vaccines for these nations can contribute a great deal. This paper aims to present an extensive review of strategic sourcing literature, and to identify the criteria and available models in making strategic sourcing decisions. The purpose is to develop a decision making framework for future empirical study of humanitarian aid networks, more specifically, sourcing and distribution of vaccines in developing countries. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A thorough review of several purchasing and supply chain management (SCM) journals was conducted to identify the strategic criteria in making sourcing decisions, hence “strategic sourcing”. In line with this, a number of sourcing strategies were reviewed to find the relevant strategic criteria. Secondary data from practice were also investigated for special characteristics of vaccine supply chains in humanitarian aid networks. Articles were then scrutinized and results categorized in order to develop a framework for future empirical studies. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The findings show the historical development of strategic sourcing and the criteria in making strategic sourcing decisions. More recent studies, while taking a look back in history, have revealed a mix of strategies for more flexible models. Quality has been noted to be a strategic criterion for sourcing vaccines and this has caused the supply market to be dispersed on a global scale. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Considering the extensive number of academic publications, due to the focus of this study being sourcing within humanitarian aid networks, a number of academic journals in logistics/SCM/sourcing were reviewed. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A decision making framework is presented for sourcing vaccines within the humanitarian sector. The criteria in making strategic sourcing decisions are further re-evaluated and a base model proposed. The framework will be used for further research on sourcing in the humanitarian aid sector as well as practical implications.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Unit evacuation teams (1 physician &amp; 2 nurses) carried caches by foot to a nearby field clinic site (1/4 mile). Cache transport times ranged from 3 minutes (maternity ward) to 15.5 minutes (hemodialysis), averaging 11.2 minutes. Hospital leadership arrived in 4 minutes, and maintenance staff with portable power and oxygen in 23 minutes. Fifty-seven community volunteers (age 9 months – 60 years) under Eagle Scout candidate leadership were prepared as moulaged mock patients. Unit teams used evacuated supplies to provide medical care for 6 mock patients each, listing missing or insufficient supplies at exercise end. Cache supply deficits noted by participating teams included: portable oxygen (66%), blood pressure cuffs (44%), thermometers (44%), select pharmaceuticals (44%), and others.

Working status of the rectifier in high power output condition was analyzed, and the conduction angle of the rectifier was calculated. The power factor (PF) of the SCW circuit has been studied, and the equivalent condensance of the circuit has been derived. Measurements were done for the PF compensation. The surge impact during the short circuit transient process was considered in choosing the protection resistance. Test results showed that design specifications of the power supply were achieved, with the non-load voltage being up to 1.32 MV and the ratio of ripple voltage to output voltage as 9.4%.</jats:p>",

Most timberland in this region is owned by family forest landowners whose forest management objectives are varied. This study evaluates the conditions under which family forest landowners from Lee County, Alabama, would be willing to supply wood biomass energy feedstock for a prospective local biofuel industry. Using standard survey methodology, a questionnaire was mailed to every family forest landowner of 20 or more acres of forestland in Lee County, resulting in 363 valid responses and a response rate of 41%. Results indicate that most family forest landowners are willing to supply both timber and harvest residues for production of biofuels and that such willingness is positively correlated with the number of acres owned, the existence of an effective market, and the opportunity to contribute to local economic development and global climate change. Three-quarters of all respondents indicated willingness to manage their land for biomass production, compared with 43% of respondents who actively manage their land at present.</jats:p>",

Due to global business competition, suppliers are required to supply raw materials with the right quality and quantity. Suppliers are responsible for reducing the inventory costs and improving product quality. This paper deals with the development of a decision support system based on the integration of analytical hierarchy process and gray relational analysis for supplier selection. The additive normalization method is used as the prioritization method to calculate the priority vector. The analysis results indicate that the proposed selection model enables the manager to select the SCPM of Notebook PC more objectively by allowing them to deploy effectively. The proposed model can also be applied to other high technology factories, thus enhancing Taiwanese competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

However, micro estimates of intertemporal substitution (Frisch) elasticities are an order of magnitude smaller than the values needed to explain business cycle fluctuations in aggregate hours by preferences.

Uplift of intrabasinal monoclines and anticlines reduced the available accommodation space, resulting in changes in both the geometry of the depositional sequences and the large‐scale architecture of fluvial, mudflat and shallow carbonate lacustrine deposits. Main drainage fluvial systems record areas with a high sedimentary supply, while mudflats and shallow fluctuating lakes represent areas that received less sediment. Two end members in the large‐scale architecture of main drainage fluvial system in the Almazán Basin (Spain) are: (i) ribbon‐shaped channel fills with low interconnectivity which pass laterally into mudflats dominated by mudstones and evaporites and into palustrine and shallow carbonate lacustrine deposits (mainly in the A2 depositional sequence); and (ii) sheet‐like channel fills with high interconnectivity laterally correlated with stacked calcretes in the marginal mudflats (in the upper part of A3).

Due to the variable nature of crop production in the Southeast, previous studies that ignore price and yield risk may fail to capture one of the salient features of the region's agriculture. Our results indicate supply elasticity values for corn, cotton, and soybeans of approximately 0.670, 0.506, and 0.195, respectively. Compared with the results of studies in other regions, corn and cotton acres respond more to price changes and soybean acres respond less to price changes.</jats:p>",

Changes in plant growth and metabolism after Phi application should be reflected in altered nutrient‐use efficiency and leaf photosynthesis. We carried out a greenhouse study using seedlings of two contrasting citrus (<jats:italic>Citrus spp.</jats:italic>) rootstocks, Carrizo citrange (CC) and Smooth Flat Seville (SFS), growing in either aerated hydroponic culture or sterilized native sandy soil. Plants were subjected to four P treatments: No P (control, P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>); 0.5 mM P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> (PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐P); 0.25 mM P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> + 0.25 mM Phi (P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> + Phi), or 0.5 mM Phi (Phi). Photosynthetic characteristics, concentrations of total P (P<jats:sub>t</jats:sub>) and soluble PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐P or PO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐P in leaves and roots, and plant growth were evaluated after 80–83 d P treatments. Overall, the P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> plants had the highest P<jats:sub>t</jats:sub> (total P) and total plant dry weight while the P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> plants had the lowest P<jats:sub>t</jats:sub> but highest total root length and root‐to‐shoot ratio. Leaf chlorophyll (SPAD readings) and net assimilation of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>CO2</jats:sub>) of the P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and Phi plants were similarly lower than those of P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> and P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> + Phi plants. Growth responses of the P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> + Phi treatment were intermediate between the P<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> and Phi treatments. Although Phi increased P<jats:sub>t</jats:sub> and soluble‐PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐P concentration in leaves and roots above the P<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> treatment, this did not translate into increased plant growth. In fact, the Phi treatment had some phytotoxic symptoms, impaired P‐ and N‐utilization efficiency for biomass production as well as lower nutrient‐use efficiency in the photosynthetic process. Thus, these two rootstocks could not use Phi as a nutritional source of P.</jats:p>",

However, existing theory is frequently interpreted as predicting a negative ESD, such that offspring beg less when parental supply is high. While empirical evidence largely supports this interpretation, several studies have identified the opposite case, with well-fed offspring begging more than those in poorer condition. Here, we show that signalling theory can give rise to either a negative or a positive ESD depending on the precise form of costs and benefits. Introducing variation among parents in the cost of care, we show that the ESD may change sign depending upon the quantitative relation between two effects: (i) decreased supply leads to increased begging because of an increase in marginal fitness benefit of additional resources to offspring, (ii) decreased supply leads to reduced begging because it is associated with a decrease in parental responsiveness, rendering begging less effective. To illustrate the interplay between these two effects, we show that Godfray's seminal model of begging yields a negative ESD when care is generally cheap, because the impact of supply on the marginal benefits of additional resources then outweighs the associated changes in parental responsiveness to begging. By contrast, the same model predicts a positive ESD when care is generally costly, because the impact of care costs on parental responsiveness then outweighs the change in marginal benefits.</jats:p>",

However, the exact mechanisms of the induction of antibiotics production are still not clearly established. In a previous study, the induction of pristinamycins production by <jats:italic>Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</jats:italic> as well as product concentrations were correlated with power dissipation per unit of volume (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>V</jats:italic>) in shaking flasks. In this study, detailed kinetics of growth, substrate consumption, oxygen transfer rate and pristinamycins production under varying <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> conditions have been obtained and analyzed. Our results showed that higher <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>V</jats:italic> resulted in a higher concentration of biomass and promoted an earlier nutrient limitation and ultimately an earlier induction of pristinamycins production.

When oxygen uptake rate (<jats:italic>OUR)</jats:italic> was limited by free‐surface oxygen transfer, pristinamycins production was not detected despite the occurrence of nitrogen and/or phosphate sources limitation. The threshold value for <jats:italic>OUR</jats:italic> observed was around 25 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

To induce this production, the oxygen transfer had to be non‐limiting. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011;108:2151–2161. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The Generalized Watershed Loading Functions—Variable Source Area (GWLF‐VSA)—watershed model is used with future climate scenarios derived from different General Circulation Models (GCMs) to simulate future inflows to reservoirs that are part of the New York City Water Supply System (NYCWSS). Future scenarios that use current system operation rules and demands, but changed reservoir inflows, suggest that changes in precipitation and snowmelt will affect regional water availability on a seasonal basis. The combined effect of projected increases in winter air temperatures, increased winter rain, and earlier snowmelt may result in more runoff during winter. This will cause reservoir storage levels, water releases and spills to increase during the winter and earlier reservoir refill in the spring. An overall increase in precipitation will result in a reduction in number of days the system is under drought conditions, despite increased evapotranspiration later in the year.

However, the extra crashing cost spent within a supply chain partnership will inevitably increase with the shortening of the lead time. On the other hand, the longer the lead time, the larger the amount of safety stock that must be held. The problem of determining a suitable policy of inventory and purchasing management is investigated in this study, with the objective of minimizing total expected inventory costs with multiple partners.

This may be due to altered fetal nutrition causing sustained changes within the developing hypothalamic energy balance regulatory system. Using our established ovine model of IUGR, 130‐day singleton fetuses (term = 147 days) were obtained from growing adolescent mothers on control dietary intake (C), high intake (H) or H with growth hormone administration during either early (H + early GH) or late gestation (H + late GH) (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 6/group). GH increased maternal glycemia for the duration of treatment. H and H + early GH fetuses showed IUGR compared with C fetuses; body weight was partially restored in H + late GH fetuses, with 40% increased adiposity. In the fetal hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), cocaine‐ and amphetamine‐regulated transcript mRNA (anorexigenic) was decreased in H fetuses and correlated across all groups with total fetal liver glycogen. Neuropeptide Y, agouti‐related peptide (orexigenic) and proopiomelanocortin (anorexigenic) mRNAs were not different between groups. Insulin receptor mRNA in the ARC was increased in H, H + early GH and H + late GH fetuses and correlated negatively with fetal plasma insulin. Leptin receptor mRNA in the ARC correlated positively with fetal plasma leptin concentration and fetal fat content. Therefore, in IUGR fetuses, a key anorexigenic neuropeptide is sensitive to altered glucose supply and the hypothalamic leptin‐signaling pathway is altered prenatally by increased adiposity and leptinemia. These changes could impact on postnatal energy balance regulation.</jats:p>",

Continuous Devonian–Early Triassic sedimentation filled the adjoining Kuznetsk and Minusa basins and buried (and re‐heated) the Kuznetsk‐Alatau basement. After initial Pangaea break‐up and Siberian flood‐basalt magmatism, the basement reached TFT and AFT retention‐temperatures in the Middle Triassic and Early Cretaceous, respectively, during denudation‐induced cooling.</jats:p><jats:p>Terra Nova, 00, 1–9, 2011</jats:p></jats:sec>",
