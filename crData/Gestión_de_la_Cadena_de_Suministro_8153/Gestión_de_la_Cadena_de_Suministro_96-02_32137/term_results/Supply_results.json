Lincoln, Omaha, and other municipalities withdraw groundwater for public supplies from the adjacent alluvium, which is hydraulically connected to the Platte River. Data were collected, in part, to provide information to managers, planners, and public utilities on the likelihood of water supplies being adversely affected by these herbicides. Three computational procedures—monthly means, monthly subsampling, and quarterly subsampling—were used to calculate annual mean herbicide concentrations. When the sampling was conducted quarterly rather than monthly, alachlor and atrazine concentrations were more likely to exceed their respective maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) of 2.0 μg/L and 3.0 μg/L, and cyanazine concentrations were more likely to exceed the health advisory level of 1.0 μg/L. The US Environmental Protection Agency has established a tentative MCL of 1.0 μg/L for cyanazine; data indicate that cyanazine is likely to exceed this level under most hydrologic conditions.</jats:p>",

Previous studies recommended contradictory responses to potential fire loss. We developed forest-level timber management optimization models with deterministic average and stochastic fire loss and used them to develop insight into the impact of uncertainty on forest management planning. Our analysis indicated that producing a stable timber supply requires the establishment of a buffer stock of timber. This strategy reduces the short-term harvest quantity, but increases the expected long-term harvest quantity. Paradoxically, the timber supply is both more stable, and larger. The results are sensitive to the method of regulating timber production: profit maximizing behavior of future producers requires a much greater buffer stock. In addition, bounds on the effect of transportation were developed, conditions where the mean value problem is adequate were identified, and the effect of a downward sloping demand curve was investigated.

The methodology was applied to two urban regions: the city of Leicester in UK; and Cerdanyola, part of the Area Metropolitana de Barcelona, in Spain (Boyle, 1994b). The Energy and Environment Research Unit at the Open University carried out the initial model development and applied the model to Leicester, whilst the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona applied the model to Cerdanyola. The model that was developed as part of this project is discussed, with particular emphasis on the modelling process. The paper then goes on to discuss the application of the model to the city of Leicester, and the results obtained from the model describing the energy demand and supply patterns of Leicester for the years 1984 to 1994. A comparison is made between the energy demand and supply patterns of Leicester and the UK for 1990. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study determined the relative contributions of systemic (bronchial) and pulmonary blood flow to the intraparenchymal airways =1 mm in diameter by using 15-mu m fluorescent microspheres and fluorescence microscopy in four dogs. Fluorescent microspheres of one color were injected into the inferior vena cava as a pulmonary blood flow marker, and fluorescent microspheres of another color were injected into the left ventricle as a systemic blood flow marker. After the second injection, the animals were killed and the lungs were excised and air dried at total lung capacity. The left lung was sliced into transverse planes and then sectioned into smaller blocks containing airways down to 1 mm in diameter. The blocks were then sectioned using a Vibratome and examined with a fluorescence microscope. Pulmonary and systemic blood flow markers were counted in airway walls, and the diameter of each airway was measured to determine the bronchial tissue volume. After a correction for the number of blood flow markers injected into each circulation, the average ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow markers seen in airway walls was 1:37, indicating that 97% of the blood supply to the intraparenchymal airways down to 1 mm in diameter was from the bronchial circulation. Furthermore, on the basis of a weighted least squares regression analysis, systemic (bronchial) blood flow per unit tissue volume increased as airway diameter decreased (P = 0.03). </jats:p>",
