      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a sand‐culture experiment lasting 21 weeks plants of timothy grown from seed were maintained at all combinations of three levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The number and weight of tillers, leaves and ears, and the weight of roots, were determined at the end of the experiment, and for some of the treatments at intervals of 4 weeks. All three nutrients had significant effects, especially N which at its lowest level of supply tended to mask the effect of the other two elements. Potassium influenced tiller numbers least, especially those of primary tillers, but in the presence of high concentrations of N and P it had a large effect on leaf area and dry weight. Relative growth and net assimilation rates responded to varying nutrient supply only in the early stages of growth, so that in general variations in dry weight were associated with nutrient effects on leaf area.</jats:p>",
