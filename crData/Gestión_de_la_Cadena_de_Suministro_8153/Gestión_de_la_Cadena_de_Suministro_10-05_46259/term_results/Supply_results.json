Extant research on the resulting channel interactions either assumes the national brand manufacturer can credibly commit to maintaining a wholesale price or that he lacks such ability. However, these two scenarios imply very different supply chain interactions, as only a national brand manufacturer with commitment ability can strategically adjust a national brand wholesale price to prevent a store brand introduction by the retailer. We specifically analyze the impact of this assumption on the manufacturer, the retailer, and the customers. We determine when long‐term contracts that provide the manufacturer with such commitment ability can improve supply chain profitability.</jats:p>",

First stage is dual interleaved buck chopper stage in order to make the DC bus and output pulse voltage controllable. Second stage is a inverter converting the DC voltage into a series of square AC voltage pulse. IGBT module(300A-1200V) is used as the main switch device for the proposed supply is a high power application. As we know large capacity power IGBT module can hardly work as high as 40Khz[1], so to solve this problem, interleaved control scheme is incorporated. Basic ideas are to share the total switching losses. To combine several converters working under certain sequence is the key point. Final output pulse frequency is 20-40Khz,voltage level is 0-800V, and pulse width is 0-90% changeable. The whole system is concise effective. Experimental results verified the feasibility of abovementioned power supply.</jats:p>"

The research was carried out at a test stand with an air-supplied injector. The test results (the pressure both before and behind an injector, a control signal and the current flowing through an electromagnetic coil) were analyzed for the impact of pressure on the injector characteristics. The analysis deals with a pressure effect on a unit mass flow, injector opening dead time (minimum time of a signal that causes an opening), the characteristics linearity, and its intersection point with a time axis. There was also analyzed a single injection time course, particularly emphasizing injector valve opening and closing time. It has been stated that the increase in pressure results in the increased unit mass flow and the simultaneous increase in injector dead time as well as a shift of the intersection point with a time axis along this axis.</jats:p>"

Quality measurement in a wood products supply chain was studied in great detail with the objective of increasing the understanding of quality performance measurement practices in a secondary wood products supply chain. Opportunities for improvement were also identified. A single-case study was used as the main research approach, with 30 interviews and observation as major data collection methods. Findings revealed a high degree of internal integration in the focal company, made possible in great part by a continuous improvement effort that expands all of its facilities. Opportunities for improvement were found in external integration, particularly regarding supplier quality management. A disconnect was identified between supply chain members in regard to quality information; particularly, there was a lack of true supply chain quality measures reflecting the contribution of each entity to the overall quality. Results from this research highlight the importance of adopting a systems perspective when designing a supply chain performance measurement system. Poor quality at any point in the supply chain is detrimental to customer satisfaction, hurts profitability, and eventually translates into higher costs for downstream business segments and for the final customer; the end result is a decline in competitiveness of the entire system.</jats:p>",

First, the paper addresses general issues relating to land market and factors affecting its demand and supply through a literature review. Subsequently, through a survey of land supply sources and secondary data, the study explores trends in land supply and land prices over a thirty year period, identifying specific reasons for the trends. In terms of land supply, the study's findings include the fact that a substantial amount of land in Colombo is not readily usable for development activities due to various reasons. The study also reveals a move from residential activities to commercial activities in the heart of Colombo and a considerable increase in land prices in the post Tsunami era. The suggestions include allowing this commercial sector to move towards the city centre to accommodate the high demand for commercial activities after the liberal economic policy introduced to the country in 1977.

The introduced methodology is aimed to analyze efficiency of a specific planning policy over the product life cycle within the entire supply chain for automated switching from a non-cyclic to cyclic and to optimize the cyclic planning policy for products at the maturity phase. For optimization of a multi-echelon cyclic schedule, the simulation optimization algorithm developed is based on integration of the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) and response surface-based local search to improve GA solutions. The comparative analysis of planning policies is based on estimation of the difference between mean values of their total costs by using the Paired-t confidence interval method and evaluation of an additional cost of the cyclic schedule. The simulation environment allows one to describe input data to build the supply chain network and store it in an external file, computing effective planning policies, automatically generating and running a network simulation model, generating production rules for switching from one planning policy to another and optimizing parameters of a multi-echelon cyclic schedule. Finally, a business case is described that illustrates the practical application of the presented methodology. </jats:p>",

They comprise 90% of the global firm population and employ more than 50% of the labor force in the private sector. This case study examines issues related to sustainable supply chain management and social entrepreneurship in the SME context. Being small does matter and the efficiencies of small to medium-sized companies struggling for competitive advantage in the global marketplace warrants consideration. Philosopher's Wool Co., located in Inverhuron, Ontario, Canada, is a woolen producer and woolens product manufacturer that partners with other Ontario wool producers and American wool processors and distributors. Its sustainable vertical supply chain system increased local woolen farmers' revenues contrary to the “conventional” price wisdom in the Canadian woolen industry and turned by-product cost into profitable end use. It also effected social change in its local business community and in global customer relations through resource efficiency and socially responsible employee and consumer policies. However, the struggle to maintain a foreign distribution network and remain competitive and profitable was problematic. Students are challenged to solve the problems of an SME operating in a global economy.</jats:p>",

The 1990s saw the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software packages, and organizations enthusiastically (even if sometimes slowly and painfully) moved from the silo mentality of departmental and unit-based information systems solutions to enterprise-wide information solutions. Today, companies are increasingly realizing that the progression from departmental to enterprise information systems has a logical next step: inter-organizational or supply chain solutions. While many pioneering companies have linked to their customers and suppliers for years, the improving reliability and security of the Web presents new opportunities for all organizations. Companies are increasingly moving to the Web or considering moving to the Web to conduct business transactions, connecting themselves with suppliers and customers.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Much of the recent research on electronic data interchange and information technology (IT) in the supply chain has focused on using the Web to conduct business-to-business (B2B) commerce across the supply chain, thus improving the older electronic data interchange (\"EDI\") model. The B2B market has grown steadily over the last several years. As an increasing portion of companies migrate to the Web it becomes important for both academics and practitioners to understand the benefits and pitfalls of such a migration. Numerous studies enumerate the benefits of electronic supply chain integration and B2B, and these benefits fall into the following categories: Reduction of process cost, improved operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, improved coordination, cooperation, and commitment between EDI partners, and improved overall process performance. However, a study has not been done which compares the process performance benefits of all three possible groups: Companies or processes (hereafter simply \"companies\") using no electronic supply chain integration (verbal and/or paper orders, invoices, etc.), companies using non-Web-based Supply Chain Integration (traditional EDI, using private or leased lines), and companies using Web-based supply chain integration. A notable exception occurred in a 2002 study, but this study was done on only 18 companies, a very small sample size. Also, many current studies claim that companies are misdiagnosing the advantages of B2B over existing ways of doing business. The absence of a three group comparison, along with a possible misdiagnosis of advantages, calls for further examination.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Thus, this research will attempt to determine differences in the performance of companies using no electronic supply chain integration, companies using non-Web-based supply chain integration, and companies using Web-based supply chain integration.</jats:p>",

A supply—demand model hypothesizes that institutionalization is a function of four sets of influences: stability in election law, persisting commitments to parties by political elites and by voters, and learning by elites and by voters. The hypotheses are tested with aggregate data from nine nationwide elections in Russia since 1993, in which institutionalization and its complement, volatility, are decomposed. Survey data from the 2007—8 round of Russian elections is then used to test the extent of institutionalization through party identification. Logit analysis shows that the high level of support for President Putin’s new party, United Russia, is based on temporary rather than durable influences. The political elite’s volatile supply of parties has created a ‘floating’ party system and a delegative democracy with implications for new democracies on other continents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As increasingly more companies outsource to Asia, US furniture companies' supply chains are becoming longer. To make their logistics networks more efficient, companies need to choose the right supply chain model, promote cooperation with their partners in the supply chain, and adopt new technologies to make better decisions and to manage better. Discrete-event simulation models are powerful tools that can be used by furniture manufacturers to perform what-if types of analyses to estimate the impact of their decisions on the overall performance prior to making any real changes to their system. We developed such a simulation model for a typical furniture manufacturer in northeastern Mississippi. By simulating the supply chain of the manufacturer under various scenarios, we show that outsourcing all of the business is not necessarily the best option because it may lead to a local reduction of capacity. This capacity reduction impacts the flexibility and profitability of the manufacturer. Outsourcing decisions may also be affected by product type. In general, outsourcing labor-intensive, slow-moving, and easy-to-transport items makes sense.</jats:p>",

Bellows type DMFC attempts increasing in the amount of fuel supply and making of the density uniform by soaking the cell material directly in the fuel container filled with the methanol-water solution. In the previous report, the airflow path in the cathode for a single cell was examined by using three dimensional simulations. As a result, it was shown that the air diffusion material to diffuse air uniformly was very effective. Moreover, one particular solution was shown as the best shape of the air diffusion material.  In this paper, the dependence of the air supply speed, the cell output power when two or more cells were connected has been examined by the simulation. In addition, the airflow path has been analyzed.</jats:p>",

Although much work has been done exploring why states transfer arms, little has been done to answer the question of why states choose to violate arms embargoes. Earlier studies have found that states transfer arms to one another for a variety of economic and strategic reasons. This study constructs a time series cross-section data set to test whether the same interests that drive dyadic arms transfers also influence the likelihood and size of arms embargo violations. Using a two-stage model of dyadic arms transfers, this study finds that measures for arms import dependence and alliance portfolio similarity best predict the likelihood and size of arms embargo violations. These results provide evidence that state decisions to violate embargoes are driven by political interests more than economic interests. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Barbados has been experiencing increasing rates of obesity and chronic non-communicable diseases characteristic of a country in nutrition transition. However, few studies have been carried out on how precisely the diet has changed in recent decades. Our aim was to analyse the FAO food balance sheets for Barbados from 1961 to 2003 in order to characterise the changes that have taken place in the macronutrient supply of the country during that period. Annual food balance sheets were downloaded from the FAOSTAT database, and per capita supply for twelve commodity groupings was analysed for energy and macronutrient levels using WISP dietary analysis software (Tinuviel Software, Llanfechell, Anglesey, UK). The food supply in 2003 provided over 2500 kJ (about 600 kcal) more energy per capita per d than it did in 1961. Energy from carbohydrate as a percentage of total energy has fallen from 70 % in 1961 to 57 % in 2003 and is now at the lower end of WHO recommendations. Energy from fat as a percentage of total energy increased from 19 % to 28 % and now lies at the upper end of WHO recommendations. Sugars, at over 17 % of dietary energy, are well above the upper limit set by the WHO. Despite having methodological limitations associated with the use of food balance statistics, our data suggest that these imbalances need to be addressed as a matter of priority in order to try to reverse the incidence of nutrition-related chronic diseases that are projected to cause increasing disability and premature death in the country in the coming years.</jats:p>",

In order to have superior performance, the rectifier-converter systems need to be rigorously regulated.   The DC power supply is an important aspect for the automotive industries because of its use for a wide range of loads and is mandatory for charging the battery.   However, DC power supplies experience many problems such as poor power factor, high input current harmonics distortion and un-controlled DC voltage. In this paper, an integrated control scheme is proposed for regulated DC power supply with high power quality for automotive applications. The proposed control scheme consists of two nested loops with a feedback of DC voltage and input current and a feed forward of the output power supply. An improved input power factor correction with a low input current total harmonics distortion has been used to model the power system using a combined control system.  The proposed control scheme achieves nearly unity power factor with a minimum input current total harmonics distortion and able to supply regulated DC voltage with high power quality. </jats:p>"

The cost‐effectiveness of seven testing strategies was evaluated against no testing and hierarchically in incremental analysis. Donor‐specific strategies included testing donors born in endemic countries, testing all donors a specific number of times, or testing all donors every time. Component‐specific strategies are based on screening platelet‐containing donations.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:</jats:bold> A decision analytic model simulated the lifetime cost (US dollars) and health outcomes (quality‐adjusted life‐years [QALYs]) of two hypothetical cohorts of blood recipients, an all‐ages and a younger subset, from a 2007 societal perspective. Model variable values were obtained from US screening data, Blood Systems Laboratory, the Health Care Utilization Project, and published literature.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> For the all‐ages cohort, compared to no testing, the cost‐effectiveness of testing all donors one time was $757,000 per QALY, all donors two times $970,000 per QALY, and universal testing $1.36 million per QALY. In the all‐ages and the younger transfused populations, testing donors with geographical exposure was most cost‐effective ($173,000 and $29,000/QALY, respectively). The most influential variables in the model were related to characteristics of the transfused population: survival and health state utilities. With respect to <jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic> variables, results were most sensitive to seroprevalence and transmissibility.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> Selective <jats:italic>T. cruzi</jats:italic> screening generates nearly the same effectiveness as universal screening, but at a reduced cost. Outcomes and associated costs of Chagas disease take longer to materialize than the average life expectancy of transfusion recipients.</jats:p>",

Die Konzepte werden jedoch mangels einer geeigneten Strukturierung und einem damit verbundenen komplexen Auswahlprozess nur zögerlich in die Praxis umgesetzt. Dieser Artikel stellt einen Ansatz vor, mit dessen Hilfe die Vielzahl der Konzepte strukturiert und typologisiert werden kann. Die Konzepte werden zunächst an Hand einer Morphologie inhaltlich charakterisiert. Anschließend werden mittels einer Clusteranalyse Typologien der Konzepte abgeleitet. Mit Hilfe dieser Zusammenfassung der Konzepte zu Gruppen kann letztendlich die Anzahl der Alternativen, zwischen denen Unternehmen vor einer potenziellen Implementierung abwägen müssen, verringert werden.</jats:p>",

Production and export of Indonesian CPO increase progressively in the view years so that CPO is one of the pre-eminent products of Indonesia. On the other hand, however, they could give two negative impacts. First, a less CPO supply for domestic market as a result of export growing. Second, a worse environment as an effect of the opening new palm plantations. We, therefore, construct and simulate the system model for analyzing the relationships between the components and for describing their behaviour within the supply chain of CPO by using a dynamic model. The result shows that in the next 30 years, the revenue of Indonesian CPO industries tends to increase. The biggest revenue will be achieved in the year 23rd. The maximum addition of plantation employees is in the year 7th as well as in the year 17th. Deforestation would be the highest in the year 7th and 17th in which 2008 as a basic year.</jats:p>"

The goal of this project was to provide guidance for health care facilities in evaluating their water use and determining how it might be curtailed in an emergency, and in developing an emergency water supply plan (EWSP) for the facility. The planning guide walks a facility through four steps to develop an EWSP: Step 1 ‐ assemble the team and background documentation; Step 2 ‐ water use audit; Step 3 ‐ analyze emergency water supply alternatives; and, Step 4 ‐ develop EWSP and test/exercise/revise.</jats:p>",

Findings indicated that drinking water from public supply wells is more vulnerable than domestic well water to VOC contamination. Analyses showed that the solvents perchloroethene and trichloroethene in public well samples were associated with point sources and pumping rates, potentially resulting from contaminant plumes that are drawn into wells with large capture zones. In contrast, detections of the trihalomethanes chloroform and bromodichloromethane and detections of methyl tertiary butyl ether were not associated with pumping rates. Chloroform detections were inversely correlated with the percentage of undeveloped land, indicating a nonpoint source signal. Widespread VOC detections in public well samples confirmed that wellhead protection efforts are warranted and that prudent managerial decisions regarding well planning, construction, and operation can result in reduced risks of VOC contamination to drinking water supplies.</jats:p>",

Particular attention is paid to the role of ecologically unequal exchange relationships in the mode of the vertical flow of exports and the transnational organization of extraction and production in the context of foreign investment dependence. It is argued that these interrelationships in the primary sector contribute to deforestation in less developed countries. Following theoretical discussions, regression analyses are conducted to assess the validity of the proposed relationships. Results suggest that both types of integration do contribute to deforestation in less developed countries, net of other factors. Ultimately, this research suggests that the structure of the world-economy allows for developed countries to externalize their consumption-based environmental costs, which often leads to increased environmental degradation in many less developed countries. </jats:p>",

We set two conditions for establishing complementarity: (i) one type of strategic integration must positively influence the adoption of another and (ii) the two types of strategic integration must exhibit a synergistic fit with respect to manufacturing plant capabilities. We test these conditions using survey results representing 224 manufacturing plants. The findings show positive complementarities between PPT integration and supplier integration with respect to quality, delivery, and process flexibility. Also, positive complementarities exist between PPT integration and customer integration with respect to quality and new product flexibility. The results extend the emerging theory of strategic value chain integration and provide guidance to manufacturing managers who wish to assemble strategic integration policies.</jats:p>",

In this study we analyzed the response of constructed temperate grassland communities to five levels of nitrogen (N) supply, ranging from 0 to 150 kg N ha−1, under two climate scenarios. Biomass of the plant communities responded positively to N supply in the current climate, but was insensitive to N supply in the future climate. This altered response was not the result of a changing response from a single species, but all species seemed to contribute to it. The weaker response in the future climate was caused by changes in N uptake rather than by changes in nitrogen use efficiency, as community N stocks showed the same response pattern as community biomass. Climate change apparently modified the relation between fertilizer N addition and plant available N.\n                        </jats:p>"

During the transportation process, the distributor has to make an appropriate effort to preserve the freshness of the product, and his success in this respect impacts on both the quality and quantity of the product delivered to the market. The distributor has to determine his order quantity, level of freshness‐keeping effort, and selling price, by taking into account the wholesale price of the producer, the cost of the freshness‐keeping effort, the likely spoilage of the product during transportation, and the possible demand for the product in the market. The producer, on the other hand, has to determine the wholesale price based on its effect on the order quantity of the distributor. We develop a model to study this problem, and characterize each party's optimal decisions in both decentralized and centralized systems. We further develop an incentive scheme to facilitate coordination between the two parties. Computational results are reported to show the effects of freshness‐keeping efforts. </jats:p>",

The hypotheses were investigated via quantitative and qualitative data, thus offering a rich test of the formulated relationships. Consistent with the theory, the quantitative results showed that intellectual property, operational assets, and remanufacturing frequency are significant drivers of the re‐make versus buy decision. However, counter to the theory, the quantitative results did not support the significance of brand reputation, technological uncertainty, condition uncertainty, product complexity, and volume uncertainty. The qualitative results were used to enrich these findings by providing theoretical extensions and pragmatic insights of the remake versus buy decision in remanufacturing.</jats:p>",

Organizational change has also resulted from an adaptation of companies to the newly competitive environment. This has led to a diversity of organizational choices across Europe. We analyze this diversity by using a modular approach, which decomposes reforms in electricity distribution and retail into logical ‘blocks’. We then examine how European countries have dealt with two policy and regulatory issues related to customer protection in that new environment: the regulation of quality of distribution, which is a task of regulators, and energy affordability policies for vulnerable customers, which are a central aspect of public service policies in the electricity sector.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The eruption was preceded by inflation of a magma reservoir located beneath the center of the caldera and ∼3 km below sea level (bsl), which began immediately after Okmok's previous eruption in 1997. In this paper we use data from several radar satellites and advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques to produce a suite of 2008 coeruption deformation maps. Most of the surface deformation that occurred during the eruption is explained by deflation of a Mogi‐type source located beneath the center of the caldera and 2–3 km bsl, i.e., essentially the same source that inflated prior to the eruption. During the eruption the reservoir deflated at a rate that decreased exponentially with time with a 1/<jats:italic>e</jats:italic> time constant of ∼13 days. We envision a sponge‐like network of interconnected fractures and melt bodies that in aggregate constitute a complex magma storage zone beneath Okmok caldera. The rate at which the reservoir deflates during an eruption may be controlled by the diminishing pressure difference between the reservoir and surface. A similar mechanism might explain the tendency for reservoir inflation to slow as an eruption approaches until the pressure difference between a deep magma production zone and the reservoir is great enough to drive an intrusion or eruption along the caldera ring‐fracture system.</jats:p>",

This study reexamines this relationship in an attempt to overcome some shortcomings of previous research. To that end, a theory‐based measure of inventory leanness, which takes into account industry‐specific inventory management characteristics, is proposed. The analysis of a large panel data set of U.S. manufacturing companies reveals that the significance and shape of the inventory–performance relationship varies substantially across industries. This relationship is significant in two‐thirds of the 54 industries studied. In most of these instances, the relationship is concave, suggesting that there is an optimum level of inventory leanness beyond which firm performance deteriorates. A post‐hoc analysis is conducted to identify industry‐level characteristics that may determine the nature the inventory–performance relationship. Managerial implications are discussed and several opportunities for future research are outlined.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Due to the importance of trust to this society, it can be very difficult to increase the size of one’s network for making transactions and doing business. This paper describes several possible applications of a working concept called WishVast that will help people expand their social networks, explore more opportunities, and share more information. WishVast is a social networking platform that leverages the power of cellphones and SMS messaging for the goals of helping individuals to increase social capital and build trust, ultimately helping to alleviate poverty. Cellphones are an appropriate technology because of the rapid rate of adoption and widespread availability of handsets and service throughout Kenya. The applications outlined are the labor hiring process and produce supply chain integration and how WishVast can promote inclusion and reduce inefficiencies. The information presented is the result of a semester-long project and three weeks of travel to Nyeri, Kenya.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Starting soon after the 1997 eruption at Okmok volcano and continuing until the start of the 2008 eruption, magma accumulated in a storage zone centered ∼3.5 km beneath the caldera floor at a rate that varied with time. A Mogi‐type point pressure source or finite sphere with a radius of 1 km provides an adequate fit to the deformation field portrayed in time‐sequential interferometric synthetic aperture radar images. From the end of the 1997 eruption through summer 2004, magma storage increased by 3.2–4.5 × 10<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which corresponds to 75–85% of the magma volume erupted in 1997. Thereafter, the average magma supply rate decreased such that by 10 July 2008, 2 days before the start of the 2008 eruption, magma storage had increased by 3.7–5.2 × 10<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> or 85–100% of the 1997 eruption volume. We propose that the supply rate decreased in response to the diminishing pressure gradient between the shallow storage zone and a deeper magma source region. Eventually the effects of continuing magma supply and vesiculation of stored magma caused a critical pressure threshold to be exceeded, triggering the 2008 eruption. A similar pattern of initially rapid inflation followed by oscillatory but generally slowing inflation was observed prior to the 1997 eruption. In both cases, withdrawal of magma during the eruptions depressurized the shallow storage zone, causing significant volcano‐wide subsidence and initiating a new intereruption deformation cycle.</jats:p>",

A student research team comprised of engineering and college students aimed to employ participatory action research methods to further understand existing challenges and develop a prototype for a water treatment and supply system. After careful analysis of local resources and constraints, the team decided that the most successful solution would combine the use of biofilters to purify the public spring water supply and improved rainwater collection to make use of the extensive storm season. An integrated prototype of these systems was built at the village government school with the purpose of serving as a model for replication in households throughout the village. In a discussion of the team’s methods and reflections, this paper emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between making a design both relevant to the community and technologically successful.</jats:p>"

At canola blossom, corn poppy plant number in nitrogen‐treated plots was 23% less than that in the nitrogen‐untreated ones. Canola seed and oil yield was reduced 18.6 and 23.7%, respectively, by the competition of 100 corn poppy plants m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>, with ‘Elan’ and ‘Titan’ the most productive hybrids. Nitrogen supply did not increase in all cases the competitive ability or the seed and oil yields. In the laboratory, germination of the winter weeds was completely inhibited by the greatest extract concentration (5 g 100 mL<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) of all hybrids. Nitrogen supply did not affect, in most cases, the phytotoxicity of canola hybrids, while phytotoxicity did not significantly differ among hybrids. Conclusively, the hybrids Elan and Titan, cultivated without any herbicide or nitrogen fertilizer, could be viable as a short‐term alternative crop system for canola seed and oil production, especially in organic or low‐input fields infested by corn poppy.</jats:p>",

Such species can spatially coexist for an extended period of time in a community maintained via competition‐colonization (CC) trade‐offs. Whether fluctuations in resource supply allow such exotic species to successfully invade and displace the native species or hold the coexistence is not previously explored, and it is the focus of this study. In this article, we model propagule‐limited spatial competition explicitly linked with resource‐competition within the framework of the classic CC‐model, while time‐dependent fluctuations in resource supply are considered in a sinusoidal function. The model predicts that if the amplitude of the fluctuations is greater than the average resource supply rate, there exist a range of values of fluctuation frequency that can allow the exotic species to successfully invade the habitat and to reduce the extent of native species. On the other hand, if the fluctuation amplitude is less than the average resource supply rate, such exotic species can coexist with the native species, independent of fluctuation frequencies. In addition, we found that at a constant resource supply rate, the exotic species can stably coexist with the native species at competitive equilibrium.</jats:p>",

Knowledge of the genetic variation, covariation, and genetic architecture of agronomic and cell wall traits will help maize breeders improve relevant traits through selective breeding and genetic engineering. We utilized the maize intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) and to evaluate the genetic relationships among traits relevant for cellulosic biofuel production, including grain yield, stover yield, neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD), and glucan, xylan, and lignin concentration. Intermated B73 × Mo17 RIL were evaluated per se and as testcrosses to W604S to assess how well performance and QTL effects correspond between inbreds and hybrids. There were no unfavorable correlations between agronomic and cell wall traits within the testcross progeny. Polysaccharide content was either positively correlated to, or not correlated to, NDFD, indicating that increasing both carbohydrate content and convertibility is feasible. Quantitative trait loci were identified for all traits evaluated, but few QTL were in common between inbred per se and testcross evaluations despite moderate to high genotypic correlations between progeny types. This study provides information that will support the development of dual‐purpose maize hybrids that are high in grain yield and also high in yield of digestible cellulosic feedstock.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A modeling approach was used to analyze the response of crop productivity to irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP), where excessive use of water for irrigation has caused rapid decline in groundwater table. We calibrated and evaluated the farming systems model APSIM with data from three sites (Luancheng, Yucheng and Fengqiu). The calibrated model was applied to simulate the response of crop yield to climate variation and irrigation. The results show that the APSIM model was able to simulate growth and yield of wheat and maize in a double cropping system. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of yield and biomass simulations were 0.83 and 1.40 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for wheat, 1.07 and 1.70 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for maize, respectively. Soil water and ET were also reasonably predicted, with RMSE of 24.33 mm 1.49 mm d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. The simulated rainfed yield range was 0∼6.1 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for wheat and 0∼9.7 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for maize in the double cropping system. Each 60 mm additional irrigation increased crop yield by 1.2 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 540 mm irrigation would be required to achieve the yield potential of 7.1 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for wheat and 8.3 t ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for maize. If &gt;180 mm irrigation water was available, partition it to wheat and maize would lead to higher total yield than applying it only to wheat. Changing to a single crop system would lead to significantly lower annual total crop yield, although yield of the single crop could be increased due to increased stored soil moisture.</jats:p>",
