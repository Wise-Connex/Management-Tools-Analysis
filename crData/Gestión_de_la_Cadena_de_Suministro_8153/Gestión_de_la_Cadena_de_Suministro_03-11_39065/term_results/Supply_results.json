      "abstract": "<jats:p>The popularity of supply chain partnerships has exploded over the past few years with an increasing interest in the role of trust in facilitating the relationship. There has been a noticeable increase in the last quarter of the twentieth century of the importance of trust in partnerships and alliances in management literature. This paper deals with the nature and crucial role played by trust in long‐term relationships and tries to integrate a number of different perspectives to develop a framework along with three issues: ways the term “trust” is used, factors leading to trusting behaviour in the customer‐supplier relationship, and the effect of trust on the behaviour of a customer and a supplier. The paper presents some insights for supply chain managers from which they can examine their own partner relationships and provides supply chain managers with an in‐depth analysis of how to manage their supply chain relationships.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain formation is the process of determining the structure and terms of exchange relationships to enable a multilevel, multiagent production activity.  We present a simple model of supply chains, highlighting two characteristic features: hierarchical subtask decomposition, and resource contention.  To decentralize the formation process, we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain.  In a competitive equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall.  To determine prices, we define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies.  In the presence of resource contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature.  The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria.  However, complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs.  A subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus.</jats:p>"

First we review the recent literature: open‐loop interest rate rules are subject to indeterminacy and instability problems, but a properly chosen expectations‐based rule yields determinacy and stability under learning, and implements optimal policy. We show that Friedman's rule also can generate equilibria that are determinate and stable under learning. However, computing the mean quadratic welfare loss, we find for calibrated models that Friedman's rule performs poorly when compared to the optimal interest rate rule.</jats:p>",

Egg fertilization status was determined at break‐out by the appearance of the germinal disc (GD) and then the perivitelline layer overlying the GD region was collected to count sperm (Sperm<jats:sub>OPVL</jats:sub>) under fluorescence following staining with 4′,6′‐diamidino‐2‐phenyindole (DAPI). The study was carried out on commercial ostrich farms over two laying seasons. In the first year, 229 eggs from nine randomly chosen ostrich pens comprising pairs, trios (two females, one male) and larger groups were collected for 1 week of every month of laying. Eggs contained 253 ± 18 Sperm<jats:sub>OPVL</jats:sub>/mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of the GD (mean ± SEM; range 0–1330). Egg fertilization rate averaged 89.4 ± 3.4% and varied from 78.6 to 98.2% between pens. Month had no effect on sperm supply or egg fertilization status. Eggs from paired birds (sex ratio 1 : 1) had less sperm in the GD than the eggs from pens with a higher sex ratio. In the second year, 150 eggs from seven pens, each containing only one male and either one, two or three females, were studied for 2 weeks at the beginning (winter), middle (spring) and end (summer) of laying. Eggs contained 364 ± 45 Sperm<jats:sub>OPVL</jats:sub>/mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> of the GD (range 0–2880). Season had no effect on sperm supply or egg fertilization. The number of Sperm<jats:sub>OPVL</jats:sub> varied between pens, assumed to be due to variation between individual males. The number of Sperm<jats:sub>OPVL</jats:sub> increased as the sex ratio increased only when very high‐ranking males were excluded from the analysis. Egg fertilization rate was 94.4 ± 3.1% but varied from 64.0 to 100% between pens. Egg fertilization was not affected by season or sex ratio. Low fertilization rates were observed in two pens and appeared related to the lack of synchrony between timing of laying and sperm production in the first, and lack of mating in the second pen. We conclude that ostrich flocks generally have high rates of egg fertilization and any infertility is associated with lack of sperm supply.</jats:p>",

The paper begins with the definition of a methodology to collect the information needed, both environmental (to enable institutions to be sorted into homogenous groups) and performance related. The analysis of indicators and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) models allowed classification of each hospital's performance and explained the operational approaches used, either at a general level or for each subprocess of the supply chain. It was observed that important economies of scale may be achieved with better co-ordination and with the regrouping of the supplying activities, both for purchasing management and central store management. The study showed that the best performance of central store services comes with flexible administrative structures, by receiving packages as small as possible and by using employees from the lowest range of the hierarchy. Purchasing services should employ highly qualified and well-paid staff. Although such services are relatively small with respect to their purchase volume, they show a higher activity rate. As a result of the discovered performing strategies, the possible economies range from 20% to 30% of the actual supply-chain management cost. </jats:p>",

One potentially important determinant of knowledge coordination between firms is the relative strength of the knowledge bases of the two partner companies. In the context of the local supply chain, this paper examines the extent of knowledge coordination between a group of 18 Northern Ireland‐based MNE plants and their local suppliers. A typology of knowledge complementarity is developed and related to the extent of firms' knowledge coordination activities. The analysis suggests three main empirical results. First, and somewhat unexpectedly, the relationship between MNE plants and their suppliers is characterized by a wide range of configurations of knowledge complementarity. Second, clear differentials exist between the occurrence of knowledge coordination activities incidental to normal trading relations and more intentional knowledge coordination activities. Third, no direct link was evident between knowledge complementarity and the level of knowledge coordination. The implication is that firms' willingness to coordinate knowledge, something that may be strategically determined, is more important than capability in determining the extent of knowledge coordination.</jats:p>",

Field experiments were conducted in 2000 and 2001 near Sidney and Mead, NE, to determine the water use efficiency (WUE) and yield response to water supply at critical developmental stages of pearl millet and grain sorghum [<jats:italic>Sorghum bicolor</jats:italic> (L.) Moench]. Four water regimes were used: (i) no irrigation, (ii) single irrigation at boot stage, (iii) single irrigation at mid–grain fill, and (iv) multiple irrigations. Pearl millet grain yields were 60 to 80% that of grain sorghum. Average grain yields at Mead were 5.1 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for pearl millet and 6.1 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for grain sorghum. At Sidney, average pearl millet yields were 1.9 and 3.9 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and average grain sorghum yields were 4.1 and 5.0 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Both crops used a similar amount of water (336 and 330 mm in 2000 and 370 and 374 mm in 2001 for pearl millet and grain sorghum, respectively) and responded to irrigation with a linear increase in grain yield as water use increased. Grain sorghum had greater WUE than pearl millet (12.4–13.4 kg vs. 5.1–10.4 kg grain ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> mm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Pearl millet, with lower and less stable yields, does not currently have the potential to be a substitute crop for grain sorghum in Nebraska.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this study was to assess hospital bed occupancy both by planned and unplanned cases, and to assess how supply and demand affect bed occupancy. Data was obtained from the Lazio Hospital Information System (HIS) dataset on all hospital discharges from July 1998 to June 2001. Using Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) as the reason for hospital stay, admissions were classified into four categories: 'planned stay', 'presumed planned stay', 'presumed unplanned stay', and 'unplanned stay'. Time series analysis of daily bed occupancy by category of stay was performed. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to asses the effect of weekdays and holidays on bed occupancy. Fluctuations in daily occupancy were observed in all categories of stay-in general, bed occupancy decreased over weekends, on national holidays, and during the major holiday season of August. In comparison with unplanned stays, the largest fluctuations were observed for planned stays while presumed planned and unplanned stays showed lesser fluctuations. It is possible to distinguish planned and unplanned hospital stays by using DRG grouping. Cyclic rigidities in the supply of services rather than the availability of beds or demand for beds seem to dictate hospital use in Roma so that restrictions in services hamper any reallocation of beds for 'planned stay' when demand for 'unplanned stay' beds declines. </jats:p>",

The sows were randomly assigned to six treatments (1–6). Each group received the same basic diet, covering the requirements of energy and nutrients except Val (4.5 g native Val, i.e. 3.5 g apparent ileal digestible Val). Adding crystalline <jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐Val dietary Val concentrations of 5.5, 6.5, 8.5, 10.5 and 14.5 g/kg, respectively, were realized. Feed intake of the sows was determined daily, body weight was determined on day 110 of gestation and day 1, 22 and 35 of lactation. The piglets were weighed on day 1, 21 and 35. The intake of piglet feed, which was offered from day 21, was determined at day 35 for each litter. Milk yield was determined using the weigh‐suckle‐weigh‐method at day 13, 14, 20 and 21, fat and protein contents were analysed in hand‐milked samples with infrared spectroscopy.</jats:p><jats:p>Feed intake (kg/day) of the sows during lactation averaged 2.9, 4.3, 4.6, 4.6, 4.9 and 5.1 for treatments 1–6, respectively. For treatments 1 and 2 body weight losses of the sows during lactation were higher (1207 and 805 g/day, respectively) and milk production was lower (7076 and 8686 g/day, respectively), compared with the average of treatments 3–6 (625 g/day body weight loss; 9263 g milk/day). Daily weight gain of the piglets was also lower (146 and 171 g/day vs. 200 g/day) leading to lower weaning weights of 6.6 and 7.5 vs. 8.5 kg. As a consistent growth depression of the piglets in Val deficiency must be assumed, at least 6.5 g Val corresponding to 5.5 g apparent ileal digestible Val per kg lactation feed must be recommended.</jats:p>",

Patients from Tayside Scotland (17 244 new users of dispensed aspirin each with 10 matched comparators) were included. A pragmatic analysis totalled costs from the start to end of the study and compared these with a matched cohort of aspirin nonusers to estimate excess costs. Fastidious analyses were done of subjects with no prior history of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) or renal disease where the cost that occurred during aspirin exposure, the 30 days following aspirin exposure and subsequent nonexposure was calculated adjusting for risk factors in each period.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> Subjects took aspirin for only 1.18 of the 2.53 years follow‐up (47% compliance). Aspirin use cost an additional £49.86 per year (pragmatic analysis) made up of £1.96 for aspirin tablets (4%), £5.49 for dispensing costs (11%), £24.60 for UGI complications (49%) and £17.81 for renal complications (36%). The costs for managing complications were substantially lower in the fastidious analysis (£2.66 for UGI complications and £2.92 for renal complications). Assuming that the antiplatelet trial meta‐analysis is an accurate assessment of the benefits of aspirin, the costs of preventing one vascular event lay between £62 500 (primary prevention, pragmatic analysis) and £867 (secondary prevention, fastidious analysis). These costs may be underestimates due to the low compliance observed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> Compliance with aspirin was poor.
