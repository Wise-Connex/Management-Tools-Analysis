      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain performances have been touted as improving the performance of organizations which participates in advance planning system. As a result, managers not only have to re-establish their companies to produce higher-quality products and services, decrease waste, respond rapidly to the market, but also to handle their supply chain performance efficiently. However, supply chain performance has received attention and focused on the adaptation of technology to facilitate supply chain performance, but still significant gaps remain in the literature. Most organizations are faced with an array of challenges as they strive to compete in today’s dynamic global markets. Main aim of the study was to determine the conditional effect of supplier relationship on the relationship between advance planning system, and the supply chain performance via. The study was anchored on positivist paradigm and employed explanatory research design. A target population of 591 manufacturing firms of sample of 233 firms were studied. Questionnaires were used as a method of collecting data. The collected data was analyzed using multiple regression models. Results showed that supply advanced planning system significantly influences supply chain organizational performance positively (β=0.6769,p=0.000 &lt; 0.05). Further, supply chain agility (SCA) significantly affected the supply chain organizational performance (SCOP) with coefficients and the probabilities β=0.2730 (p=0.000 &lt; 0.05). Further, the effect of supplier relationship (SR) on relationship between supply chain advanced planning system (SCAPS) and supply chain organization performance (SCOP) was strongly positive (β=.0600,p=0.0049 &lt; 0.05). The moderated mediation further was positive (β = 0.0451) and significant while mediating role of supply chain agility became insignificant to influence supply chain organizational performance. The difference association between insignificant mediating effect of SCA and significant moderated mediation effect can be attributed to the strong moderating role of SR on the link between supply chain advanced planning and the organizational performance. Meaning the supplier relation is critical player because of its effect. In conclusions that supply chain advanced planning improves performance of the overall value of the supply chain by reducing costs and increasing efficiency with leaner operations. It is incredibly significant for manufacturing firms to enhance supply chain organizational performance of the firms competing in global markets to respond to the competitive challenges they encounter in the industry and leveraging these skills to gain a competitive advantage over other. It is a strategic decision for the manufacturing firms to maintain their long-term effectiveness in variable and movable market conditions and to attach importance to agility to be successful. Agile innovation is expressed as shifts in instruments, procedures and initiatives that enable the creation of a facility or business under uncertain circumstances. Agile manufacturing firms should not only encourage facility to adapt efficiently to consumer requirements but also includes reacting with the unpredictable speed to quickly respond to operations and strategic alliances</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: As a result of globalisation and the growing importance of environmental and social issues, construction companies are expected to reduce the environmental impact of their day-to-day activities and make the industry more environmentally friendly. Many research works published have ignored the critical parameters and dimensions of green supply-chain management (GSCM) and logistics performance as environmental protective practices in the construction industry. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how the construction sector should implement GSCM programmes and logistics performance as environmentally friendly practices in their business activities, which would be beneficial to all stakeholders.Objectives: The present study intends to fill this gap by analysing the impact of environmentally friendly practices, such as GSCM and logistics performance in the construction industry in southern Gauteng. This study considered regulatory pressure, green information systems, green packaging, reverse logistics and logistics performance as environmental protective practices.Method: This study adopted a quantitative approach to survey a sample of 440 suppliers and purchasers’ managers from construction companies in the southern Gauteng province. A judgemental or purposive sampling technique was applied to collect data from respondents. Data were analysed with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 27.0) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS 27.0). In addition, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the relationship between constructs and test the hypotheses.Results: This study revealed that regulatory pressure, green information systems, green packaging and reverse logistics significantly influence logistics performance of construction companies.Conclusion: Study demonstrated that through GSCM and logistics performance, construction companies can correlate their business activities and the environment effectively.</jats:p>"

Supply Chain Operations Reference model (SCOR) defines basic processes of the supply chain (SC) into five categories as Plan, Source, Make, Delivery and Return. The search for a more sustainable production and consumption system is so relevant today that the United Nations (UN) have selected it as one of their paramount societal objectives for sustainable development. The implementation of sustainability in production and consumption processes aims to mitigate negative pressures on the ecosystem generated by products, services, and transportation.

The first part of the chapter includes a systematic literature review. Based on the identified research gap, a new mathematical model is described, which makes it possible to describe last-mile logistics processes from an environmental point of view. The functional model of the distribution system includes the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies, which makes it possible to gather real-time information from the distribution process and use real-time status information for a sophisticated design and operation. The mathematical model of this approach defines an NP-hard optimization problem; therefore, heuristic optimization algorithm is supposed to solve the design and operation tasks of the green distribution problem. As the computational results show, cyber-physical systems increase the performance of green supply chain solutions and have a great impact on operational cost. As the numerical example shows, the integrated approach resulted in a 5.3% cost reduction in transportation operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain industry is at the crossroads of the business revolution through the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), impacting business activities across industries. The transformative elements of 4IR offer individual consumers, corporations, and governments unprecedented opportunities to link, collaborate, process, and manage rising consumer and business data to boost decision-making, efficiency, and productivity. Evidence shows that have applied a mix of collaborative and innovative technologies to internal and external activities to manage supply chain disruptions. The groundbreaking technological advancements paved the way for the supply industry to shift supply business prototypes from traditional supply chain models to supply web models. The shift has helped firms resolve national and global supply chain disruptions. The present chapter introduces the Supply Web (SW) concept and its distinctive tenets by adding to the growing body of the evolving Industry 4.0 field, knowledge to help advance the field. The author calls on governments, the global supply industry, and academia to consider embracing the new SW paradigm evolving under 4IR to help resolve societal and consumer challenges emerging in the 21st Century.</jats:p>"

Supply chains can contribute to this by adoption of eco-friendly technologies, sustainable materials, reducing waste, among others. Adopting and scaling innovative technologies such as machine learning, blockchain, internet of things (IoT), and 3D printing has potential to improve efficiency through improved visibility, flexibility and decision making across the supply chain. Efficiency and lean operations may induce vulnerability in supply chains, due to disruptions like the Covid-19 pandemic which can compromise business. The concept of sustainability is explored from both the business and customer perspectives, as well as in the broader policy environment that includes politics, the economy and society. Businesses are likely to adopt sustainable practices if there are financial incentives. However, environmental sustainability cannot be pursued at the expense of business survival. Therefore, the adoption of different technologies has potential to bring us closer to solving the sustainability-profitability paradox.</jats:p>"

The sample of the study consists of company managers operating in the manufacturing sector in Turkey. An online survey was sent to company managers through connections established on LinkedIn and an analysis was carried out with the data collected from 414 participants. As a result of the analysis, it has been determined that environmental uncertainty has a direct, significant and positive effect on competitive advantage. In addition, the results of the research show that supply chain integration and supply chain agility have a partial mediating role in the relationship between environmental uncertainty and competitive advantage. According to the results of this study, in conditions of high environmental uncertainty, companies can increase their supply chain agility capabilities by establishing a more integrated structure with their supply chain partners, and thus gain a unique competitive advantage over their competitors. It has been observed that the relationships between the concepts, which are the subject of the study, have been investigated separately in different studies in the literature. This study will contribute to the literature by investigating the relationships between concepts in a holistic way.</jats:p>"

The searches were conducted on the Internet database platforms using keywords such as logistics, logistics activities, geography of logistics activities, supply chain management, logistics theories and freight models.Results: The relationship between logistics research and theory is ambiguous in that the majority of the research does not explicitly incorporate theory. Logistics particularly benefits from theory originating from other disciplines, such as economics, strategic management and marketing; however, the use of theories that originate from human geography has been limited in logistics research.Conclusion: The drive to understand the movement and storage of freight at different scales has relevance to human geography, particularly the subdisciplines of transport geography and economic geography.

The modeling process was exerted by group-based machine learning techniques, a dynamic random search (DDS) algorithm and ultimately, the model performance was evaluated. In addition to providing stable hydraulic conditions, evaluating the coupled optimization platform (RTC-eco-layout) formulation on a typical day was adequate to beget an average of up to 23% daily energy savings as well as preserving the hydraulic feasibility properties in the range of up to 30% energy cost economies.

Still, LSCM executives are hesitant regarding DSCT implementation. One reason is the difficulty of making a reasonable cost–benefit comparison, because the benefits of using a DSCT are rarely quantified. Moreover, there seems to be no method of quantifying these benefits as of today. Methods: This article builds upon an extensive simulation study of a constructed organic food supply chain (FSC), containing as many as 40 simulation experiments. In this simulation study, three volatility scenarios in the FSC were simulated and their effects on LSCM performance were measured. Subsequently, dynamic simulation experiments were run to emulate DSCT use. The benefits of using a DSCT were then quantified using a newly developed approach. Results: A conclusive method for quantifying the benefits of using a DSCT is presented and validated. Moreover, the performance evaluation of using a DSCT for the multi-echelon inventory management of an organic FSC is given. Conclusions: The study leads towards a method for quantifying the use of DSCTs that is of importance for research and practice alike. For managers, it additionally provides an exemplary application of said method in the context of organic FSCs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: This article examined the performance of South African export-oriented firms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The study is conducted against the backdrop of an export sector which has grown in importance since South Africa came out of economic isolation in the early 1990s, an effect which has been amplified in the last decade given that the world economy has grown meaningfully faster than the domestic sector of the South African economy.Objectives: Given the importance of the rising importance of the export sector, the performance of South African exporting firms is considered, given the observed resilience of export-oriented firms in developed and developing markets. Notably, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic challenged this resilience by disrupting export-oriented firms on the demand side and supply side in their home and foreign markets, potentially threatening network effects and diversification benefits, which have been traditional sources of resilience.Method: Drawing on data for 1023 South African firms, regression analysis was used to assess the impacts of the pandemic on exporting firms relative to non-exporting firms. The study also considered various heterogeneous aspects of exporting firms to provide further insight on their resilience, including firm size, firm age, industry of operation and the nature of export relationships.Results: Incorporating the above various factors, the study results show that export-oriented firms were significantly more vulnerable than non-exporting firms to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.Conclusion: The findings have important implications for policy. First, export-oriented firms are found to be more vulnerable to disruption than non-exporting firms. This is contrary to expectations and different to experiences in other markets. This finding highlights the importance of policy support to the export sector during periods of uncertainty. Second, the export sector’s contribution to the South African economy has grown meaningfully over the past three decades, underlining the importance of supporting a sector that experiences heightened vulnerability when crises strike.</jats:p>"

The results of analysis show that the supply chain management practice (SCMP) has a positive and statistically significant influence on supply chain responsiveness (β = 0.909, p-value = 0.000) and the competitive advantage of firms with the standardized coefficient of (β= 0.639, p-value = 0.000). Similarly, the supply chain responsiveness has a positive and significant effect on competitive advantage by (β = 0.352, p-value = 0.000), on the other hand, supply chain management practice (SCMP) has a significant indirect effect on competitive advantage by (β = 0.320, p-value = 0.000) through supply chain responsiveness. Accordingly, we suggest that managers of food processing should properly manage their supply chain management practice, develop a responsive supply chain to gain a competitive advantage. But this study was limited only to food processing with plc and Share Company.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Nowadays, a gradual change in customers’ attitudes towards transport service makes it more challenging to understand the reasons behind customers’ travel decisions. High-speed rail (HSR) has been mentioned recently and is expected as the best and most modern transport option in long-distance trips in Vietnam. However, research studies have paid scant regard to how HSR’s attributes may affect potential users, and therefore the motivations and barriers to adopting HSR are still unknown.Objectives: This study aimed at examining motivations and barriers to take-up HSR for considering customers’ preference on the proper attributes and levels of HSR.Method: This study drew on a nationwide survey and conjoint analysis to investigate customers’ behaviour.Results: In Vietnam’s context, HSR ticket was found to be the principal barrier to adoption, whereas the speed of HSR was identified as the least important behavioural driver amongst potential HSR users. The results show that HSR design and planning should provide a combination of minimum check-in and waiting time, a 20-min frequency, average speed of 250 km/h, all add-on services and facilities, ticketing of approximately VND 500–700 thousand per 300–500 km and nearby all-day parking.Conclusion: This investigation has demonstrated the value of conjoint analysis to compare a wide range of attributes associated with consumers’ decision to use HSR. The findings indicate that in countries such as Vietnam, in particular, where train usage is low, policymakers and transportation agencies seeking to boost the use of HSR must take attributes other than fare into consideration.</jats:p>"

Since we need to utilize the consent blockchain that implies hyperledger texture every one of the exchanges is straightforward so we can keep away from the specialists and stop the blood to sell in the bootleg market. In this strategy, we utilized the savvy contract for a consent network that implies cold chain (Go Language/Java) code to be composed so third people cannot mess with the information.

The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model enables an integrated, dynamic, and visual assessment of ecosystem services at different scales. In addition, Geodetector is an effective tool for identifying the main driving factors of spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. Therefore, this article takes the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), the most prominent strategic reserve of freshwater resources in China, as the study area and uses the InVEST model to simulate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the supply-demand balance of WSSs and freshwater security patterns in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, and explores the key driving factors of freshwater security index (FSI) with Geodetector. The total supply of WSSs in the TGRA decreased by 1.05% overall between 2005 and 2018, with the head and tail areas being low-value regions for water yield and the central part of the belly areas being high-value regions for water yield. The total demand for WSSs in the TGRA increased by 9.1%, with the tail zones and the central part of the belly zones being the high water consumption areas. In contrast, the head zones are of low water consumption. The multi-year average FSI of the TGRA is 0.12, 0.1, 0.21, and 0.16, showing an upward trend. The key ecological function areas in the TGRA are high-value FSI regions, while the tail zones in the key development areas are low-value FSI regions. Industrial water consumption significantly impacts FSI, with a multi-year average q value of 0.82. Meanwhile, the q value of industrial and domestic water consumption on FSI in 2018 increased by 43.54% and 30%, respectively, compared with 2005. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variation of WSSs and detects the drivers in the natural-economic-social perspective and innovation in ecosystem services research. The study results can guide water resource security management in other large reservoirs or specific reservoir areas.</jats:p>"

Our research employs a controlled laboratory experiment to study these biases when both types of uncertainty—that is, supply and demand uncertainty—are present. Our results show that the presence of both supply and demand uncertainty has a more nuanced effect on decision biases than does either type of uncertainty alone. Demand uncertainty can elicit and influence the diversification bias, even in the absence of supply uncertainty. Moreover, supply uncertainty affects the magnitude of the pull‐to‐center bias.

It can be concluded that research is mainly focused on answering technological questions, and only very few studies take into account the logistics processes related to blending technologies, their design, cost-efficiency, utilization and sustainability including energy efficiency and environmental impact. Based on this fact, within the frame of this research the authors describe a new approach, extending the basic model of blending problems by adding new supply chain efficiency-related components that makes it possible to take logistics parameters related to the raw materials supply (available stocks, batch sizes, transport and storage costs, supply chain structure) into consideration. A mathematical model of this supply chain optimization problem for blending technologies is described including routing and assignment problems in the supply chain, while technological objectives are also taken into consideration as technological objective functions and constraints. The optimization problem described in the model is a problem with non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard), which means that there are no known efficient analytical methods to solve the logistics-related supply chain optimization of blending technologies. As a solution algorithm, the authors have used an evolutive solver and a new metrics, which improved the efficiency of the comparison of distances between solutions of routing problems represented by permutation arrays. The scenario analysis, which focuses on the integrated optimization of technological and logistics problems validates the model and evaluates the solution algorithm and the new metrics. Using the mentioned algorithm, the supply chain processes of the blending technologies can be improved from availability, efficiency, sustainability point of view.</jats:p>"

Further, the study used questionnaires as primary data collection instruments. Data analysis was done using both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The study rejected the null hypothesis that supply chain configuration does not moderate the relationship between dynamic supply chain capabilities and resilience in the retail sector. From the analysed data, the moderating effect of SCC had a reducing impact on the relationship between dynamic SC capabilities and resilience in the retail industry. In this regard, the study makes some substantive recommendations; that retail chains should re-evaluate their suppliers upstream and engage in objective supplier base reduction and rationalization to reconfigure their retail chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Russia is the largest natural gas supplier to the EU. The invasion of Ukraine was followed by a cut-off of gas supplies from Russia to many EU countries, and the EU is planning to ban or dramatically reduce its dependence from Russia. We provide a dataset of daily gas consumption in five sectors (household and public buildings heating, power, industry, and other sectors) with supply source shares in the EU27 &amp;amp; UK from 2016 to 2022. The dataset separates the contributions of Russian gas imports, and other supply sources, and accounts for storage to estimate consumption. The dataset was developed with a gas network flow simulation model based on mass flow balance by combining data from multiple datasets including daily ENTSO-G pipelines gas transport and storage, ENTSO-E daily power production from gas, and Eurostat monthly gas consumption statistics per sector. The annual consumption data was validated against BP Statistical Review of World Energy and Eurostat datasets. We secondly analysed the share of gas supplied by Russia in each country to quantify the ‘gap’ that would result from a cessation of all Russian exports to Europe. Thirdly, we collected multiple data sources to assess how national gaps could be alleviated by 1) reducing the demand for heating in a plausible way using the lower envelope of gas empirical consumption – temperature functions, 2) increasing power generation from sources other than gas, 3) transferring gas savings from countries with surplus to those with deficits, and 4) increasing imports from other countries like Norway, the US, and Australia from either pipelines or LNG imports, accounting for existing capacities. Our results indicate that it should be theoretically possible for the EU to make up collectively for a sudden shortfall of Russian gas if combining the four solutions together, provided a perfect collaboration between EU countries and with the UK to redistribute gas from countries with surplus to those with deficits. Further analyses are required to investigate the implications for the costs including social, economic, and institutional dimensions, political barriers, and negative impacts on climate policies with inevitable increases of CO2 emissions if the use of coal is ramped up in the power sector.\n                        </jats:p>"

Considering that two types of supply chains could choose between centralized (C) and decentralized channel structures (D), we first establish four channel structure models based on optimization theory, namely, Models DD, DC, CD, and CC. Wherein Model DD(CC) means that two supply chains adopt the channel structure D(C) simultaneously and Model DC(CD) refers to GSSC adopting the channel structure D(C) while TSSC using the channel structure C(D). Further, we develop an evolutionary game to discuss the ESSs of the dynamic competitive system under different market environment. The research results show that the stronger the integration between upstream and downstream firms of GSSC is, the supply chain would more likely provide higher green service when the TSSC has a decentralized channel structure. Moreover, when the competition between two supply chains is sufficiently low, only point (0,0) is the ESS; when it is moderate, there are two ESSs, i.e., ESS (0,0) and ESS (1,1); when it is very high, only point (1,1) is the ESS. Numerical studies are conducted to examine the effects of competition coefficient on prices, demands and profits, as well as the roles of initial states of two supply chains’ channel strategies on their ESSs.</jats:p>"

The results obtained confirmed the existence of a major impact on the operating activity of the Tunisian companies in the sample. 68% of the companies surveyed recorded deterioration in their activities and 29% of them experienced a severe decrease. To cope with the consequences of the crisis, three policies have been adopted to quantitatively and qualitatively adjust human resources to the needs of companies: temporary reduction in the workforce, Tele-working and dismissal.\nThe study then shed light on the situation of the supply chain of companies. Four behavior patterns were detected. Maintaining a fluid and regular relationship with suppliers and customers has pushed companies to implement technological solutions to manage flows and maintain the relationship.\nHowever, the results of our research remain limited due to the low response rate from companies. The theoretical framework is not sufficiently referenced due to the novelty of the subject. Finally, we lack the necessary perspective on the consequences of the strategies adopted by companies.

The pandemic has highlighted the weight of the supply chain in the regular functioning of the global economy.

This research uses a single case study methodology and 24 SC employees in Belgium and Germany took part in a survey. To measure the effect of SC disruptions on the firm’s financial performance, quarterly financial statement data was collected from the years 2018 to 2021. The results of the regression analysis show that there is no significant impact of SC disruptions on the firm’s productivity and non-financial performance. The paired samples <jats:italic>t-</jats:italic>test suggests that there is no significant change in the firm’s financial performance before and during Covid-19.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contributes to the supply chain finance literature with an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation model focusing on the bank’s point of view. Our theoretical model assesses how a bank should screen a supply chain (SC) member and whether that requires different considerations and monitoring systems compared with traditional corporate loans. In the model, the SC members may cooperate, reducing their bankruptcy risk considerably; thus, the chance for and extent of inter-entity financial aid are critical to consider when assessing bankruptcy risk. A cooperative SC member cannot just be financed from debt taken by other members, but it may also offer protection to other SC members using its operating cash flow. Thus, based on our results, bankruptcy risk is SC-specific, rather than a characteristic of an individual firm. Therefore, to finance an SC member is a quasi-joint decision of its peers, so particular care should be paid to estimating and monitoring the correlations between the operational cash flows of cooperative SC members. One of the key results is that of edge default exposure of the bank; it might be optimal to limit the amount of the loan made available to a given collaborative SC member instead of charging higher rates or financing the most attractive SC member only. Another SC member offering an additional guarantee with its assets will provide the remaining need for financing. As this solution also reduces the total bankruptcy risk of the SC, the SC itself should prefer this financing structure.</jats:p>"

An increasing number of companies are relying on supply chain resources in the technology development process. Based on the framework of knowledge resource orchestration and the survey data of Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in China’s automotive industry, this study comprehensively analyzed the influencing factors of technological innovations in supply chain enterprises. The analysis of the research by the Bootstrapping method found that supply chain relationship quality (SCRQ) positively impacts corporate technological innovations, in which knowledge sharing and knowledge integration play a dual mediating role. The investigation of the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) revealed that individual elements do not constitute a necessary condition for high-tech innovations in supply chain firms. Mutual commitment among supply chain members plays a more pervasive role in generating high-tech innovations. The two results corroborate each other and further illustrate the vital role of the intersection of SCRQ and knowledge management for corporate technological innovations.</jats:p>"

Many industrialized countries have gradually enlarged their innovation policy mix to include demand-side interventions, among them the use of public procurement to stimulate innovation investment at the firm level. Latin America, though, exhibits an unbalanced policy mix with little deployment of policy interventions that tackle the conditions that affect the demand for innovation. Using nonexperimental impact evaluation techniques, this research not only assesses the impacts of participating in public procurement projects on firm-level innovation efforts and outcomes but also compares these impacts with traditional supply-side approaches. The findings suggest that public procurement has a significant impact on innovation outcomes, but the results only hold when public procurement requires the development of new solutions. Regular or noninnovative public procurement does not show any impact on firm-level innovation.</jats:p>"

Supply management is a political success, supported by federal and provincial governments, Canada’s major political parties, and the Canadian public. Judgements of its programmatic success differ according to the weight placed on its different objectives. Supply management has achieved the foremost goal of its founders: stabilizing domestic production and increasing producers’ bargaining power. Yet it is credited with higher consumer costs for Canadian consumers, high entry costs for future farmers, and impeding needed policy change. On process success criteria, the conflicted and even precarious success that jeopardized supply management in its early days has largely, but not entirely, given way to resilient success.</jats:p>",

The objective of this case study is to demonstrate the supply chain of an electronics industry in the industrial pole of Manaus, evaluating the scenario before and during the pandemic, its main difficulties, from the shortage of raw materials up to the high costs of international freights. The final good industry is totally dependent on component industries, the complicating factor is that in general the components are supplied by Asia, and arrive in Manaus by sea and air transport. At the height of the pandemic, ports were closed and flights were canceled, causing impacts on the supply chain. Some components are produced by local industries, however they also suffered shortages of virgin raw materials for processing, triggering consequences on the entire supply chain. The method used was a case study, and used a strategic tool such as SWOT analysis, a quality tool such as ISHIKAWA, and a risk mapping tool such as GUT Matrix and 5W2H action plan. Data were collected through interviews, observations and archival information, allowing the researcher free to walk in the direction of construct solutions, with the author's own experience, who works in the area, an important component of contextualizing the research. From the observation of the data, it was evidenced that the analyzed industry started a crisis management, and actions to mitigate and manage the impacts of the pandemic on its logistics chain and despite the challenges faced, the company's business continuity results were achieved, and bringing maturity to the integrated logistics chain management process.</jats:p>"

Based on the supply chain network data disclosed by Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2019, this paper uses edge betweenness centrality as a representative index of supplier-customer network centrality to explore the moderating effect of edge betweenness centrality on the impact of customer stock price changes on supplier stock price changes. It is found that the change of customer stock price has a significant positive correlation with the change of supplier stock price in the next month, and the higher supplier-customer edge betweenness centrality degree, the more significant the positive correlation. This conclusion is robust, and low supplier concentration will enhance the moderating effect of this indicator. Additionally, the new customer momentum factor can be further constructed by using the edge betweenness centrality. The research of this paper provides a new applicable situation for the transmission of customer momentum, helps to enrich the literature related to supply chain information management and realize the mining of Alpha in supply chain data.</jats:p>"

The SolarWinds supply chain cyber-attack is reviewed in light of its kinetic effects. The Russian-Ukrainian war is then discussed, where the article observes that the kinetic effects of the conflict have far more real-life consequences than the SolarWinds cyber-attack. The paper’s thesis does not discount the effects of a cyber-attack on supply chains. Instead, it perceives that kinetic disruptions of supply chains due to economic sanctions are promptly experienced, whereas cyber disruptions have an almost ethereal quality as far as the public is concerned. The result is that the current economic sanctions against the Russian Federation, its allies, and its people are affecting the sanctionees and the sanctionors. The article concludes that the supply chain disruptions caused by Western sanctions have a larger kinetic effect than the SolarWinds cyber-attack.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the supply of piped water to the Indian cities is increasing, the demand is not always fulfilled. This gap in water demand and supply is usually bridged by using alternate sources of water, mostly groundwater. Bangalore, the capital city of Karnataka, is one of the fastest developing metropolitan cities in India is also facing piped water supply issues. The groundwater is the main source of alternate water supply in the city. In the present study, a District Metered Area (DMA) is selected in the Bangalore South-West division; this DMA has both intermittent and continuous water supply systems. The water distribution network (WDN) of study DMA contains four inlets and three supply zones. The first is a continuous water supply system whereas the second and third are the intermittent systems. The impact of inequitable supply in the study DMA is evaluated and the consumption of groundwater to cope with insufficient water supply is analyzed. The Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient are used to assess the inequity in groundwater extraction under intermittent and continuous supply zones. The data from the field flowmeters, consumer meter reading, and door-to-door questionnaire survey are used for the analysis. The questionnaire survey includes RR number, presence of wells/borewells, horsepower (HP) of the pumps used, building type, the number of inhabitants, and the floors in each building. In the continuous supply system, a questionnaire survey was untaken for 80% of the connections, whereas in the intermittent supply system random sampling was used. The questionnaire survey analysis showed that 53% of the consumers in the continuous supply system rely on piped water supply, whereas others used groundwater as well as piped water supply. The study illustrated the gap in groundwater consumption between supply zones within intermittent water supply systems as well as between intermittent and continuous water supply zones. Reliability on groundwater was high even in continuous supply systems indicating insufficient pressures resulting in unsatisfied demands. The study indicated that just increasing the access to the piped water supply to the consumers is not sufficient, the acceptable quality with adequate pressure of water should be delivered to reduce the use of groundwater. The inferences from the study can be used to regulate groundwater extraction.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the planned work on the way to the final literature review is defined. Therefore, research questions, for a qualitative argumentation with the ripple effect are phrased. The aim is to find out how resilient supply chain networks react on the ripple effect, how the effects of the exogenic shocks can be measured to compare supply chain networks, and which simulation techniques are appropriate to justify and quantify the results. Furthermore, the target quantitative bibliometric analyze patterns are defined and a brief conclusion is capturing achievments and stating out next steps.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc the world over, simultaneously creating opportunities for some, including ‘Big Pharma.’ Governments continue to have the obligation for managing the pandemic, and many governments delegated the responsibility for vaccine supply to Big Pharma. Developed countries generously funded vaccine development, while reserving the first option to purchase the vaccines for themselves, thus being accused of vaccine hoarding. Concurrently, Big Pharma has disclaimed liability for any side effects caused by the virus, and any obligation to share its vaccine intellectual property. This left most of the world, particularly the Global South, in a precarious position regarding vaccine supply. This article discusses the obligations of governments to their own people and to the rest of the world and the obligations of Big Pharma, specifically regarding equitable vaccine supply during the COVID-19 pandemic. To articulate its arguments for vaccine equity, the author relies primarily on the right to dignity and attempts to balance this right against the seemingly conflicting interests of the Global North. The vaccine equity issue is an intersectional issue perpetuated by systemic inequalities affected by a myriad of factors including historical power imbalances. It is argued that all parties need to act to overcome the pandemic, especially states and companies in the Global North. This would be consistent with international policy and legal environment and the requirements of global justice.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the study considers various scenarios in which Oklahoma legalizes recreational cannabis for adult use and simulates changes in state-level market sales for other legal states and the average grower profits in Oklahoma. We assume that legalizing recreational cannabis in medical-only states would significantly increase the demand quantity in the legalized states and the local government would levy a significant level of tax on recreational cannabis.

Furthermore, we find that as the excise tax rate on recreational cannabis in Oklahoma is increased, the demand quantity in recreational cannabis market would decrease while the other markets’ demand quantity would increase on average. As the elasticity of substitution between state-level products increases, the overall demand quantity would increase and the market quantity across states become more sensitive to Oklahoma’s tax policies. This pattern could become starker as the elasticity of substitution between recreational and medical cannabis increases. In terms of profit, heavy taxation and price decrease due to legalization would significantly decrease cannabis producers’ production and profit levels unless the cost reduction strategies complement legalization.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Based on our results, the legalization of recreational cannabis has the potential to generate tax revenue to fund critical government projects and services. However, such legalization would have to be done carefully because heavy excise taxes would decrease the legal cannabis market demand and growers’ profit, which would incentivize producers and consumers to move to the illicit cannabis market. Policymakers would have to compromise between the levels of interstate transportation and taxation to ensure that cannabis suppliers also realize some profit within the cannabis supply chain.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Meanwhile, with the popularity of mobile aerial base stations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted cloud computing is essential for providing diversified service at areas without available infrastructure. However, it is difficult to meet the requirements of a number of IoT devices which distribute a large area through one single UAV cloud server, and thus multi-clouds have been applied in large-scale IoT environments. Due to the limited battery capacity of UAV, hybrid energy supply has been considered as an effective approach. How to allocate the computing resources and offload the tasks to the UAV-assisted clouds is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the trade-off between the energy consumption and system performance in a UAV-assisted multi-clouds system. Considering the transmission and execution cost, a dynamic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the power consumption of UAVs with the constraint of queue stability is formulated, which is further decomposed into three sub-problems using stochastic optimization techniques. A collaborative task offloading and resources allocation algorithm (CTORAA) based on artificial intelligent technique is proposed to jointly determine task offloading and energy harvesting. We provide corresponding mathematical analysis showing that CTORAA can reach the arbitrary profit-stability trade-off. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our algorithm.</jats:p>"

The adoption of BPS can create new supplier-buyer relations that are different from traditional ones because the traded products are usually outside of the core business of the supplier, so the new relations need to be coordinated. This paper considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The by-product is randomly generated along with the production of the core product. The manufacturer sells its core product directly to the market with uncertain demand and sells the by-product to the retailer facing stochastic demand. To coordinate both the manufacturer’s production and retailer’s order decisions and achieve efficient performance, we analyze several contracts and find that a combined contract with an ABD contract and a revenue sharing contract could coordinate the supply chain and realize Pareto-improvement. A numerical experiment is also carried out to explore the influences of fluctuations in demand and supply on the performance of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the total supply chain.</jats:p>",

Renewable power sources are highly specific in prevalence, both regionally and temporally, and their utilization at utility-scale for round-the-clock power supply poses the problem of matching power generation capacity and power demand at every instant of time. In the present work, we propose a model that integrates geographically distributed and diverse power sources with geographically spread-out power consumption centres and distributed and diverse electrical energy storage systems through transmission and storage loss models. For a regional electricity grid, the model computes, over a given day, the minute-by-minute power demand from and power generation in all districts, extracts matching power from a hierarchy of power sources so as to minimize transmission and storage losses, and stores/draws excess power in/from a variety of power storage options. For the specific case of the South Indian Power Grid (catering to about 285 million people in South India), the model shows that about 240 GWh of new electrical storage is required for round-the-clock power supply from non-GHG power sources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The circular economy has emerged as a new paradigm for sustainability. The ‘take-make-reutilise’ concept of the circular model is considered to be far more superior to the traditional ‘take-make-dispose’ linear model. The concepts of circular economy and sustainability are closely related; the circular economy is considered a driver to more sustainable business. Our existing global food system is highly unsustainable. Roughly, one-third of the total food produced gets lost or waste at different stages of food supply chain. Further, the agriculture sector is also a victim of and a major contributor to climate change. Hence, our food system is in urgent need of transformation from the existing unsustainable to be made more sustainable and healthier. So, it is critically important to adopt circular economy-driven sustainability practices in the food industry and its supply chain. While there have been many studies in the past which built conceptual knowledge on the circular economy and sustainable food business practices, rarely any study attempts to investigate the perception of food business managers/executives by integrating both concepts.  The article analyses the circular-economy driven sustainability adoption practices in the food supply chain. Based on the survey of managers and business executives of 26 selected food companies in India, the study investigates the managerial perception on sustainability adoption practices in food supply chain. The findings indicate that food business managers and executives believe that adoption of sustainable practices is extremely important for food business sustainability. However, their sustainability adoption practices were found to be on moderate level across the food supply chain. The major recommendation is that the government should take the proactive approach to educate the agri-food industry particularly the traditional food enterprises including SMEs about the benefits of the adoption of circular economy and sustainability approaches. Policy-based initiatives are required to develop the enabling conditions in terms of provision of necessary infrastructure, delivering technical-know, promoting innovations and extending the financial support for successful adoption of circular economy-driven sustainability practices by agri-food sector and its supply chain.</jats:p>"

With the rapid development of cloud computing technology, a distributed datacenter plays a vital role in supply chain management of many infrastructures but suffers from high energy consumption and low service efficiency due to heavy allocation of massive calculation and analysis tasks. In this paper, an efficient multi-swarm particle swarm optimization approach is proposed based on load balancing. Both makespan and completion time variances of all resources have been minimized. An initialization scheme is also presented concerning the convergence rate and adaptive inertia weights. An open dataset from an Alibaba datacenter has been employed to resolve the uneven load events caused by inefficient supply chain arrangement between distributed tasks and resources. Two criteria, makespan and response time during task scheduling have been chosen for performance evaluation. According to the results, the proposed work can improve task scheduling efficiency and sustainability in distributed datacenters supporting diverse supply chain environments.</jats:p>"

First of all, the state transition probability tree is constructed to represent the state transition of each enterprise, then the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) is used to analyze the scale of risk spread, and the diffusion threshold of risk is discussed. We find that the herd mentality, self-vigilance, talent recruitment, and enterprise management will effectively curb the spread of risks. Directly recruiting talents and strengthening enterprise management is more effective than increasing vigilance.

This system aims to improve the water harvesting capacity by using a shared harvesting system at the neighborhood level and digital technology. The presentation of this system is organized as follows: (i) identification of the challenges of the rainwater harvesting at the neighborhood level, (ii) design of the smart RWH system architecture that addresses the challenges identified in the first phase, (iii) realization of a simulation-based reliability analysis for the smart system performance. This methodology was applied to a residential neighborhood in the city of Jenin, Palestine. The main challenges of smart water harvesting included optimizing the shared tank capacity, and the smart control of the water quality and leakage. The smart RWH system architecture design is proposed to imply the crowdsourcing-based and automated-based smart chlorination unit to control and monitor fecal coliform and residual chlorine: screens, filters, and the first flush diverter address RWH turbidity. Water level sensors/meters, water flow sensors/meters, and water leak sensors help detect a water leak and water allocation. The potential time-based reliability (Re) and volumetric reliability (Rv) for the smart RWH system can reach 38% and 41%, respectively. The implication of the smart RWH system with a dual water supply results in full reliability indices (100%). As a result, a zero potable water shortage could be reached for the dual water supply system, compared to 36% for the municipal water supply and 59% for the smart RWH system. Results show that the smart RWH system is efficient in addressing potable water security, especially when combined with a dual water supply system.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the single-phase model of the MMC was established to deduce the working characteristics of the MMC-RPC and its compensation principle for the traction power supply system with the v/v wiring transformer. Secondly, the adaptive VSG control strategy was adopted for the inverter of the MMC-RPC to provide dynamic inertial and damping support for the traction power supply system based on the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control. Compared with the traditional double closed-loop (DCL) and VSG controls, it has better anti-disturbance and dynamic performance. The root locus analysis of control parameters based on a small signal model shows that VSG control can provide more stability margin. Furthermore, Differential Flatness Control (DFC) was used in the inner-loop controller to ensure the stable control of the inverter and the stability was verified by the Lyapunov stability analysis. For the rectifier of the MMC-RPC, a hierarchical three-level control strategy with system-level control, cluster-group voltage control, and inter-cluster voltage control for keeping the voltage balance was adopted. Finally, simulation results on the Matlab/Simulink platform verified the effectiveness and stability of the joint control applied in the MMC-RPC.</jats:p>"

Then the buyer will need to reserve capacity from suppliers and pay for this in advance of knowing the final demand. “Capacity Games with Supply Function Competition” by Edward Anderson, Bo Chen, and Lusheng Shao studies a very general version of this problem, in which both capacity and production costs are volume dependent. They explore how an auction will operate in this setting and allow supply function bids from suppliers. They apply this framework to a newsvendor problem with unreliable suppliers, a portfolio procurement setting with supply options and a spot market, and a bundling problem with nonsubstitutable products. This helps to understand when we may expect the buyer to make a reservation choice that maximizes the overall supply chain profit. The key to these results is to show that the supply chain optimal profit is submodular in the set of suppliers. </jats:p>",

Using individual-level data for 2003–2016 and exploiting geographic variation in early immigrant settlements together with time variation in female immigration inflows, we find that female immigration has led to disparate outcomes across women of different education levels and family structures. In line with the evidence from developed countries, female immigration to the DR is associated with an increase in the hours worked by highly educated native women with family dependents (relative to equally educated women without dependents). However, for low-educated native women, female immigration is associated with a decrease in hours worked and in earnings. Our results underscore the importance of studying the disparate effects of migration on vulnerable groups in developing countries.</jats:p>",

Here we show a new mechanism that can explain them. We begin by showing how the order of mutations can alter evolutionary trajectories. We present a framework integrating both mutation and environmental biases and show that mutation bias can strongly outweigh any environmental bias, a regime we call “supply-driven” evolution. We then show how a common type of mutation bias, where detrimental mutations are more common than beneficial mutations, can drive the locking-in of structural hierarchies such as eukaryotism or multicellularity, independently from the environment. Finally, we generalize this result to show how any mutation (or sets of mutations) that creates the possibility of new phenotypes can persist for a very long period of time. That is, innovations that make possible a large range of new phenotypes can become frozen in time. By becoming frozen, these novel structures can no longer change, which means a range of phenotypes also become impossible. This opening and closing of phenotypic space is a new mechanism of macro-evolution.</jats:p>"

Specifically, it assesses the extent, depth, and severity of minimum wage violations in the Cameroon labor market, and evaluates the impact of the 2008 minimum wage review on labor supply in Cameroon between 2005 and 2010. To achieve these objectives, use is made of the violation class of indices, bivariate probit, and the control function. Empirical results show that minimum wage violation is more prevalent, deeper, and severer among rural (female) workers than their urban (male) counterparts. Results also confirm a direct relationship between engaging in the formal sector and labor supply over the period 2005–2010 and participating in the formal sectoincreasesse the hours of work. These findings are in tandem with the wisdom that the Cameroon government could adopt a compliance-enhancing strategy that needs to be comprehensive, addressing issues throughout the design, adjusting, and implementing the minimum wage policies especially in the informal sector, rural areas, and deprived female groups.</jats:p>"

The studies on the subject have been generally focused on classical and labyrinth side weirs. However, the same is not true for piano key side weirs (PKSW) in a straight channel. The piano key weir (PKW) has high discharge capacity compared with classical weirs. In this study, the hydraulic characteristics of a trapezoidal piano key side weir (TPKSW) in straight channels were investigated experimentally. In all experiments, the hydraulic characteristics of nine TPKSW models were studied extensively using the De Marchi, Domínguez and Schmidt approaches in the subcritical flow regime, with Froude number range 0.12 &amp;lt; F1 &amp;lt; 0.87. The results show that a TPKSW provides better performance compared to traditional rectangular and triangular labyrinth side weirs. Specifically, for the 0.12 &amp;lt; F1 &amp;lt; 0.4 condition, the efficiencies of a TPKSW and trapezoidal labyrinth side weir are close to each other. A trapezoidal labyrinth side weir is more efficient than a TPKSW at larger Froude numbers. The discharge capacity of the TPKSW is 2.9 to 12 times higher than that of the rectangular side weir. Scatter diagrams were obtained for CPW and F1 numbers using various approaches available in the literature. The diagram generated by the De Marchi approach has much less scattering, compared to the diagrams generated by the Domínguez and Schmidt approaches. It has been determined that TPKSWs are an effective type of side weir in lateral flows. Lastly, an empirical equation was obtained for the discharge coefficient, which is in good agreement with the experimental data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Existing studies have predominantly explored the influence of supply chain resilience on the performance of firms in the context of developed economies. This study highlights the need for SMEs to be prepared to tackle uncertainties in business operations. Background: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role in every economy, and limited studies have highlighted the significance of resilience in the firms. Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of supply chain resilience on SMEs’ performance in Saudi Arabia based on three dimensions of resilience, namely agility, robustness, and flexibility. It aims to investigate how they relate to the dimensions of SMEs’ performance, namely production performance and market/sales performance. This study also investigates the overall impact of supply chain resilience as a construct on SMEs’ performance. Methods: This study employed a quantitative research design to answer the research questions. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The study was based on 255 samples of managers in SMEs from Saudi Arabia. The hypothesized model has been tested using the SPSS/Amos 26. Results: Based on the findings, it has been found that supply chain agility and flexibility had a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production and marketing/sales performances. Supply chain robustness demonstrated a significant positive relationship with SMEs’ production performance but not their marketing/sales performances. Overall, there was a significant positive relationship between supply chain resilience and SMEs’ performance. Conclusions: This study contributes to the body of literature on supply chain resilience by expounding knowledge on aspects such as agility, flexibility, and robustness. The study enhances our understanding of the role of supply chain resilience on SMEs’ performance in an emerging economy context.</jats:p>"

Solar distillation is a promising technology for brine management. The main goal of this study was to treat high salinity solution of reverse osmosis desalination brine and to recover valuable resources while producing freshwater. The implementation of the study is through two phases: the first phase includes desalination by a reverse osmosis process to produce fresh water and the concentrated brine, while the second phase consists of recovering solid salts using the solar distillation. Thus, different experiments of desalination by reverse osmosis pilot and solar distillation were carried out under optimal experimental conditions. The obtained results showed that chlorides are the most dominant constituents in the composition of brines, while the daily water productivity contributed to around 80% of the total productivity of the solar system (volume of the water produced/m2/day) and the amount of salt crystallized by solar distillation represents 35 grams per liter of brine, this salt is greatly demanded in several sectors such as agriculture, industry, and others.</jats:p>",

The Act is examined from a critical perspective to see what effect it would have had if it had existed when the attack occurred. The SolarWinds cyber attack is then discussed in some detail. In deciding what would have happened if the FASCA was a law at the time of the attack, the events are presumed to be the same as what took place. It was at the time when the cyber-attack information reached the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC) that the incident would likely have changed. The paper argues that there would be delays in the actions of the FASC due to the complexity of the bureaucracy involved. The article concludes that the projected outcome would differ from the actual outcome because the cyber-attack would have been handled administratively rather than legislatively in the proposed outcome. This difference may or may not have fostered mitigation of the cyber-attack.</jats:p>",

It demonstrates that the relationship between capacity and capital structure is not as simple as the existing literature suggests. If the supplier is very powerful, it will use a mixed capital structure and build less capacity than if it were equity financed. If the buyer is very powerful, the supplier will use all debt financing and overbuild capacity. In this case, the supplier would not agree to build capacity ex ante if it were prohibited from borrowing. Hence, borrowing is Pareto optimal. Under a more balanced power structure, the supplier may choose all debt financing and overbuild capacity or all equity financing and underbuild capacity, depending on the trade‐off of the bargaining benefits and costs of debt financing. </jats:p>",

They come from faulty production systems, in poor organization of distribution processes or are related to external factors, often unseen. Consequently, it is necessary to build resistant chains. This article discusses this topic in the context of the basic types of supply chains, i.e. agile, lean and green. The aim of the study was to assess the types of chains in which the tested production entities are embedded and check if the proposed models of building resilience take this into account. The reason this should be investigated further, is to indicate relationships in areas that are rarely captured in research models. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the work. Interviews were conducted in over seventy subjects and a critical analysis of the literature on model of resilient supply chains was performed. As a result of the work undertaken, it can be concluded, inter alia, that in the economic reality, there are hybrid chains in which the characteristics of pro-saving chains prevail. It was also established that the proposed research models for resilient chains should take into account, to greater extent, accents compatible with the nature of the chains occurring an economic reality. It is also necessary to extend their content to include pro-environmental components. At the same time, it is not unequivocal that the chains with the advantage of agility-related attributes are more resistant than the chains in which the greater concentration is attributed to the attributes of lean or green chains. Determining this requires further research.</jats:p>",

Our results suggest a single significant path for explaining SCRM in young SMEs, while we found three significant paths for explaining SCRM in mature SMEs. Furthermore, the results indicate that demand risk is the only external factor for young SMEs to realise SCRM success. For mature SMEs, demand risk and/or relative performance are essential to explain SCRM performance. Based on our findings, we theoretically contribute by unravelling the pathways through which external factors influence SCRM performance.

The study aims to use the artificial ventilation approach to improve the performance of the compound labyrinth weirs. The current study proposes artificial ventilation techniques to mitigate the pressure behind nappe flow and to improve the coefficient of discharge. The data have been collected for three cases (without vented (WV), with vented (V), and with suction (S)). The results indicated that the pressure distribution behind nappe flow was not similar for all tested points. Also, a slight negative pressure was observed when H′t/P′ was measured between 0.1 and 0.2. Artificial ventilation with a suction pump was the best technique to reduce pressure behind the nappe flow when compared with a vent pipe device. Furthermore, the compound coefficient of discharge (Cdc) using the suction and vent devices was greater than the compound coefficient of discharge (Cdc) without the vent devices by 10% and 4.5%, respectively. The empirical equations were provided to predict the compound coefficient of discharge when pressure data behind nappe flow is available.</jats:p>",

This is especially true of novel/future fuels and technologies in large industries. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was formulated to represent biofuel supply chains across Europe for the production of three novel marine fuels and to allow the selection of fuel conversion technologies, biomass supply locations, and the logistics of transportation from resources to conversion and from conversion to final markets. On top of this, the total production costs and emissions were calculated and compared to current marine fuels to assess the implementation potential and feasibility of these fuels. The MILP model was used to design and analyze optimal distribution and conversion systems, using a realistic data-set covering the European member states and 15 of the largest bunkering ports in the EU. The results showed that on average, the fuels obtained a 72% greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction compared to a fossil fuel comparator and ranged from 22–36 €/GJ in total production costs. It was also discovered that forestry residues were the best-suited biomass for the production of these fuels and that Poland had the highest supply potential of all considered states. The available supply of biomass was sufficient for the demand in the foreseeable future, the largest impediment to the adoption of these fuels is the available refining potential in Europe.</jats:p>"

However, the insufficient supply of heme limits the whole-cell P450 biocatalytic activity. Here we report a strategy of improving intracellular heme supply for enhancing the catalytic efficiencies of P450s. After comparing the effects of enhancing heme transport and biosynthesis on P450 activities, intracellular heme supply was optimized through the integrated expression of necessary synthetic genes at proper ratio and the assembly of rate-limiting enzymes using DNA-guided scaffolds. By the combined use of mutated heme-sensitive biosensor and small regulatory RNA systems, the intracellular heme level was fine-tuned. The catalytic efficiencies of three different P450s, BM3, sca-2 and CYP105D7, were enhanced through fine-tuning heme supply for the synthesis of hydroquinone, pravastatin, and 7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone as examples of chemical intermediate, drug, and natural product, respectively. This strategy will be useful to produce other hemoproteins with high activities.</jats:p>"

This study analyzes the system by modeling and simulation responses under dynamic operating conditions. The model includes a compressor, a cooler, and an external humidifier in a series. Different air mass flow rates that represent demand changes were simulated in the compressor model, including extreme conditions under compressor surge. Then, the air temperature was reduced in the cooler by exchanging heat to coolant flow before reaching the humidifier. Lastly, the humidification model presents heat and mass transfer between wet air from the cathode exhaust to the supply air through a bundle of membranes. Simulation results were observed in MATLAB/Simulink, which predicted the changes in supply air characteristics and effects of load changes to the system. Higher load requires more flow rate and higher compressor speed, leading to lower water content in the cathode air. Due to low flow rate and high pressure, a compressor surge could cause an unstable cathode air supply.</jats:p>",

Long-term changes in hydrological processes are referred to as climate change for an area. Urbanization, population growth, and economic growth are all having negative effects on the environment. The study of trends in the long term is essential from climatic change and socioeconomic perspectives. Examining the temporal variations in rainfall is crucial because changes in rainfall patterns and distribution can have a significant impact on the amount of water available in a watershed. The objective of the study is to assess the long-term (1902–2021) temporal trends in seasonal (winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) and annual rainfall for the Rajsamand district of Rajasthan state using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) technique. Due to its ability to provide results in graphical form, the ITA approach is a very useful tool for detecting patterns in rainfall time series data. This technique is also used to detect trends as ‘low,’ ‘medium,’ and ‘high,’ which should be considered in future studies on floods ‘high’ and drought ‘low’, respectively. Based on the above study, it is observed that no trend is detected for the annual season, a positive trend is detected in the winter season and a negative trend is detected for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in some regimes respectively. The ITA of the S-W monsoon also specifies that in the low regime the nature of the trend is increasing and in the high regime nature of the trend is decreasing. This research will serve as a scientific foundation for assessing and mitigating the effect of climate change on the environment to reduce the risk of weather patterns.</jats:p>",

This paper studies the platform’s design choices and creators’ participation and supply decisions when users’ (viewers’) consumption of goods (content) is financed by third-party advertisers. The model specifies the platform’s scale: number of creators and content supplied and magnitudes of viewers, advertisers, and revenues. I examine how the distribution of creator capabilities affects market concentration among creators and how it can be influenced by platform design. Tools for ad management and analytics are more impactful when the platform has sufficient content and viewers but has low ad demand. Conversely, reducing viewers’ distaste for ads through better matching and timing—which can create win–win–win effects throughout the ecosystem—is important when the platform has strong demand from advertisers. Platform infrastructure improvements that motivate creators to supply more content (e.g., development toolkits) must be chosen carefully to avoid creating higher concentration among a few powerful creators. Investments in first-party content are most consequential when the platform scale is small and when it has greater urgency to attract more viewers. I show that revenue sharing is (only partly) a tug of war between the platform and creators because a moderate sharing formula strengthens the overall ecosystem and profits of all participants. However, revenue-sharing tensions indicate a need to extend the one-rate-for-all creators approach with richer revenue-sharing arrangements that can better accommodate heterogeneity among creators. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems. </jats:p>",

This study first assesses important conceptual considerations that explain the expansion of global value chains and the growth of trade interdependencies among nations. Next, an analytical case study observes (1) America's supply chain vulnerability through three major waves of infection, (2) the difficulty to mend weaknesses in the supply linkages once the novel coronavirus spread globally and (3) American government's failures to both anticipate and respond to supply shortages, especially in the health sector. Trump administration's policies failed to ensure a reliable supply of simple personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare professionals and hospitals throughout the first three waves of infection. Moreover, state and federal governments' substantial reliance on large manufacturers who have established procurement relationship with government led to continuous nationwide supply shortages throughout 2020. The federal government's inability to engage small and medium manufacturers in the production of critical supplies of PPE and diagnostic tests deepened and prolonged the devastating impacts of the pandemic. Our case study demonstrates that the American government needs to rethink the country's substantial reliance on the global supply chain, and the specific requirements to boost domestic manufacturing capacity. The revitalisation of America's manufacturing ability and the local supply networks will boost the productive power of the nation, strengthen resiliency, reduce vulnerability in disruptive times and prepare the nation for future crises.</jats:p>",

The term “digital supply chain” has arisen as a relatively new concept in the manufacturing and service sectors. Organizations planning to utilize the benefits of digitalization, especially in the supply chain area, have uncertainties on how to adapt digitalization, which criteria they will evaluate, what kind of strategies should be developed, and which should be given more importance. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches can be addressed to determine the best strategy under various criteria in digital transformation. Because of the need to capture this uncertainty, fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) have been preferred in the study to widen the definition domain of uncertainty parameters. Interval-valued fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) are one of the most often used fuzzy set extensions to cope with uncertainty. Therefore, a new interval-valued fermatean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IVFF-AHP) method has been developed. After determining the main criteria and sub-criteria, the IVFF-AHP method has been used for calculating the criteria weights and ranking the alternatives. By determining the most important strategy and criteria, the study provides a comprehensive framework of digital transformation in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although water is considered a human right, rural communities in many countries face challenges related to the lack of a safe water supply. In rural areas, where there is no access to public or private water supply, populations have no other choice than to rely on other unsafe sources of water. Community-managed water supply (CMWS) has emerged as an alternative to address the lack of access to safe water. Nonetheless, this alternative has several critical characteristics that harm the sustainability of water supplies. Studies on sustainability and the long-term impact of the CMWS were explored through a review of recent literature using Scopus and Web of Science databases, which analyzed 86 papers reporting on research into the sustainability and efficiency of water supply systems managed and operated by local communities, as well as the long-term critical factors that can interfere with the functionality of these systems. Based on the critical factors most cited in the literature, we proposed a framework of strategies that interrelate and integrate the critical factors into levels of responsibility. The most critical factors are related to the community level, such as inadequate capacity and ineffective systems. This demonstrates the relevance of local characteristics in the implementation of water management systems. The most cited sustainability strategies refer to the local level as the one requiring action to promote effective community involvement and post-construction support. The framework helps to conceptualize what we called an enabling environment for decision-making, and thus, the achievement of the long-term sustainability of water supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system requires an adequate hydrogen supply and circulation to achieve its expected performance and operating life. An ejector-based hydrogen circulation system can reduce the operating and maintenance costs, noise, and parasitic power consumption by eliminating the recirculation pump. However, the ejector’s hydrogen entrainment capability, restricted by its geometric parameters and flow control variability, can only operate properly within a relatively narrow range of fuel cell output power. This research introduced the optimal design and operation control methods of a dual-ejector hydrogen supply/circulation system to support the full range of PEMFC system operations. The technique was demonstrated on a 70 kW PEMFC stack with an effective hydrogen entrainment ratio covering 8% to 100% of its output power. The optimal geometry design ensured each ejector covered a specific output power range with maximized entrainment capability. Furthermore, the optimal control of hydrogen flow and the two ejectors’ opening and closing times minimized the anode gas pressure fluctuation and reduced the potential harm to the PEMFC’s operation life. The optimizations were based on dedicated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and system dynamics models and simulations. Bench tests of the resulting ejector-based hydrogen supply/circulation system verified the simulation and optimization results.</jats:p>"

At present, the main method to obtain this current is to increase the number of the capacitive pulsed power supply (PPS) modules. However, low utilization and massive volume of the railgun system would occur with this method, hampering the application of railgun. Therefore, the utilization optimization technology of PPS is researched in this paper. In order to obtain highly stable flat-top current, the control strategy of the capacitive PPS is designed, and a new charging voltage configuration is proposed, which significantly decreases the use of the capacitive modules. Besides, a miniaturization transformation scheme of capacitive PPS is proposed based on the control strategy. The result shows that the flat-top current ripple has the biggest influence on the PPS utilization, and the smaller the flat-top current ripple, the lower the utilization. When the current with 200 kA magnitude and 0.75% flat-top current ripple is achieved, an 81.9% decrease of volume and a 428.7% utilization improvement are achieved through miniaturization transformation.</jats:p>"

We used a dual (socio-ecological and economic) approach to sustainable energy development. The research was carried out using the methods of reduction reasoning, scientific observation, and examination of source documents. We identified crisis threats in the context of sustainable energy development. Then, we analyzed the supply of wood biomass in Poland, taking into account its geographical location. As a result, we identified and characterized the causal relationships between the assumptions of the concept of resistance and the sustainable development of energy with the use of wood biomass. We found that the concepts of resilience can be adapted to assessing energy sustainability. This adaptation is based on resilience, flexibility, and strategic ability to revitalize the country. We found that five key threats (extreme weather events, climate breakdown, pollution, infectious diseases, loss of biodiversity) affect both the energy-sustainability system and forest management, and the relationship is two-way. We show that the production of forest biomass is compatible with modern forest management and supports the implementation of sustainable energy development, which takes place under the concept of resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s competitive world, it is essential to provide a new method through which maximum efficiency can be created in the production and supply cycle. In many production environments, sending goods directly from the producer to the consumer brings many problems. Therefore, an efficient transport system should be established between producers and consumers. Such a system is designed in the field of supply chain management knowledge. Supply chain management is the evolutionary result of warehousing management and is one of the important infrastructural foundations of business implementation, in many of which the main effort is to shorten the time between the customer’s order and the actual delivery of the goods. In this research, the supply chain consists of three levels. Suppliers are placed on the first level, cross-docks on the second level, and factories on the third level. In this system, a number of suppliers send different raw materials to several different cross-docks. Each channel is assigned to a cross-dock for a specific product. The main goal of this article is to focus on optimizing the planning of incoming and outgoing trucks with the aim of minimizing the total operation time within the supply chain. The arrival rate of goods from suppliers to the cross-dock is stochastic with a general probability distribution. On the other hand, the time required to prepare and send the goods is random with a general probability distribution. The service time in each cross-dock depends on the number of its doors. Therefore, each cross-dock can be modeled as a G/G/m queueing system where m represents the number of doors. The mathematical model of the research has been developed based on these assumptions. Since the problem is NP-hard, the time to solve it increases drastically with the increase in the dimensions of the problem. Therefore, three metaheuristics, including multi-objective water flow, non-dominated sorting genetic, and a multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm have been used to find near-optimal solutions to the problem. After adjusting the parameters of the algorithms using the Taguchi method, the results obtained from the algorithms were analyzed with a statistical test and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated. The results vividly demonstrate that non-dominated sorting genetics is the best of all.</jats:p>"

Managers from 270 food and beverage production companies in Kenya were targeted as part of the study. A sample size of 146 comprising of supply chain, procurement, operations and finance managers was obtained using two-stage sampling design. Cluster random sampling was utilized in the first stage to find 73 food and beverage production companies. In the second stage, convenience sampling was employed to choose two participants from among the 73 firms that had been chosen. Research questionnaires were used to collect primary data. The drop-and-pick approach, along with emailing the questionnaires, were used to obtain data. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed by utilizing descriptive statistics in SPSS version 28. Inferential analysis was carried out, with a focus on correlation as well as regression analysis, and also hypothesis testing. Tables were used to display the findings.&#x0D;\nResults: Customer integration and competitive advantage of food and beverage manufacturing enterprises in Kenya had a positive significant association (R =.661, p =.000), according to the data. This meant that consumer integration boosted the competitiveness of Kenyan food and beverage manufacturers. Customer integration and competitive advantage of food and beverage manufacturing enterprises in Kenya were also shown to have a positive and statistically significant association (R =.661, R2 =.379), according to the study. As a result, customer integration accounted for 66.1 percent of the variation in food and beverage manufacturing enterprises' competitive advantage.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: While existing theory was validated, the study recommends that managers of food and beverages manufacturing firms should build procedures and policies that link to a superior understanding of the customer in order to meet their expectations. The study also recommends that the food and beverages industry regulators should devise policies that would allow food and beverage manufacturers to integrate with customers and thus help avoid losses that impact the efficiency of these businesses and eventually the economy as a whole. The study suggests that the government takes a more systematic approach to ensuring the growth and development of customer integration in Kenyan food and beverage manufacturing firms in order to maintain a competitive edge. Moreover, empirical research needs to be conducted to establish the effect of customer integration on the competitive advantage of other sub-sectors of manufacturing in the economy.</jats:p>"

While crisis management has focused on a few organizations involved in supply chain operations (manufacturers, governments, carriers, and the consuming public), it has primarily received a functional focus. Due to their decentralized network structure, supply chains are prone to suffer from disruptive events solved by supply chain crisis management. This chapter presents the blockchain technologies' possibilities and limits used in an integrated IoT-based information system architecture. The chapter describes how the scalability limits of blockchain technology affect the proposed architecture performance that uses it. Also, the chapter presents a review of the academic literature, pointing out how some solutions use a centralization process to improve response time and security of the blockchain-based architecture. Finally, the chapter provides security threat models, which consider by blockchain protocols in IoT networks.</jats:p>",

A structured literature review of articles in the 2010-2021 period, addressing geographic location, journals, publishers, authors, research designs, and applied theories, has been used to prepare this paper. The additional discussion of AI incorporates information from the structured review to conclude the findings and suggest future research directions. The authors have used the Scopus database and prestigious peer-reviewed journals to search for relevant papers using suitable keywords. This paper concluded that the Asian region has the highest concentration of publications and that AI adoption positively affects the IS-SCI relationship. Empirical quantitative research design and resource-based view theory are prominent among the reviewed publications.

Our analysis finds that GLR is an important reason for the overall inelasticity of housing supply in 272 Chinese cities, which reduces housing supply elasticity from 1.457 (elastic) to 0.872 (inelastic). Housing supply elasticity caused by GLR has declined the most in first‐tier cities and the eastern regions. The marginal effect of land use regulation is greater than that of land allocation and supply regulations. The initial development level and natural geographic constraint of each city also matter in China's housing supply market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: In practice, trade credit (TC) is often offered in a contract that stipulates a single, fixed interest, rather than an interest menu contingent on the loan amount. We examine why a supplier uses such a single-interest contract and why a buyer who can access perfect external capital (EC) with contingent interest may use TC, when the supplier does not share the buyer’s demand risk. Methodology/results: We solve a dynamic game between a supplier and two buyers, who have access to EC and compete in a Cournot game in the product market. We show that the single-interest contract incentivizes a buyer to order more. Thus, such a contract benefits the supplier and makes TC a strategic device for buyers to commit to competing aggressively. Opposite to well-known results, we show that buyers may benefit from using strategic TC, because their access to EC gives them strong pricing power that yields sufficiently low wholesale price. The entire supply chain also benefits because the over-ordering distortion under TC mitigates the under-ordering problem caused by double marginalization. Managerial implications: Our analysis implies that, to weaken buyers’ pricing power and improve profit, the supplier should offer cheap TC—for example, in net terms to—financially resourceful buyers and expensive TC—for example, with early payment discount—to financially constrained buyers, as observed in practice. We find strategic TC to yield increasingly more benefit for the supplier as its production cost decreases and may allow the buyer to maximize its payoff at an intermediate consumers’ willingness-to-pay that leads to strong pricing power and low wholesale price. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, organized retailing has witnessed a newer trend in the upcoming generations. Globally, these changes are attributed to growing family income, increased female participation, the transformation from joint to nuclear family structure, and technological advancements. Moreover, other variables such as lower supply chain costs, growing sales, rising consumer demands, changing market structure, and increasing competition also influenced supply chain networks. It is observed that the organizational nonlivestock supply chain performance is affected by strategic, operational, and environmental aspects. AI is helping to deliver powerful optimization capabilities, which are required for more accurate capacity planning, improved productivity, high quality, lower costs, and greater output, all while fostering safer working conditions. These benefits are all made possible thanks to the introduction of AI in supply chains. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the relevant previous research, the purpose of this work is to determine the specific contributions that artificial intelligence (AI) has made to supply chain management. This research attempted to discover the present as well as possible AI strategies that may increase both the study of Supply Chain Management as well as the practice of it. This was done in order to solve the current scientific gap of AI in Supply Chain Management. It was also found that there are holes in the existing study that need to be filled by more scientific investigation. To be more exact, the following four facets were discussed: (1) the AI approaches that are most often used in Supply Chain Management; (2) the AI techniques that have the potential to be used in Supply Chain Management; (3) the Supply Chain Management subfields that have benefited from the application of AI so far; and (4) the subfields that have a high potential to be improved by AI. Identifying and evaluating articles from the four supply chain management domains of logistics, marketing, supply chain management, and manufacturing require the use of a predetermined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this study, insights are provided via the use of methodical analysis and synthesis. A better understanding of these parameters not only improves the nonlivestock supply chain processes but also ensures competitive advantage. The present research aims to test the following elements that including supply chain speed, customer retention, supply chain management integration, and various management. The proposed work categorizes the performance of the supply chain using the Improved Feed Forward Network with Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Results indicate that inventory management, customer happiness, profitability, and client base identification are listed as competitive advantage elements. On the other hand, stakeholder satisfaction, innovation and learning, market performance, customer satisfaction, and financial success are the six recognized organizational performance criteria. Resultantly, the overall performance metrics of the proposed work is 94.12%, while accuracy rate, specificity, and sensitivity rate are found to be 94.12%, 92.15%, and 89.14%, respectively. The research can be helpful for industrial managers to optimize the performance of supply chain systems using artificial intelligence.</jats:p>",

Based on the findings of studies from the academic literature, the results are quite mixed. Though the number of SFSC-related empirical studies has risen in recent years, there is a lack of SFSC-related data, even in the European Union (EU), where a sustainable agriculture and food system must play a crucial role in the implementation of the Green Deal. Overall, it is hard to name those features that, without any doubt, affect the willingness of consumers to purchase from an SFSC. The studies mostly remarked on age and education; however, even these findings cannot be generalized. Therefore, some consumers of non-global food supply chains could be characterized very well, but these observations could differ in diverse cases because of local factors.</jats:p>"

Accurately estimating the energy over any hydraulic system using traditional empirical formulas is tedious and challenging. Consequently, employing new and precise techniques still in high demand is crucial. In this study, the authors developed an empirical model for estimating the residual energy downstream of the type-A piano key weir (PKW) using gene expression programming (GEP) by considering six non-dimensional parameters: headwater ratio, magnification ratio, inlet to outlet width ratio, inlet to outlet key bottom slopes, inlet to outlet overhang portions and the number of cycles. The performance of the proposed models has been compared to empirical equations using the statistical factors coefficient of determination (R2), concordance coefficient (CC), and root mean square error (RMSE). The computed relative residual energy values using the proposed models are within ±10% of the observed ones. The proposed GEP model predicted the relative residual energy satisfactorily, with coefficients of determination of R2 = 0.978 for training, 0.980 for testing and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.032 and 0.029 for the training and testing datasets, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work is a unique integration of three different areas, including smart eye status monitoring, supply chain operations reference (SCOR), and system dynamics, to explore the dynamics of the supply chain network of smart eye/vision monitoring systems. Chronic eye diseases such as glaucoma affect millions of individuals worldwide and, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible vision loss. Nearly half of the affected population is unaware of the condition and can be informed with frequent, accessible eye/vision tests. Tonometry is the conventional clinical method used in healthcare settings to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP) level for evaluating the risk of glaucoma. There are currently very few (under development) non-contact and non-invasive methods using smartphones to determine the risk of IOP and/or the existence of other eye-related diseases conveniently at home. With the overall goal of improving health, well-being, and sustainability, this paper proposes Eye-SCOR: a supply chain operations reference (SCOR)-based framework to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone-based eye status monitoring apps. The proposed framework is designed using system dynamics modeling as a subset of a new causal model. The model includes interaction/activities between the main players and enablers in the supply chain network, namely suppliers/service providers, smartphone app/device factors, customers, and healthcare professionals, as well as cash and information flow. The model has been tested under various scenarios and settings. Simulation results reveal the dynamics of the model and show that improving the eye status monitoring device/app factors directly increases the efficiency/Eye-SCOR level. The proposed framework serves as an important step towards understanding and improving the overall performance of the supply chain network of smart eye/vision monitoring systems.</jats:p>"

Modern energy supply systems based on renewable energy sources have non-linear systems with complex transients and possible critical and chaotic regimes. The study of structures of hypernumerical systems, their features, methods of calculation and approximation of the elementary functions of a hypercomplex variable allows to effectively apply such systems in mathematical modelling of invariant power supply systems based on renewable energy sources. In some cases, the use of hypernumerical systems makes it possible to replace the original problem with an equivalent one, that is to build a bicomplex solution model.&#x0D;\nThe system of complex numbers was considered as the initial system. With recurrent doubling of the system, hypernumerical systems of different dimensions with different properties were obtained, which made it possible to assign different values to the products of imaginary units. It is proved that the introduction of additional conditions of commutativity and associativity, which apply to real numbers and imaginary units, allows to specify the choice of a hypernumerical system.&#x0D;\nIn the analysis of nonstationary processes of invariant systems and the study of the possibilities of hypernumerical systems, the expediency of choosing a bicomplex calculation method in mathematical modelling of systems with multiple modulation is substantiated. The method of bicomplex representation involves direct and inverse bicomplex transformation, which allows obtaining an analytically complete solution for the analysis of an invariant power supply system based on renewable energy sources. Examples of the use of bicomplex integral transformation for the analysis of systems with multiple modulation are considered. The application of the hypercomplex calculus apparatus for the transformation of systems of differential equations is proposed to simplify or compress them into one equation. It is shown that the use of hypercomplex calculus allows to significantly reduce the amount of processed information without reducing the informativeness of the mathematical model.&#x0D;\nThe proposed formulation of tasks in a hypercomplex view allowed to compress the processing information and obtain a compact vortex for the output signal.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: This paper aims to critically examine the potential barriers to the implementation and adoption of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the beef supply chain. The beef supply chain has been challenging due to its complex processes, activities, and management. The beef industry has relied heavily on the human workforce in the past; however, RPA adoption allows automating tasks that are repetitive and strenuous in nature to enhance beef quality, safety and security. There are considerable potential barriers to RPA adoption as organisations have not focused on trying to eliminate them due to various reasons. Previous studies lack knowledge related to potential barriers to RPA adoption, so this creates a research gap and requires attention. Methods: Statistical data and information are extracted using secondary data relevant to RPA adoption in the beef supply chain. A business process model is formed which uses values or variables using existing statistical data and information. Simulation of the process model is carried out using Simul8 software and analyses of different scenarios help in choosing the best approach for RPA adoption. Results: The results have identified the potential barriers in RPA adoption through the simulation process thus ensuring RPA performs with more potential. Analysis of ‘what-if’ scenarios allow organisational and employee-level improvements along with enhancing RPA’s accuracy. Conclusion: The process model is a generic model for use in real-life scenarios and can be modified by organisations according to their own business needs and requirements. The study contributes in theoretical and practical aspects as it allows decision-makers to adopt RPA in a robust manner and adds to scientific knowledge by identification of potential barriers to RPA adoption.</jats:p>"

This work studies smart agricultural greenhouses' adaptive control and supply chain management based on the intelligent fuzzy auxiliary cognitive system (IFACS). This work firstly expresses the intelligent fuzzy control theory and analyses data according to the fuzzy control set. Secondly, the adaptive control and supply chain management of the intelligent agricultural greenhouse are studied by using an intelligent fuzzy aided cognitive system. Finally, the light intensity and carbon dioxide content of the intelligent agricultural greenhouse are analysed; the temperature and humidity content of the intelligent agricultural greenhouse of the traditional control method and adaptive control are compared; the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on the environment under supply chain management is analysed. The research results indicate that the adaptive control of the intelligent agricultural greenhouse based on the IFACS can keep the greenhouse temperature within a specific range and reduce the impact of temperature on the development of agricultural greenhouses. The IFACS is effectively managed in the adaptive control of the intelligent agricultural greenhouse. From 2015 to 2020, the smart agricultural greenhouse supply chain management gradually reduced the content of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted by the production and suppliers through the IFACS. The content of greenhouse gases emitted by product transporters did not change significantly, and the greenhouse gases emitted by non‐manufacturing suppliers gradually decreased. In 2020, supply chain GHG emission intensity decreased by 20% compared with 2015, and GHG emissions from product transportation also decreased by 6% compared with the previous year. This research has reference significance for the adaptive control of intelligent agricultural greenhouse by IFACS and the environmental control of agricultural greenhouse by supply chain management.</jats:p>",

As critical infrastructure sectors become more interdependent, a method is needed to assess how disruptions to one sector affect other sectors. This need is particularly significant in the case of critical national supply chains which have not received the same attention as other critical infrastructure systems. This research develops a methodology for performing supply chain impact assessments by integrating model‐based systems engineering (MBSE) with discrete event simulation (DES). SysML models capture the supply chain structure and critical infrastructure interdependencies. Simulation of the supply chain model subjected to external constraints identifies the impacts from critical infrastructure disruptions. This approach enables researchers and public policy planners to assess critical supply chain risks associated with current infrastructure implementations, and to conduct what‐if analyses on alternative solutions. Application of this methodology to assess the natural disaster impacts on an urban food supply system demonstrates the effectiveness of modeling and simulation for evaluating the impacts of critical infrastructure disruptions on a wide range of critical supply chains. Future research should apply this methodology to different national supply chains and investigate additional critical infrastructure interdependency linkage mechanisms.</jats:p>",

In creating a halal product, it will undergo a process from raw materials to ready-to-consume products. There are eleven criteria for the Halal Assurance System in Indonesia, which become the guidelines for conducting halal product audits. One of them is the traceability aspect. It is the critical point in conducting studies on the halal supply chain. The research aims to explain the implementation of supply chain management in restaurants or stalls in Yogyakarta with halal certification from Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI/ Indonesian Ulema Council). It also analyses halal principles in supply chain management on processed meat products among restaurants or stalls in Yogyakarta. Also, it aims to identify problems among entrepreneurs of processed meat products in implementing halal supply chain management. The researchers implemented qualitative research with a descriptive analysis approach. The data were obtained from interviews and observations with entrepreneurs, slaughterhouse owners, and BPJPH. The researchers also conducted Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with the management of LPPOM MUI DIY. The second approaches are the data triangulation methods. Respondents were selected with the purposive sampling method. The data obtained were then analyzed with Atlas.ti software application. The results indicate that the entrepreneurs who have been halal certificated are highly likely apply halal principles in their business lines.

This paper uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to design an electrostatic precipitator power controller. In this paper, a fuzzy control scheme with variable scale factors is adopted to make the highest average voltage between the two poles of the precipitator better approach the critical breakdown voltage. In this paper, the transfer function is derived based on the finite element differential equation and the method of three-dimensional drawing. In this way, the influence of parameters such as the coupling inductance of the pulse power supply, the coupling coefficient, and the parasitic resistance of the dust removal chamber on the load oscillation can be obtained. It is found that the control system can control the electrostatic precipitator power well. It can significantly improve dust removal efficiency.</jats:p>",

As the numerical experiments followed the fractional factorial designs, from the factor analysis, it is suggested that a new car-sharing business first study the external business environment. Even if the external environment is sound, the company still needs to pay attention to internal operations management.

The approach presented is based on an assumption of similarity in demand behavior between different DMAs. It requires no other data than net inflow timeseries for the DMAs or supply areas under consideration, and no assumptions other than that of similarity of demand. As such, it provides a low-data-requirements method for the evaluation of background and unreported leakage that does not share underlying assumptions with the commonly used mininum night flow method and may potentially present a supplement or alternative to it.

According to the results of the calculation of hydrological indicators, in terms of 15, the index, a significant difference is seen among upstream and downstream stations. Therefore, it can be found that the presence of the Givi Dam has created a good platform for intensifying the hydrological and morphological changes of the river plan. The particular strength of the river in all parts of the fourth interval and the ninth, 12th, eighth (second interval) levels causes the erosion threshold to soar. The highest amount of shear stress was observed in the second interval at 12, 13, and 9, respectively. Generally, the changes of the Givi River Plan include expansion of existing meanders, displacement of paths, increase of curvature and formation of small meanders and formation of channel pattern and dynamics, affected by discharge provision, sediment discharge due to dam construction, lithological resistance of the riverbed and human interference.</jats:p>",

NGOs and legislators made efforts to require manufacturers that use “conflict minerals” to learn and disclose their sources. In the mineral supply chain, the critical link between mines and manufacturers is smelters. We study equilibrium sourcing decisions in the supply network consisting of manufacturers and smelters. We show the equilibrium depends on the total demand of “compliance‐prone” manufacturers, which would choose to be compliant if the prices of certified and noncertified metals were equal. We identify the conditions for the existence of several types of equilibrium: an all‐certified equilibrium where all smelters become certified; an equilibrium where both metal types coexist with no shortage of certified metal; and an equilibrium where both metal types coexist with a shortage of certified metal. In the event that an all‐certified equilibrium is out of reach, we identify how the usage of conflict minerals changes as an NGO or a legislative body targets additional manufacturers. Our model does not incorporate deliberate choices by the mines to become verified conflict‐free, that may enhance the effect of the penalties in the long run. However, in the short‐to‐intermediate run, for a given pool of mines that are verified, an implication of our results is that imposing penalties on manufacturers goes only so far: If penalties induce sufficiently many manufacturers to become compliance‐prone, certified metal may become so expensive that some compliance‐prone manufacturers will not comply.</jats:p>",

For this theoretical study was considered published work. The most interesting contents reviewed where from the 2000’s on. A research was made having into account scientific papers from journals as this is still a theme that hasn’t been much studied. A review of the sales methodology of several brands/suppliers working on the supply chain was also made to contextualize sourcing possibilities. This paper will be divided in three parts. First it will be made a literature review to understand how supply chains work, secondly about co-creation and third will be made a contextualization about practices in other concepts and suppliers. This theoretical research made the author raise a series of concerns and possibilities that could make this study being developed empirically, in the future to access the manufacturers’ opinion over the best practices that can be applied. This study could be a plus for future investigators in the fashion field as well as brands and fashion designers, to understand how co-creation can simplify its relationship with its supply chain. As for the limitations there was no opportunity for an empirical study to be made with the focus on manufacturers, although this could be important for the future. Also, it would be interesting to better understand the positive and negative impacts of the co-creation development and implementation in fashion, namely on the supply chain and manufacturing industries of fashion products as this has been barely studied.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, due to the growth and development of financing tools and methods, financial institutions are always looking for new, efficient, and low-cost methods. In carrying out their daily production operations, companies are faced with different and diverse financial input and output flows from purchasing orders and inventory to receiving the price of sold goods, which are not the same in terms of time. Therefore, they will inevitably look for the financing of these processes, which is referred to as working capital financing. However, in the conditions of recession and lack of bank loans and considering the problems caused by the unilateral management of this issue, there is a need for innovative financial tools such as supply chain financing (SCF). In recent years, with the introduction and evolution of blockchain technology, this opportunity has also arisen in financial fields to make the most of this new technology. Considering the growth of this technology and the importance of supply chain financing, in this research, it was first tried to fully investigate the dimensions and key components of blockchain-based supply chain financing. chain stores were considered as a case study and the importance of supply chain financing was analyzed in them and the SCF framework was presented in these applied enterprises. In addition, the most important key performance indicators in a blockchain-based supply chain financing system are identified and evaluated with an emphasis on chain store processes. To evaluate the data, a non-linear hierarchical analysis method was used. The results show that transferring and reducing risks in different types is one of the most important performance indicators of the blockchain-based supply chain financing system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the mid-2010s, the circular economy has emerged as a key conceptual lever in corporate efforts to achieve greater environmental sustainability. Corporations have increasingly drawn upon the circular economy perspective in efforts to rethink sustainable supply chain management practices. This new corporate approach to sustainable supply chain management is evident in an emerging literature that has yet to be fully documented. In this systematic review of research, bibliometric methods were applied to a database of 709 Scopus-indexed documents. Author co-citation analysis identified four schools of thought comprising the intellectual structure of this literature: Sustainable Production and Environmental Management, Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Reverse Supply Chain Management, and Circular Economy. Synthesis of these themes suggests that the adoption of a circular economy perspective is transforming sustainable supply chain management in two important ways. First, this perspective reorients supply chain management away from a narrow focus on efficiency and waste reduction and towards a new paradigm of redesign, reuse, and product transformation. Second, adoption of the circular economy highlights and leverages reverse cycles in the supply chain. Thus, circular economy business models enable supply chain management to enhance corporate contributions to sustainable production and consumption. Drawing upon this framing of supply chain management within a circular economy, the review proposes a new framework for accelerating corporate sustainability.</jats:p>"

This paper examines the differences in effectiveness and sustainability in clean drinking water supply (DWS) systems in rural areas of the country that are either provided by the government or by local and international Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). I argue that drinking water supply projects that are conducted using an individualized community-led methodology by international and local NGOs working in partnership are more effective and sustainable than generalized methodologies often employed by the government, and positively contribute to other areas of development including gender equality. To do this, I look specifically at the approaches taken by the NGOs Nepal Water for Health (NEWAH) and Engineers Without Borders (EWB) in providing drinking water supply systems to rural communities in Nepal. Critically examining the outcomes of the differing methodologies that are employed to provide access to clean drinking water in this context is important in facilitating the achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal of safe and affordable drinking water for all.</jats:p>"

Prediction of the five Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components and one residual from the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) decomposition used different models of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Except for the small errors in the first two components, the rest of the ARIMA models are highly fitted. For prediction of runoff in 2014 and 2015 based on EEMD-ARIMA model, the relative errors are 6.26% and −1.17%. Compared with the single ARIMA model and Back Propagation (BP) model, the prediction effect is better, and the prediction method is simple and clear.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the importance of SSs and their related technologies in improving business performance. Through an initial systematic review of sixty-one papers, the authors identify six key determinants that lead to the effective application of SSs in business systems, namely, the application of effective managerial skills, supply chain integration, financial analysis, business performance, strategic and operational capabilities, and technologies. The work then goes on to develop an industry case study that informs thinking on the capabilities of smart technologies in collaborative working environments and then onto the development of a practice-focused framework for future research. This study identifies that the implementation of SSs within organisations not only improves business performance but also their supply chains through the effective integration of business activities and systems, and through the degree to which communication and decision-making is facilitated between humans and devices. This leads to the improvement of quality, speed of information, and information sharing. This study also finds that there is a lack of systems standards that currently govern IoT and SSs integration and data security within businesses.</jats:p>"

As competition becomes stiff, firms must be more involved in how their suppliers and customers conduct their businesses. To succeed in today’s challenging business environment, firms must be able to effectively integrate the internal function within a company and effectively link them with the external operations of supply chain members. Due attention should be given by firms to supply chain management practices as it has significant influence in enhancing SCM functions and ultimately performances. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the practices and effect of supply-chain management on firms’ competitive advantage; and to look at the effect of inventory management on firms’ performance. Moreover, the study attempted to identify major challenges of supply-chain management in selected manufacturing firms in Ethiopia. To attain the objectives quantitative approach was employed. Moreover, a descriptive inquiry along with causal research design was used. Primary data were obtained from survey questionnaires. Large manufacturing firms; 2 textiles and 2 sugars were selected as samples using purposive sampling technique. In addition, 4 officials from each of the eight departments’ viz., General Managers, Purchasing managers, Technical managers, Operation managers, Quality managers, Transport managers, Sales and IT managers were selected from the four firms included in the study. Hence, a total of 128 respondents from each of the three studies were judgmentally selected. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 version using descriptive statistics, Correlation analysis and multiple regressions analysis. Accordingly, based on the regression result it is revealed that the supply chain dimensions included in the study viz., customer relationship management, customer service management, level of information sharing, demand management process, environmental issues,  and supplier relationship management were positively and significantly affect firms competitive advantage.  Finally, it is suggested that manufacturing firms should create close relationship with customers to differentiate their products from competitors. Moreover, manufacturing firms are recommended to apply information technology like electronic data interchange within and among the supply chain umbrellas as a whole.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Frequencies, percentages, mean, and standard deviation; simple and multiple linear regression and Pearson Correlation Coefficient models were applied on the quantitative data while narrative analysis was applied on the qualitative data. The total respondents who agreed and strongly agreed that the water supply in Nyamira South Sub-County was: long enough were 22.7 per cent; adequate for the needs of the people were 22.5 per cent; of good quality were 31.2 per cent; safe for drinking were 32.1 per cent. Those who agreed that funds generated from the water supply were adequate were 15.4 per cent; and that the water was affordable were 22.1 per cent. The qualitative findings suggested that the water supply was not sustainable. Based on the composite mean and standard deviation of 2.47 and 1.01 respectively, the study suggested that the M&amp;amp;E work plan for Nyamira South Sub-County water supply existed and was available. However, the work plan was not in use, was not regularly reviewed nor updated. The study&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis of no significant relationship between M&amp;amp;E work plan and sustainable water supply in Nyamira South Sub-County, Kenya was rejected since P=0.000&amp;lt;0.05. Strengthening the use of M&amp;amp;E work plan in project implementation was recommended.</jats:p>"

In this research, using the for an annual 24-hour maximum rainfall data set of 45 synoptic stations throughout the country, the PMP values were calculated through the original Hershfield method and then the Hershfield-Desa method. By comparing the obtained results of 24-hour PMP estimation through the two mentioned methods, it is found that the estimation of PMP values in the original/first Hershfield method is well higher than the expected value (2.54 to 4.03). While in the modified method (Desa method), PMP values are significantly reduced and seem more reasonable (1.02 to 1.3). Meanwhile, the calculated variability and skewness coefficients also indicated more variability of PMP values in the southern stations of the country compared to rainy regions, which makes the estimation of PMP in the southern regions of the country considerably unreliable.</jats:p>",

However, quantification of sediment availability and its variability in time is challenging, because sediment supply is often strongly stochastic and dominated by mass wasting. In this paper, we introduce a variable landslide sediment supply as a function of topography, hydrology, and hillslope activity in the hydrology‐sediment model TOPKAPI‐ETH. We use the model to analyze the dynamics of sediment storage in a mesoscale pre‐Alpine basin. We simulate a range of transport‐ and supply‐limited conditions to quantify the variability of suspended sediment concentrations and load, and the seasonal dynamics of sediment storage. We show that supply limitation dampens the natural variability of the hydrological and sediment transport processes, and therefore reduces the scatter of the suspended sediment rating curve. By comparing the model results with observations, we demonstrate that alternation of low and high sediment availability favors sediment load variability at the outlet. The temporal dynamics of sediment storage depends on the hillslope activity, and the balance between sediment supply by landslides and evacuation by runoff. When the export flux is comparable or greater than the recharge flux, the storage shows seasonal fluctuations with a maximum in late winter or spring, and sediment starvation in summer. By representing the dynamics of both inputs and outputs of the sediment storage, the proposed model provides a physically based tool to isolate the effect of transport‐ and supply‐limited conditions in basin sediment response.</jats:p>",

The study looked into both the demand and supply sides, as well as the spatial and temporal variations between supply and demand, from the perspective of a city region. To investigate the mismatch between demand and supply both quantitative and qualitative sources of data were employed. Landsat data, expert knowledge, document review, and qualitative data including key informant interview was utilized. The land-use patterns analyses show that ecosystem services flow in the city surroundings are higher than those within Mekelle city’s administrative boundary. Land use/land cover dynamics were the main drivers of ecosystem services supply decline in the Mekelle city region. Those changes negatively affected the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the growing urban and rural populations. This supply of bundles of ecosystem services did not match the demands of the society which endangered the sustainable utilization of natural capital. The results disclose land-use patterns over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide sustainable ecosystem services supply are declining. On the contrary, demands for these services are increasing due to the growth of the population and economic activities. The study can support spatial planners in addressing the sustainable use of watershed ecosystem services.\n \n </jats:p>"

This study identifies sub-basins with high flood potential in the baseline period (1982–2005) and the future period (2025–2048) in the Hablehroud basin, north-central Iran. It uses the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and 23 coupled model intercomparison project 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). It estimates the instantaneous peak flow (IPF) and uses a flood index (FI) to determine the contributions of each sub-basin to the floods. The rainfall of the basin will increase by 11.5% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 12.6% under RCP 8.5. The minimum daily temperature (Tmin) of the basin will increase by 0.8 °C under RCP 4.5 and 1.1 °C under RCP 8.5 in the future period. In addition, the maximum daily temperature (Tmax) will rise by 1 °C under RCP 4.5 and 1.2 °C under RCP 8.5. Moreover, basin runoff will increase by 6.4% under RCP 4.5 and 11.6% under RCP 8.5.

Approaches for reconstructing tectonic and climatic histories from alluvial architecture generally assume that floodplain preservation is primarily a function of channel mobility relative to long-term sediment-accumulation rate; however, the amount of mud supplied to a river network can significantly impact the baseline accumulation of fine-grained deposits in alluvial basins. Here we evaluate preserved fine-sediment volume fractions at the bedform, reach, and outcrop scale across the transition from the mudstone-dominated Blackhawk Formation to the sandstone-dominated Lower Castlegate Sandstone (Upper Cretaceous, Utah, USA). Results show a nearly 50% decrease in mud abundance across the Blackhawk-Castlegate transition at a range of morphodynamic scales (mud percent in bed material: 28.4% to 14.1%, interbar fine deposits: 39.6% to 22.1%, and outcrop architecture: 58% to 16%). This decrease in fine-grained sediment coincides with an abrupt increase in quartz abundance from Blackhawk to Castlegate sands, suggesting that unroofing quartz-rich source rock caused significant regional changes in the alluvial deposits. This result shows that changes in sediment supply grain size are detectable from bed to landscape scales and can cause major changes in stratigraphic architecture. This method of comparing sand-to-mud ratios can be broadly applied in other fluvial successions and in source-to-sink transects to better reconstruct mud fluxes through ancient fluvial networks and to investigate how rivers respond to changes in fine-sediment availability.</jats:p>"

This paper presents new ideas for the sustainable development of the coal supply chain. To significantly improve the systematic and scientific evaluation of the sustainable development of China’s coal supply chain under the background of “dual circulation”, a sustainability evaluation index system for the coal supply chain is proposed, which contains five dimensions. Furthermore, an evaluation model is built based on multi-granularity unbalanced decision-making and TOPSIS theory. On this basis, an empirical study was carried out using a coal supply chain in China as an example, and scientific and effective development countermeasures are presented, which effectively promote new development and build unique competitive advantages for the energy industry.</jats:p>"

However, the existing literature does not provide sufficient quantitative assessment of labor problems for corporate decision-making. This study fills this research gap by conducting a social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of the T-shirt supply chain from a consumer perspective to quantify labor issues in monetary terms. The framework consists of two approaches: (1) calculation of willingness to pay (WTP) to solve labor problems and (2) inventory analysis. To calculate the WTP, questionnaires were distributed to 203 respondents. The WTP ranged from 344 JPY (labor rights) to 596 JPY (child labor). The WTP was used as an indicator of integration of labor problems. In inventory analysis, working hours were used to quantify the impact on workers. The results showed that working hours were long in the textile and wearing apparel stages. In conclusion, T-shirts manufactured in Vietnam were identified as the least worker-friendly T-shirts sold in Japan, with a social cost of 2,835 JPY. In supply chain stages, child labor was identified as a major problem in India at the textile stage and in Vietnam, at the wearing apparel stage. This study quantifies labor risks through a cost–benefit analysis, thereby contributing to the development of supply chain strategies for companies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain is a seamless network of activities and stakeholders involved in any business. It ensures a smooth flow of goods, products and services. In the modern global setting, supply chains have become more complex and inclusion of technology is providing great benefits. Robust technology is needed for identification, tracking and monitoring of the various goods and assets during the supply chain. One such emerging technology for this is RFID sensors. RFID is a popular wireless technology capable of collecting, storing and transmitting data and thus identifying, tracking and communicating. The two main components of RFID systems are tags and readers each of which perform a crucial and specific function. Tags are basically the memory, storing data received by the reader. Readers retrieve the data and transmit it to tags using an antenna. RFID technology has greatly replaced its counterpart and competitive technology- barcodes, in supply chains. It provides various benefits as compared to barcodes due to which it has got increased attention in various fields such as supply chains, healthcare, agriculture, food industry, manufacturing, libraries, security etc. Supply chain management deals with the flow of activities or processes included in any business, production activities. During this entire journey from raw material procurement to final dispatch a number of smaller supply chains are included each of which are critical. RFID technology has been largely deployed in supply chain management in order to identify, track and store information. These RFID systems enable real time monitoring of the supply chain and gives an upper-hand as compared to barcodes. RFID systems are not only used for storing and retrieving product data but also to monitor and track the flow of the entire supply chain. In the case of cold chains, RFID systems are used for maintaining the environment needed for ensuring quality of food products. Various such applications of these sensors in supply chains have been identified and deployed, However, still this technology remains to be dormant to some extent in supply chain industry. This review paper is aimed at doing a thorough literature review of RFID technology, its deployment in the supply chain domain, and challenges faced.</jats:p>",

Even though, two research questions should be verified priority: How do manufacturers make good use of pull production and employee involvement under lean practices that can strengthen supplier management robustness and enhance the prevention ability of resilience? Why does the combination of lean practices with an audit mechanism strengthen the produce synergy to prevent and control opportunistic behaviour by suppliers? PLS and the Sobel test were applied to survey data from 231 Chinese manufacturers to test and verify research questions. Pull production and employee involvement can enhance responsible purchasing, emergency-response, manufacturing process coupling, and further strengthen supplier management robustness, further enhance the prevention ability of resilience in dealing with opportunistic behaviour. In addition, enhancing manufacturing process coupling has the indirect effect of strengthening emergency-response ability. The audit mechanism can control the dysfunctional behaviour of the supplier, further guiding cooperation with the practice of pull production and employee involvement; in addition, audits also trigger the supplier’s trade-off mindset in terms of risk and profit maintenance.</jats:p>"

We apply panel data methodology and, in distinction to previous research, consider the development of the housing market (urban growth) as physical volume. The results demonstrate that structural changes are driven mainly by fundamental demand factors and that the displacement effect occurs primarily in the market’s rental sector and not in the owner-occupied segment. The apartment price per square meter, together with mortgage interest rates, are the major driving factors in the process of converting dwellings into housing cooperatives. Fundamental variables that affect new construction in both the rental and housing cooperative sectors are population and income growth. In the presence of a rent control environment, the rent or price level does not contribute to adding new units to the total housing stock.</jats:p>"

After a comprehensive evaluation of enterprises, suppliers, and transporters, we propose a reasonable ordering, supply, and transshipment decision scheme. Specifically, we first use principal component analysis to screen out several important suppliers. Second, we screen out 26 stable suppliers based on the regularity of supply using LSTM and ARIMA models, respectively, and then based on the transportation cost and loss cost minimization objectives, further refine the ordering and forwarding scheme. Finally, we realign our ordering and forwarding schemes according to the transportation cost and warehousing cost minimization objectives. The experimental evaluation structure shows that our model yields the most economical ordering and shipping scheme each week. Moreover, after replacing the objective function, our model can still improve the single-week capacity by 0.79% as well, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization ability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many localities with limitations on the availability of water, Water Distribution Networks (WDNs)  supply water only for a few hours in a day. In such networks, inefficient operational policies can lead to inequitable supply of water. This work proposes a data-driven approach for scheduling the supply side of WDNs for equitable distribution of available water. We formulate and solve a scheduling problem that makes use of flow measurements from the real network rather than a hydraulic model of the WDN. This helps reduce the effort required for model development and the errors arising out of it. Further, to avoid making excessive measurements on the network, we propose a heuristic for choosing measurements that are informative. In each step of this iterative procedure, a schedule is prepared using  the available measurements and based on this, a new system state that has to be measured is identified. The iteration is completed when the measurements are made, and the database is updated. We demonstrate the advantages of this technique through simulations of a real WDN and also experiments performed on a lab-scale network.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the current tea supply chain and analyze the logistics cost based on the activity-based costing (ABC) method in the smallholder and middleman tier to foster the sustainability of tea agribusiness. It was conducted in three main areas in Central Java Province, Indonesia, namely Batang, Pekalongan, and Banjarnegara regency. The method used was an in-depth interview and a semi-structured questionnaire to gain holistic information from 181 respondents. The results showed that material handling activity and transportation have the highest portion of the smallholder’s and middleman logistics costs, respectively. The total logistics cost of smallholders varied from case to case, ranging from IDR 821.7 to IDR 1,075.0 per kg of fresh tea leaves. Transportation activity and administration costs make up 30.8% of the total smallholder’s logistics cost. Meanwhile, the current development of the global tea market promotes policy adaptation on the commercial plantation tier and increases the cost of labor for plucking activity up to 2.5 times. Additionally, this study discovered the profit range of smallholders and middlemen. Therefore, the collaborative work of all parties is necessary to succeed in sustainable tea agribusiness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban mobility is one of the main issues in the pursuit of sustainability. The United Nations 2030 Agenda assigns mobility and transport central roles in sustainable development and its components: economic, social, and environment. In this context, the emerging concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offers an alternative to unsustainable mobility, often based on private car use. From the point of view of sustainable mobility, the MaaS paradigm implies greater insights into the transport system and its components (supply, demand, and reciprocal interactions). This paper proposes an approach to the transport system aimed at overcoming the current barriers to the implementation of the paradigm. The focus is on the implications for the transport supply subsystem. The investigation method is based on the analysis of the main components of such subsystem (governance, immaterial, material, equipment) and its role in the entire transport system. Starting with the first experiences of Finnish cities, the paper investigates some real case studies, which are experimenting with MaaS, to find common and uncommon elements. From the analyses, it emerges that the scientific literature and real experiences mainly focus on the immaterial components alone. To address the challenges related to sustainable mobility, this paper underlines the need to consider all components within a transport system approach. The findings of the paper are useful in several contexts. In the context of research, the paper offers an analysis of the transport supply system from the point of view of the MaaS paradigm. In the real context, the paper offers further useful insights for operators and decision-makers who intend to increase the knowledge and skills necessary to face challenges related to the introduction of MaaS.</jats:p>"

Water quality data prediction has an important significance, as it provides data support for the effective estimation of water quality, and is also an indirect way to protect water resources and the environment. At present there are a variety of water quality prediction methods, but these methods still have some shortcomings. In this paper, the main water quality pollution indicators such as the dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (P) data were the object of study to build a water quality prediction model. The water quality prediction index contains numerous nonlinear correlation characteristics that results in low training efficiency on a large-scale data. Therefore, a combined water quality prediction model based on integrated ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and cascade support vector machine (Cascade SVM) is proposed. First, the EEMD method is used to highlight the real characteristics of the original water quality data series. Then, the parallel training and prediction process are realized by the Spark, a distributed computing engine, to parallelize the traditional Cascade SVM. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model shows a strong superiority in many aspects of performance such as training efficiency and prediction accuracy.</jats:p>",

This raises the question as to whether the pandemic has contributed to a greater interest in and demand for locally produced foods. To answer this question, a study was undertaken to explore how consumers perceive SFSCs in delivering social, economic, and environmental benefits and whether these perceptions have been enhanced during the pandemic. A survey was carried out among consumers in Atlantic Canada who purchase food from SFSCs. Based on 80 valid responses, the findings revealed that consumers perceive SFSCs to deliver more social benefits post-pandemic than they thought SFSCs did before the pandemic. Supporting the local economy, food safety, freshness, and product quality are key motivators of shopping from SFSCs. Consumer perceptions about the sustainability of SFSCs did not vary much based on sociodemographic factors. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly alter consumer spending and frequency of shopping from SFSCs. This may affect the SFSCs’ ability to expand operations beyond current levels and suggest the complementarity between SFSCs and LFSCs for more sustainable consumption patterns. The study provides valuable insights into the attractiveness of the local food businesses and the effect of unexpected events such as COVID-19 on consumer behaviors.</jats:p>"

Our research interest is motivated by the grounds that the value of downstream retailers’ sales information to upstream manufacturers is to improve the accuracy of manufacturers’ order forecasting. This problem is particularly important in the remanufacturing of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). In this study, we consider a retailer (she) as the demand information holder, who sells new and remanufactured products in wholesale to a manufacturer (he) and, simultaneously, she and the manufacturer competitively collect used products from the customers. We explicitly characterize the role of information sharing in a CLSC. We contributed to the information-sharing literature by integrating the existing information-sharing model with dual recycling channels and channel power structure. Previous literature suggests that retailers prefer to share demand information with other firms when the market demand is high. However, surprisingly, we find that when the manufacturer does not play a leading role, the retailer shares her forecast demand information with the manufacturer if the market demand is low. We also show that information sharing reduces the overall profit of the supply chain when the manufacturer dominates the market. In addition, our results also illustrate that information sharing affects the performance of the supply chain mainly by affecting the wholesale price.</jats:p>"

Crucially, the paper examines the significance of three alternative identification strategies on the nature of supply and demand shocks and their impact on the economy: zero shock covariance in the presence of long‐run demand neutrality; non‐zero shock covariance in the presence of long‐run demand neutrality and long‐run demand non‐neutrality with zero shock covariance. Interest lies in which of the identification strategies provides shock decompositions that are theoretically coherent and congruent with the empirics of South African growth and inflation. Results support non‐zero shock covariance in the presence of long‐run demand neutrality identification. The analysis suggests that growth shocks in South Africa are dominated by supply shocks, and inflation shocks by demand shocks. Further, negative supply shocks lower steady state growth and raise steady‐state inflation, while positive demand shocks only raise steady‐state inflation and are growth neutral. South Africa appears relatively isolated from international productivity shocks.</jats:p>",

Due to the high proportion of coal in China’s energy, most thermal power plants use coal as fuel to generate electricity. In the process of coal combustion power generation, a large amount of air pollutants such as CO2, SO2, and Nox are produced, which destroys the ecological environment. In order to alleviate the energy crisis and reduce the emission of polluting gases, the development of renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy is extremely important. Electricity supply and heat supply account for the main part of China’s energy consumption, 40% of China’s energy consumption is used for electricity supply, and 25% is used for heat supply. In terms of electricity supply, 12% of electricity is used for residential use, about 74% is used for industrial production, and 14% is used for commercial development.</jats:p>",

Internal quality control alleviates the promoting effect of supply chain concentration on the risk of stock price collapse.

Collaboration and visibility enhancement in supply chains is a key to achieve resilience and robustness in supply chains. Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) is always been one of the difficult, yet powerful tool for collaboration in supply chains. Companies, in general attempt to address the technological side of changes, but avoid addressing the non-technological side of it, while implementing CPFR. This paper aims to explore the technological and non-technological enablers of CPFR, separately considering the Indian manufacturing industries and study their causal relations, using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). The results are beneficial, as managers can concentrate on causal enablers, while implementing CPFR. The success factors for implementation can slightly vary across different industries, but the applicability of the result is wider due to several common issues that arise during its implementation. Thus, the paper aims to provide directions for considering the most influencing enablers that can act as critical factors in the successful implementation of the CPFR. These influential enablers can be given much focus to reduce the vulnerabilities and to enhance the resilience capabilities of firms and their supply chains.</jats:p>",

In the water quality reliability evaluation, residual chlorine is a representative of water quality, and a first-order decay model was usually adopted. The water quality reliability (R) based on water quality entropy (WQE) and improved water quality reliability (Rd) based on improved water quality entropy (IWQE) were proposed and compared for three networks. The method was developed based on the EPANET toolkit and MATLAB environment. The results indicated that flow entropy (FE) is strongly related to WQE, and improved flow entropy (IFE) is also strongly related to IWQE. In addition, Rd can reflect the effect of pipe velocity, whereas R can only reflect the effects of pipe flow and the WDS layout. The novelty of this paper is to develop the entropy with consideration of the pipe velocity to measure water quality liability as a surrogate index, which can reduce the calculation load and can be applied to a nonlinear system. The proposed water quality reliability evaluation method based on information entropy can help design, analyze, and improve the water quality in the WDS.</jats:p>",

Therefore, an efficient backwash strategy plays a key role in ensuring a sustainable operation of the filters. In this study, a real-time monitoring method based on electrical resistivity tomography has been developed and tested at full scale for a period of six months in a rapid gravity granular filter during drinking water production. It provides proof of concept for a developed equipment and monitoring strategy within the given production environment. The time series of collected data, with different depth sensitivities of the upper 40 cm filter bed, demonstrates the temporal and spatial resolution capability of the method. Results show temporal development related to dynamic operation and backwash which in this study is combined with snapshot diagnostic tools and operational parameters to increase the spatial understanding of the active processes within the filter. These results suggest electrical resistivity tomography to be a suitable method for monitoring backwash efficiency.</jats:p>",

In accordance with the phase space reconstruction theory of dynamical systems, a fuzzy model for enterprise supply chain risk assessment is proposed using the robust nonlinear mapping capability of support vector machines and the characteristic of fuzzy logic that makes it easy to combine prior system knowledge into fuzzy rules. The results demonstrate that the prediction model can not only automatically acquire knowledge from learning data to generate fuzzy rules but can also extract support vectors that can represent the inherent laws of enterprise supply chain risks, drastically reduce the number of support vectors, and accurately predict. Future risk can be accurately predicted. This conclusion suggests that the support vector machine based on a fuzzy model is an effective method for analyzing enterprise supply chain risk.</jats:p>",

The prime objective was to examine the relationship between e-logistics operations and performance of health care supply chain management. A quantitative research approach was utilized to gather data from public referral hospitals respondents using structured survey questionnaires.  For data analysis, descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling were utilised, aided by SmartPLS 3. Findings showed a positive significant relationship between e-logistics operations and performance of health care supply chain management in the context of Ugandan public referral hospitals. This study implies that the key e-logistics operations in relation to the performance of health care supply chain management, are central management of drugs, the correct order picking of drugs given to the right patients for quality control, and presence of an electronic system to update stock daily. Additionally, the findings designated that, e-logistics operations are related to the performance of health care supply chain management in terms of ICTs tracking systems and data transparency. The practical implication to the health sector- stakeholders, is to consider ICT-tracking systems and data transparency for e-logistics operations and performance of health care supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Outbreaks that cross country, state and provincial lines are virulent due to the number of people they can affect and difficulty controlling them. Research is needed on food supply chain networks, which are not well-characterized in relation to foodborne illnesses or generally. This paper introduces the United States Food, Energy, and State Transportation (US-FEAST) model and demonstrates its applicability <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> analysis of a hypothetical demand shock resulting from multistate food contamination. US-FEAST is an optimization-based model across all fifty states with yearly timesteps to 2030. It is a framework integrating food system data from multiple individual data sources. To calibrate, we develop a bilevel optimization routine to generate synthetic, state-level data and provide estimates of otherwise unavailable data at the intersections of the food and transportation systems. The results of US-FEAST elucidate potential heterogenous state-level variations in response, regional changes in food flows, vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and implications for food system resilience. While the generated data and scenarios are not empirical evidence, they provide insights to aid in planning by projecting outcomes and intervention effects. Our results estimate a 23% beef production decrease and 4% price decrease provide a road map toward data needs for quantifying food system resilience to foodborne illness. US-FEAST and its framework may have global utility for studying food safety in national and international food supply chain networks.</jats:p>"

Our study investigates a dual-channel supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer, wherein the supplier ex-ante decides whether to implement the credit payment policy in the consumer market, and then the retailer determines whether to provide credit payment services in the reselling channel. We uncover that the supplier’s preference toward credit payment policy is not unidirectional. Specifically, the supplier establishes credit payment policy in the consumer market unless the discount of cash opportunity cost is lower than the price discount of credit payment services. Moreover, we find that, under credit payment policy of the supplier, the retailer opts to provide credit payment services when the discount of cash opportunity cost is higher than the price discount of credit payment services. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that, compared with non-credit payment policy, credit payment policy may restrict the development of economics sustainability, which undermines the whole supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, an original analytical solution for supercritical free-surface flow in rectangular channel contraction is proposed. The two-dimensional steady depth-averaged shallow water equations are simplified to an asymptotic one-dimensional (1D) unsteady flow problem in the transverse direction. A first-order approximation is then obtained using small perturbation theory, and the 1D asymptotic model is solved analytically using the Laplace integral transformation. The two-dimensional flow field solution is obtained following a compilation of sequence planes in the time domain. Free-surface profiles along the side wall and the channel axis were compared against experimental data. For this, laboratory tests were performed in addition to a comparison with classical experimental results available in the literature. Within the limits underlying the model, good agreement in water surface profiles is obtained by comparing experimental and theoretical predictions. Principal flow features, such as wave amplitude and positions, are well captured, which makes the solution model of interest for the design and analysis of contracted open channels.</jats:p>",

However, there is no standard for measuring supply chain sustainability and business competitiveness. The objectives of this research were to analyze and criticize existing methods for supply chain sustainability assessment and develop a new framework for future research. This study reviewed 151 scientific articles related to supply chain sustainability assessments from 2004 to 2020. The results show that many techniques are used for sustainability assessments. However, no single technique can comprehensively measure supply chain sustainability. Therefore, a new robust technique that accommodates complex data in a sustainable supply chain is required. The technique to be developed is a machine learning technique because it can accommodate multi-criteria problems with various nonlinear relationships. This research is a case study of the sugarcane agroindustry supply chain. The supply chain of the sugarcane agroindustry faces various sustainability issues caused by negative environmental impacts. The analysis results show that using machine learning techniques to assess sustainability for the sugarcane agroindustry’s supply chain has great potential to be developed. Machine learning applications for this assessment can also be used to monitor the performance of organizations. Thereby organizations can enhance their sustainability performance through data-driven decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intermittent water supply (IWS) networks are a problematic reality for over one billion people. Despite their drawbacks, IWS networks persist, and projects to convert them to continuous supply often fail. Here we explore one reason such projects might fail: the energy loss associated with IWS. Under IWS, water is delivered over a shorter period, increasing flow rates and thereby increasing energy losses. Could this energy loss prevent utilities from increasing their supply durations?To explore this question, we built two IWS versions of the Modena water network in EPANET. All households were assumed to withdraw water either i) as hastily as possible or ii) as patiently as possible. Artificial tanks and emitters modelled household storage and network leakage, respectively. Artificial tanks filled quickly, mimicking hasty withdrawals. To model patient withdrawals, a flow control valve was installed upstream of the tank, distributing withdrawals evenly throughout the duration of water supply.Simulations showed that when households withdraw hastily, energy losses strictly increase as the supply continuity of the network increases. Conversely, when households withdraw water patiently, energy losses increase initially, reach at least one maximum, and then decrease as supply continuity increases. Our results suggest that since energy losses often increase as utilities increase continuity, energy loss could obstruct some utilities from increasing supply continuity and from achieving continuous supply. We also found clear evidence that network behaviour strongly depends on the hastiness of household withdrawals. We also found that when networks with patient households are supplied with ample continuity, leakage can substantially influence the energy loss. We recommend additional theoretical and field research on IWS investigate the pace at which household withdrawals occur. </jats:p>"

Moreover, because of environmental and social requirements, traditional supply chain networks have changed to sustainable supply chain networks. On the other hand, reverse logistics can be effective in terms of environmental and economic aspects, so the design of the supply chain network as a closed loop is necessary. In addition, customers have a demand for different products with different quality levels. Considering different types of customers with a variety of consumption trends can be a challenging issue, and is addressed in this study. The main contributions of this research are considering different quality levels for products as well as different tendencies of customers towards environmental issues. In this study, a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model is designed that seeks to balance economic, environmental, and social responsibilities. In this paper, costs and customer demands for different types of products at different quality levels are considered under uncertain conditions using a robust possibilistic programming method. The proposed multi-objective model is solved using the Augmented Epsilon Constraint (AEC) method that provides an efficient set of solutions for all decision-making levels. The results show that the robust possibilistic programming method is more effective in dealing with uncertainties than the possibilistic programming method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bacteriological and Physico-chemical analysis of Lapai water source was investigated. Lapai is the headquarters of Lapai Local Government Area of Niger state, Nigeria. Bacteriological quality of water samples was determined by enumeration through Total Viable Count and Coliform count using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method. The Isolates were subjected to Series of Biochemical tests for characterization and identification. The physicochemical parameters were determined according to the standard analytical methods for the examination of water and waste water and Romanian standard. Findings from this work includes the following: Maximum Total Viable Count (TVC) and Coliform count were recorded to be 2.45 x 107cfu/mg and &gt; 1100 MPN index/100ml,while minimum TVC and Coliform count were recorded to be 1.05 x 107cfu/mg and 0MPN index/100ml in the water samples. Total bacteria count and identified from all the water sources in Lapai metropolis indicated that Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp occurred most with five (5) and four (4) isolates respectively.The conductivity data for the raw water samples indicated that State low-cost (LN), IBB Hostel (LE) and Emir Palace (LW) analysed were 250, 120 and 580 μs/cm. The pH, conductivity, chloride, nitrate and total hardness decreases with increasing treatment time in the column for the borehole water samples. While, the pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, total suspended solid (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total solids (TS), BOD, COD, nitrate, phosphate, ammonia and heavy metal analysis for the surface water (stream/river) samples also decreases with increasing treatment time in the packed column. Treatment of the water using nanocellulose revealed a decrease in all the investigated parameters with increasing treatment time. Most water samples examined did not meet up with the WHO standard for portable water, and the presence of these bacteria are potential pathogens that can significantly affect microbiology water quality, resulting to great health risk.</jats:p>"

While much attention has focused on the effects of climate change on pest management prior to harvest, much less attention and time has been devoted to determining the effects of climate change on pest management in the postharvest supply chain from farm to fork. Climate change may percolate to pest management at a macro level through compositional changes in which species attack commodities through distributional changes or what commodities are grown in a region (and thus processed in that area). However, climate change may also result in altered microclimates at food facilities, which can be tied to increased generation times, elevated damage and contamination potential, greater abundance of species, and greater need for external inputs. A variety of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies may help increase the resiliency and adaptation of management to climate change. Tactics susceptible to warming temperature changes in climate showing decreased efficacy include semiochemical-based, behaviorally-based tactics, a subset of insecticides (e.g., pyrethrins and pyrethroids), and those that rely on low temperature (e.g., grain aeration, grain chilling). Tactics at food facilities showing resilience to warming temperature changes in climate include packaging, other groups of insecticides, and likely sanitation. Data gaps include predicting changing distributions for stored product insects under climate change, translating macro climate changes into microclimate changes at food facilities, and rigorously investigating how IPM tactic efficacy varies under changing climate. Increased scrutiny of how climate change will affect pest management in the postharvest supply chain will deliver improved outcomes for the entire agricultural system.</jats:p>"

Two experiments were conducted. In experiment I, PSS were grown in nursery without Si (Control) and with Si. Experiment II was conducted in the field on Eutrustox with the following treatments: no Si supply (Control); Si supplied during the PSS formation phase; Si supplied through foliar spraying in the field; Si supplied through fertigation in the field; and Si supplied in the PSS formation phase and during field development. Silicon use in both crop phases benefited sugarcane by increasing photosynthetic pigment content and the antioxidative defense system. The innovation of Si management to be supplied via fertigation integrated in both crop phases (PSS and in the field) optimizes the element use by increasing the crop's productivity and sustainability.</jats:p>"

Compared with traditional energy sources, the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell has the advantages of good low temperature start-up performance, low noise, high efficiency and high power density, and no carbon emission, which gradually becomes the main energy source of the backup power supply system. This paper designs the backup power system topology of the “dual fuel cell and lithium battery” and researches energy management strategy based on fuzzy control (FC). Considering that it is difficult for the fuzzy controller to obtain the optimal membership function parameters according to working conditions, this paper aims to reduce the hydrogen consumption of the system, uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize the membership function of the fuzzy controller, and proposes an energy management strategy based on whale optimization fuzzy control (WO-FC). The energy management strategies are verified and compared by simulations. The results show that the membership function of the optimized fuzzy controller based on WO-FC energy management strategy has changed greatly: The hydrogen consumption of the system obviously decreased compared with no optimization, and the overall efficiency of the fuel cell also significantly improved. To be more precise, the energy management strategy based on WO-FC reduces the hydrogen consumption of the system by 5.35% and improves the overall efficiency of the fuel cell by 1.56%.</jats:p>"

The discovery of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) as a ferritinophagy receptor provides an opening to address the connection between iron and metabolic diseases. This study aims to specifically dissect the role of hepatic ferritinophagy in lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis.

The existence of this relationship requires the identification, measurement, and evaluation of the supply chain to determine an improvement strategy. The purpose of this research is to identify the supply chain structure, analyze the supply chain performance, added value, and risk, and formulate a strategy for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain. The identification of supply chain structures was analyzed using descriptive analysis, supply chain performance using SCOR and AHP, added value using a modified Hayami model, risk analysis using HOR, and strategy formulation using ANP. The research results reveal that the supply chain structure of the apple agroindustry consists of six structures. The supply chain performance of farmers is included in the marginal category, while collectors and industries are included in the average category. The added value of farmers was the lowest, while the collectors and industries were relatively high. There are still many risks in the supply chain, with more than ten risk priorities for each supply chain member. An alternative strategy for improving effectiveness and efficiency is technology development and innovation. This is done by providing apple cultivation and post-harvest technology for highlands, packaging technology for fresh apples, automatic machines for production, digital promotion to expand product sales up to a national scale, and further development can add a product tracking system to maintain product safety.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Globalisation has facilitated different industries to eliminate geographical boundaries and equipped organisations to work collectively to produce goods. Pharmaceuticals is one such industry which has majorly benefited from globalisation to reduce costs and increase profitability at different aspects of research, development, manufacturing of drugs and finally distribution of drugs. Globalisation not only reduces costs and increases profits for the industry, it also makes essential medication available to all individuals even at remote areas of undeveloped, developing and developed countries. As the number of entities or participants grew in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), the complexity and abstractness of the drug delivery from manufacturer to consumer has increased, which raised new concerns like counterfeit medication, incorrect, incomplete or no information about the drug reaching the consumer thus undermining customer confidence and most importantly distribution delays which can cause serious impact on the life of the consumer as well as business growth. Considering all these challenges, there is a dire need for a robust PSC which can eliminate blind parties and provide a transparent chain. A transparent PSC will eliminate data fragmentation between different participating entities by creating a trail of secure, single source of truth for the entire life cycle of a medicine, thereby eliminating the introduction of counterfeits and ensuring the consumer safety. This article proposes a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent supply chain for PSC and proof‐of‐concept is implemented to analyse the scalability and efficiency of the proposed architecture. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of the technologies which can provide such transparent PSC and Smart Contracts (SC) are the most commonly used component in such systems to implement business logic and access control mechanisms. The proposed PharmaChain model investigates all the interactions between the main entities in PSC and also addresses smart contract issues such as re‐entrance, randomness and lacking trustworthy data feed. Results are compared with other proposed solutions for PSC based on DLT.</jats:p>",

To measure the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, a numerical study is performed on generated problem cases, and the results are compared to those obtained using LINGO. The proposed algorithms provide a significantly better solution with a difference of about 3.04% for ACO1, 1.78% for ACO2, and 1.65% for ACO3 on average from the exact solution and in a very short time compared to Lingo.

The first step in leakage assessment is to recommend non profitable water volume, rather than just based on the percentage of leakage rate (the calculation mode of percentage is easily disturbed by the change of water volume); Advanced indicators also need to consider factors such as pipe network conditions, pressure and the number of user connections; If possible, it is recommended to calculate the leakage index (ILI) of water supply network in line with international standards, and through this index, determine the leakage classification of water supply system according to the target matrix provided by the world bank, so as to formulate corresponding leakage control countermeasures, and finally form a set of leakage performance evaluation system of urban water supply system combined with the actual situation of our country. Experiments have proved that among users with large caliber and large water volume, the promotion of electromagnetic remote transmission water meter should be strengthened to improve the metering capacity of water meter. Since 2014, non household meters above Dn40 in the company's new household installation project have adopted electromagnetic remote transmission water meters. At the same time, strengthen the remote monitoring and management of large-diameter water meters. Through remote transmission, we can grasp the changes of users' water use in real time, and realize the three-level early warning of sudden change of water volume through the mining of remote transmission data.</jats:p>",

This study introduces a two-echelon remanufacturing supply chain motivated by the practice of applying green advertising to update consumers’ low-carbon awareness. We use a game-theoretical approach to analyze the remanufacturer’s and retailer’s decisions on the green advertising program (non-coop vs. co-op green advertising) under different competitive scenarios in the LCSC. We find that the LCSC’s and the retailer’s profits are optimal in the non-coop green advertising under the monopoly, but the LCSC’s and the remanufacturer’s profits are optimal in the co-op green advertising under the competition. We suggest that the entry and royalty fees can be applied to coordinate the LCSC under different competitive scenarios.</jats:p>"

The analytical expression of bullwhip effect based on pricing strategy and product substitution is derived for the first time. The effects of pricing strategy and product substitution on the bullwhip effect are studied through simulation. The analytic results and the simulation results show that the bullwhip effect of the two parallel supply chains will be affected by lead time, product substitution rate, and pricing coefficient. The interesting finding is that the bullwhip effect can be efficiently alleviated by adopting a price strategy with many correlations and a small coefficient of autocorrelation.</jats:p>",

This paper aimed to predict the quantitative and qualitative changes in groundwater over time and to evaluate the efficiency of different modeling methods. This study is based on three steps. In the first step, quantitative and qualitative piezometers were clustered by the Growing Neural Gas Network (GNG) method, and the central piezometer of each cluster was used on behalf of each cluster. In the second step, four different Artificial Intelligence (AI) models were applied, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Emotional Artificial Neural Network (EANN). As a post-processing approach three different ensemble methods were used: simple average ensemble (SAE), weighted average ensemble (WAE), and nonlinear neural network ensemble (NNE). In the third step, the outputs of single AI models were used to enhance the evaluation results. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the NNE led to reach the better performance for three GWL, TDS, and TH parameters up to 37, 29, and 23% on average, respectively. Study results will lead to the improvement of AI applications in groundwater research and will benefit groundwater development plans.</jats:p>",

По этим и другим вопросам политики признают необходимость скоординированных ответных действий всего участники и тесного сотрудничества с частным сектором. Практическая задача, которая остается, заключается в обеспечении того, чтобы развитие местных туристических направлений соответствовало политике, установленной на национальном уровне. Туризм -это многосегментная отрасль. Это отрасль, в которой продукты потребляются на месте, формируя невидимый экспорт. Это также фрагментированная отрасль с высокой сложностью из-за чувствительного к цене характера спроса и нематериальности, способности к гибели и неотделимости. Устранение потерь в цепочке и улучшение обслуживания клиентов. Устранение потерь, например времени ожидания, инвентаризации и производства не запрошенных продуктов, приводит к снижению затрат. Улучшение обслуживания клиентов посредством взаимосвязанных процессов приводит к выбору предпочтительных поставщиков и увеличению товарооборота. Все это приводит к более высокой производительности (больше доходов / меньше затрат). В туризме очень важную роль играет предоставление качественных услуг с минимальными или сокращенными пробелами. Сокращение жизненного цикла продукта, усиление конкуренции и повышенные ожидания клиентов вынудили многие ведущие компании перейти от управления физической логистикой к более продвинутому управлению цепочкой поставок. Поэтому во многих случаях единственным возможным способом дальнейшего сокращения затрат и времени выполнения заказа является эффективное управление цепочкой поставок. Помимо снижения затрат, подход к управлению цепочкой поставок также способствует улучшению обслуживания клиентов. Он позволяет управлять запасами, транспортными системами и целыми распределительными сетями, чтобы организации могли соответствовать или даже превосходить ожидания своих клиентов. Туризм имеет жизненно важное экономическое, социальное и культурное значение и открывает реальные перспективы для устойчивого экономического роста. Целью научного исследования является - исследовать научный подход в определении управления цепочками поставок в туризме: логистический инструментарий.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The sustainable development of tourism and the digital transformation of the sector are the key challenges that participants face. On these and other issues, policymakers recognize the need for a coordinated response across all stakeholders and close collaboration with the private sector. The practical challenge that remains is to ensure that the development of local tourism destinations is in line with policies set at the national level. Tourism is a multi-segment industry. It is an industry in which products are consumed locally, forming invisible exports. It is also a fragmented industry with high complexity due to the price-sensitive nature of demand and intangibility, perishability and inseparability. Eliminate losses in the chain and improve customer service. Eliminating waste, such as waiting time, inventory, and production of unsolicited products, results in cost savings. Improving customer service through interconnected processes results in preferred vendor selection and increased turnover. All this leads to higher productivity (more revenue / less cost). In tourism, the provision of quality services with minimal or reduced gaps plays a very important role. Shortening product life cycles, increased competition and heightened customer expectations have forced many leading companies to shift from physical logistics management to more advanced supply chain management. Therefore, in many cases, the only possible way to further reduce costs and lead times is through efficient supply chain management. In addition to reducing costs, the supply chain management approach also contributes to better customer service. It allows you to manage inventory, transportation systems and entire distribution networks so that organizations can meet or even exceed their customers' expectations. Tourism is of vital economic, social and cultural importance and offers real prospects for sustainable economic growth. The purpose of the scientific study is to explore the scientific approach in the definition of supply chain management in tourism: a logistics toolkit.</jats:p>",

In this context, the present study aimed to explore the influence of close environment on the possible contamination of these resources. For this purpose, 22 WASPs were characterized (within a 10 m radius of the point) both from physiographic (nature of bedrock, water supply utility, soil type, land use) and anthropogenic (presence of pit latrines, domestic wastewater, domestic breeding, agricultural activities, wild garbage dump, washing clothes on-site). Then, chemical (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>3−</jats:sup>) and bacteriological (faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, total coliforms, and <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic>) contamination parameters were analyzed and compared with the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) was done, using water quality variables as input combined with environmental data as supplementary data. It revealed that waters from WASPs were generally of very poor bacterial quality, due to proximity with pit latrines, domestic wastewaters, and/or agricultural plots. NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> is exceptionally high where WASPs are close to agricultural plots and/or domestic wastewaters. The MFA showed that the chemical degradation of WASP mostly results from wider scale processes and is representative of diffuse (and likely long-term) impacts on the resource. In contrast, bacteriological contaminations were better governed by immediate contexts and appears to result from the combination of anthropogenic and physiographic constraints. Regarding vulnerability, the type of soil and the nature of the WASPs are the main influencing factors. The hydromorphic context accentuates the vulnerability, while the order of increasing vulnerability related to the type of WASPs is: spring - well and borehole - river. These results indicate that poor water management, combined with a limited consideration of local environmental specificities threatens the security and sustainability of this resource in semi-urbanized zones over heterogeneous aquifers, and argue for a twofold education effort for managers and end-users of the resource.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to propose an accurate travel-time estimation model. The model was developed by considering the different multiple traffic modes through a continuous approach. Moreover, in this model, it was assumed that the route between two nodes was a combination of different segments (i.e., expressway, boulevard, main street, auxiliary street, alley, etc.), and the speed level varied along the route and depended on the segments of the route. Congestion is a key factor affecting the delivery time of food to customers. To assess the reliability of the model, data from the delivery and sales network of the oldest and biggest beverage manufacturer in Iran was used. A new congestion pattern was identified based on the analysis of 272 routes and several rules were described that proved the above assumption about congestion. The travel time estimated for 30 random vehicles with random departure times were compared with data from Google Maps through statistical analyses.</jats:p>"

In these locations, it is particularly essential to establish practical alternatives to cope with the increase in the intensity and duration of droughts caused by climate change. This study proposes a methodology for the conjunctive use of a sand dam and groundwater well under various drought conditions. The method has been applied to a small mountainous area in South Korea. Owing to the scarcity of observational data, it is crucial to properly estimate the hydrological components necessary for judging the feasibility and reliability of conjunctive operations. The step-by-step procedures for performing the tasks are presented in this study. For the inflow of the sand dam, which is a portion of the basin runoff, two different approaches were employed and compared: the Kajiyama formula and a simple two-parameter monthly water balance model (TPM). Water budget analysis allowed for the determination of whether the current and increased water demand could be met under various drought conditions. Preliminary analysis revealed that a sand dam alone could not reliably meet the demand for 10-year or more severe drought conditions. Various water allocation scenarios between surface water (i.e., sand dam) and groundwater were tested. Conjunctive use of a sand dam and groundwater well turned out to increase the reliability of the water supply. As water demand increases and droughts become more severe, the role of groundwater increases. With appropriate resource allocation, 100% water supply reliability could be achieved, even for one year-lasting 50-year drought. We demonstrated how a system could be flexibly operated to meet the target demands monthly, given the system reliability level.</jats:p>"

With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industry—one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified.</jats:p>"

Adopting an embedded multiple case study approach, this paper explores and analyzes 11 cases of contractual relationships between Italian semolina and pasta producers and farmers in order to investigate whether sustainability strategies affect the design of contracts and the related consequences. Findings reveal that different sustainability strategies correspond to different design and combinations of (both monetary and nonmonetary) contractual incentives aimed to centralize property and decision rights. What emerges is that stronger sustainability strategies entail a higher degree of buyers’ control over strategic investments (such as land and seeds) as well as wider provision of technical assistance and knowledge and innovation transfer toward farmers. Therefore, mutual gains seem at stake, even if socio-economic implications of the shift in decisional and control rights from farmers toward buyers shall be neglected, to ensure a better coherence with the farm to fork strategy and sustainable development goals.</jats:p>"

It is emphasized that there is a need to improve state policy in order to create market incentives for a more rational distribution of capital from the sphere of resource use to more technological sectors, taking into account social and environmental consequences. An analysis of the structure of Ukraine's primary energy, which affects the functioning of the economy and the fuel and energy complex, was carried out. Ukraine's energy balance is marked by structural and price disparities, which significantly worsen the country's energy security indicators. The energy intensity of Ukraine's GDP is given, the dynamics of its decrease is extremely low. The characteristics of the Ukrainian international gas transit system are given and the need to change its architecture is indicated.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Marketplace platforms such as Amazon or Farfetch provide a convenient meeting point between customers and suppliers and have become an important element of e-commerce. This sales channel is particularly interesting for suppliers that sell seasonal goods under a tight time frame because they provide expanded reach to potential customers even though it entails lower margins. In this dyadic relationship, a supplier needs to optimize when to share inventory with the platform, and the platform needs to set the right commission structure during the season. Academic/practical relevance: We characterize supplier participation into the platform in a dynamic setting and link it to inventory levels, demand rates, time left in the season, and commission structure. This directly drives the commission structure decision made by the platform. We, thus, provide a framework to evaluate platform commission fee policies, taking into account supplier responses. Methodology: We use an optimal control framework with limited inventory supply and a stochastic demand process. We study the conditions under which the supplier accepts participation and use the platform as a sales channel. We also study the optimal commission structure that the platform should employ and the supplier procurement response. Results: We find that suppliers only participate if inventory is high relative to the time left to sell the items. As a result, the platform can only offer limited supply at the beginning of the season. Given this behavior, we find that the platform and the system are always better off with flexible pricing via fully dynamic commissions, which hurts the supplier the most (better off with less flexible commission fees). Interestingly, when the inventory decision is contingent on the platform pricing policy, the platform often finds it beneficial to commit to a static fee to incentivize the supplier to stock up, highlighting that inability to commit to fixed commissions may destroy value through double marginalization effects. Managerial implications: Our work suggests that short-term profit for the platform is maximized with fully dynamic commission fees at the expense of supplier profit. If inventory is endogenous, suppliers can retaliate by reducing their commitment at the start of the season. Despite the increased revenue obtained with the fully dynamic commission fee, the lost sales from the inventory drop incentivize the platform to opt for supplier-friendly commission fees, which are better for long-term profit. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Strict food regulations, high‐quality product demand, and fierce market competition urge food enterprises to focus on the optimization strategy of product safety and traceability recall in the food chain. To better meet customers' safety and quality expectations and reduce the loss of problematic products that fail to be recalled in time, the paper establishes a two‐level food supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and supplier, uses the Stackelberg game to explore the interaction between traceability recall and product safety optimization in the food chain, and finds the best food safety investment and product traceability recall strategy. And we consider the case of the former investing in the latter's product safety efforts. The results show that the food safety premium sharing rate determines the optimal decision of manufacturers and suppliers when each member is faced with the difference between the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit and the traceable recall cost coefficient. In addition, the higher safety investment cost factor increases the burden on the entire supply chain and reduces the safety benefits of the food chain. Moreover, higher security investment cost factors increase the burden on the entire supply chain and reduce the safety benefits of the food chain. Interestingly, suppliers can take advantage of the increased cost per unit of unrecalled products to obtain higher safety investments when manufacturers implement recall measures for problematic foods. We also introduced blockchain technology and discovered Pareto optima for food safety. When the supplier bears part of the problem of food loss, food safety, quality, and investment are high. The conclusions show that product traceability recall is beneficial to the overall welfare of the food chain.</jats:p>",

In this context, for a platform supply chain consisting of one manufacturer facing a shortage of green R&amp;D funds and a one third-party platform, this paper develops four game models under two financing channels (bank financing channel and platform financing channel) and two selling modes (agency selling mode and reselling mode). The equilibrium results of different models are derived and compared, and then the choices of selling mode and financing channel from the perspectives of both the manufacturer and the platform are analyzed. The conclusions show that the consumers’ sensitivities to green R&amp;D and DDM activities, as well as service commission fee, are major factors influencing green R&amp;D level and both parties’ choice of selling mode and financing channel. In most cases, a platform financing channel can promote the green R&amp;D level better and is more beneficial to the manufacturer and the platform. Only in a few cases, the two parties prefer the reselling mode and bank financing channel. However, agent selling with bank financing will never be their optimal strategy.

The data was collected from the (n=200)\nexperts of textile companies from different cities including Faisalabad, Lahore, Karachi and Multan. The greener\npractices were identified through literature review and evaluated by applying the four independent variables including\ncustomer involvement, supplier involvement, environmental involvement and financial involvement. By using descriptive\nstatistics and multiple linear regression analysis, the results depict that except for supplier involvement, the rest of the\nthree independent variables were found significant in predicting organizational performance. This study bridges the gap\nto understand the relationship between different dimensions of green supply chain management (GSCM) and\norganizational performance. The major contribution of this from the theoretical side is that supplier involvement has a\nnegative impact on organizational performance. Finally, the findings of this research would be helpful for concerned\nmanagers and policymakers in making decisions to adopt greener practices in achieving business excellence.</jats:p>",

The production speed of products has far exceeded people's needs. Emission reduction and environmental protection have become people's new pursuit. Closed loop supply chain should consider not only product life cycle and recycling, but also economic and environmental benefits. It has become the focus of scholars all over the world. Closed loop supply chain refers to the complete supply chain cycle from procurement to final sales, including product recovery and reverse logistics supported by life cycle. It is a highly complex process. In the closed-loop supply chain, the simplest form is composed of manufacturers, retailers and recyclers. Recycler is the most critical link in the new closed-loop supply chain system, which is not available in the traditional supply chain. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the change of recyclers when exogenous variables fluctuate from the perspective of economic psychology.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Research Objects and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Most scholars use short-term static methods when studying the uncertainty of recyclers in closed-loop supply chain. It is particularly important to analyze the uncertain factors in the closed-loop supply chain. In order to analyze this problem, this paper first improves the closed-loop supply chain model of capital flow and logistics coupling, so as to better simulate the real closed-loop supply chain. Secondly, the sensitivity analysis function of Vensim software is used to simulate the impact of exogenous variables on the inventory value and capital value of recyclers in the closed-loop supply chain model. At the same time, in order to verify the impact of recyclers' emotional stability, this study adopts the following scale. The communication anxiety scale adopts 15 questions of the Interaction Anxiety Scale (IAS) compiled by Leary, with a single dimension and a 5-level score, from 1 to 5 to “very inconsistent”. The higher the score, the greater the degree of social anxiety. The emotion regulation self-efficacy scale adopts the emotion regulation self-efficacy scale (RES) revised by Caprara. The 12 questions are divided into three dimensions: expressing positive emotions, managing depression / pain and self-efficacy of managing anger / anger, with 4 questions in each dimension. A 5-level score is adopted, from 1 to 5, which means “very inconsistent” to “very consistent”. The higher the score, the higher the degree of self-confidence in regulating their emotions. In the study, Cronbach's α The coefficient is 0.80. The aggression scale adopts the aggression scale (bpaq) compiled by Buss and Perry</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The scale has 29 questions and is divided into four dimensions: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility. The higher the score, the stronger the attack. In this study, Cronbach's α The coefficient is 0.85. The depression questionnaire adopts Beck's revised depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The questionnaire has 21 questions, with a single dimension. The higher the total score, the heavier the degree of depression. The data were obtained by spss19 0 and amos17 0 for analysis.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>the 19 exogenous variables were divided into four categories: Manufacturer related parameters, retailer related parameters, recycler related parameters and other related parameters. The sensitivity of these 19 parameters to recycler inventory and capital in closed-loop supply chain is simulated and analyzed. Through the comparative analysis of sensitivity chart, it can be seen that the manufacturer's inventory adjustment time, the retailer's safety inventory coefficient, the retailer's smoothing time, the retailer's inventory adjustment time, the collector's fixed expenditure and the collector's initial inventory value are positively correlated. And have a significant impact on collectors' inventory and emotional stability. The reason is that appropriate time adjustment helps to reduce work pressure and naturally improve job satisfaction.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>in the closed-loop supply chain, the fluctuation of the same exogenous variable in the same range has a more significant impact on the recycler's inventory than on the recycler's capital. For recyclers, the decline of inventory value has a positive impact on the capital of recyclers, while the decline of capital value has a negative impact on the capital of recyclers. The impact of retailer order smoothing time on recycler inventory and capital is uncertain. Therefore, recyclers should strengthen fund management, establish insurance mechanism and prepare reserves to prevent the impact of external variable fluctuations on recyclers' funds. At the same time, in view of the uncertainty caused by exogenous variables related to manufacturers and retailers on recyclers' funds and inventory, recyclers need to deal with it through information sharing, compensation mechanism, incentive and other ways.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Acknowledgements</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supported by a project grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.71764019), the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No.19BGL187), the Planning Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Inner Mongolia (Grant No.2021NDB082), Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation (Grant No.2021MS07016 and 2020MS07020) and Research Center for Resources, Environment and Energy Development Strategic.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

As a multifunctional organ, its energy supply, when faced with insufficient dissolved oxygen in the water, remain unclear. In this study, largemouth bass were subjected to hypoxia stress (1.2 mg/L) for 24 h and 12 h reoxygenation (R12) to evaluate energy supply strategy of gills. Under hypoxia, gills respond firstly and rapidly by increasing respiratory rate and changing gene expression. Transcriptome data showed that 2026 differential expressed genes (DGEs) were detected in the early stage of hypoxia exposure, including genes related to oxygen sensor and transport. KEGG functional analysis of DEGs revealed that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was enriched across all the sampling points (0, 4, 8, 12, 24h, R12). The gene expression and enzyme activity of three rate-limiting enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-6, pyruvate kinase) in glycolysis pathway were significantly increased. The increase of glycolysis products pyruvate and lactic acid, as well as the number of mitochondria, suggest the enhancement of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of glucose. These results suggest that gill of largemouth bass enhanced energy supply during acute exposure to hypoxia stress.</jats:p>"

In the proposed approach, the manufacturer is willing to donate as long as, (I) business image is improving; thus, the potential market size is expanding and, (II) consumers are also donating through the proposed donation scheme. Results indicate that not only the total earnings are increasing, the market participation is also boosted. Further, operational decisions are coordinated successfully with a revenue‐sharing contract. Findings imply that there is a minimum threshold for manufacturer's participation ratio to ensure the profitability of the proposed scheme, not to mention consumer's donation size.

Deferred payment and bank loan financing models under Retailer- and Manufacturer-Stackelberg settings are established, respectively. The equilibrium price and sales effort strategies of both sides of the supply chain under two power structures and financing modes are obtained by the backward solution method, and then the influence of free-riding behavior and financing interest rate on equilibrium strategies is explored, as well as how the power structure affects the financing decisions of enterprises. The results show that deferred payment is more conducive to retailers’ sales effort and order volume, which is the optimal financing model for the retailers under each power structure. Power structure affects the initial capital threshold of retailers and the manufacturers’ financing decisions. The impact of free-riding behavior and financing rate on equilibrium prices exists and varies, depending on the power structure and financing model. Numerical simulation results show that manufacturers should give priority to publishing price strategies, while retailers should decide whether to give priority to publishing price strategies according to financing mode and cross-price sensitivity. This paper’s findings can provide valuable guidance for decision-making in financing, price, and sales effort for the capital-constrained dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

This work presents a novel methodology that can optimize the design of biofuel supply chains by adopting a decentralized network structure consisting of a mix of fixed and mobile processing facilities. The model considers a variable biomass yield profile and the mobile fast pyrolysis technology. The mixed-integer linear programming model developed identifies the optimal biofuel production and biomass harvesting schedule schemes under the objective of profit maximization. It was applied in the case study of marginal lands in Scotland, which are assumed to be planted with Miscanthus. The trade-offs observed between economies of scale against the transportation costs, the effect of the relocation costs and the contribution of storage capacity were investigated. The results showed that, in most cases, harvesting is most concentrated during the month of the highest biomass yield, provided that storage facilities are available. Storage capacity plays an important role to widen the operational time window of processing facilities since scenarios with restricted or costly storage resulted in facilities of higher capacity operating within a narrower time window, leading to higher investment costs. Relocation costs proved to have a minor share in the total transportation costs.</jats:p>"

The place, time and type of transported cargo, etc., have an impact on the complexity of the transport system structure, which is why it is important to explore the possibilities and create transport optimization models throughout the entire cargo supply chain and analyze issues related to their organization, which affects the safety and reliability of this type of systems. The aim of the article is to present and analyze the concept of the agro cargo supply chain model using inland navigation, in the relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on the example of the Capital Group OT Logistics S.A. (OTL SA Capital Group). Taking into account the complexity and structure of transport tasks, it is important to look for optimal solutions in the field of transport. Each supply chain model includes only certain selected factors that have a limited impact on the volatility of the transport. It is not possible to build a model that would fully recreate the behavior of the object, with all possible external influences. The article considers the optimization model of inland wheat transport to final consumers, which predicts a constant demand for cereal loads in certain time segments. This model does not provide any rapid domestic fluctuations in demand for wheat at certain time intervals.</jats:p>"

The potential of Cemani chicken is very good, apart from being a chicken used for traditional ceremonies, Cemani chicken has good production potential and has very large export prospects. However, the population is still limited causing many requests that cannot be fulfilled. Maintenance that has not implemented an integrated and traditional supply chain system causes the development of Cemani chicken agribusiness to be slow. The supply chain management system (SCM) is an integrated marketing system that includes the integration of products and actors to provide satisfaction to customers. In the Cemani chicken commodity, the actors and those involved are not clearly known. This study aims to determine the actors involved in the Cemani chicken supply chain and to find out the product flow, as well as the finances contained in the supply chain in Pakis, Malang, East Java. The study was conducted at the Cemani chicken farm in Pakis, Malang, East Java. The location selection was done purposively based on the consideration that the center of the Cemani chicken farm in Indonesia was in Pakis, Malang City, East Java. The research was conducted in November 2020. The research method used is a descriptive survey method. The method of determining respondents is purposive sampling which is based on the supply chain of a farm owned by Mr. Ihsan and Mr. Sigit. Determination of the respondents of traders and consumers in this study was carried out by snowball sampling, namely tracing the supply chain channels of the livestock owned by Mr. Ihsan and Mr. Sigit from traders to consumers in the Java area. Respondents in this study were 2 breeders. The data for product flow obtained were analyzed descriptively while for financial flows were analyzed using margin and efficiency analysis. Based on the results of the study, it is known that the actors in the supply chain of grade I and grade I Cemani chickens are breeders, traders in the city, traders outside the city and consumers. There are three marketing channels in the marketing supply chain for Cemani chicken in Pakis Malang City, namely channel I consisting of Breeders → Traders Outside Malang City → Traders in the City → Consumers. Channel II consists of Farmers → Traders in the City → Consumers and channel III consists of Farmers → Consumers. Sales use online and offline systems. The flow of finance where the selling price is the highest is the out-of-town traders belonging to Mr. Sigit at a price of Rp. 350,000 – Rp. 531,250 / head with the age of 2-5 months. The most efficient marketing channel is that farmers distribute directly to consumers.\nKeyword : Products flow, financial flow, local chicken</jats:p>"

A simple, user-friendly website, the SMARTCHAIN Innovation Platform, evolving since March 2019, may facilitate interaction and cooperation among SFSC stakeholders. This article presents the Platform&amp;#039;s development and evaluates its efficacy and impact by analysing data from Google Analytics (GA) and other sources. Primary Platform features promote communication and information sharing: these are the 1) Innovation Hubs in 9 European countries, 2) Inventories including 150 SFSC innovations and 50 SFSC initiatives, 3) Resources databases of Publications and Weblinks, and 4) Training section. GA showed that visitors to the Platform increased slowly in the 16 months since its start, and the number of page views increased with the amount of time on the Platform. The most visited page of the Platform was the information-providing Innovation Inventory. Most Platform users were in partner countries of the SMARTCHAIN project, but not all Innovation Hubs had high numbers of users. Most users arrived at the Platform by direct link, but LinkedIn was the most important originating social network. Taken together, these data suggest growth potential for an easy-to-use website that provides useful and up-to-date information but little inclination for SFSC stakeholders to use an online Platform for communication.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

However, the mismatching of prediction model parameters produces prediction errors, resulting in a significant decline in the performance of finite-set model predictive controls. Aiming at the problem of model parameter mismatch, an extended-state observer was proposed to accurately estimate the disturbance of the system in this paper, and the obtained disturbance value was added to a finite-set model predictive control controller to compensate for the prediction error and achieve parameter robustness. By constructing a prediction model of the inverter output voltage in αβ coordinates, all the possible output voltage values were predicted by using different voltage vectors and system measurement values. A set of voltage vectors that minimized the cost function was selected, and its corresponding switching state was applied to the inverter in the next sampling period to achieve control of the output voltage quality. Both the simulation and experimental results showed that the finite-set model predictive voltage control method based on the extended-state observer can estimate the total disturbance quickly and accurately, suppress the influence of capacitance parameter disturbance, and improve the control effect of an inverter.</jats:p>"

The findings convey that cost recovery is a failure in rural water supply even they are not able to generate revenue. Inactive community participation, the notion of free water supply, unaccountable payment is main reason for poor revenue collection. Therefore, active community participations, educating the household on water supply, adoption of accountable payment mode will be a step towards revenue generation.

For this reason, they should be properly stored along the supply chain to guarantee the desired quality to the consumers. Specifically, ameliorating items face an increase in value if there are stored for longer periods, which can lead to higher selling price. At the same time, the costumers’ demand is sensitive to the price (i.e., the higher the selling price the lower the final demand), sensitiveness that is related to the quality of the products (i.e., lower sensitiveness for high-quality products). On the contrary, deteriorating items lose quality and value over time which result in revenue losses due to lost sales or reduced selling price. Since these products need to be properly stored (i.e., usually in temperature- and humidity-controlled warehouses) the holding costs, which comprise also the energy costs, may be particularly relevant impacting on the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the supply chain. Furthermore, due to the recent economic crisis, companies (especially, small and medium enterprises) face payment difficulties of customers and high volatility of resources prices. This increases the risk of insolvency and on the other hand the financing needs. In this context, supply chain finance emerged as a mean for efficiency by coordinating the financial flow and providing a set of financial schemes aiming at optimizing accounts payable and receivable along the supply chain. The aim of the present study is thus to investigate through a systematic literature review the two main themes presented (i.e., inventory management models for products that change value over time, and financial techniques and strategies to support companies in inventory management) to understand if any financial technique has been studied for supporting the management of this class of products and to verify the existing literature gap.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intermittent water supply (IWS) operations frequently involve water filling and emptying cycles that are strongly influenced by air-water interaction. Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) software has been recently proposed to simulate pipe filling events in IWS systems. As the tool is conceived to simulate both free surface and pressurized flows, it also has the potential to analyse the air entrapment. However, there is no numerical model capable of accurately and efficiently simulating the air behaviour during these events, nor of predicting the locations of air pockets created during the pipe filling process.An experimental pipe rig was assembled to better understand the pipe filling process in terms of pressure variation, the propagation of the filling wave and the air entrapment locations under different initial conditions. The pipe rig has a classic reservoir-pipe-valve configuration. Different behaviours are observed in this experimental setup during the pipe filling tests. An entrapped air pocket is created at the high point for lower flow rates, which is not dragged when the pipe is full. This air pocket can go from a similarly free surface flow inside the pipe to a complete water filled flow, depending on the flow rate. For low flow rates, a high head loss is introduced due to a hydraulic jump inside the pipe. For higher flow rates, the air is dragged, no air is entrapped and only the local head losses from the change of direction at the high point are observable.Following the collected experimental data, SWMM is used to assess to which extent it can predict entrapped air pockets location and their volume. Different filling processes can occur and an air model should be included to simulate the tests carried out in the pipe rig. The results obtained show that SWMM is capable of predicting air pocket locations but not the air pocket volumes. Further research is necessary to improve SWMM in this context.</jats:p>"

Selyaninov. The relevance of the study is that the Republic of Bashkortostan is one of the regions of the Russian Federation characterized by a high level of development of agricultural production. It is noted that the processes observed over the past decades reflect the aggravation of the economic and environmental situations and are largely related to the ongoing changes in climatic conditions on a regional scale. This requires the need for appropriate calculations and estimates. The study is based on the analysis of the materials of long-term hydrometeorological observations conducted through the Roshydromet network, which reflects the reliability of the results obtained. The observation period covers 1936-2021 and includes characteristic phases in the composition of cyclic fluctuations of the observed quantities. The article notes that the calculations and estimates for studying the features of changes in the conditions of heat supply and moisture supply, carried out in recent years, indicate a violation of the homogeneity of the series of observations. Based on the performance of a large number of calculations and estimates with a certain degree of conditionality, the time for a cardinal change in trends was identified. Therefore, in the article, 2 samples were selected for the general population of random variables, which made it possible to identify absolute and relative deviations of the norms for them and carry out cartographic analysis using the ArcGIS software package. It has been established that during the period of noticeable climatic changes in most of the territory of the republic there is a tendency to increase the values of the hydrothermal coefficient.</jats:p>",

The five largest ports globally handle goods that embody &gt;1.4% of global output, while 40 ports add &gt;10% of domestic output of the economies they serve, predominantly small islands. We identify critical cross-border infrastructure dependencies for some landlocked and island countries that rely on specific ports outside their jurisdiction.

In real business world, both manufacturer and retailer accept credit to make their business position strong, as credit not only strengthens their business relationships but also increases the scale of their profits. The long period of credit may increase the demand ratebut simultaneously it can also increase the credit risk. We investigate a two-layer supply chain model under dynamic demand with a manufacturer and a retailer maintaining decaying items with controllable deterioration rates under two levels of trade credit policies. For the time of trade credit granted to the retailer, the manufacturer bears opportunity costs. To promote sales and optimize sales volume, both supply chain participants give trade credit periods to downstream members and due to the credit period, both of them are facing default risk. Both members work together to invest in preservation technologies to abate the rate of degradation. The proposed models are developed for both the centralized and the decentralized scenarios. A closed form model having profit maximization problem is developed for both the centralized and the decentralized scenarios. The focus of this study is to obtain the optimal selling price, replenishment cycle time, preservation technology cost, upstream and downstream trade credit period to optimize supply chain profit. The paper’s novelty lies in introducing two level trade credit with default risk considering decaying items with controllable deterioration and price and credit sensitive customer’s demand in a dual channel supply chain inventory policy. It is found that joint supply chain model can be able to enhance the total profit of the whole supply chain. Lastly, sensitivity analysis highlights the influence of major model parameters using numerical examples.</jats:p>",

The present study contributes deeper insights into the logical integration of the resource‐based characteristics that can facilitate the effective transition from traditional to green supply chains while also increasing the effectiveness of existing green supply chains. The proposed model, rooted in the resource‐based view (RBV) theory, examines the associations of supply chain connectivity (SCC), supply chain information sharing (SCIS), top management commitment (TMC) and green procurement and logistics acceptance (GPLA) with green supply chain management (GSCM). Analysis of data from employees at 381 manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom confirmed the positive associations of SCC and SCIS with TMC and GPLA, of TMC with GPLA and GSCM and of GPLA with GSCM. The results also confirmed the serial mediation effect of TMC and GPLA on the associations of both SCC and SCIS with GSCM.

As a consequence, food travels long distances to reach consumers and its production is over-reliant on chemicals, leading to high levels of carbon emissions and soil degradation. Short food supply chains (SFSCs) have been advocated as more sustainable alternatives and have been explicitly mentioned by the Dutch government and the EU as a strategy towards achieving sustainability goals. While SFSCs are viable on a small scale, scaling and mainstreaming them has proven difficult due to low margins, high costs, and steep learning curves. Their economic underperformance is particularly glaring when compared to the highly cost-efficient - albeit energy and resource intensive - conventional commercial supply chains. In practice, SFSCs therefore remain isolated success stories, failing to contribute to systemic change in food systems. In efforts to enhance the performance of SFSCs, this paper introduces the GAIN transition model, a novel framework based on gamification which provides a holistic and actionable framework for SFSC actors to coalesce and strategize around a common vision. We illustrate the underlying principles of GAIN and its potential for institutionalizing SFSCs. We find that thus far, GAIN has helped to catalyze action and has proven a useful tool which provides a common language for actors to navigate this complex space. Future research and more dissemination are needed to conclude with more certainty on the quantitative impact of GAIN in terms of enabling and strengthening SFSCs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

While the number of cooperatives in China has increased rapidly in recent years, it is challenge for many small-scale cooperatives in China to achieve high performance due to resource and scale constraints. Taking Rui’an Meiyu’s Trinity Comprehensive Cooperation Organization as an example, this paper makes improvement to the original Trinity Comprehensive Cooperation Model and innovatively proposes a new practicable model called “three areas of cooperation with multiple bodies” for small-scale cooperatives to adopt. According to our research, the following features have been identified: first, the formation motivations of the new model include four different aspects, and the formation process of it includes three specific steps. Second, the resource integration mechanism of the new model is composed of production coordination optimization, supply and marketing platform restructuring, and credit capital guarantees. Third, the new cooperative model can increase economic benefits and simultaneously promote sustainable agricultural development. This study further complements the literature on the Trinity Comprehensive Cooperation Model and offers many managerial and academic implications for cooperative members and policy-makers.</jats:p>"

It allows you to influence macroeconomic components, such as the amount of money supply, activity in the credit market and the exchange rate of the national currency. Such actions lead to an increase in the money supply and the speed of its turnover, ensuring the availability of loans. Economic growth is being stimulated, but there are also adverse consequences - inflation is accelerating. The central bank uses monetary policy more frequently to bring about the desired level of change in real economic activity. These changes significantly affect the stock market. Economic theory uses the relationship between the money supply and the consumer price index. An analysis of the impact of the money supply on the consumer price index is necessary to select the most reliable type of monetary policy in the economy, to ensure macroeconomic stability or to stimulate economic growth. The money supply not only denotes and shows the level of money in various types and forms, but is also an important indicator on which price increases, inflation, credit policy, etc. depend. The dynamics of the money supply determines the dynamics of prices. The accumulation of excess money supply in the country’s economy leads to the depreciation of the national currency.

Methodology/Results: We conduct a behavioral experiment using the beer distribution game. We estimate decision rules using multilevel modeling approaches that overcome several drawbacks of the estimation methods used in the earlier literature. We find robust evidence that, contrary to the overreaction when in backlog hypothesis and reports from popular press, decision makers order less aggressively and become insensitive to the scope of the problem when in backlog—a scope neglect phenomenon. Managerial implications: We propose a dual-process theoretical account predicated on affective reactions to explain this scope neglect. Our results suggest that affective reactions under novel operating conditions or dramatic events in supply chains, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can overwhelm cognitive processing of managers and make them fail to recognize the full scope of the problems faced and update decision models accordingly. Understanding the cognitive-affective drivers of ordering behaviors that generate supply chain instability is important in designing interventions to mitigate their negative effects. </jats:p>",

By allowing large users to bypass urban gas companies and negotiate directly with upstream producers, direct supply can propel China’s gas sector towards a higher degree of marketization. Among the range of measures undertaken to reform the gas market, direct supply has received far less attention. Nevertheless, China’s regulators and policymakers at the central and sub-national levels have increasingly acknowledged the key role of direct supply in reducing the cost of gas and fostering more market competition. However, the remaining challenges to the implementation of direct supply are multiple and mainly originate from the extant restraints posed by the Chinese regulatory system governing the gas sector. Against this background, this article argues that the localized implementation of direct supply represents a ‘low-hanging fruit’ in China’s gas market reform.</jats:p>",

Green supply chain management (GSCM) is gaining attention because of increasing environmental deterioration, such as overflowing landfills, depletion of raw materials, and pollution in general. The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating role of technological innovation on the relationship between GSCM practices and social performance in 258 manufacturing firms in Malaysia certified with ISO 14001. Survey data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that GSCM practices had a significant and positive effect on technological innovation and social performance. Moreover, technological innovation had a positive effect on social performance. Technological innovation also mediated between GSCM and social performance. Therefore, the present paper confirms the positive effect of GSCM on the technological innovation of manufacturing firms, which in turn improves their social performance. </jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to explore the impact of various types of supplier integration on the buyer's efficiency and innovation, as well as the contingency effects of supply base concentration, an important supply base design choice. Drawing upon Social Exchange Theory, we argue that the expected benefits of supplier integration activities to efficiency and innovation are strengthened by supply base concentration. We test our hypotheses using data collected from 324 manufacturing plants. Hierarchical regression results reveal that some supplier integration types improve performance <jats:italic>only</jats:italic> under higher levels of supply base concentration, while the effects of other supplier integration types vary according to the type of performance considered or are not significant at all. In addition, the results suggest that developing technologies to share information with suppliers may be counterproductive in driving efficiency.

This structure enables the manufacturers to reach multiple segments of consumers with different online and offline shopping preferences, but it may create channel conflicts due to the manufacturers’ competitive position in the end market. Cooperative advertising programs can be implemented in response to the emerging competitive dynamics between the manufacturers and the retailers. We investigate the impact of the consumers’ sales channel preference (<jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., “consumer loyalty”) and the product compatibility with online shopping (<jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., “product web compatibility or web fit”) on the cooperative advertising and pricing decisions of a manufacturer and a retailer in a dual-channel supply chain. We use game-theoretical models and characterize the firms’ equilibrium behaviors under different power structures in the channel. Our results indicate that the level of the retailer’s advertising investment and the manufacturer’s reimbursement in the cooperative advertising program depend critically on consumer loyalty, product web compatibility, and the power distribution among the channel members. For example, when the channel power is symmetrically distributed or held asymmetrically by the retailer, the retailer’s local advertising level increases as the product web compatibility decreases or the proportion of store-loyal consumers increases; whereas this trend is reversed when the manufacturer is the channel leader. We examine how the introduction of the direct channel affects the profits, and we generate additional managerial insights from numerical experiments.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on the implementation of SO-LCA in a wine-producing organisation starting from a social organisational approach to the working conditions previously evaluated with SA8000. The SO-LCA case study was performed on a consortium composed of nine cooperative wineries located in Chieti, Abruzzo, a region in Central Italy. The existing experience of the consortium with SA8000 provided information and data on the working conditions of the companies involved in the life cycle of the evaluated wine line.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Food loss and waste are major issues in the food industry, and they affect all stages of the food supply chain (FSC). Food loss and waste are linked to environmental deterioration, economic loss, and an increase in hunger. Therefore, the food industry requires sustainable consumption and production (SCP) to reduce losses and waste. The circular economy (CE) concept has become a popular strategy for reducing food waste and boosting sustainability. Therefore, with efficient reverse logistics in the FSC, food producers can help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) like SCP and zero hunger. In literature, minimal research has been available in identifying the CE adoption challenges in FSC. This research identifies 15 critical challenges from the literature and discussion with the panel of experts. The relationship between the challenges has been established through an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique. The challenges were characterized in cause–effect according to their relational intensity obtained using the grey decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. Grey's relational theory is applied in DEMATEL to minimize uncertainty and vagueness of the expert judgment. The findings of this study suggest that creating policy from the government, providing incentives, and strictly enforcing environmental regulations are the most critical challenge. Hence, by focusing on the above, the effective adoption of the CE principle is achieved. This result also suggests that by addressing the challenges of CE, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be performed. This study provides some recommendations for the practitioners to adopt CE towards sustainable development targets.</jats:p>",

Engaging suppliers and customers on carbon management reduces vulnerability to climate-related risks and increases resilience and adaptability in supply chains. Therefore, it is important to understand the motives and preconditions for pursuing supply chain engagement from companies that actively engage with supply chain members in carbon management. In this study, a relational view is applied to operationalize the supply chain engagement concept to reflect the different levels of supplier and customer engagement. Based on a sample of 345 companies from the Carbon Disclosure Project’s supply chain program, the determinants of engagement were hypothesized and tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic estimation methods. The results indicate that companies that integrate climate change into their strategies and are involved in developing environmental public policy are driven by moral motives to engage their suppliers and customers in carbon management. All these factors make a stronger impact on supplier engagement than on customer engagement. Moreover, companies operating in greenhouse gas-intensive industries are driven by instrumental motives to engage their suppliers and customers because increasing greenhouse gas intensity positively influences engagement level. Company profitability appears to increase supplier engagement, but not customer engagement. Interestingly, operating in a country with stringent environmental regulations does not appear to influence supply chain engagement. By utilizing relational capabilities and collaboration, buyers can increase their suppliers’ engagement to disclose emissions, which ultimately will lead to better results in carbon management.</jats:p>",

A total of 25 risks have been identified and prioritized by fuzzy FMEA, where these risks are divided into eight supply risks, 12 manufacturer risks, and five demand risks. The mitigation strategies give five options: (1) branding image, (2) market penetration, (3) partnership, (4) preventive maintenance, and (5) production capacity to choose from.

On the supply side of populists in power (t), in the literature, populist rule is typically associated with unsustainable expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and with trade protectionism. At t  + 1, by using rational and biased belief assumptions, economists provide implicit inputs for a seemingly paradoxical question: why is a populist re-elected even if most populist policies assumably end up in Pareto inferior outcomes? This article summarises and criticises the relevant economic literature and shows that not only political science, but economics scholarship is instrumental for studying populism at all three stages. </jats:p>",

On the one hand, the unique relationship built through direct contact between producers and consumers, the fair distribution of value added in the chain that producers can find in engaging in SFSC, the increasing number of SFSC initiatives, the farm resilience, and territorial strategies that are being developed seem to be the most positive aspects, that can explain the trends moving towards these types of distribution channel. On the other hand, many hindering factors were also identified, such as weak communication and marketing capacity of producers, and a lack of efficiency and cooperation between peers. The fierce competition of conventional distribution, using green washing, together with a profusion of labels, price issues, and unsuitable standards were mentioned as the main threats faced by SFSC actors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

People depend on supply chains for basic necessities such as food, water, drinks, etc. Any disruption in these shipment pipelines poses a serious threat to human life. Supplier selection (SS) has been identified as a crucial component of FSC, which has been contemplated as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem in many studies. The failure of some specific MCDM problems is due to failure in contemplating the relationships between alternatives under uncertain circumstances. To address such challenges, we present a contemporary method for designating green suppliers based on single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy (SVNHF) information, in which the input assessment is taken into account using single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy numbers (SVNHFNs). The foremost purpose of this analysis is to construct a topological structure on single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets (SVNHFSs) as well as to validate several key properties with examples. We discuss certain properties of SVNHF topology such as the SVNHF closure, SVNHF interior, SVNHF exterior, and SVNHF frontier. We also examine the conceptualization of the SVNHF dense set and SVNHF base in SVNHF topology using comprehensive examples. Eventually, to demonstrate and validate the superiority and inferiority ranking (SIR) method and choice value (CV) method in terms of their rationality and scientific basis, a real-world example of supplier selection in a food supply chain is provided. A comparative analysis is also performed to discuss the symmetry, validity and advantage of the proposed techniques.</jats:p>"

POM requires FFB from independent smallholders to maximize CPO production. POM usually separates FFB supply based on internal and external sources. However, the segregation did not identify the farmer and farm location source of external FFB. This study aims to analyze and design an FFB supply system from the independent smallholder’s channel by identifying the farmers’ and farms’ source of FFB in every batch production of CPO and identifying Farms and farmers to support a traceability system of CPO derivative products. The New FFB delivery system services will be run on a cloud platform. The services are truck allocation, weigh scheduling, weighing, sorting, and CPO production. The Method for developing FFB delivery service using a system approach and System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This research only discusses the analysis and design phase. The research output is a new design delivery system of FFB with Block Appointment Scheduling (BAS) for quality control of FFB to produce high-quality CPO. The simulation of BAS and CPO production is running based on the business process at PT. RSI.</jats:p>",

However, the connection rates to PWSOs are highly varied. Therefore, this study aimed to find the reasons for the low connection rates of PWSOs and to propose ways to increase the connection rates. The three PWSOs selected for this study supply water continuously, with sufficiently high pressure and good water quality except for the low concentration of residual chlorine, while the per capita supply volume varies significantly. Households with alternative water sources, namely rainwater and well water, consume less piped water than those without alternative water sources. Scattered service areas far away from water treatment plants had coverage rates that were lower than in compact service areas. The present connection costs and water tariffs are higher than those that non-connected households are willing to pay, though they pay high costs for bottled water. Due to the high variation in household income, connection fees and water tariffs are a financial burden for low-income households. Because the operating rates of the PWSOs are 21–47%, it is advised that PWSOs reduce their connection fees and water tariffs to obtain more connected households in their service areas.</jats:p>"

From the data obtained, the analysis was carried out using several tools, such as Fishbone Diagram, Root Cause Analysis, and Value Stream Mapping (VSM). In assessing supply chain performance, the results of the assessment from the SCOR analysis were used to determine the part of the activity that has a low value in this case; the activity is the length of cycle time for storing finished goods in the warehouse. The root of the problem from the average length of the cycle of storage of finished goods in the warehouse shows that it occurs because the layout of the storage of goods was not well regulated. Therefore, it was necessary to improve the layout of the finished goods storage warehouse and implement technical procedures for taking goods. The results of this study are improvements that need to be implemented, so that the cycle of storing goods in the warehouse is not too long and the value of goods storage performance on SCOR to become increase.&#x0D;\nABSTRAKArtikel ini membahas tentang studi kinerja rantai pasok setelah diukur menggunakan Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) analisis dengan melihat variabel yang memiliki nilai sangat rendah yaitu 0 yang terdapat dari penilaian kinerja setiap variabel. Rendahnya nilai tersebut berpengaruh terhadap kinerja rantai pasok ketika dilihat secara garis besar. Dari data yang diperoleh, analisis dilakukan dengan menggunakan beberapa tools yaitu Diagram Fishbone, analisis akar penyebab, dan Value Stream Mapping (VSM). Dalam melakukan penilaian kinerja rantai pasok, hasil penilaian dari analisis SCOR digunakan untuk mengetahui bagian bagian aktifitas yang memiliki nilai rendah dalam hal ini yaitu lamanya waktu siklus penyimpanan barang jadi di gudang. Akar masalah dari lamanya waktu rata-rata siklus penyimpanan barang jadi di gudang menunjukan bahwa terjadi karena tata letak penyimpanan barang tidak diatur dengan baik. Oleh karena itu perlu perbaikan tata letak gudang penyimpanan barang jadi dan menerapkan prosedur teknis pengambilan barang. Hasil dari studi ini yaitu perbaikan yang perlu diterapkan agar siklus penyimpanan barang di gudang tidak terlalu lama sehingga nilai kinerja penyimpanan barang pada SCOR dapat meningkat.</jats:p>"

Three different higher-order scales were developed for assessing the SSCM, SFP and innovation adoption. The first scale for SSCM higher-order construct consisted of service–product supply chain management practices (SPSSCM), service–setting supply chain management practices (SSSSCM), and service–delivery supply chain management practices (SDSSCM). The second higher-order scale for sustainable firm performance (SFP) consisted of economic, operational, environmental, and socio-cultural performance. The third higher-order scale for innovation adoption (INNO) consisted of “product- and process-based innovation”, “marketing-based innovation”, “technology-based innovation” and “organizational innovation”. The face, content, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity was tested using pilot study, expert opinion, EFA, and CFA. With 178 responses collected from restaurateurs, managers, and supervisors of casual restaurants in Prachuap Khiri Khan province in Thailand, this study evaluates the direct effects of SSCM on SFP. It further evaluates the mediating role of innovation adoption between sustainable supply chain management practices and firm performance and the moderated mediation effects of socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, education, and experience. The results reveal that sustainable supply chain management practices can positively lead to sustainable firm performance. However, irrespective of the indirect effects of socio-demographic factors, adopting innovation completely mediates the relationship between sustainable supply chain management practices and firm performance.</jats:p>"

In this paper, two ranking criteria have been utilized to convert the uncertain objectives into their crisp form. Using these two ranking criteria for the uncertain MCMOTP model, two deterministic models have been developed namely, Expected Value Model (EV Model) and Optimistic Value Model (OV Model). The multi-choice parameters in the constraints are converted to a single choice parameters with the help of binary variable approach. The EV and OV models are solved directly in the LINGO 18.0 software using minimizing distance method and fuzzy programming technique. At last, a numerical illustration is provided to demonstrate the application and algorithm of the models. The sensitivity of the objective functions in OV Model is also examined with respect to the confidence levels to investigate variation in the objective functions.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes an integrated optimal allocation model for aquifer sustainability and environmental benefits when managing conjunctive water resources. Optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are used to balance economic benefit and demand management based on decision makers’ preferences. The findings indicate that less water was allocated to industries with high water demand. The value of the allocated water to these industries is between 34 and 52%. Thus, it concluded that specific industries are unsustainable when environmental damage is considered. From the scenarios examined, scenario 10 (water resource conditions and water demands are determined based on existing conditions, considering domestic water management and aquifer restoration) was found to be the optimal water management scenario. The indicators of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) for this scenario are 0.30, 0.15, 190, 40.9, and 0.55 for relative water stress, aquifer sustainability, aquifer attenuation period, aquifer recovery potential, and agricultural water productivity, respectively. This finding implies that considering demand management, wastewater treatment, and the absence of industrial development in development scenarios, it will be possible to conserve aquifers and meet water demands.</jats:p>",

Despite strong evidence of the positive association between participation and the depth of PTA on GVC participation, the analysis finds that the impacts of disasters and the significance of their interactions with PTA participation are highly sensitive to the choice of disaster variables and econometric specifications. However, there is emerging evidence suggesting that PTA participation increases a country's vulnerability to disaster effects.

So the purpose of this study is to find out whether the beef chicken business in the village of Gunung Manaon 1 is in accordance with Islamic law, both in the production process, distribution and when it arrives at hand. consumers and what is the role of halal supply chain management in this beef chicken business. The research method used is a qualitative method using descriptive by conducting field observations and direct interviews with business owners, employees and consumers. And from the results of this study, we found that the Chicken Slaughter Business in Gunung Manaon 1 Village was in accordance with existing halal laws. In addition, supply chain management activities in the Chicken Slaughterhouse have also met halal standards according to interview and observation data. Then for the provision of animal feed and the like, it is also necessary to ensure the validity of feed and beverage ingredients, vaccines and vitamins that do not directly affect chicken meat, but this is done to avoid suspicious things....</jats:p>"

The subjects were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 71 workers who worked under high strain isolated (HSI) psychosocial working condition (workers felt that their work entailed high demand, they possessed a low controllability over their job and low work–related social support). The second group consisted of 367 workers who worked under other conditions. The result from the chi-square test between workers’ demographic characteristics and their psychosocial working conditions revealed that the probability of working under HSI condition for workers with different Gender, Age, Education Level, Work Experience, Work Position, and Average Monthly Income are different. It insisted the heterogeneity of working under HSI condition among construction workers. A logistic regression model for forecasting the probability of working under HSI condition, using the workers’ demographic characteristics, has then been developed in this study. The model consists of five demographic characteristic variables, namely Work Position, Education Level, Average Monthly Income, Work Experience, and Age. The adjusted odds ratio value, which was obtained from the analysis of the model constants, indicates that Work Position, Average Monthly Income, Age, Education Level, and Work Experience have influence on workers’ probability of working under HSI condition in descending order. Finally, an example of applying the model to identify specific demographic characteristics of workers who need special attention is presented at the end of this paper.</jats:p>"

In order to investigate the trend of the incoming flow rates before leaving the junction, experiments with inflow rates (North and West) ranging from 0.18 to 2.17 L/s, Reynolds numbers ranging from 14,324 to 110,780, and free chlorine concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.80 mg/L were performed. The results showed that flows tend to bifurcate rather than mix completely, and the bifurcation and mixing depend mainly on the relative flow rates entering the cross junction. Based on the experimental results, a dimensionless concentration (R) was estimated, allowing for predicting chlorine at the East outlet. Then, a solute mass balance was also performed within the cross junction to predict chlorine concentration at the South outlet. Finally, an adjustment of the R-value was performed by using 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the analytical equations were also validated with simulations. The standard k–ε turbulence model with enhanced wall treatment for modeling turbulence and near-wall effects, respectively, were used. More mixing models will improve water quality simulations to ensure proper control of chlorine and possible contaminants in water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

An accurate estimation of scour depth below the stream-bed is important during design since it determines the foundation levels and the expansion of the bridge foundation structures. The present study reveals the results of flume experiments on equilibrium scour depth and scour volumes around circular bridge pier models in clay–sand sediment mixtures. The scouring process in a cohesive sediment mixture is a complex interaction between clay–sand network structure and bed shear stresses. The bed shear stress reduces inside the scour hole as scour depth increases, and this is related to the different modes of scouring in clay–sand mixtures. An exponential equation for the non-dimensional scour volume is proposed considering all the experimental runs to get a specific understanding of the surrounding volume of scour hole from maximum equilibrium scour depth in a clay–sand mixed cohesive bed, when the approach flow velocity is near to the critical velocity for mixed sand. The proposed equations are validated using the pre-existing data from the literature dealing with experimental investigations on bridge scour using clay–sand mixed cohesive sediment and show good agreement with observed data.</jats:p>",

Most studies have confirmed the application effect of nudges in policies that are receptive, but there is little research on their application in policies that are resistive. Through research on the supply content and promotion mechanism of policy resistance, we determined that the nudge policy tool does not demonstrate significant benefits for the effect of policy behavior, while, among the explicit policy tools, the preaching tool has a significant impact on the effect of policy behavior.</jats:p>"

To explore how to enhance their capacity to act and benefit society at large, we turned to scholarly and policy work on Social Innovation (SI). We concentrated on understanding what SI in SFSCs is and how it may stimulate their potential, following a two-phase approach. In Phase 1, employing a two-step systematic literature review, we generated a rich database of SI definitions, but no suitable definition was found. We proceeded to craft a domain-specific systems-centred definition, positing that SFSCs can be seen as social living systems, while SIs in SFSCs may be seen as processes that bring about change (e.g., new mentalities) and result in the creation of sustainable value for the actors involved and beyond. With the aid of an additional scholarly review, we also determined that the drivers of SI that matter are those that secure actor engagement in the co-design and co-development stages of SI (e.g., training). In Phase 2, we attempted to empirically validate the findings from Phase 1 in 12 Community of Practice (CoP) events in nine European countries. We found partial support for the SI definition, strong support for the vital role of trust, and concluded that, in any SFSC, it is critical to have a group of dedicated actors that have realized their role as (co-)leaders in co-shaping their own future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

The increase in demand does not mean that PT PQS Indonesia did not experience obstacles during the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem faced was the decline in delivery performance from suppliers, which impacted on the reduced stock of raw material stock and could even lead to production stops. This is because the suppliers were affected by Covid-19. This is a challenge because PT PQS has dozens of suppliers at home and abroad. To repeat this so that production does not stop, PT PQS Indonesia added a feature to help control supplier delivery performance.

However, our findings suggest that, when considering the vaccine product available at the time (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; 65% efficacy against infection after 2 doses), prioritizing the elderly for vaccination remained the best strategy to minimize the disease burden caused by Delta, irrespectively to the number of available doses. Vaccination of all individuals aged 50□years or older would have averted 40 (95%CI: 18-60), 90 (95%CI: 61-111), and 62 (95%CI: 21-108) critical cases per 100,000 residents in urban, rural, and remote areas, respectively.

One of the important factors of remanufacturing is the quality of the remanufactured products. The collection and distribution of used products require proper management. Based on this situation, this study discusses a hybrid closed-loop supply chain management in cooperation with a hybrid production system. The vendor comes up with the policy of sharing remanufacturing responsibility by sharing the technology license with other supply chain players. The carbon cap restricts emissions from the entire hybrid production system of the vendor. Other factors of this proposed study are service by the retailer and quality, gift policy, and customer awareness by the vendor. This study examines the scenario under random market demand. Classical optimization provides the solution under the Stackelberg game policy where the vendor acts as leader and the retailer &amp; third party act as followers. This paper considers two scenarios: Scenario A for a continuous distribution and Scenario B for no specific distribution. A comparison is drawn between various motivating factors-based policies to control supply chain management.</jats:p>",

The retailer serves as the exclusive sales channel during the introductory period of a style generation.

The retailer adopts dual rollover if she sells the old style generation, and single rollover if she does not. We develop a two-stage game to explore the chain members’ equilibrium decisions while accounting for the manufacturer’s cost inefficiency in direct sales and consumers’ mental account deficit. We find that the manufacturer’s cost inefficiency has double-edged effects and can offset the negative effect of consumers’ mental account deficit on the introduction of a new style generation. Furthermore, a win–win outcome can be achieved when the manufacturer with an intermediate level of cost inefficiency engages in direct sales and consumers have high valuations of the old style generation or when the manufacturer with significant cost inefficiency does not engage in direct sales.</jats:p>",

Water demand measurements or pseudomeasurements (i.e. estimations based on historical data) are associated with a time interval (sampling rate), which affects the variability of water demands. Considering a long time interval implies losing information about water consumption within that temporal window. The variance (i.e. quantification of variability) computed from demand records is thus only “apparent”, because the variability within the time interval is averaged and lost (i.e. “missed”). The relationship between missed and apparent variability can be assessed through the so-called TEmporal scale SIgmoid Curve (TESIC), which is here presented as a tool to characterize short-term demand variability. TESIC is used in this work to compute demand uncertainty for a given time resolution level and to estimate peak demands for different temporal resolutions in a realistic water supply case study. These applications show that TESIC provides a conceptual framework to explain and quantify the temporal resolution effect in hydraulic modelling applications.</jats:p>"

During the temporary loss of support from circulation, the tumor cells must act self-sufficient to survive and then to migrate to re-connect with the nearest blood supply or die. We have previously reported that ablation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) completely nullified the ability of tumour cells to migrate and invade under serum-free conditions in vitro and to form tumours in vivo. The mechanism behind the important function by cell surface LRP-1 was not fully understood. Herein we show that LRP-1 orchestrates two parallel cell surface signalling pathways to support the full constitutive tumour cell migration. First, LRP-1 stabilizes activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to contribute half of the pro-motility signalling. Second, LRP-1 mediates secreted Hsp90α autocrine signalling to bring the other half of pro-motility signalling. Only combined inhibitions of the EGFR signalling and the eHsp90α autocrine signalling led to the full blockade of the tumour cell migration as the LRP-1 depletion did. This finding uncovers a novel mechanism by which certain breast cancer cells use LRP-1 to engage parallel signalling pathways to move when they lose contact with blood support.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Scan based trading (SBT) represents a type of replenishment system in which the supplier retains title until the product is scanned through checkout at the retail store by the consumer. Although SBT carries potential benefits for both parties in the supplier-retailer dyad, it may also yield asymmetric gains to these parties, particularly because SBT can impose greater inventory costs to suppliers through shrink. We document the financial benefits in terms of supply chain profit creation and allocation based on the differences in bargaining power between parties in a vertical channel under SBT vis-à-vis the more traditional vendor-managed inventory (VMI) contracts. Academic/practical relevance: Although prior literature has examined inventory benefits and drawbacks from VMI and SBT contracts in retailer-supplier dyads, it has failed to offer a systematic evaluation of the relative impact of these contract forms on bargaining power and profits in these dyads. We address this knowledge gap. Methodology: To that end, we use a methodological approach that incorporates an empirical Nash-in-Nash bargaining model, a supplementary regression, and a counterfactual simulation. Results: We find that retailer bargaining power is higher under SBT relative to VMI contracts. Moreover, the direct effects of a retailer switching from VMI to SBT regimes generate an average increase of 25% in total supply chain profit, allowing the retailer and its supplier to increase their profit by 20% and 29%, respectively. However, although the retailer’s profit share decreases by approximately 3.5%, the supplier’s increases by about 3.3%. We attribute the decrease in the retailer’s share to a stronger bargaining position on the supplier side based on higher supplier shrink costs. Managerial implications: Our findings provide managers with more transparent information regarding the set of outcomes they can expect should they choose to enter into SBT contracts. Importantly, we show how an outcome that has significantly hindered the adoption of SBT contracts (i.e., shrink costs) can enter into the negotiation between retailers and suppliers to optimally split the dyadic surplus of the contracts between these parties. </jats:p>",

It increases the resource value of used goods. In this study, we proposed a circular business gap exploiter model in which a re‐commerce company exploits residual value in product systems utilization. A game‐theoretic approach is used to investigate the coordination problem of a two‐echelon circular supply chain with e‐commerce and re‐commerce companies. In addition, we proposed a coordinated structure under the revenue sharing contract and the two‐part tariff contract through Nash negotiation to address the coordination problems. We compared the centralized and decentralized model findings and observed that the decentralized model shows potential for improvement. We showed model's applicability through numerical examples and sensitivity analysis to indicate how parameters such as wholesale price and retail price affect channel decisions and member profits. The results show that a two‐part tariff contract may efficiently coordinate the circular supply chain. The study shows that under a circular business model, two tactics may be applied. These are extending product value and extending resource value.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global catastrophes such as a supervolcanic eruption, asteroid impact, or nuclear winter could cause global agricultural collapse due to reduced sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface. The human civilization’s food production system is unprepared to respond to such events, but methane single cell protein (SCP) could be a key part of the solution. Current preparedness centers around food stockpiling, an excessively expensive solution given that an abrupt sunlight reduction scenario (ASRS) could hamper conventional agriculture for 5–10 years. Instead, it is more cost-effective to consider resilient food production techniques requiring little to no sunlight. This study analyses the potential of SCP produced from methane (natural gas and biogas) as a resilient food source for global catastrophic food shocks from ASRS. The following are quantified: global production potential of methane SCP, capital costs, material and energy requirements, ramp-up rates, and retail prices. In addition, potential bottlenecks for fast deployment are considered. While providing a more valuable, protein-rich product than its alternatives, the production capacity could be slower to ramp up. Based on 24/7 construction of facilities, 7%–11% of the global protein requirements could be fulfilled at the end of the first year. Despite significant remaining uncertainties, methane SCP shows significant potential to prevent global protein starvation during an ASRS at an affordable price—US$3–5/kg dry.</jats:p>"

A widely observed problem associated with IWS is the inequitable distribution of water across the network. This results in different consumers in the network receiving different volumes of water. Modelling the inequity within IWS systems remains an open research field. To date, simulations have often adapted hydraulic modelling software to understand the distribution of water with little attention to the consumer interaction with the network. This paper proposes a conceptual model based on a more holistic understanding of water distribution in IWS systems. Understanding the spatial and temporal variation in received volumes, as well as the variation in consumer access within the network, enables a more representative simulation of the inequitable quantity of water received by consumers.</jats:p>"

A cost-benefit model of RWH was developed with subject to reliability target of water supply and runoff capture in each simulation. Near-optimal solutions were identified for each case using a constrained nonlinear programming algorithm. We apply the model to evaluate the RWH system in Bandung Area, West Java. Various types of buildings, ranging from residential houses, schools, dormitories, offices, apartments, condominiums, mosques, and hospitals, are studied to provide several optimal parameters for tank volume and number of users for various land-use scenarios. The resulting parameters are obtained through optimization to get minimal RWH’s capital costs and water purchase costs by applying several criteria related to the financial feasibility of the RWH system and by keeping the runoff coefficient not exceeding the pre-development value. The simulation results can be used as a guide for planners to consider the application of RWH in several types of buildings.</jats:p>",

In line with this, the main purpose of this study is to develop a sustainable food Supply Chain Network (SCN). The SCN enables the collection of agro-food grains from different farmers’ locations and delivers the same to food processing units. To design an efficient and effective sustainable pickup and delivery network, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) mathematical model is formulated. The proposed model achieves the sustainability goal by minimizing the collection costs. The developed MINLP model is solved by using an exact optimization approach in LINGO 18 software. Further, to test the efficacy of the developed model, various computational experiments are performed, varying from small to large size data. The results of these experiments reflect that our model can support businesses in designing an efficient and effective sustainable pickup and delivery network. Lastly, it has been shown that innovative packaging materials can help to minimize the wastage of food.</jats:p>"

Additionally, macroinvertebrate productivity can be affected indirectly via biological mechanisms, such as changes in species interactions, richness, competition, and predation. We studied the effects of agriculture on structural and functional descriptors of macroinvertebrate communities by assessing environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate secondary production (MSP), biomass and density in two forested and two agricultural streams and investigated underlying biotic mechanisms. On average, MSP was 1.6–3.6, biomass 2.8–6.2 and density 5–13 times higher in agricultural than in forested streams. This pattern was associated with higher nutrient concentrations, standing crops of riparian herbaceous vegetation, suspended particulate organic carbon, quantity and quality of epilithic biofilms and chlorophyll‐a concentrations in seston and biofilm of the agricultural streams.

The project is based on the hypothesis that it is possible to reverse the demographic trend in marginalised areas – characterised by a declining population, a high old-age index, a lack of basic services and, at the same time, a high potential for innovation – with building renovation and differentiated housing offers with high standards of quality and services. Through a systemic and place-based approach, the research uses pilot cases to experiment on themes linked to new housing demands, digital and green innovation, proximity welfare and social cohesion through a multi-actor and multi-level process.</jats:p>"

Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH) novel reference technologies, we analyzed the efficiency, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, and the social, economic and ecological performance (TBL elements) of 29 municipalities in drinking water supply, in Oromia National Regional State. The results from 42 (efficiency), 173 (effectiveness), and 37 (cost-effectiveness) DEA and FDH models on production model criterion and TBL elements reveal that performance of many municipalities was weak, and the municipalities encountered trade-offs on the production model criterion and TBL elements. We argue that inter-organizational bench-learning can improve performance, reduce trade-offs, and respond to the effect of climate change on the drinking water supply. To this end, we argue for the need to map peers for inter-organizational bench-learning. We identified five inter-organizational bench-learning strategies and drew implications.

Fluidized bed of pre-flocculated particles prompted contact flocculation and enmeshment which lowered the residual turbidity for PFBC (0.07 ± 0.09 NTU) compared to CC (2.48 ± 1.71 NTU). Fine particles suspended in water clarified from PFBC and CC were hetero-disperse with Zavg as 2,341 nm and 5,693 nm respectively. On average, total residual aluminum was found to be 147 ± 33 ppb and 141 ± 51 ppb, while dissolved residual aluminum was found to be 31 ppb and 59 ppb for PFBC and CC respectively. Average total organic carbon reduction by PFBC and CC was 70.4% and 67.7% respectively. Size, structure and fractal dimensions of flocs were studied and average settling velocity of PFBC flocs was calculated to be 37% higher than CC flocs. Distinctness in characteristics of sludge formed in the two reactors has been highlighted by means of SEM micrographs and FT-IR spectra.</jats:p>",

Due to the high disturbance and degradation that occurs as a result of mining on Indigenous lands, mine restoration and closure (MR&amp;C) must mobilize the political agency of Indigenous Australians and provide enduring benefits beyond the life‐of‐mine. Here, we demonstrate that Indigenous engagements with mining restoration supply chains in Australia can only succeed if institutionalized socio‐environmental inequalities are recognized and dismantled. Through environmental justice lenses, we examine critical mine restoration injustices and how Indigenous Australian participation can energize environmental self‐determination. We analyze emerging restoration supply chains through the native seed collection and production activities as opportunities for nurturing transformative local collaborations, Indigenous entrepreneurship, and political participation. Our analysis shows the potential for community practices to coproduce MR&amp;C through enduring partnerships, Indigenous‐led organizations, and plural knowledge systems. Indigenous Australian leadership in coordinating investments, collaborations, techniques, and business operations is critical to transforming MR&amp;C into democratic and equitable plans and actions on Indigenous lands where mining operates. When aligned with progressive institutional changes, restoration interventions can potentially strengthen environmental self‐determination for Indigenous Australian political control over the customary use and stewardship of their lands.</jats:p>",

To better understand the consequences of this effect, the responses of the leaf water relations and nitrogen (N) use efficiency of barley and tomato plants to elevated CO2 (e[CO2], 800 ppm) combined with progressive drought stress at two levels of N supply (N1, 0.5 g N pot−1 and N2, 1.0 g N pot−1) were studied. The plants were grown in two separate phytotrons at ambient CO2 (a[CO2], 400 ppm) and e[CO2], respectively. The leaf physiological parameters as well as carbon (C) and N concentrations were determined; plant growth, water and N use efficiencies were evaluated. The results showed that e[CO2] increased photosynthesis and water use efficiency (WUE) while decreased specific leaf area (SLA) in both species, whereas N supply level differentially influenced WUE in barley and tomato plants. The abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure during progressive soil drying varied between the two species where the stomatal conductance (gs) of barley plants was more sensitive to leaf ABA than tomato plants, though CO2 environment did not affect the response in both species. Compared to a[CO2], e[CO2] reduced plant transpiration rate (Tplant) in barley but not in tomato. e[CO2] increased the leaf C:N ratio ([C:N]leaf) in plants by enhancing leaf C concentration ([C]leaf) in barley and by dilution of leaf N concentration ([N]leaf) in tomato, respectively, but N2 substantially decreased [C:N]leaf, and thus, N treatment was the dominant factor controlling [C:N]leaf. Collectively, appropriate N supply may modulate the acclimation of plants to e[CO2] and soil water deficits. This study provides some novel insights into N management of different plant species for adapting to future drier and CO2-enriched environment.</jats:p>"

The competitive environment and customer perception have shifted in favour of an ecological mentality. As a result, green supplier selection (GSS) has emerged as a critical problem. The challenge of green supplier selection striving for agility, durability, ecological sensitivity, leanness, and sustainability is tackled in this paper. In terms of recycling applications, environmental applications, carbon footprint, and water consumption, the environmental parameters evaluated in GSS and traditional supplier selection differ. Because of the form of the problem, a resolution is defined, which comprises an algorithm entrenched in the spherical linear Diophantine fuzzy sets (SLDFSs) Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique. Before discussing the approach of the SLDF model, some background information on SLDF sets is provided. To assure the uniqueness of this robust extension, different operations on SLDFSs are described, along with some concise interpretations to help the reader comprehend these ideas. A robust TOPSIS approach has been utilized in the issue of GSS by taking into consideration the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique particularly useful in several areas, like analyzing and choosing traditional and environmental conventionalities. Due to linguistic criteria and the inability to assess all criteria, the fuzzy technique must be used with the TOPSIS method to lessen the consequences of instability and ambiguity. The spherical linear Diophantine fuzzy TOPSIS approach is employed, as it simplifies the evaluation of decision-makers and criteria. The hybrid technique resulting from integrating the SLDFS and TOPSIS is extremely successful in selecting which provider is more suited among the alternatives established on the criteria set by the order of significance, and this method may also be incorporated into similar issues.</jats:p>",

Dalam perancangan, digunakan data iklim yang terdiri dari data bulanan curah hujan, suhu rata-rata, kecepatan angin rata-rata, lama penyinaran matahari, dan kelembapan relatif 10 tahun terakhir (2011-2020). Pendugaan evapotranspirasi dilakukan pula dengan metode Hargreaves dengan menggunakan data iklim harian. Hasil studi menujukkan bahwa kekurangan air irigasi pada puncak musim kemarau sebanyak 4.20 mm/hari atau setara 24.47 m3/hari. Kebutuhan air irigasi tertinggi untuk mencukupi kebutuhan evapotranspirasi dan perkolasi sebanyak 46.09 m3/hari pada bulan September. Kapasitas reservoir yang dirancang sebesar 12 m3. Reservoir ini berdimensi dengan panjang 3 m, lebar 2 m dan tinggi 2 m yang dilengkapi dengan pipa inlet dan outlet dengan diameter 3 inches dan 2 inches.</jats:p>"

In our country one of the promising systems for monitoring and diagnostics is Transformer Diagnostics Monitor. The authors have considered the algorithm of this monitoring system and the possibility of its application in digital substations (DSs). Implementation of Transformer Diagnostics Monitor in the automatic control system of a substation prevents electrical equipment from failing, reducing the economic damage from power shortage.</jats:p>",

In a novel contribution to the literature, this study adopts the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to examine the technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions for adopting blockchain technology in supply chains. This represents a departure from prior studies which have adopted the technology acceptance model (TAM), technology readiness index (TRI), theory of planned behavior (TPB), united theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models. Data was collected through a survey of 525 supply chain management professionals in India. The research model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results show that all the eleven TOE constructs, including relative advantage, trust, compatibility, security, firm’s IT resources, higher authority support, firm size, monetary resources, rivalry pressure, business partner pressure, and regulatory pressure, had a significant influence on the decision of blockchain technology adoption in Indian supply chains. The findings of this study reveal that the role of blockchain technology adoption in supply chains may significantly improve firm performance improving transparency, trust and security for stakeholders within the supply chain. Further, this research framework contributes to the theoretical advancement of the existing body of knowledge in blockchain technology adoption studies.</jats:p>",

This paper is intended to get a better understanding of the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in understanding green supply chain and recommending strategies for improving this role. Based on the qualitative appraoch and a purposive sample of 60 respondents, data were collected using in-depth interview, focus group discussion, indirect observation and analysis of  secondary data. Data were analysed based on the thematic analysis strategy through the aid of MAXQDA 10 software. Findings of the study revealed that, manufacturing companies faced a number of challenges towards implementing green supply chain. At the green sourcing and purchasing level, the company was confronted with lack of sustainable practices in the organization vision and mission, poor commitment by top management to source environmental friendly materials and high operational costs. Moroever, challenges related to green manufacturing were lack of knowledge by the staff on environmental practices and impacts as well as lack of demand for green manufactured products due to their expensive nature. Challenges related to green transportation and distribution included irregular transportation by the vehicles, poor maintenance of the vehicles and poor infrastructures. Finally, challenges related to green disposal and reverse logistics were lack of information sharing between the firms and suppliers, inadequate legal enforcement by the government specifically to protect environment, shortage of equipment, lack of knowledge of the workers about disposal processess and also manufacturing companies failure to control customers after selling the products. Hence, to improve this situation, we recommend that; to improve green sourcing, use of modernized machines and provision of relevant traing. For the green transportation, manufacturing companies are required to conduct maintanance fot motor vehicles, making consolidation of materials so as to reduce number of trips per day. Finally, to improve green disposal, manufacturing companies are required to establish the program of waste collection from the residential areas as well as purchasing disposal equipment so as to avoid costs of outsourcing</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, efficient planning and designing of such systems are extremely complex due to the intermittency of renewable sources. Many existing studies fail to capture the stochasticity and/or avoid detailed reliability analysis. This research proposes a practical stochastic multi-objective optimization tool for optimally laying out and sizing the components of a grid-linked system to optimize system power at a low cost. A comparative analysis of four state-of-the-art algorithms using the hypervolume measure, execution time, and nonparametric statistical analysis revealed that the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) was more promising, despite its significantly longer execution time. According to the NSGA-III calculations, given solar irradiance and energy profiles, the household would need to install a 5.5 (kWh) solar panel tilted at 26.3° and orientated at 0.52° to produce 65.6 (kWh) of power. The best battery size needed to store enough excess power to improve reliability was 2.3 (kWh). The cost for the design was $73520. In comparison, the stochastic technique allows for the construction of a grid-linked system that is far more cost-effective and reliable.</jats:p>",

When the collectors’ investment cost-efficiency is high, the manufacturer prefers to share its information with only one collector.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In supply chain literature, production coordination and vehicle routing have received a lot of attention. Even though all functions in the supply chain are interrelated, they are normally handled independently. This disconnected approach might lead to less-than-ideal outcomes. Increasing total efficiency by integrating manufacturing and delivery scheduling processes is popular. This study focuses on synchronic production–distribution scheduling difficulties, particularly permutation flow shop scheduling in production and sequence-dependent setup time (SDST) and vehicle routing alternatives in distribution. To create a cost-effective distribution among the placement of geographically separated clients and hence to minimize delivery costs, batch delivery to customers employing a succession of homogenized capacity limitation vehicles is examined here. However, this might result in the failure to complete multiple client orders before their deadlines, raising the cost of lateness. As a result, the goal of this study is to lower the overall cost of tardiness and batch distribution in the supply chain. To accomplish so, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed, and the model is solved using a suggested genetic algorithm (GA). Because there is no established benchmark for this issue, a set of genuine problem scenarios is created in order to assess the proposed GA in a viable and difficult environment. Ruiz's benchmark data, which is derived from Taillard's benchmark cases of permutation flow shops, was supplemented with SDSTs in the production of test examples. In comparison to an exact method, the results show that the proposed GA can rapidly seek solutions to optimality for most small-sized instances. Furthermore, for medium and large-scale cases, the proposed GA continues to work well and produces solutions in a fair amount of time in comparison to GA without the local search.</jats:p>",

The Pleistocene fraction of groundwater exceeds 50% in 7 eastern aquifers that are predominately confined.

Then, the optimal oxygen excess ratio (OER) parameters under different load currents are obtained, and the optimal OER parameters are also used as the OER control reference for the designed algorithms. In addition, a 2-ADRC algorithm is designed and proposed to make the actual OER parameters close to the optimal OER in real time. Furthermore, compared with PID and MPC algorithms, the 2-ADRC algorithm can comprehensively consider the two parameters of mass flow and pressure ratio to make the compressor work in the high-efficiency zone and improve the net power and efficiency of the PEMFC system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an indispensable role in China’s national economic system, and they can play a critical role in promoting economic growth and full employment. The main reason for the disruption and impediment to the development of SME clusters is that the enterprises in the clusters are experiencing a “capital shortage,” as a result of the double contradiction between the clusters’ financial benefits and the difficulties in financing. Grey theory is a relatively new concept in the field of information processing. It proposes theories and methods for processing and analyzing incomplete information systems using mathematical methods. This study uses finance in supply chain as a new research perspective to investigate the effectiveness of finance in supply chain in resolving SMEs’ financing problems using the Grey theory model, with the goal of resolving SMEs’ financing problems. When comparing the results of the Grey theory model and the regression analysis model, the relative error of the Grey theory model is on average 12.2% lower than that of the regression analysis model, indicating that the Grey theory model greatly improves accuracy. As a result, using the Grey theory model to solve supply chain financing and SMEs’ difficulties can share risks, share credit, reduce transaction costs, weaken information asymmetry, and achieve mutual benefits and a win-win situation. It is expected to promote the development of the finance in supply chain model, mobilise enterprise enthusiasm for using finance in supply chain, improve finance in supply chain operational efficiency, and promote finance in supply chain development.</jats:p>",

Previous research either focuses on the technology aspect or the optimization of a supply chain; there is little specific guidance on how banks can form a holistic model to evaluate their Fintech strategy for supply chain finance. By using an integrated approach, this study adopted the decision- making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and several analytical methods to construct a hybrid decision model for banks. We concluded four plausible Fintech strategies from previous research and highlighted the advantages of the blockchain-based strategy. We used a domestic bank in Taiwan as a case study during the evaluation phase and implemented crisp and confidence-based fuzzy assessments. The result indicates that the blockchain-based leading strategy would be ideal for this bank. The hybrid decision model also unveils the complicated relationships among those evaluation factors, which sheds light on banks pursuing their innovation in financial services. The findings contribute to banks developing their Fintech-based supply chain financing business, and the supply chain participants may also benefit from securing efficient loans to expedite their operations.</jats:p>"

Because of the large budget allotted to raw materials, supplier selection is a critical issue for the industry’s financial status. The right supplier in the industry drastically reduces problems throughout the supply chain. The several managers of a company were interviewed, and the most essential criteria considered by the managers when choosing their supplier firms were identified. In this study, Fuzzy-AHP and goal programming are combined to identify suitable suppliers and allocate orders in the supply chain. The mathematical models developed the goals of minimizing periodic budget, minimizing defect rate, maximizing the total value of purchase, and maximizing demand. To reach the desired values of periodic goals, the multiobjective multi-integer linear programming model is presented. A mathematical example is offered to show the effectiveness of suggested method. The Archimedean goal programming method is used to solve these multiple periods of single products within the Lingo 18.0 software package. Multiple period demand allocations to suppliers are calculated as X11 = 9000, X12 = 7800, X13 = 7900, X21 = 3434.9, X22 = 5098, X23 = 6002.56, X31 = 100, X32 = 100, and X33 = 100. All the target values of budget, defective rate, and demand are achieved for all periods except the total values of purchasing. The results are subjected to sensitivity analysis. It will help a manufacturer for selecting a suitable supplier to allocate the order for maximizing the profit, improving the quality of product, enhancing the supplier buyer relationship, strengthening the supply chain, reducing the risk of purchasing decision, and improving customer satisfaction. Therefore, the supply chain is effective to supply the continuity of products.</jats:p>",

A total of 21 semistructured interviews were undertaken with 16 large food and beverage companies operating in Australia, including 11 multinationals. Institutional theory and extended resource‐based view (ERBV) were applied to evaluate the companies' responses to the external pressures that they faced. The lack of a government regulatory and environmental framework was seen as a major barrier, while top management commitment was generally strong across the sample companies and was seen as a key internal driver. In order to develop an effective sustainability strategy, it is important that a company understands the drivers and barriers to sustainability implementation so that the appropriate actions can be taken. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is first time that the drivers and barriers to sustainability of large food and beverage manufacturers have been evaluated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of blockchain and IoT enables promising solutions in decentralized environments in contrast with centralized systems. The blockchain brings forth features such as fault tolerance, security, and transparency of the data in IoT devices. As there is requirement of consensus among the network nodes to agree on a single-state-of-ledger, nonetheless, the extensive computational requirement for the consensus protocol becomes a limitation in resource-constrained IoT devices with limited battery, computation, and communication capabilities. This study proposes an empirical approach on the adoption of blockchain in a supply chain environment. Furthermore, a modified version of the Raft consensus protocol is proposed for use in supply-chain environment on the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger. In Raft consensus protocol, each transaction is directed to the leader node that transmits it to the follower nodes, making the leader node the bottleneck thus inhibiting the scalability and throughput of the system. This also results in high latency for the network. The modified RAFT consensus protocol (mRAFT) is based on the idea of utilizing the idle follower nodes in disseminating the vote requests and log replication messages. A detailed empirical evaluation of the solution built on Hyperledger Caliper is performed to demonstrate the applicability of the system. The improved workload division on the peers boosts the throughput and latency of the system in ordering service that enhances the overall efficiency of the system.</jats:p>",

The goal of the research is to study the influence of the oil supply method on the bearing thermal state and to determine the design factors reducing the bearing temperature. The study was carried out with the use of bearings with diameters of 100320 mm with different design of the oil supply: through oil dispensing grooves in the pads, through oil nozzles in the inter-pad space, using lead-in chamfers for the pads, with oil bypass channels. The tasks posed were solved by using volumetric geometric models with the tools of computational fluid dynamics in the ANSYS CFX package in which differential equations describing the model are solved by the finite element method. The patterns of temperature and pressure distribution over the surface of the lower, most loaded bearing pad were obtained for various options of oil supply and different geometry of bearing pads; values of the bearing load carrying capacity, maximum pressure in the working gap, the oil mass flow through the elements of the oil supply; dependences of the bearing static performance on the distance between the shaft and nozzles. Oil supply through oil dispensing grooves made in pads is a factor that negatively affects the bearing thermal state, which is associated with so-called locking of the working gap. It is shown that implementation of oil supply through the space between the pads is more efficient. The use of a lead-in chamfer with plain inserts simplifies oil supply to the working gap. The design solutions described make it possible to reduce the maximum oil temperature in the bearing by 36 degrees Celsius.</jats:p>"

In this regard, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Institution Fuzzy Delphi (IFD) are employed to extract the relevant and prominent KPIs. After, a hybrid Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) and Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) have been applied to illustrate a conceptual framework for the CSC performance management of the healthcare sector in the emerging economy of Iran. As a result, eight critical indicators emanated from the SLR-IFD approach. Furthermore, sixteen relationships amongst the performance indicators were identified via hybrid FCM-FDEMATEL. Inventory availability, information availability, innovation, and technology were selected as the most influential indicators. Besides, changing the information technology category, including information availability and Innovation and technology, had the most impact on the performance of the entire CSC. This study attempts to evaluate hospitals’ circular supply chain performance, by designing the circular evaluation framework. Hospital managers can use the results of this research to improve their internal circular supply chain performances in the intensive care units by understanding the different scenarios.</jats:p>"

Then, an advance purchase discount (APD) contract and an option contract are applied to coordinate the supply chain. Moreover, an innovative prepayment-based option (PBO) contract is designed based on an APD contract and an option contract. We discuss the cash flow, the inventory risk allocation and the impacts of carbon emission tax under each contract. It is found that considering improving cash flow, preselling (or option selling) as a means of supporting the manufacturer with sufficient cash flow will help expand production and invest in greening technology. From the perspective of avoiding inventory risk, the APD contract benefits the manufacturer while the option contract benefits the retailer. However, the PBO contract generates intermediate allocations of inventory risk between manufacturer and retailer.</jats:p>"

Salgın, tedarik zincirindeki firmaların sosyal sıkıntılar yaşamasına da neden olmasına rağmen, sosyal boyutların çok az makalede doğrudan çalışıldığı belirlenmiştir. Diğer yandan, salgın lojistik sektörünün önemini belirgin hale getirmiş, özellikle kargo ve üçüncü taraf lojistik şirketler hazırlıksız yakalandıkları salgında olağanüstü performans sergilemek zorunda kalmıştır. Buna rağmen, anahtar kelimelerinde COVID 19 geçen makalelerde lojistik faaliyetlere ve kargo hizmetlerine yönelik çalışmaya rastlanmamıştır. Bu kapsamda, salgının kargo hizmetleri ve 3PL şirketlere etkileri hakkında araştırma boşluklarının bulunduğu tespit edilmiştir.</jats:p>"

The empirical analysis has been carried out by administering an online questionnaire to 273 consumers within a hypothetical context. A multiple price list has been provided in order to measure the price premium for 1 kg of oranges transported by EVs comparing with the ones transported by traditional vehicles. A Tobit regression model has been used for the data analysis in order to identify the most influential factors affecting the consumers’ WTP. Results suggest that consumers’ WTP is mainly influenced by environmental attitudes, knowledge and possibility of engaging in responsible purchasing, and the approval of friends and relatives (social norms). This study delivers insights into support both farmers’ choice to invest in EVs and policymakers to develop policies promoting this transition process. The main limitations of this study are related to the use of a random sample of respondents and to the social desirability bias linked to self-reported questions. </jats:p>",

In order to improve the classification and identification of compound-voltage sag sources when the distribution network contains harmonics, the author proposes a new method for the classification and identification of compound-voltage sag sources based on the eigenvalue synthesis method. Among them, according to the different voltage sag waveform characteristics caused by different composite voltage sag sources, the three-phase voltage unbalance is defined, and the result is obtained by combining the compound-voltage sag source including single-phase grounding with the voltage sag source compounded by induction motor startup and transformer input. After experiments and research, the proposed method is verified by simulation experiments, the results show that the method can classify and identify the types and fault sequences of the compound-voltage sag sources well, and the identification accuracy rate is higher than 96%.</jats:p>",

A coupled runoff prediction model based on the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is proposed to address the non-linear and seasonal features of runoff data. The GSA has a significant local optimisation capability, while the SARIMA model allows for real-time adjustment of the model using historical data and is suitable for analysing time series with seasonal variations. Consequently, the GSA-SARIMA model was developed and applied to the runoff prediction of the Xianyang section of the Wei River. The results suggest that the GSA-SARIMA model achieves a linear correlation coefficient of 0.9351, a Nash efficiency coefficient of 0.91, a mean relative error of 6.57 and a root mean square error of 0.21. All of the evaluation indicators of this model outperform the other models developed, and its application to actual runoff prediction is feasible, which creates a new path for runoff prediction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Mann-Kendall trend test is applied to ascertain the separation point between the training and prediction datasets.

To improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government embarked on the large‐scale “Thousands of Villages” (ToV) program in 2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between rural nanostores and the ToV program's certified consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores' adoption of the ToV procurement system was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of nanostore owners, the ToV's CPG suppliers, and the government. We then collected interview data. In <jats:italic>Period 1</jats:italic> (2013–2014), when the technology was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner's trust in the ToV's CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners to use the ToV procurement system. In <jats:italic>Period 2</jats:italic> (2018–2019), three contextual factors emerged—population demographic shift, improved technology infrastructure, and trust in new [non‐ToV] purchasing platforms—each hindering the ToV procurement system's use. We observed strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering associated training (<jats:italic>Period 1</jats:italic>), to also providing credibility to competing non‐ToV procurement platforms (<jats:italic>Period 2</jats:italic>). Collectively, the findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases unfamiliar with advanced IT.</jats:p>",

Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies. The outcomes of this research can be helpful for industry owners to predict the expected technological innovation level of their system by investing a certain budget in green investment, eco-friendly design and customer collaborations in their enterprises.</jats:p>",

Information sharing can improve supply chain performance. A probabilistic demand system with one seller and one buyer studied by scholars can find that compared with the traditional decentralized system, the quantity coordination strategy can improve the performance of the supply chain. However, supply chain members are reluctant to provide private cost information because their customers may abuse this information, which will seriously affect their psychological security of privacy protection. The application of secure multiparty computing (SMC) is a possible way to solve these problems. SMC provides a framework for computing partners to make decisions to achieve global goals while protecting the privacy of any party's private information. Only a few literatures have discussed the application of SMC in supply chain collaboration. When applying SMC protocol to the joint ordering strategy with quantity discount under Probabilistic demand, the inventory problem has not been studied. Especially in terms of the actual indicators of emotional labor and work stress, no research has been carried out.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Subjects and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Firstly, we analyze the optimal order quantity under Probabilistic demand, the optimal joint order quantity under Probabilistic demand, profit distribution and quantity discount design. Then, based on the SMC protocol, a joint ordering strategy under Probabilistic demand is proposed, and the corresponding privacy protection quantity discount of the joint ordering strategy without intermediary is given. In this regard, we give the numerical simulation of joint ordering and the numerical simulation of privacy protection joint ordering strategy and its quantity discount design. Last, Using the revised Lin Shangping's “organization's emotional labor burden scale” and “Minnesota Satisfaction Scale (MSQ), the study distributed 200 questionnaires to the subjects and recovered 196. The sample structure distribution is that men account for 51.7%, the lowest proportion under the age of 25 (2.5%), and the highest proportion over the age of 36 (62.6%) The proportion is the highest, accounting for 64.0%. In terms of service years, the proportion of 1-3 years is the lowest, accounting for 4.4%, and the proportion of more than 7 years is the highest, accounting for 84.2%. The total correlation coefficient and total reliability of the modified items were analyzed to delete the items without internal consistency in the questionnaire, so as to improve the reliability of the questionnaire and the quality of measurement tools.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The privacy protection joint ordering strategy based on the probabilistic demand of SMC protocol can be implemented under the condition of any private (cost and capacity) information retention, which can be realized without mediation. The numerical simulation results of joint ordering show that joint ordering can reduce the total cost of supply chain. Through quantity discount design, the cost of each participant in the supply chain can be reduced to varying degrees. In terms of emotional labor, it has a positive and significant impact on job satisfaction, because appropriate emotional labor helps to reduce work pressure and naturally improve psychological safety.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>SMC protocol gives the privacy protection joint ordering strategy under Probabilistic demand, and determines the privacy protection quantity discount of the joint ordering strategy under Probabilistic demand. The numerical simulation results of joint ordering show that joint ordering can reduce the total cost of supply chain. Through quantity discount design, the cost of each participant in the supply chain can be reduced to varying degrees. The above privacy protection agreement can be realized without the help of intermediaries. The buyer and the seller can obtain the optimal joint order quantity while protecting their own privacy information, which helps to improve the psychological security of supply chain members, and realize efficient operation and win-win of the supply chain. In the future, we will consider the existence of more buyers or multi-layer supply chain structure, and deduce the corresponding privacy protection algorithm.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Acknowledgements</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supported by a project grant from Zhejiang Philosophy and Social Sciences Foundation (Grant No.19NDJC145YB), and a project grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71203161), and a project grant from National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 17BGL132).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The company \"Rifar\" is a domestic manufacturer of a new series of bimetallic and aluminum sector radiators of high quality. Production of bimetallic heating radiators is carried out using a hydraulic press. For the least adhesion of the alloy to the molds walls (especially when casting aluminum) the lubrication of the molds with a separating lubricant is used to reduce the wear of molds and refills on the blanks. Currently, the lubrication of the molds is used. Separating lubricant for the molds is taken from the individual intermediate tank standing near each foundry complex. In this case, the lubricant is filled once, and it is used throughout the shift. After that, the tank with the help of forklifts is sent to refueling. To increase the operational reliability and ease of maintenance of foundry complexes, it is proposed to replace the individual supply of separating lubricant to the molds of foundry complexes with a centralized supply system. As a result of development of a system for the centralized supply of separating lubricant to casting complexes molds, it was possible to simplify the lubricant supply scheme, to reduce fuel costs and maintenance complexity. Replacing the individual supply of the separating lubricant to the molds of the casting complexes with the centralized supply system improves the reliability of separating lubricant supply to such complexes molds. Calculations showed that implementation of design solutions does not require large capital expenditures, and as a result of the implementation of the proposed measures, the production cost will decrease by 0.02 %; the payback period of the proposed investment project does not exceed 1 month.</jats:p>"

A long-term (19 year) rice-wheat system experiment was examined to find out the best nutrient management practices (BNMP) through recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS), soil test crop response (STCR), farmyard manure (FYM), along with the inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea). Seven nutrient management practices were applied in combination of organic and chemical fertilizer in the rice-wheat system.

The results showed a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher contribution to phosphorus availability by Residual-P followed by NaHCO3-Po &gt; NaOH-Pi &gt; NaOH-Po &gt; HCl-P &gt; NaHCO3-Pi &gt; available P and lowest in WSP under different long-term management options in rice-wheat system after completing 19 crop cycles. Variations in soil P-fractions with depth were compared to different treatment combination, and a considerable increase in all the major P-fractions was noticed. The continuous application of various IPNS options as organic farming (OF), RDF, STCR, and the inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea) significantly improved all P fractions in the soil system and offered an added benefit in terms of sustainability of production and soil health compared to the solo application of chemical fertilizers. Overall, results showed that IPNS options (berseem and cowpea) showed its superiority over the rest of the treatment. This study suggests that the inclusion of pulses would increase P-availability in soil system.</jats:p>"

However, for many of these firms, it is difficult to translate this strategic aim into fruitful operational decisions. They need to address many deep uncertainties and dynamic complexities in their supply chain system, which make their transition towards CLSC management challenging. This article aims to develop a better understanding of how supply chain actors taking steps towards CLSC management could be supported to reach higher levels of maturity in dealing with deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity. This is investigated in a single, facilitated, embedded case study: a future-oriented decision-making process regarding the use of timber with four real-world actors in the construction industry. The process is structured and supported with analyses, following a methodology based on the capability maturity approach. In this empirical context, the selected approach is shown to have positive effects on clarifying the potential impact of transitions to CLSC management. Furthermore, it stimulates important learning processes during the transition, and as such supports actors to achieve higher levels of maturity and to take further steps towards CLSC management. In this context, a conceptual distinction is made between ‘situational maturity’ and ‘mental maturity’, which enriches double-loop learning theory in the context of transitions.</jats:p>",

This paper provides insights into the heated debate on the global supply chain by examining the competitive manufacturing environments of China, Japan, and South Korea. More specifically, we conduct a cross‐national survey and empirically investigate the manufacturing strategies employed by manufacturing managers in the top Asian players: China, Japan, and South Korea. We examine four dimensions of the manufacturing strategies: quality, inventory, flexibility, and top management involvement. Our findings indicate that Japanese manufacturers are more committed to the cumulative approach to quality management and see enhanced flexibility as a strategic priority. While Chinese managers are also committed to achieving quality, they are more delivery‐driven and thus are more likely to occasionally accept slightly off‐quality components from suppliers to “save” an order. However, in all three countries, managers with a high focus on quality also focus on just‐in‐time management and in turn, on flexibility. There is significantly less agreement among Chinese managers, compared to their Japanese and Korean counterparts, that the top management should be involved in operational planning, goal setting, and the provision of rewards.</jats:p>",

Salvage options allow for inventory reductions and incur fixed cost and variable revenues. We first analyze the tactical problem of determining an optimal procurement strategy under given capacity profiles at the two suppliers. We then address the strategic model in which optimal capacity profiles, both static and dynamically adjusted, are obtained based on two‐part capacity contracts. We characterize the structure of optimal procurement strategies when the lead times of the two suppliers differ by a single period and the lead time for salvage opportunities matches that of one of the suppliers. For general lead time combinations, we show that the optimal procurement strategies satisfy monotonicity and limited sensitivity properties, and construct effective heuristics and upper and lower bounds based on our structural results. </jats:p>",

A new round of information technology revolution, represented by the Internet, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation mobile communications (5G), is driving profound changes in the automotive industry. Smart vehicles (also known as intelligent connected vehicles) that integrate many high-tech technologies to provide safer, more convenient, and low-carbon comprehensive travel solutions have become an inevitable form of future vehicles. This paper constructs a three-level supply chain consisting of high-performance chip suppliers, smart car manufacturers, and retailers. On the basis of considering the level of product innovation and sales effort, Stackelberg game method is used to study the influence of each player in the supply chain on each parameter and the profit of each player under three scenarios: centralized decision making, nonsharing of innovation cost, and sharing of innovation cost. The results show that: when the level of sales effort has nothing to do with the level of innovation, the level of product innovation and the total profit of the supply chain increase with the improvement of the retailer’s sales ability; when the level of sales effort is related to the level of innovation, the level of product innovation under the cost-sharing decision model is greater than the case of no cost sharing, but the total profit of the supply chain is less than the case of no cost sharing.</jats:p>",

However, under different institutional environments, the impact mechanism of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services is still unclear. Based on China’s interprovincial panel data from 2011 to 2019, this paper constructs a threshold effect model, sets the institutional environment as the threshold variable, and empirically analyzes the impact of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services. The results show that the difference in regional institutional environment will lead to the obvious threshold effect of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services: When the institutional environment is poor, the role of Internet development on the supply efficiency of government public services is not significant. With the improvement of the institutional environment, the role of Internet development in promoting the supply efficiency of government public services gradually appears, but the marginal intensity of promotion weakens. Compared with existing studies that mostly use linear models, this paper incorporates the institutional environment into the complex relationship between Internet development and government public service supply efficiency, and clarifies the role of the institutional environment in the process of Internet development affecting government public service supply efficiency and the non-linear relationship among the three. This paper reveals the mechanism of Internet development affecting the supply efficiency of government public services under different institutional environments and provides a new perspective for solving the shortage of public services.</jats:p>"

It also explores the moderating role of inter-functional integration. We have collected the data from the 308 supply chain managers of pharmaceutical firms in Pakistan and questionnaires were used for data collection with multi-item scales already developed and validated. The findings suggest that knowledge management capacities significantly influence a firm's competitive advantage or supply chain agility. The supply chain agility fully mediates between absorptive capacity, transformative capacity, and firm competitive advantage. Further, supply chain agility partially mediates between inventive capacity and firm competitive advantage. Meanwhile, inter-functional integration moderates the relationship between supply chain agility and firm competitive advantage, with their positive relationship strengthening when inter-functional integration is high. The study provides empirical evidence that knowledge management capacities (such as absorptive capacity, transformative capacity, and inventive capacity), supply chain agility, and inter-functional can be important factors in improving firm performance.</jats:p>"

As an intermediate between the retailer and the bank, the supplier provides a credit guarantee for the retailer. Two credit guarantee schemes are proposed, guarantee for quality and guarantee for both quality and sales (GQS). The partners' optimal decisions under different schemes are derived via Stackelberg game. As a critical influential factor to determine the financing cost, the loan interest rate is carefully examined with respect to its effect on the strategies of both partners. Furthermore, the influence of loss aversion on the participants' decisions is examined. Based on the theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the following conclusions are drawn. First, the retailer's optimal order quantity is independent of the supplier's decision on the technology level, whereas the supplier's optimal decision is affected by the retailer's order size. Second, financing is not always attractive to the retailer, and is adopted only with a reasonably lower loan interest rate. Third, the GQS scheme is a win–win strategy for the supply chain if the loan interest rate is relatively high. Finally, the loss‐averse strategy is more robust for the retailer when the demand is volatile and unpredictable.</jats:p>",

This study takes the marine supply chain composed of Maersk and ports in 17 coastal cities in China as decision-making units (DMUs). It then chooses indicators from the three dimensions of economy, environment and society to evaluate the sustainable efficiency of the marine supply chain, Maersk and ports. In order to deal with the uncertain variables of the sustainability evaluation index, this study develops an uncertain network DEA model based on the uncertainty theory, and the computable equivalent form and proof are also provided. In addition, this study divides the decentralized marine supply chain into two modes, i.e., Maersk as leader and the port as leader, and it calculates their sustainable efficiency, respectively. These results suggest that the sustainable performance of ports is superior to that of Maersk, and the sustainable performance of the marine supply chain is better under the lead of ports, but most of the sustainable efficiencies of marine supply chains are inefficient. Therefore, ports should act as a catalyst for the development of the marine supply chain, and the management implications and suggestions for the economic, environmental, and social dimensions are also outlined at the conclusion.</jats:p>"

The arc energy, lifetime and maximum current are measured by the up-to-date power source and the proposed arc simulation circuit at various output inductance values. The experimental data are compared with the simulation results. The paper presents a brief model description for the arc parameter calculations. According to the experimental data, the decrease in the output inductance leads to the increase in the peak current, arc lifetime and energy. It is shown that the energy recuperation stored in the output inductance allows reducing the arc energy. Also, self-locking of control transistor occurs at a lower value (∼1 µH) of the output inductance, leading to the reduction in the current amplitude and the additional decrease in the arc energy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the industry environment becomes more competitive, the supply chain management for multi items has become an essential part of the industries. In this paper, a multi-echelon inventory model for deteriorating multi items with imperfect production has been developed under the environment of fuzzy and inflation. A single producer, multi-supplier, and multi-retailer are considered from the integrated point of view. Here, the producer only produces the retailer’s need to have a tremendous advantage and minimum loss. It is observed that the inflation rate is almost uncertain for deteriorating goods in every supply chain. In this paper, the inflation rate is taken as a triangular fuzzy number, and the centroid method is used to defuzzify the profit function. The shortage is not allowed in any part, an imperfect production process is considered, but it is not reworkable in this supply chain. Different inflation rates are considered for additional items because inflation has strained the most vulnerable consumers (the daily wage earners), who mainly demand goods in short and small quantities. This entire model is developed based on the retailer’s demand and due to which, the profit potential is maximized. The central premise of this study is to get maximum benefit by creating a production model for deterioration items. Finally, a numerical example and sensitivity analysis illustrate the present study. It is observed that if the number of shipments taken from the supplier increases during the production period, the total profit increases in crisp and fuzzy. If a positive change occurs in the number of shipments received through the producer to the retailer, then the fuzzy model has positive, but a slight negative change occurs in the crisp model. This paper shows the effect of a joint replenishment policy for multi-item compared with the independent approaches.</jats:p>",

Compared with the return service level, the perceived quality of online reviews has a greater impact on the overall profit of the supply chain. Under the dual influence of the perceived quality of online reviews and the level of return service, the supply chain profit in the centralized model is better than that in the decentralized model.

The most important societal challenges in which Dutch drinking water companies want to invest are found in in (a) cooperation in the underground, (b) customer satisfaction, (c) water quantity and quality and (d) future-proofing of the distribution network. For the research program this indicates that knowledge needs to be expanded in three directions: (1) water quality and temperature of the drinking water in the distribution network, (2) justified decisions on maintenance and replacements and (3) transition toward strategic network design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The increased frequency and severe consequences of risks in the cruise industry have attracted increasing attention from both academics and practitioners, especially after the 2012 ‘Costa Concordia’ disaster and the 2020 coronavirus outbreak on the ‘Diamond Princess’. Although the literature on risk studies associated with the cruise industry and supply-chain risk management is growing, the extant literature lacks a study to view risks in the cruise industry associated with the supply chain. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing the literature on risks related to the cruise industry and general supply-chain risks to create a framework of cruise supply-chain risks. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted to validate the identified risks and explore potential undiscovered risks. A novel risk typology of the cruise supply chain was then built based on the literature review and the empirical study. This includes macro risks, safety, security, and health risks, information risks, and supply risks. This framework can be applied for the purpose of systematically identifying the risks and their impacts on the cruise supply chain. This paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive cruise supply-chain risk classification with a detailed explanation of each risk in the cruise supply chain, which can be used by stakeholders in the cruise industry to identify and measure the impact of each risk. Additionally, this paper provides avenues for future research by scholars interested in assessing and managing cruise supply-chain risks. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a case study of designing a services for orthopedic and dental prostheses production. To this end, the competitive environment, the aggregating factor and logistic costs, tariffs and tax incentives, regional demand, political factors, the value of currency, and the demand uncertainty are analyzed. The results indicate that the adopted framework for network design decisions effectively allows the analysis of regional facility configuration. It also suggests that there are no hindering factors to the implementation of a 3D printing service company. In the region studied, there are fiscal incentives of more than 60% for taxes on the movement of goods between municipalities, which can be an advantage when locating facilities outside the capital. Competitors are well qualified, but there is room for new companies focused on quality and price, which may be a case for specialized products such as protheses. The estimated demand ranges from 146 to 509 units per month, which may be an opportunity for a new entrant given the few additive manufacturing ventures identified in the region.</jats:p>"

First, the impact of COVID-19 is much larger for non-essential workers than for essential workers. Although female non-essential workers are more affected than male non-essential workers, on average, women and men are equally affected, because more women than men are essential workers. Second, the impact for partnered essential workers with young children, both men and women, is not larger than for others. Third, single-parent essential workers respond with relatively large reductions in labour supply, suggesting emergency childcare was insufficient for them. Overall, labour demand effects appear larger than labour supply effects.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to analyse how these water supply public works, which maintain their original use, have also taken on new functions through the conversion of some of their parts and added new values to the existing ones. In order to do this, an inventory was drawn up with the location and cultural value of each structure based on its historic, technological, landscape and symbolic features, as well as its use. The results establish the significance of the overall system, not only in functional terms but also as a cultural resource. It is essential to understand the historic water supply infrastructure as a whole, not just as individual components but rather as pieces of a network. This is also essential for the management and preservation of the system, both where the structures are still in use as part of the water supply and where they have been converted for other uses.</jats:p>"

However, the body of research on curriculum planning process using analytical methods is still small. Additionally, prior research focused on planning of an individual curriculum or making study plan for students. Curriculum planning at the program level is an under-researched topic. A robust model has not been constructed to address curriculum selection and credit allocation problems simultaneously. To help educational leaders make the most appropriate curriculum plan corresponding to their goals with the highest level of utility achieved, this study presents a new decision support framework with integrated approach. In the proposed framework, based on the competency weights derived from the analytical hierarchy process method, the importance of each potential curriculum is evaluated using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. An exploratory estimation is made to calculate the contribution values of competency development by each curriculum taught at different levels. Finally, multichoice goal programming with utility function determines the curriculum to be provided and corresponding credits to minimize the aggregate deviations from predefined goals with multiple aspirations. An application to curriculum planning of an undergraduate supply chain management program is presented to validate the flexibility and practicality of the proposed approach. The implications of the study are not restricted to curriculum planning of supply chain management program.</jats:p>",

Relative sea-level (RSL) change and sediment supply can play a significant role in driving environmental change. This study examines the relative influence of these drivers during the Holocene. Biostratigraphic records and RSL data are presented from two locations in the inner portion and upper reaches of the macrotidal Humber Estuary, eastern England. The results provide a new terrestrial limiting point and six sea-level index points, two of which at c. 1500 cal years BP provide the youngest sea-level index points for the inner estuary. An early-mid Holocene tidal lagoon system, that lacks modern equivalent, is recorded at one site. The results indicate a shift in the dominance of RSL rise driving the early Holocene creation of wetlands, to sediment supply dominating changes in the mid-late Holocene against the backdrop of a reduced rate of RSL rise, with a submergence of wetlands evident after c. 4000 cal years BP. The persistence of fen carr evident between c. 6800 and 5500 cal years BP suggests stability and resilience of the peatland system to continuing RSL rise. As rates of contemporary RSL rise increase, combined with climate and human impacts on the landscape, the drivers of change in these type of estuary systems will shift, with the records providing analogues of potential system responses that can help inform coastal management strategies. </jats:p>",

Water footprint is an effective tool to analyze the problems of water and food security. The study analyzed the food production and consumption water footprint of 12 major products from the points of spatial, temporal and structure, including plant-based food and animal food. From 2001 to 2019, the production and consumption water footprint presented an upward trend and almost a three-fold difference between the two. In terms of spatial pattern, the high values were mainly concentrated in eastern China. The water stress level and water footprint of food production basically coincided. However, there seemed to be no significant correlation with water footprint of food consumption. Referring to the great variation in water structure, green water was the dominant not only in food production, but also in consumption. For food structure, grain production and consumption contributed the most to the overall water footprint. Finally, the study put forward suggestions for sustainable food production and consumption. The research is helpful to realize green and efficient water management in the food production process and rational consumption, ensuring food and water security.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS The water footprint of food production and consumption of 12 major foods is explored from three aspects: spatial-temporal differences, water resources structure and food structure. There was a three-fold difference between the water footprint of food production and consumption. Green water accounted for the highest proportion of food production and consumption. Food and vegetable production and food and meat consumption had a high water footprint.</jats:p>",

It is becoming more and more difficult for companies to control their own raw material supply, production, and sales by relying only on their own strength, and this is the key to influencing a company to become bigger and stronger. This problem will be efficiently solved by the implementation of “Internet of Things + Blockchain” technology. As a result, research into a new sort of smart supply chain management based on “Internet of Things + Blockchain” is required. From the perspective of building a smart supply chain, this paper makes full use of literature data methods, theoretical analysis methods, case analysis methods, logic analysis methods, and other methods. To study the effectiveness of IoT and blockchain technology through case study of changes in the order quantity in the procurement link of the supply chain. By understanding the current status of related research at home and abroad, as well as the Internet of Things technology and blockchain technology, this paper analyzes China. The main problems existing in the supply chain management of enterprises are the combination of the Internet of Things technology and the blockchain with the enterprise supply chain to create a smart supply chain platform, and the feasibility and functional efficiency of the smart supply chain platform. The related check was found, its deficiencies were found, and remedial measures were taken. The research results show that this intelligent supply chain management platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain can make the operation of the entire supply chain clearly visible. Information and data sharing can be achieved among the various departments of the supply chain to achieve scientific management and precision of the enterprise prediction. And this model can also be used in other industries to achieve industrial upgrading.</jats:p>",

We discuss the equilibrium decisions of the manufacturer and the platform when the platform serves as two different roles. We find that when the total production quantity of the manufacturer who with an online marketplace channel exceeds a threshold, the manufacturer tends to choose the platform’s marketplace role for the online channel, unless the wholesale price and the upper limit of demand are high. When production quantity is below this threshold, unless the wholesale price and the upper limit of demand are low, the manufacturer tends to choose the platform’s reseller role for the online channel. The platform tends to choose the role whose production quantity exceeds the threshold. If both are exceeded, the platform chooses the marketplace role when the wholesale price is low, and if both are not exceeded, the marketplace role is better when the wholesale price is high. </jats:p>",

Further mechanism analyses reveal that both financial condition deterioration and interest conflicts contribute to adverse policy effects. These two factors negatively impact the credit quality of mandatory firms and then weaken credit quality after the mandate subsequently undermines suppliers' willingness to lend. Additionally, the negative association between mandatory CSR disclosure and trade credit is mainly concentrated on highly policy‐exposed corporates, that is, state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) and high‐polluting firms. Our work innovatively evaluates CSR effects from the perspective of suppliers, which provides a new insight into CSR management along the supply chain for academics and practitioners.</jats:p>",

ABSTRACT The battle of intermittent water supply posed a tough challenge by jointly considering a problem related to analysis, design and operation of water distribution networks (WDNs). A methodology is needed which could summon all the inefficiencies of the existing network on a single platform to achieve the different stated objectives (Indicators) under some technical and financial constraints. The main targets are: (1) reduction in losses by repairing leaks, and/or replacing pipes, (2) to increase consumer satisfaction by meeting the demands at required pressure. A multi-stage methodology is proposed to suggest a solution to the given problem. Initially, demand nodes are clustered to form District Metering Area (DMA) by considering the locations of existing valves using the methodology of Sharma et al. (2022, Accepted for publication). The methodology of Sharma et al. (2022) consists of identification of clusters and their boundaries by considering the location of existing valves. The boundaries optimization is solved using Genetic Algorithm (GA) with customer satisfaction as a constraint to identify permanent boundaries. Out of the several ways of improving the network performance in desired 5-year periods with limited budget in each year, the leak detection and repair, pipe replacement with same or higher size, and valve installation to reduce excess pressure are proposed to be targeted primarily. A fast greedy algorithm, similar to that used by Gupta and Bhave (1996) for design of WDN and Agrawal et al. (2007) for strengthening and expansion of WDN, is proposed to be used. The iterative methodology will start with existing network. Benefits in terms of improvements in both head and outflows at demand nodes due to change in any option will be calculated along with increase in cost for that option. All the options will be considered one by one. Out of several options at any stage few best will be selected. The iterative process of selection for any year will be repeated till the available fund for that year are exhausted.  Final solution for the first year will become, initial solution for the next year. Solution for all the five years will be obtained. Finally, the performance of network would be assessed using suggested parameters and the results will be reported.  Gupta R. and Bhave P.R.

Vor dem Hintergrund der Berichte der Internationalen Arbeitsorganisation (ILO) wird zunächst dargestellt, wie die Lücke zwischen formaler Standardsetzung einerseits und der Einhaltung der Regeln in der Praxis andererseits in der derzeitigen sozialwissenschaftlichen Literatur interpretiert wird. Zudem werden anhand der privaten Zulieferaudits und der öffentlichen Arbeitsinspektion einzelne Befunde betrachtet, die Hinweise auf besondere Beiträge der Arbeitswissenschaft zur Thematik geben können. Der Beitrag schließt mit Überlegungen, wie die Arbeitswissenschaft die Internationalisierung ihrer Forschung ausdehnen kann, um in der Debatte um die Durchsetzung globaler Arbeitsstandards – etwa durch das Lieferkettengesetz – Gehör zu finden.</jats:p>",

We investigate and compare three operation policies under the CS agreement, covering continuous and intermittent production manners and shipments of equal and unequal batch sizes. For each operation policy, we develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming model to jointly optimize the production sequence of two classes of cores, production cycle length, shipment frequency, and shipment batch sizes, with the objective of minimizing the cost rate. By analyzing the respective decisions and conducting an extensive numerical study with various scenarios, we explore the advantages and applications of each operation policy.

Recovering the groundwater storage capacity while ensuring the safety of the existing land use is essential for groundwater management. To simulate the groundwater response to different recharge schemes, and to determine the optimal recharge strategy that has the maximum amount of water recharged into the aquifers under specific constraints, an optimization framework, which integrates a 3D transient groundwater flow model with a genetic algorithm (GA), was realized in a Python programming environment in this study. The optimization results show that the optimal amount of water recharged into aquifers is 5.36 × 109 m3 from January 2020 to December 2029, and the upper river reaches are the main recharge area, accounting for 67.58% of the total. Compared with constant recharge, optimal results indicate that the total amount of water recharged into aquifers will increase without exceeding the upper limits of the groundwater levels. However, as groundwater exploitation reduces (18.44%), the river's optimal amount of water recharged also decreases (17.23%). Therefore, the developed model can identify the optimal groundwater recharge strategy and eventually facilitate decision-making in the case of EWR.</jats:p>",

We establish manufacturer-led game models and compare the equilibrium results of green R&amp;D strategies. The study found that three types of green product R&amp;D strategies exist in competitive supply chains: neither conduct green product R&amp;D (NN), only one supply chain conducts green product R&amp;D (YN), and both conduct green product R&amp;D (YY). Price competition intensity and green R&amp;D cost have a negative impact on prices, green levels, and enterprise profits. Wholesale prices, retail prices, green levels, and enterprise profits are highest in YY strategy, but they are lowest in NN strategy. When one supply chain does not conduct green product R&amp;D, the other supply chain will choose green product R&amp;D only if the green R&amp;D cost meets certain condition. When one supply chain conducts green product R&amp;D, the optimal choice for the other supply chain is always to conduct green product R&amp;D. For the optimal selection strategies, applying two-part pricing contracts achieve supply chain coordination.

A current major issue in the industry is to strive for sustainable development focuses on three aspects, social, environmental, and economical. The use of technology, especially concrete material technology, is one of the supporting factors to achieve the goal. Concrete material usage, with cement as the main component, is quite prominent in the industry, supported by Indonesia’s top 12th cement producer globally with a 2,05% contribution of the world’s total cement production. However, the industry performance in each part of Indonesia also needs to be observed, considering that Indonesia has numerous islands. This study aims to evaluate the landscape of technological development of construction material regarding the supply-demand from geographical dimensions. This supply-demand analysis can consider policy strategies to support sustainable development programs. The data used in this study are derived from the production and consumption aspects of concrete material with an economic approach. The study shows the relationship between the development of concrete construction technology in terms of supply and market conditions.

The success factors and bottlenecks of each short food supply chain operation and their current value propositions were identified. From the inventory, those innovations were selected for each short food chain case study which can be applied to eliminate or reduce the bottlenecks or enhance the success factors leading to new, upgraded value propositions with increased added value for the consumers.

In addition, the companies often have neither a sufficiently well-maintained database of the water network nor geoinformation systems (GIS), simulation software or data analysis tools that can be used to plan and optimise interventions in the drinking water system (e.g. expansion of the network). Large water suppliers are often better equipped technically, but the data is often not used in an efficient manner.The objective of the W-Net 4.0 research project (www.wnet40.de) was to develop a modular and scalable platform that combines GIS, simulation software and data analysis tools and meets high IT security standards. Combined with novel service concepts, value-added networks and training concepts, also small and medium-sized water utilities will be enabled to use these technologies. The high degree of usability and accessibility of the platform supports the daily work of planning engineers, and network operators. The paper includes a detailed description of the platform and use cases. It also emphasizes the training program tailored for small and medium sized utilities.</jats:p>"

Such misstatements could affect the decisions about carbon emission transfers in the supply chain. To optimize carbon emission transfers among supply chain enterprises, this study formulates a supplier-led Stackelberg game model incorporating the government’s initial carbon emission allowances and fines. The study also examines the mechanism of the behaviors of enterprises in low-carbon supply chains, the proportions of initial quotas, the impact of government fines on carbon transfers, and the influence of the supply chain and carbon emission transfers on related supply chain decisions and profits. The main findings are as follows. First, the proportion of the government’s initial quota has a positive effect on the carbon emission transfer quantity of the supplier, while government fines and misstatement factors have a negative effect. Second, the carbon emissions of the unit product of the supplier decrease as the under-reporting factor and carbon emission transfer quantity of the supplier increase. The under-reporting factor has a stronger effect on the carbon emissions of the unit product. Third, in a carbon-free market, carbon emission transfers negatively affect the disclosed profits of the supply chain, whereas in a perfect carbon market, the carbon trading price has a certain endogenous regulation mechanism for the suppliers’ operational decisions. Fourth, the supplier’s wholesale price order quantity is negatively correlated with the supplier’s carbon emission transfer quantity, but positively correlated with the initial carbon quota ratio.</jats:p>"

However, recent studies have found that lactate may be a mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on brain health. Lactate plays a dual role as an energy supply substrate and a signaling molecule in this process. On the one hand, astrocytes can uptake circulating glucose or degrade glycogen for glycolysis to produce lactate, which is released into the extracellular space. Neurons can uptake extracellular lactate as an important supplement to their energy metabolism substrates, to meet the demand for large amounts of energy when synaptic activity is enhanced. Thus, synaptic activity and energy transfer show tight metabolic coupling. On the other hand, lactate acts as a signaling molecule to activate downstream signaling transduction pathways by specific receptors, inducing the expression of immediate early genes and cerebral angiogenesis. Moderate to high-intensity exercise not only increases lactate production and accumulation in muscle and blood but also promotes the uptake of skeletal muscle-derived lactate by the brain and enhances aerobic glycolysis to increase brain-derived lactate production. Furthermore, exercise regulates the expression or activity of transporters and enzymes involved in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle to maintain the efficiency of this process; exercise also activates lactate receptor HCAR1, thus affecting brain plasticity. Rethinking the role of lactate in cognitive function and the regulatory effect of exercise is the main focus and highlights of the review. This may enrich the theoretical basis of lactate-related to promote brain health during exercise, and provide new perspectives for promoting a healthy aging strategy.</jats:p>",

Fraud detection and prevention require an in‐depth understanding of food supply chains and their vulnerabilities and risks so that food business operators, regulators, and other stakeholders can implement practical countermeasures. An analysis of historical criminality within a sector, product, or country is an important component and has not yet been conducted for the seafood sector. This study examines reported seafood fraud incidents from the European Union's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, Decernis's Food Fraud Database, HorizonScan, and LexisNexis databases between January 01, 2010 and December 31, 2020. Illegal or unauthorized veterinary residues were found to be the most significant issue of concern, with most reports originating from farmed seafood in Vietnam, China, and India. For internationally traded goods, border inspections revealed a significant frequency of reports with fraudulent or insufficient documentation, indicating that deceptive practices are picked up at import or export but are occurring further down the supply chain. Practices such as species adulteration (excluding veterinary residues), species substitution, fishery substitution, catch method fraud, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing were less prevalent in the databases than evidenced in the scientific literature. The analysis demonstrates significant differences in outcomes depending on source and underlines a requirement for a standardized and rigorous dataset through which food fraud can be scrutinized to ensure enforcement, as well as industry and research resources are directed accurately.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p><jats:bold>Practical Application</jats:bold>: Levels of historic food fraud in a product, sector, supply chain node or geographic location provide an indication of historic criminality, the methods used and the location of reported frauds.

Although there are numerous policy frameworks and systems to ensure that the management of the public procurement processes are fair, equitable, transparent, and cost-effective; the public procurement management practice, particularly in the delivery of construction goods and services, remains vulnerable to mismanagement and irregularities. To this extent, the nature of the irregularities and the stages at which they occur in the public procurement system remains unclear. To address this gap of knowledge, a content analysis method and the associated techniques of in-Vivo coding and word frequency analysis were used for the analysis of the secondary data. The study revealed that poor and or non-performance were the most frequent irregularities in the procurement of public construction services.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network’s supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems’ constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In increasingly complex, volatile and global supply and distribution markets, the sustainable management of the supply chain and its associated processes is, and will be more so in the future, a key element of competitiveness. In this sustainable field, the packaging design actively contributes to this competitive improvement of companies and supply chains, which has generated different theoretical approaches, among which the “Sustainable Packaging Logistics” (SPL) concept stands out. Within the framework of the development of this concept, different authors have identified the potential to address different actions, among which the packaging standardization of formats and qualities outlines. Therefore, this article proposes and justifies a methodology for the standardization of the packaging system from an efficiency and sustainability perspective, based on the redesign of secondary packaging (boxes). The reason for this approach is not only because secondary packaging is the link with the other two levels of the system (primary and tertiary), but it is also less limited at the level of commercial restrictions (typical of primary packaging) or logistics (typical of tertiary packaging).Thus, the authors have developed a methodology for the rationalization of secondary packaging composed of four stages that are distributed in a similar way to a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle. In order to build new alternatives to the initial packaging system from a perspective of standardization of boxes, it is necessary to propose analysis strategies that allow to justifiably reduce the number of initial formats from which one starts. In the methodological proposal, this strategy involves establishing volumetric groups similar in dimensions and qualities. To establish these groups, the boxes are sorted by volumes from highest to lowest, associating to each of them the number of expected units of consumption in the period of analysis; the boxes with less consumption are tried to integrate in another box with similar volumetry. The products with a higher level of sales are tried to assign highly efficient boxes at the productive and logistical level. At the same time, the potential impact on primary and tertiary packaging of this reassignment is identified, comparing the associated KPIs.Likewise, the application of this methodology is illustrated with the development of a case study in the food sector that adopts the “Action Research” approach. After the application of the methodology in the company, it can be seen how the impact on the different pillars of sustainability is reduced thanks to the elimination of the most inefficient boxes and the standardization of the most suitable ones. In the same way, the operability of the packaging system also improves substantially due to the reduction of packaging references. This article is considered to be of interest at an academic and business level because it delves into the standardization and integration of the combined packaging-product-supply chain system as a means of deploying the SPL approach. These results contribute to advance in unexplored lines of research, and help organizations to improve their logistics processes in a sustainable way.</jats:p>"

Various method exists for coastal aquifer vulnerability mapping and the one most commonly used is GALDIT because of its simplicity. The present study modified the original GALDIT ratings and weights using Shannon’s entropy theory to study the seasonal vulnerability of coastal aquifer in the coastal region of Benin, West Africa. Thus, the monthly GALDIT index for the study region was computed using 5 years of (2015–2019) average data of GALDIT dynamic input parameters. The original and modified GALDIT approaches were validated using total dissolved solid (TDS) concentration. Pearson’s correlation and Spearman coefficient correlations were calculated, and generally the modification of the GALDIT parameters’ relative weight using entropy has improved the method as this gave a better correlation with TDS concentration (0.739). From the calculated monthly GALDIT index, the most vulnerable period was identified using TOPSIS method. Based on TOPSIS results, the coastal aquifer of Benin is more vulnerable to seawater intrusion in February due to the decrease of groundwater level in that period and less vulnerable in July. The performed sensitivity analysis showed that height of groundwater level above the mean sea level, distance from shore, and thickness of the saturated aquifer have the most influence in vulnerability to SWI assessment in the study area.</jats:p>"

As a result, adopting the RSC will cause challenges in the low-carbon supply chain. In this paper, to calculate the value of the revenue distribution parameter, a decision method based on multiple index is put forward. First, we construct an index system of revenue distribution based on the viewpoints of cost, efficiency, and satisfaction. Second, we propose the third-party participation (TPP) mechanism and the group analytic hierarchy process (GAHP) decision-making approach according to the premise that “heteronomy is better than self-discipline.” By the use of the case of company “A,” we demonstrated the applicability and practicability of the decision-making approach. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we surveyed 22 experts and set up the 43 indexes, while also constructing the analytical hierarchy process matrix and explaining each index in depth. Second, the TPP mechanism and the GAHP method are used to calculate the value of each index and their sensitivity to the decision-making by the software of Yaahp12.0. Overall, this research can help the decision-makers of low-carbon supply chain in determining the ratio of revenue distribution and improving the applicability of revenue sharing contract.</jats:p>",

Most physically active people do not meet the body’s needs in terms of micronutrients through diet. The novelty of the present manuscript is the use of an innovative dietary approach to supply micronutrients to physically active people through biofortified food. Therefore, the key point of this study was to verify whether supplementation with biofortified vegetables—and specifically molybdenum (Mo)-enriched lettuce—in healthy volunteers affects essential regulators of body homeostasis and, specifically, hematological parameters, iron and lipid metabolism, and hepatic function. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were allocated in a double-blinded manner to either a control group that consumed lettuce, or the intervention group, which consumed Mo-enriched lettuce, for 12 days. Blood samples were collected at baseline (T0) and after 12 days (T1). We found that supplementation with Mo-enriched lettuce did not affect hematological parameters, liver function, or lipid metabolism, but significantly improved iron homeostasis by increasing non-binding hemoglobin iron by about 37% and transferrin saturation by about 42%, while proteins of iron metabolism (e.g., transferrin, ferritin, ceruloplasmin) were not affected. The serum molybdenum concentration increased by about 42%. In conclusion, this study shows that consumption of Mo-biofortified lettuce ameliorates iron homeostasis in healthy subjects, and suggests that it could be used as a new nutritional supplementation strategy to avoid iron deficiency in physically active people.</jats:p>"

Although free healthcare has been decreed since 1973 to overcome the financial obstacles, and despite the efforts of successive governments to dismantle the geographical obstacles, unfortunately, the organizational obstacles have not found effective and lasting solutions until now; the majority of experts have pointed out this type of obstacle since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article highlights the growth of national and international scientific research; on the conditions that can improve the quality of health care provision. Nevertheless, current work barely addresses organizational shortcomings, particularly in the unique context of a health system that provides free health care. Through an analysis of the Algerian context, this article proposes avenues of research for the organizational obstacles that can hinder the performance of the health care system, which can constitute future empirical studies. The results of the study indicate that there is a great disparity between the regions ranging from the North to the South of the country in terms of health coverage (hospital beds, specialized care, medical personnel, etc.); a flagrant lack of operational medical equipment, and a shortage of medicines for hospital use; despite the good results recorded over the past three decades, expenditure continues to increase steadily; the private sector does not play its role as a complement to the public sector, it improvises as best it can to provide less risky lucrative care; and the application of obsolete legislation that governs a sick hospital.</jats:p>",

This takes into consideration implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The equilibrium decisions are obtained and the impacts of CSR on the price, service level, consumer surplus, profit, and utility of the LSSC are discussed. A newly designed two-part pricing contract ensures implementation of CSR. We demonstrate that (1) under DCDMM, improvement of the functional provider’s CSR has more positive effects on the level of service, market demand, consumer surplus, overall profit, and utility of the LSSC than the same level of CSR for an integrator. (2) An increase of one member’s CSR upgrades the profit of the other members but damages its own profits. Therefore, LSSC members’ final profits will depend on the influence of CSR on both sides. (3) There is an optimal total critical CSR value for an integrator and functional provider. If the sum of both CSR values exceeds this, the profit under CDMM will be less than that under DCDMM, and LSSC members need not implement contract coordination.

Crowdsourcing systems based on mobile computing seem to address the bottlenecks faced by machine learning due to their unique advantages; i.e., crowdsourcing can make professional and nonprofessional participate in the collection and annotation process, which can greatly improve the quantity of the training dataset. Additionally, distributed blockchain technology can be embedded into crowdsourcing systems to make it transparent, secure, traceable, and decentralized. Moreover, truth discovery algorithm can improve the accuracy of annotation. Reasonable incentive mechanism will attract many workers to provide plenty of dataset.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The management of all business operations, from suppliers to customers, is known as supply chain management. According to experts from the Supply Chain Management Council, supply chain management is the coordination of planning with the management of other operations including procurement, sourcing, and logistics management. The various channel managers' cooperation and partnership are key supply chain components (Ramanathan, 2014). These managers may also collaborate with suppliers, customers, middlemen, and service providers. The management of supply and demand, as well as their market projection, is a component of supply chain management's incremental activities (Fliedner, 2003; Ireland &amp; Bruce, 2000). Modern supply chains are focused on efficient consumer response (ECR) (Ireland &amp; Bruce, 2000). A crucial component of reaction efficient consumer response (ECR) is the focus of modern supply chains (Ireland &amp; Bruce, 2000). An important element of the response of efficient consumers is collaboration between suppliers and retailers. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), Point of sale systems (POS), and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) are the tools modern technology has made available to support the collaboration between retailers (Buyers) and manufacturers (suppliers). Under the implementation of such a developed supply chain structure and a clear understanding of the business practices. With the strategic units, a collaborative plan in the organization gets developed. The supply chain process is redefined to reduce the level of inventory, and lead timing, and improved responses towards deviation of customers’ demand. To establish effective collaboration these factors must be implemented effectively and are the subject of research for this project. In developed countries, the pressure to be highly competitive and efficient has helped in promoting collaboration between retailers and their suppliers. The advent of similar business culture and availability of technology is likely to promote a high degree of similar collaboration in Pakistan too (Sunil, 2010). This research project proposes to investigate the factors that are going to influence a successful collaboration program in Pakistan. We propose to explore the determinants of a successful collaborative effort and the likely success of a program such as a Supply chain management offering in the healthcare sector implemented in Pakistan.</jats:p>",

The need for advanced flood decision support tools that aid flood management has been recognized by several authors. This work examines the variability that currently exists across England with regard to the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) data collection and processing strategy in flood emergency events. Expert elicitation was carried out using a tailored questionnaire about UAS deployment in three flood emergency scenarios. The survey highlighted that reduced equipment assembly time, a national network of appropriately qualified UAS pilots and the effective UAS deployment when on-site, can reduce the response time to flood emergency. For improved comparability and reduced bias in data collection and interpretation, clear guidelines on which data products are most beneficial for particular purposes, processing time required, platform and sensor selection may also be necessary. We consider that releasing a comprehensive documentation pack, which includes guidelines, standards and protocols that detail the methods, tools, technology, quantity and quality of data, to UAS pilots on a flood emergency call, will enhance the timely response.</jats:p>",

The morphology, crystal shape, and specific surface area of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and BET-specific surface area analyzer. The results showed that the prepared LDHs/BL composites had good crystal shape, large specific surface area, and suitable pore structure. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption. The results showed that the adsorption conforms to the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. Under the same adsorption conditions, the adsorption capacity of the LDHs/BL complex was higher than that of LDH, the removal efficiency of the former was 92%, and that of the latter was 68%. The adsorption mechanism includes metal precipitation and isomorphic replacement. More importantly, this study provides a green method to prepare LDHs. LDHs/BL composites are expected to be used as a new kind of environmental adsorbent for wastewater treatment. This work provides a new idea for the utilization of agricultural and forestry wastes.</jats:p>",

We further investigated the moderating effect of two types of environmental innovation (i.e., voluntary versus compliance environmental innovations). The findings revealed that firms with high levels of environmental investments were more inclined to obtain supply chain financing. This evidence suggests the positive effects of supply chain stakeholders in promoting corporate environmental governance. Moreover, the association could be more or less pronounced for firms with high levels of compliance or voluntary environmental innovation, respectively. Furthermore, channel tests indicated that social responsibility and transaction trust were the primary channels for explaining the above relationships. Finally, the positive relationship between environmental investment and supply chain financing only held for firms located in different cities from the supply chain firms and firms with high social attention. These findings highlight the heterogeneous role of environmental innovation and public governance in alleviating firms' financing constraints.</jats:p>",

The suppliers make efforts to preserve product freshness, while the retailer, with demand forecast information, can share it with none, one or both of the suppliers strategically. By constructing a multistage game model, the optimal demand information sharing strategy in the supply chain is explored. The results show that the retailer has the willingness to disclose demand information only when the freshness elasticity is high. Significantly, with the improvement of the freshness elasticity, the retailer will transform from sharing information with both suppliers to one supplier. The suppliers are always willing to accept the information disclosed by the retailer. However, complete transparency of demand information may hurt the supply chain under certain conditions. To improve the supply chain performance, the retailer can charge both suppliers for information fees and adjust from sharing information with no suppliers to both suppliers with a relatively low freshness elasticity. Conversely, the retailer can change from sharing information with both suppliers to sharing information with one supplier through a charging contract with a relatively high freshness elasticity.</jats:p>",

We describe four datasets developed to evaluate options in U.S. and Canadian beef systems. The datasets delineate three “circular manuresheds,” each encompassing a hay‐grazing landscape where beef cattle are raised on grazingland and supplemented with hay grown nearby, and the distant feedlots where those cattle produce manure nutrients for potential import back to the hayfields. We selected the hay‐grazing landscapes of New Mexico, USA; Florida, USA; and western Canada (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) because of their significant grazingland production and potential to substitute feedlot manure for commercial fertilizer on hayfields. In each circular manureshed, the manure nutrients from major feedlot destinations could supply a considerable proportion of the P used by hay for grazing cattle: 34% of the P requirements in New Mexico, 36% in Florida, and 6% in western Canada. The average distance to return the resource was 647 km for New Mexico, 1,884 km for Florida, and 1,587 km for western Canada. These magnitudes and distances suggest that the New Mexico circular manureshed may be the most economically viable in the current agri‐food system, but this reflects only part of a greater, multi‐factor assessment of tradeoffs. The circular manureshed concept provides a platform for simultaneous consideration of competing factors for sustainability via circularity.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, in view of the influence of reference quality, this paper constructs cost-sharing contracts and two-part tariff contracts to discuss the consistency of the dual-channel supply chain. The results show that consumers’ reference quality effect has a positive impact on the equilibrium price and profit of the dual-channel supply chain. Under normal circumstances, the dual-channel supply chain cannot achieve conformity. However, consistency can be achieved under the two-part tariff contract mechanism.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 5-10 % of the population suffers from waterborne diseases. According to the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being in nine cities of the Siberian Federal District, the influence of water quality on the formation of population morbidity (from 7,7 to 41,0 %) has been established. Analysis of the data presented in the State reports on the state and protection of the environment of the Irkutsk region showed that in the surface waters of the region there is a systematic excess of the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) for phenol, and in some controlled areas for chloroform. One of the main components used in the production of various non-alcoholic products is water. Various organic substances, such as phenols, petroleum products, halogenated derivatives of hydrocarbons, according to the requirements for the quality of water used for the preparation of soft drinks, should be absent. Therefore, the purpose of the study was the use of various adsorption systems for wastewater treatment in the Irkutsk region for drinking water supply and the production of soft drinks. Used the adsorption method. The studies were carried out on model aqueous solutions, both of individual substances and in their joint presence. Mathematical modeling of the sorption process under dynamic conditions has been carried out. As a result of the studies carried out, the possibility of using charcoal for wastewater treatment has been proven. Pretreatment of activated carbon with hydrochloric acid practically does not affect the adsorption of chloroform, but leads to an increase in the adsorption of phenol. Hydrochloric acid helps to remove iron ions from the pores of the sorbents. A decrease in the degree of water purification from phenol with an increase in pH leads to the suppression of adsorption. The effect of phenol and chloroform on the value of adsorption has been established. The sorption process is limited by external mass transfer. The discrepancy between the calculated and experimental output curves of phenol and chloroform sorption from individual solutions and in their joint presence is calculated.</jats:p>"

Our research found that farmers with low-risk aversion prefer to choose the e-commerce financing strategy when the e-commerce’s interest rates are lower.

Cities are also threatened by acute risks arising at the intersection of aging infrastructure, entrenched institutions, and the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events. To better understand these multi-layered, interacting challenges of providing urban water supply for all, while being prepared to deal with recurring shocks, we present an integrated analysis of water supply security in New York City and its resilience to acute shocks and chronic disturbances. We apply a revised version of a recently developed, quantitative framework (‘Capital Portfolio Approach’, CPA) that takes a social-ecological-technological systems perspective to assess urban water supply security as the performance of water services at the household scale. Using the parameters of the CPA as input, we use a coupled systems dynamics model to investigate the dynamics of services in response to shocks—under current conditions and in a scenario of increasing shock occurrence and a loss of system robustness. We find water supply security to be high and current response to shocks to be resilient thanks to past shock experiences. However, we identify a number of risks and vulnerability issues that, if unaddressed, might significantly impact the city’s water services in the mid-term future. Our findings have relevance to cities around the world, and raise questions for research about how security and resilience can and should be maintained in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Governments all over the world usually establish the policy of subsidies to stimulate firms’ technology innovation behaviors. The participating firms may share the high risk of expense through cooperative technology innovation. Different forms of governmental subsidies may have a significant impact on the choice of firms’ cooperative innovation strategies. This paper investigates the effect of government subsidies on firms’ technology innovation strategies. We consider two modes of cooperative technology innovation (technology transfer or joint innovation) in a two-level supply chain including an upstream manufacturer (UM) and a downstream manufacturer (DM) in the presence of two forms of governmental subsidies (a per-unit production subsidy or an innovation subsidy). We find that in the presence of either form of governmental subsidy, technology transfer mode is better off for the UM than joint innovation mode when the UM’s distribution power is greater than a threshold, otherwise joint innovation mode is better off. In the presence of a given form of governmental subsidy, the DM’s response strategy is influenced by the interaction of different values of the proportion of revenue and the fraction of innovation cost. In the presence of a per-unit production subsidy, the social welfare is always more under technology transfer mode than under joint innovation mode, while in the presence of an innovation subsidy, the opposite is true. We also show that under a given cooperative innovation mode, both the UM and DM expect a per-unit production subsidy if the per-unit tax credit is high, and they expect an innovation subsidy if the proportion of governmental subsidy is high. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the theoretical results.</jats:p>",

It has long been hypothesized that the first elongating shoot tissue, the coleoptile, acts as a snorkel to acquire atmospheric oxygen (O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) to initiate the first leaf elongation and seminal root emergence. Here, we obtained direct evidence for this hypothesis by visualizing the spatiotemporal O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> dynamics during submerged germination in rice using a planar O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> optode system. In parallel with the O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> imaging, we tracked the anatomical development of shoot and root tissues in real-time using an automated flatbed scanner. Three hours after the coleoptile tip reached the water surface, O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels around the embryo transiently increased. At this time, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme critical for anaerobic metabolism, was significantly reduced, and the coleorhiza covering the seminal roots in the embryo was broken. Approximately 10 h after the transient burst in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, seminal roots emerged. A transient O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> burst around the embryo was shown to be essential for seminal root emergence during submerged rice germination. The parallel application of a planar O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> optode system and automated scanning system can be a powerful tool for examining how environmental conditions affect germination in rice and other plants.</jats:p>"

Respondents described eighteen varieties of pepper by production zones (12.91%) and colours (19.35%), while 65.59% of the respondents have no idea of the varieties marketed. Most of the pepper sold in the market, generally comes from areas such as Foumbot (25.71%), Bangante (13.33%), Okola (8.57%), Mbouda (6.97%), Mfou (5.71%) and unknown origin (21.9 %). The pepper is taken out of their production areas without any varietal identity, due to negligence on the part of producers, who buy 30% of the seedlings from the market, or extract their own seeds (42.5%) without prior identification of the variety. This leads to the loss of the genetic resource, despite the presence of several marketing structures with several well-known varieties. The lack of proper characterization leads to erosion of the pepper plant genetic resources in Yaounde and its supply areas. Added to this is the lack of interest of sellers, the high price of seeds, and the extraction of seeds from fruits after a production season or the use of seeds from the market.</jats:p>",

The results show that offset price, recovery price, and recovery quantity are positively correlated with the income through their respective channels. The transfer payment price is positively correlated with the revenue of the two channels. Trade-in strategy will increase the offset price, recovery price, and manufacturers’ profits. However, the profits of retailers and e-commerce platforms are affected by the substitutability coefficient between channels and the sensitivity of recovery price. The optimal equilibrium in the supply chain is conducive to integrate waste mobile phone green supply chain, effectively cope with the impact on the global mobile phone manufacturing supply chain, and promote the realization of the “dual carbon” goal.</jats:p>",

A general improvement was recorded in the shoot parameters of the two plants, except for a decrease in the net assimilation rate by treatment of the two plants with 100% potassium nitrate plus 100% urea. The total nitrogen, insoluble protein, and total soluble nitrogen generally decreased in cowpea shoots from the treatments but increased in case of cowpea roots and sunflower shoots and roots. The examination of the ultrastructure changes in cowpea leaves confirmed the presence of two starch granules (in response to 100% potassium nitrate, 100% potassium nitrate plus 100% urea, and the control) and three granules (in response to 50% potassium nitrate plus 50% urea) and the disappearance of the starch granules (in response to 100% urea). Despite the starch granules not being detected in the leaves of the untreated sunflower, the treated plant showed the appearance of the highest number after treatment with 50% potassium nitrate plus 50% urea (2) and the most cell size with the 100% potassium nitrate treatment. Generally, our findings demonstrated that fertilization with 50% potassium nitrate plus 50% urea has the best influence on the growth parameters and nitrogen content in the two plants, but the magnitude of response was more pronounced in case of cowpea plants.</jats:p>"

The enzyme activities increased with increasing residue loading in the 0–15 cm soil depth, but decreased with soil depth. Soil K supply increased with increasing residue loading, but nitrate‐N supply was highest with residue retention. These results demonstrate remarkable resilience of soil microbial functioning under a wide range of crop residue inputs, without adverse effects on enzyme activity attributable to inorganic N fertilizer.

This paper studies the psychology of all participants in the supply chain of community e-commerce platform, so as to establish the value creation mechanism of community e-commerce platform.

It is concluded that the key factors that affect the co-creation of the value of a community-based online store supply chain are the proportion of increased income, the cost of participating in co-creation of value, and the purchasing power of consumers brought by participating with both parties.

Overlying water and sediment samples were obtained in September 2021 during the dry period. In our experiments, we determined the distribution of different forms of P, diffusion flux of P at the interface, as well as P adsorption parameters. The results showed that concentrations of four P species in the sediments followed the order: Ca-P &amp;gt; Fe-P &amp;gt; Acid extracted phosphorus &amp;gt; Alkali extracted phosphorus. The diffusion flux of -P in each reach was positive, showing that sediments were an important P source for the overlying water. The -P content in the interstitial water of sediments was significantly correlated with that in the overlying water. This indicated that P diffused into the overlying water in the form of -P under most circumstances. The adsorption parameters gradually decreased from upstream to downstream. These data indicated that potential for phosphorus release from downstream sediments was higher than that from upstream sediments. This likely occurred because, downstream, a greater artificial disturbance intensity is observed.</jats:p>",

A radon concentration measuring study has been carried out in 62 water samples collected from both natural springs (SW) and tube wells (TW) in the above mentioned area using an AlphaGUARD radon monitor. The measured maximum and minimum radon levels of drinking water samples collected from natural springs are 13.04 Bq/l and 0.43 Bq/l respectively while those for tube wells are 71.02 Bq/l and 1.02 Bq/l respectively. The average radon activities in the two water sources separately and together are 2.88 ± 0.41 and 25.67 ± 3.89 and 10.96 ± 1.97 Bq/l respectively. This study reveals that the average radon concentrations of water samples from both sources in this area are much below the reference level of 100 Bq/l as prescribed by the WHO and EU Commission. The evaluated radon activities are used to determine inhalation, ingestion and then total annual effective dose (AED). The average total AEDs for the two types of water sources separately and together (SW + TW) are 7.86 ± 1.11, 70.07 ± 10.64 and 29.93 ± 5.37 μSv/y respectively. The evaluated average total AEDs for the two types of drinking water sources separately and together are also much below the reference limit of 100 μSv/y prescribed by the above mentioned two agencies. It suggests that the drinking water of this region is radiologically safe so far as water-borne radon hazards are concerned.</jats:p>",

To solve this problem, this paper studies the supply chain risk factors of B2C cross-border e-commerce and puts forward avoidance strategies. First, the fitness network model of a dual local world is constructed by combining the fitness model with the local world model. Then, the fitness network model of the dual local world is verified by the risk dynamics simulation model to fit the actual network situation. On this basis, the SIRS virus transmission model is constructed to simulate the risk transmission of the B2C cross-border e-commerce supply chain, and the evaluation index system of the supply chain risk immunity ability and external risk intensity are established according to the supply chain risk immunity ability and external risk intensity. AHP is used to calculate the factors that have the greatest influence on supply chain risk immunity and external risk intensity. The results show that: from the point of view of the enterprise’s own risk immunity, it is more necessary to ensure the stability of the company’s capital and to establish a perfect risk monitoring and coping mechanism to avoid risks. From the perspective of enterprise external risk intensity, the risk should be avoided from two aspects of transaction security and logistics.</jats:p>"

We found that the failing health does not significantly decrease the elderly's labor supply in rural areas when using both the subjective (self-reported health status) and objective (hypertension diagnosed or not) health indicators. Our finding indicates the phenomenon of “ceaseless toil” for the elderly in rural China, i.e., the elderly almost work their whole life even if they are not physically capable.

Various research and sustainability studies within the construction industry focus on finding economical, social, and environmental balance. Construction professionals, such as Quantity Surveyors, begin their learning journey by studying in colleges and progressing to higher education. As the construction industry evolves through modern techniques, higher education institutions must also follow suit. These modern techniques have arisen due to the shift of ethos towards sustainability. Without the higher education institutions including this new knowledge in their curriculum, future professionals will not be equipped with the correct skills. Few research have been conducted in relation to students’ views on sustainability. Although such research is at a minute level, thus the converse side of the argument is how professional Quantity Surveyors view these topics on sustainability and whether they implement them in their daily duties. Hence, the research explores the differences in understanding between practicing and academic Quantity Surveyors on sustainable development in their various professional duties. The research was conducted using questionnaires that was distributed using survey monkey. The results were analysed through Spearman and ANOVA statistical tests to check their correlations. The study found a difference in the knowledge acquired by practicing and academic Quantity Surveyors. This finding conveys the importance of sustainability knowledge and how it is fundamental in achieving the UN sustainable goals and using such knowledge in practice.</jats:p>"

We propose a general dynamic model to penetrate customer orders by decoupling point with objective to minimize the cost. The closed forms of optimal solutions are obtained for companies to deal with the integrated problem of customer order decoupling point (CODP) decision and production–inventory plan simultaneously. Applications and numerical experiments are performed to illustrate practical insights for managers. The results show that the truth of zero-inventory policy is to avoid unnecessary inventory instead of absolutely no inventory. The CODP will shift forward with the increasing of customer demand rate and shift backward with the increasing of deterioration rate under the production smoothing policy. However, although it encounters the same changes of demand, the CODP moves with a smaller extent in high deterioration rate than in low. In addition, we find that during the growth phase of product life cycle, the increase of time-sensitive degree of demand is coupled with forward shifting of CODP; while during the decline phase, it is coupled with CODP backward shifting. </jats:p>",

The identification of critical areas and ecological security patterns is crucial for balancing ESs and improving human well-being in rapidly urbanized regions. The purpose of this study was to establish a comprehensive assessment framework of ES supply–demand including provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services, so as to provide theoretical support for the identification and refined management of regional critical areas. Taking a typical waterside area in Shanghai metropolitan area as an example, based on multi-source data and ES quantitative models, we used ecological supply–demand ratio and bivariate local indicators of spatial association to quantify the relationship and matching patterns of ES supply–demand, then explored the identification, protection, and restoration of ecologically critical areas at the regional scale. The results showed that: 1) the ES supply–demand relationship in the study area was quantitatively determined. The ecological supply–demand ratio was as follows: regulating &amp;gt; provisioning &amp;gt; supporting &amp;gt; cultural, in which the supply of supporting and cultural services was less than the demand, and the problem of the supply–demand mismatch is prominent; 2) we have identified 41 supply critical areas that require priority protection, with a total area of 206.79 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> accounting for 9.65% of the total study area, showing a spatial pattern of more in the northwest and less in the southeast; 3) a total of 11 demand critical areas that need ecological restoration were identified, accounting for 31.43% of the 35 administrative towns in the study area, which are mainly distributed around three urban centers and a high-tech zone. The study is of great significance for the construction of regional ecological security patterns and rational ES allocation, and can provide a scientific framework for the ecological protection and restoration of critical areas around metropolises in developing countries.</jats:p>"

This study examined the influence of supply chain management practices on marketing performance of Boutiques in Port Harcourt. A quantitative and causal research design was adopted to take on board the four (4) hypotheses formulated for the study. The population of this study consists of eight hundred and eighty-nine (889) registered Boutiques in Port Harcourt, whose authentic list was derived from the Business Directory of the Rivers State Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and sample size of two hundred and sixty-nine (269) was attained with the Krejcie and Morgan table. A self-structured questionnaire designed in the five-point Likert scale was used to obtained primary data from five hundred and thirty-eight (538) respondents (key informants; sales representatives and customer relationship managers), purposely chosen from the selected two hundred and sixty-nine (269) Boutiques, through a cross-sectional survey. The face validity of the questionnaire was established by professionals consisting of scholars and business practitioners with adequate knowledge of the subject matter. The construct and content validity were confirmed from previous researchers who used it, with slight adjustments. The research hypotheses were tested with the simple regression technique with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. The results show that strategic supplier partnership has a very strong, significant and positive influence on customer patronage and brand awareness, and information sharing has a strong, significant and positive influence on customer patronage and brand awareness. The study therefore concludes that supply chain management practices positively and significantly influence marketing performance of Boutiques in Port Harcourt. Therefore, the study recommends that the management of Boutiques in Port Harcourt should scrutinize their supply chain management practices and ensure incessant modernization of strategic supplier partnership and information sharing in order to enhance their marketing performance.</jats:p>",

In the capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, the municipal government is facing a number of difficulties in providing sufficient water in a sustainable manner due to the increasing urban population and the serious pollution of both surface and groundwater resources, but this is also due to a lack of resources to invest in the supply system. This study aimed to investigate water users’ willingness to pay for the improvement of Hanoi’s domestic water supply system. A contingent valuation process based on a survey of 402 respondents was used to explore citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement of their urban water supply. The results show that Hanoi’s urban communities (more than 90%) were generally satisfied with the quantity of their water supply, but tended to be dissatisfied with its quality, with 80% of the respondents using advanced water purifiers before drinking and cooking. Respondents were also concerned about the overall reliability of the service, with 40% of respondents indicating that they received no check and maintenance service. A WTP regression model was developed based on the survey findings. The average WTP is 281,000 dong/household/month (approximately 12.2 USD at the exchange rate of 1 USD to about 23,000 VND), equivalent to 1.4% of the average household income at the end of 2019, indicating the level of affordability of monthly water payments among Hanoi citizens.</jats:p>"

These stakeholders have expertise in policy, consumer behaviour, the tourism sector and regulation. The interviewees represented the views of consumers, producers, and other actors who work with or within short food supply in seven European countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland). Consumers were generally perceived to be aware of the environmental impact of food production. In terms of preferences, consumers would like to shop for local food the way they shop at the supermarket: having variety of products, accessibility, and availability. The relative lack of convenience and high prices associated with short food supply chains products were seen as the major barriers to their purchase. Consumers were thought to buy the products because of health and environmental benefits, a desire to support their local community, and a preference for tradition. However, relatively few consumers purchase products regularly from SFSC. The main segments are people who believe in short food supply chains values, middle class families with young children and elderly people. More can be done to educate and engage consumers regarding these chains, and market research is needed to inform which strategy is likely to be most effective in specific contexts such as the regional level.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted, and grounded theory applied to open coding, main axis coding, and selective coding to form concepts and categories. Trajectory equifinality modeling clarified the evolution logic of digital transformation. Based on the theory of service ecology, a digital health service aging model was constructed from the “macro–medium–micro” stages and includes governance, service, and technology transformation paths. The macro stage relies on organizational elements to promote the institutionalization of management and guide the transformation of governance for value realization, including the construction of three categories: mechanism, indemnification, and decision-making. The meso stage relies on service elements to promote service design and realize service transformation that is suitable for aging design, including the construction of three categories: organization, resources, and processes. The micro stage relies on technical elements to practice experiencing humanization, including the construction of three categories: target, methods, and evaluation. These results deepen the understanding of the main behaviors and roles of macro-organizational, meso-service, and micro-technical elements in digital transformation practice and have positive significance for health administrative agencies to implement action strategies.</jats:p>"

Due to its distributed nature, IoT is vulnerable to various internal attacks. One of these attacks is the packet-dropping attack, which is very harmful. The existing packet-dropping attack detection algorithms are unsuitable for emerging resource-constrained IoT networks. For example, ML-based algorithms always inject numerous packets to obtain the training dataset. However, it is heavyweight for energy-limited nodes to forward these extra packets. In this paper, we propose a lightweight evidence fusion-based detection algorithm (EFDA), which leverages the packet forwarding evidence to identify malicious nodes. Firstly, EFDA finds the sequence numbers of dropped packets and their corresponding source nodes. Then, it traces the routing path of each dropped packet and collects evidence for detection. The evidence stored by nodes around the path record the node’s forwarding behaviors. Finally, the collected evidence is fused to evaluate the trust of nodes. Based on nodes’ trust, the K-means clustering is used to distinguish between malicious nodes and benign nodes. We conduct simulation experiments to compare EFDA with ML-based algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that EFDA can detect the packet-dropping attack without injecting packets and achieve a higher detection accuracy.</jats:p>",

Food quality in terms of taste, freshness and organic status were also taken into account in purchase decisions, and there appears to be a greater focus on health rather than the environmental implications of organic production, although the environmental aspects are also appreciated. Some participants also like the idea of supporting their local community through purchasing from local producers and/or retailers. It was believed that small-scale production and SFSC result in better quality food, but participants had less confidence in the hygiene and food safety standards of SFSC compared to longer chains. Participants thought that consumers would purchase local food if they could more easily access a variety of local food in one place, such as through supermarkets, cooperatives, farm shops and markets, or an online platform that aggregates producers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n            </jats:p>"

We further analyze the internal influences of advertising strategies on network externalities in the extended model. We find that the network externalities are beneficial to the PSC system, but the manufacturer’s fairness concerns are not beneficial to the PSC. The advertising strategies of the network platform are not affected by network externalities and fairness concerns. In the extended model, the manufacturer can obtain more profits, but the network platform yields less profit than the decentralized model without fairness concerns. Moreover, the more sensitive the network externalities are to the change in advertising strategies, the greater the profits for the PSC members.</jats:p>"

The results revealed that (1) the supply–demand relationship in the study area was mainly balanced, followed by relationships in which supply was lower than demand, and the relationships of supply exceeding demand is less, accounting for 68.35%, 26.06%, and 5.59%, respectively. (2) The core of the old urban area and the areas surrounding the old urban area had high supply–demand balance, the transitional and new urban areas had less supply than demand, and the developing urban areas had low supply–demand balance; the supply–demand relationship of amenities followed a clear circular distribution pattern. (3) The Chinese government’s continuous renewal of old urban areas has made the quantitative proportion of supply and demand components be positively correlated with the oldness of urban development, which has enlightening effects on the construction of other cities.

This paper reported the preparation, characterization, in vitro and in vivo antitumor bioactivity of a meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (TCPP)-based therapeutic nanoplatform (CMMFTP) to overcome the limitations of TME. Using Cu2+ as the central ion and TCPP as the ligand, the 2D metal-organic framework Cu-TCPP was synthesized by the solvothermal method, then CMMFTP was prepared by modifying MnO2, folic acid (FA), triphenylphosphine (TPP), and poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) on the surface of Cu-TCPP MOFs. CMMFTP was designed as a self-oxygenating ROS nanoreactor based on the PDT process of TCPP MOFs and the CDT process by Cu(II) and MnO2 components (mainly through Fenton-like reaction). The in vitro assay suggested CMMFTP caused a 96% lethality rate against Hela cells (MTT analysis) in specific response to TME stimulation. Moreover, the Cu(II) and MnO2 in CMMFTP efficiently depleted the glutathione (80%) in tumor cells and consequently amplified ROS levels to improve CDT/PDT effects. The FA-induced tumor targeting and TPP-induced mitochondria targeting further enhanced the antitumor activity. Therefore, the nanoreactor based on dual targeting and self-oxygenation-enhanced ROS mechanism provided a new strategy for cancer therapy.</jats:p>"

Here, we further shifted its reflowering time ahead through proper gibberellin (GA) treatment plus nutrient supply. GA treatment alone initiated bud differentiation, but it aborted later, whereas GA plus nutrient (G + N) treatment completed the opening process 38 days before the control group. Through microstructural observation of bud differentiation and starch grains, we concluded that GA plays a triggering role in flowering induction, whereas the nutriment supply ensured the continuous developing for final opening, and both are necessary. We further determined the expression of five floral induction pathway genes and found that PsSOC1 and PsLFY probably played key integral roles in flowering induction and nutrient supply, respectively. Considering the GA signaling, PsGA2ox may be mainly involved in GA regulation, whereas PsGAI may regulate further flower formation after nutrient application. Furthermore, G + N treatment, but not GA alone, inhibited the expression of PsTPS1, a key restricting enzyme in sugar signaling, at the early stage, indicating that sugar signaling is also involved in this process; in addition, GA treatment induced high expression of PsSnRK1, a major nutrient insufficiency indicator, and the induction of PsHXK1, a rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of sugar signaling substances, further confirmed the nutrient shortage. In short, besides GA application, exogenous nutrient supply is essential to shift tree peony reflowering ahead in autumn under current forcing culture technologies.</jats:p>"

The study found that: (1) the increase in demand attenuation coefficient, green sensitivity coefficient, and big data targeted advertising sensitivity coefficient will be beneficial to the growth of total consumer demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit; (2) supply chain coordination is necessary because greenness, demand, supply chain profit, and environmental benefit under the centralized model are higher than those under two decentralized models; (3) two contracts can achieve the coordination of the green supply chain, and the profits of the manufacturer and online retailer under the contract are greater than those under the decentralized model. The results can provide insights for promoting green supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The stabilizing properties of mineral–organic carbon (OC) interactions have been studied in many soil environments (temperate soils, podzol lateritic soils, and paddy soils). Recently, interest in their role in permafrost regions is increasing as permafrost was identified as a hotspot of change. In thawing ice‐rich permafrost regions, such as the Yedoma domain, 327–466 Gt of frozen OC is buried in deep sediments. Interactions between minerals and OC are important because OC is located very near the mineral matrix. Mineral surfaces and elements could mitigate recent and future greenhouse gas emissions through physical and/or physicochemical protection of OC. The dynamic changes in redox and pH conditions associated with thermokarst lake formation and drainage trigger metal‐oxide dissolution and precipitation, likely influencing OC stabilization and microbial mineralization. However, the influence of thermokarst processes on mineral–OC interactions remains poorly constrained. In this study, we aim to characterize Fe, Mn, Al, and Ca minerals and their potential protective role for OC. Total and selective extractions were used to assess the crystalline and amorphous oxides or complexed metal pools as well as the organic acids found within these pools. We analyzed four sediment cores from an ice‐rich permafrost area in Central Yakutia, which were drilled (i) in undisturbed Yedoma uplands, (ii) beneath a recent lake formed within Yedoma deposits, (iii) in a drained thermokarst lake basin, and (iv) beneath a mature thermokarst lake from the early Holocene period. We find a decrease in the amount of reactive Fe, Mn, Al, and Ca in the deposits on lake formation (promoting reduction reactions), and this was largely balanced by an increase in the amount of reactive metals in the deposits on lake drainage (promoting oxidation reactions). We demonstrate an increase in the metal to C molar ratio on thermokarst process, which may indicate an increase in metal–C bindings and could provide a higher protective role against microbial mineralization of organic matter. Finally, we find that an increase in mineral–OC interactions corresponded to a decrease in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> gas emissions on thermokarst process. Mineral–OC interactions could mitigate greenhouse gas production from permafrost thaw as soon as lake drainage occurs.</jats:p>",

Stakeholder theory was applied to the water resources utilization, and an improved holistic method for determining the eco-environmental flow was proposed. Considering the principles of inflow of tributaries, water intake from key sections, water balance and eco-environmental function regionalization, the new method integrated several methods to determine the water demand for the sub-items of eco-environmental flow. The three-level management targets of eco-environmental flow were proposed based on the opinions of stakeholders. Taking Shaanxi Section of the Wei River as an example, the eco-environmental flow at different levels was given for five key sections. The results show that: (1) the improved holistic method integrates multiple methods and models, making the calculation results of eco-environmental flow more scientific and reasonable; (2) the three-level management targets of eco-environmental flow can adapt to development and change in practical applications, and are operable and dynamic; (3) as a representative of the public benefits of ecosystems, government participates in the discussion of stakeholders and better coordinates competition among stakeholders. The improved method provides a new idea and reference for comprehensively and scientifically promoting reservoir ecological regulation.</jats:p>",

As a result, the availability and supply of a wide range of food raw materials and finished food products are under threat, and global markets have seen recent increases in food prices. Furthermore, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict has adversely affected food supply chains, with significant effects on production, sourcing, manufacturing, processing, logistics, and significant shifts in demand between nations reliant on imports from Ukraine. This paper aims to analyze the impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the effectiveness and responsiveness of the global food supply chains. A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach, including grey literature, was deployed to investigate six key areas of the food supply chains that would be impacted most due to the ongoing war. Findings include solutions and strategies to mitigate supply chain impacts such as alternative food raw materials, suppliers and supply chain partners supported by technological innovations to ensure food safety and quality in warlike situations.</jats:p>"

Based on the characteristic of consumers’ dual preferences for product quality and environmental friendliness, this paper constructs a novel closed-loop supply chain with network externalities for new products and remanufactured products under different waste product recycling channel strategies. It discusses the influence of product recycling channel strategies and network externalities on the optimal decision of the company. By establishing the Stackelberg game model, the analysis found that the retail price of new products and remanufactured products is not affected by network externalities and recycling channel strategies, even if the wholesale price of remanufactured products increases with the influence of network externalities. The changing trend of market demand for new products and remanufactured products is different between products with network externalities and without network externalities. When the cost of remanufactured products is within certain range, the existence of network externalities makes the market demand for new products and remanufactured products increase simultaneously. Our study also found that even if products have positive network externalities that increases consumer utility, when the cost of remanufactured products is outside certain range, the company’s profit will be higher when products have no network externalities than that when products have network externalities.</jats:p>",

The shallow groundwater and surface water in the region around Poyang Lake are replenished by precipitation, but both are more affected by evaporation. The large d-excess value indicated that the groundwater was greatly affected by water–rock interactions.

The government has adopted various measures to reduce carbon emissions from businesses and to make manufacturers responsible for recycling e-waste. In the face of external pressures, more and more companies are implementing sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management to reduce environmental pollution and achieve sustainable development. Therefore, it is essential to study the operational decisions of CLSC enterprises. This paper considers a sustainable CLSC consisting of two competing manufacturers and a dominant retailer. The government imposes a carbon tax on the retailer, and two manufacturers collect used products directly from their customers. We separately examine whether implementing green marketing by the retailer and the collaboration between the two manufacturers can improve their profits. By building decentralized CLSC mathematical models and applying game theory methods, we obtain that green marketing can increase profits for all CLSC members and improve return rates. The collaboration may yield higher total profits for two manufacturers than a decentralized solution, while the retailer’s profits may be lost under certain conditions. Finally, we perform several numerical analyses to find the relationship between unit carbon emission tax and social welfare and gain some managerial insights. The study gives key factors that CLSC companies should consider when making decisions to help them achieve sustainability and provides recommendations for the government to set a reasonable unit carbon tax.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Integer problems are non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard and can be solved in polynomial time. However, the solution to large problems requires an unreasonably long time. This paper highlights the signifi cance of developing and modifying the local search element decomposition method (LSEDCM) for accurately and promptly solving general integer and m-integer problems. The study involves two parts: creating and developing the algorithm by applying the LSEDCM and modifying the LSEDCM, genetic algorithm, and ant system. Results obtained using this algorithm were then compared with the exact and approximated solutions in terms of their accuracy, number of steps, and solution time. It was found that general integer and m-integer problems involving 2–30000 variables could be effectively solved. For the general integer problem, the average difference from the exact solution was 0.37%; it took 91.28% fewer steps and 29.29% less time to solve the problem. The average difference from the approximated solutions for the modifi ed genetic algorithm (MGA) and modifi ed ant system (MAS) was 1.47 and 2.16%, respectively. For an m-integer problem, the average difference from the exact solution was 0.57%; it took 90.60% fewer steps and 49.33% lesser time to solve the problem. The average difference from the approximated solutions for the MGA and MAS was 1.58 and 2.69%, respectively. Compared with approximated solutions, the LSEDCM obtained the best solution for the large problems. It is thus proven that the LSEDCM could be used to solve large integer problems in a shorter time compared with m-integer problems, which are more complex and intrinsically require a longer time to obtain a solution.</jats:p>"

Fixed-bed column adsorption experiments were conducted at different flow rates (5, 7.5, and 10 mL/min) and bed depths (6, 9, and 12 cm) at an initial pH and phosphate concentrations of 5 and 5.5 mg/L, respectively. The breakthrough curve analysis was developed and tabulated for the effects of the flow rate and bed depth. Fixed-bed adsorption models, namely the Thomas model, the Yoon–Nelson model, and Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model were fitted to the experimental data. The R2 values observed for the Thomas model and the Yoon–Nelson model were 0.96 and 0.98, respectively, at the flow rate of 7.5 mL/min and bed depth of 9 cm with the breakthrough adsorption capacity of 5.67 mg/g. The synthesized CSH was also tested for its phosphate removal efficiency using local wastewater treatment plant effluent. About 1,658 mL of real wastewater was treated for 249 min before the standard threshold limit (1 mg/L) was reached. This study prevails that the synthesized CSH could be applied to remove phosphate from real wastewater under a continuous flow adsorption system.</jats:p>",

Some studies did not consider the influence of different crop growth stages and the non-linear effect of the groundwater depth on groundwater use. In this study, three types of formulae for groundwater use were developed by referencing the phreatic evaporation formula without crops. According to the observation data, groundwater depth and use, and wheat evapotranspiration were fitted using these three non-linear formulae in each crop growth stage. The Accelerated Gene Algorithm (AGA) was used to optimize the parameters, and their performance indices were calculated. We observed that groundwater use increased gradually as the decrease in groundwater depth and the increase in wheat evapotranspiration; the correlation coefficients of wheat evapotranspiration and groundwater use were small (such as 0.539, 0.428) in the seedling stage and mature stage and large (such as 0.631, 0.625) in other stages. The performance of the Aviriyanover formula was the best with a correlation coefficient of 0.686 between the simulation and observation; therefore, this formula was recommended to determine groundwater use.</jats:p>",

Despite improvements in water supply, intermittent water supply (IWS) remains prevalent in rural areas. To determine the factors that lead to different water supply modes for villages, we select 38 village-level water utilities covered by the Chinese Safe Drinking Water Project for fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to identify causal configurations (‘pathways’) that lead to IWS or CWS across systems. Six configurations of water supply mode are identified on the basis of the outcomes of each case. Among these, three configurations for adopting CWS are determined. Configuration 1 features water utility with government subsidy and bills using a water meter. Configuration 2 features water utility with small population coverage, government subsidy, and villager participation in the management. Configuration 3 features a water utility collectively managed and owned by a rich village and water-saving initiatives. Configurations that lack meter-based bills, government subsidies, and water-saving initiatives are the main paths for IWS. Results highlight the uniqueness of the configurational approach in understanding different water supply patterns across various cases and emphasise the importance of government subsidies, villager participation, water-saving programmes, and water meter-based billing to achieve CWS.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the use of direct information about the EMF of a multiphase source as a reference vector of the desired transmission line current does not improve the achieved result of efficiency maximization. A virtual experiment obtained and verified the formula for calculating the efficiency of a multiphase power supply system with an arbitrary load in the form of dependence on load factor and power factor.

In view of the mean concentration in two aquifers, the TA and OA were identified as high sulfate group and low sulfate group. The contrast on hydrochemical characterization and water-rock interactions were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of sulfate enrichment in mine groundwater. Compared with low sulfate groundwater, the high sulfate groundwater possess a higher content of TDS, Na+ and Cl−, which elevated by 3.83, 4.0 and 3.29 times, respectively. The low sulfate groundwater is controlled by Ca-Na-HCO3 type (82%), whereas the high sulfate groundwater is dominated by Na-SO4-HCO3 type (88%). The geochemical process of low sulfate groundwater is influenced by dissolution of carbonate minerals and weak ion exchange. The mechanism of sulfate enrichment in mine groundwater are predominately controlled by both silicate and carbonate minerals weathering, strong ion exchange interaction and competitive effect. The outcomes enhance understanding of the mechanism of high sulfate mine water and provide theoretical support for mine wastewater treatment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS Hydrogeochemistry mechanism contrasts between low and high sulfate in limestone aquifers were studied.
