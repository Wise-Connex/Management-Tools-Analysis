A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the stability of the input coefficients, the output coefficients, and both coefficients. For both models, the effects of a demand pull on the total outputs and on the primary inputs are analytically expressed. Also, the effects of a supply push on the total outputs and on the final outputs are expressed, again for both models. In general, the assumption of fixed input coefficients in the demand-driven model does not hold, but computations are still based on it. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the correctness of the computed total outputs, both for a demand pull and a supply push.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An experiment was conducted using steers cannulated at the rumen, duodenum and ileum to study the effects of increasing the levels of barley and fishmeal in straw-based diets. Diets A, B, C and D contained ammonia-treated straw, barley and fishmeal in the ratios, 67:33:0, 66:23:11, 53:47:0 and 52:36:12 (by weight) and were offered in daily amounts of 3·9, 3·9, 4·8 and 4·8 kg dry matter. The effects of barley were attributable to increased intakes of digestible organic matter and consequently to increased flows of microbial matter to the duodenum. There were no modifications in the balance of energy to nitrogen-yielding nutrients available for absorption. Introducing fishmeal into diets improved digestibility of cellulose and xylose by up to 6.7 and 4.7 % respectively, and shifted digestion towards the large intestine. Second, it increased amino acid N supply to the small intestine which averaged 52·2, 63·2, 68·8 and 84·0 g/d with diets A, B, C and D. Some changes were also noted in the balance of amino acids absorbed. Consequently, the contribution of amino acids to metabolizable energy intake increased with the proportion of fishmeal in diets (0·17, 0·20, 0·18 and 0·21 for diets A, B, C and D).</jats:p><jats:p>Growth rates measured in heifers amounted to 259, 431, 522 and 615 g/d for diets A, B, C and D.

A chopped wheaten hay was offered to the ram lambs (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 24), whose nutrient intake was altered by infusing into the abomasum a liquid supplement, containing reconstituted cow's milk, sodium caseinate, minerals and vitamins, for a period of at least 30 d. Either two or three lambs were allocated by live weight to each of ten rates of nutrient supplementation. The lambs were slaughtered at a target live weight of 31 kg. Voluntary intake of hay was estimated over the last 7 d of feeding. The amounts of digesta and organic matter (OM) in the rumen were measured by emptying after slaughter. The particle size distribution of the digesta was measured by wet sieving and the fractional outflow rate of particulate matter by reference to the marker lignin. Growth rate of the lambs increased linearly as total energy infused increased. The linear increase in growth rate indicated that roughage was not substituted for infused nutrients on a direct energy basis. OM intake from hay declined linearly as the amount of nutrients infused increased. The decline in intake was associated with a decline in both total digesta and the amount of rumen OM. Both the fractional digestion rate of OM and the fractional outflow rate of particulate matter from the rumen were unaffected by the amount of nutrients infused. The results indicated that the rumen digesta load of young sheep fed on a single roughage is directly related to their energy deficit, that is the difference between the capacity of the animals to use energy and the energy available to them for metabolism.</jats:p>",

The distal arteries enter the navicular bone through the nutrient foramen which contains loose connective tissue, nutrient vessels and myelinated nerves. At least 77 per cent of the nutrient foramina contains synovial membrane. Twelve per cent of the arteries in the navicular bone show histological changes.

Based on the clinical and radiological findings the navicular bones of 40 Warmblood horses are divided into four different groups. In the pattern of the arteriogram obvious changes are noticed: an imbalance and a distal to proximal shift between the distal and proximal arterial supply occur, indicating a reduction of the distal blood supply with a compensatory reaction of the proximal, medial and lateral supply. The changes in the pattern of the arteriogram are histologically defined by arterio(lo) sclerosis and newly formed arteries. The presence of radiologically visible nutrient foramina is associated with a changed pattern in the arteriogram, increased bone remodelling and fibrosis. Ischaemia and increased pressure (hypertension and/or increased intra‐articular pressure) are considered to be responsible for changes in form and number of radiologically visible nutrient foramina.</jats:p>",

After 125 days of gestation the blood supply consists of two routes: one situated in the superficial layer of the fibrocartilage and the other similar to the blood supply of the navicular bone of the normal mature horse. After 270 days gestation, the blood vessels in the fibrocartilage gradually regressed and retracted until they have disappeared at six months after birth. At two months after birth the first macroscopic thinning of the fibrocartilage was noticed. From seven months to one year about 45 per cent of the navicular bones showed a slight thinning of the fibrocartilage. A positive correlation was found between radiographic abnormalities (ie enlargement of the nutrient foramina) and the frequency of thinning of the fibrocartilage. Radiographic abnormalities were first recognised 14 days after birth, whereas the arteriogram showed the first changes such as fewer or no arteries entering distally at the distal extremities at 10 weeks after birth. At four weeks after birth the first arterial wall changes were found, ie intimai thickening with or without splitting of the internal elastic membrane. From that age onward, the number of navicular bones with arterial wall changes gradually increased. Starting at five months after birth only 6 to 20 per cent of the arteries in the navicular bones without radiographic abnormalities showed arterial wall changes. However, the navicular bones with radiographic abnormalities showed arterial wall changes in 25 to 80 per cent of the arteries.</jats:p>",

Leaf K concentration increased with increasing N supply up to 100 ppm N, as did leaf Mg after the bloom stage. Leaf Ca decreased with increasing N nutrition but P concentration was unaffected. Lower leaves had higher P concentrations than did the upper leaves. P, Ca and Mg concentrations in the roots at 34 days before bloom (DBB) declined when N supply was increased but K concentration was unaffected. At 10 and 44 days after bloom (DAB) P concentrations in the roots, stem and branches increased with N supply; whereas K, Ca and Mg concentrations did not respond. Concentrations of P in the pods increased with N nutrition up to 100 ppm N but those of K, Ca and Mg in the pods, hull and seeds were unaffected by N nutrition. P concentrations in the hull and in the seeds also increased with N supply. Most of the K and Ca were in the leaves while the least were in the seeds. Most of the P accumulated in the seeds and roots; whereas the hull contained the least. Of the four nutrients analyzed for, P concentrations were generally the lowest in the various plant parts and K concentrations the highest. Ca/Mg ratios for the hull and branches were increased by 100 ppm N and the ratios for the leaves, pods and seeds were unaffected by N nutrition.</jats:p>",

On the basis of previous<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>N‐flux experiments, it is concluded that the differences in V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>at growth limiting R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>are attributable to differences in influx rates. Linear relationships between V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>and tissue nitrogen concentrations were obtained in the growth limiting range for both species, and extrapolated intercepts relate well with the previously defined minimal nitrogen concentrations for plant growth (Oscarson, Ingemarsson &amp; Larsson, 1989). Analysis of V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>for net nitrate uptake on intact plant basis in relation to nitrogen demand during stable, nitrogen limited, growth shows an increased overcapacity at lower R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>values in both species, which is largely explained by the increased relative root size at low R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>. A balancing nitrate concentration, defined as the steady state concentration needed to sustain the relative rate of increase in plant nitrogen (R<jats:sub>N</jats:sub>), predicted by R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>, was calculated for both species. In the growth limiting range, this value ranges from 3.5 mmol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>(R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>0.03 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) to 44 mmol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>(R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>0.21 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) for<jats:italic>Pisum</jats:italic>and from 0.2 mmol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>(R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>0.05 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) to 5.4 mmol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>(R<jats:sub>A</jats:sub>0.03 d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) for<jats:italic>Lemna.</jats:italic>It is suggested that this value can be used as a unifying measure of the affinity for nitrate, integrating the performance of the nitrate uptake system with nitrate flux and long term growth and demand for nitrogen.</jats:p>",
