Market demand trends and expansion of export pipeline capacity will then be summarized in an overlay fashion to illustrate how radically the North American gas marketing industry has changed in the last decade. This will provide the foundation for a general discussion and analysis of the impact these changes have had on natural gas marketing strategies and activities.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supply</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In order to put Canadian gas supply into perspective, it is useful to first look at the subject from a global viewpoint. In addition, a complete discussion of natural gas supply must address both gas reserves and production rates. The ratio of gas reserves divided by production rates, referred to as the reserve life index or R/P ratio, gives an indication of the industry's efficiency in converting its gas reserve \"assets\" into cash flow.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>FIGURE 1: Western Canada reserves. (Available in full paper)</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>As of January 1, 1993. Canada ranked eleventh in the world with respect to remaining established gas reserves. The 96 Tcf of Canadian gas reserves, however, is dwarfed in comparison to that of the world leader, the former Soviet Union, which is estimated to have nearly 2,000 Tcf of gas reserves. Moreover, Canadian reserves represent only 2.0% of global gas reserves. It is also important to note that about 25 Tcf of Canadian gas reserves are in \"frontier\" areas and are not on-stream yet, leaving only 71 Tcf of reserves that can access existing production infrastructure.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Canada is definitely a \"world class\" natural gas producing nation, ranking third (5 Tcf/year) behind the former Soviet Union (29 Tcf/year) and the United States (19 Tcf/year). The production numbers reflect raw gas production, less volumes reinjected for pressure maintenance. Canadian production represents less than 7.0% of total global production.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The R/P ratios for the top three gas producers reveal that the U.S. is the most efficient (9 years), followed by Canada (19 years), with the Soviet Union in third place (67 years). If Canada's frontier gas reserves are excluded from the calculation, Canada's R/P ratio improves to 15 years, as of January 1993.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Figure 1 illustrates the change in remaining marketable gas reserves by province in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin since 1985, when gas pricing and market access were deregulated in Canada. The oversupply mandated and created through the prior decade of regulation has been reduced by nearly 10 Tcf of reserves during the 1985–1994 period. This represents a 13% decrease in gas reserves in Western Canada.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The larger impact of deregulation has been on Western Canada's gas production rates, which are illustrated in Figure 2. Since 1985, gas production rates have increased steadily and rapidly; nearly a 75% increase! This growth was facilitated by the timely expansion of provincial pipeline systems as well as downstream pipelines connecting Canada to the huge U.S. market.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>FIGURE 2: Western Canada production.

In addition to the aeration, this supply of high-quality BOD is a non-negligible part in the operating costs. Because of the complexity of the bighly interconnected biological processes a heuristic approach for process optimization is hardly possible. Therefore the Nitrification Denitrification Biological Excess Phosphorus Removal (NDBEPR) model of Wentzel et al. and a numerical optimization a1goritbm were used to optimize SBR time scheduling, i.e. minimize both effluent concentrations and operating costs. It was found that a sequence of short aerobic/anoxic phases appears to be better than the usual sequence (one aerobic phase followed by one anoxic phase). This result was validated on a 500 I scale SBR. The optimized process saves up to 50% on extra BOD supply and up to 30% on aeration time. Moreover, it was shown that these cost savings were not at the expense of the phosphorus removal efficiency or the nitrification rate. From an additional numerical optimization it was seen that the ideal SBR time scheduling may depend on the loading. Therefore. a control strategy hased on OUR and ORP measurements is proposed.</jats:p>",

They were thought to be sufficiently healthy to consider donation of a kidney. The age range was 18 to 69 years.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>: Renal blood flow showed the anticipated decline with increasing age, whether the subjects were on a restricted or a liberal salt intake. Captopril induced an acute increase in RBF, averaging 88 ± 7 mL/100 g/min in subjects on a low‐salt diet, and 49 ± 9 mL/100 g/min in subjects on a high‐salt diet, but no influence of age was identified on the renal vasodilator response on either diet. Increasing age did not limit the renal vasodilator response, although subjects beyond the sixth decade were not studied.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS</jats:bold>: The limited renal vascular response to vasodilators we had documented in earlier studies does not extend to ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors lack the pharmacological specificity required to prove a role for angiotensin II (Ang II), the data are compatible with a contribution of Ang II to the maintenance of renal vascular tone that does not change with increasing age, at least to 70 years of age.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concentration of extracellular glucose in anesthetized rat brain was measured continuously with two types of substrate-specific microelectrodes in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. Extracellular glucose level increased in hyperglycemia and decreased in hypoglycemia, paralleling the changes in blood sugar. Increased neuronal activity and in particular spreading depression, evoked triphasic alterations in extracellular glucose concentration: an initial rapid fall was followed by an equally swift overshoot above the baseline and a subsequent return to it. Limitation in O2 supply led to a decline in extracellular content of glucose: respiration with 5% O2 reduced the level by 7–20% and that with 3% O2 by 75–85%. Decreases to undetectable concentrations were seen in ischemia despite the use of an oxygen-insensitive microglucose sensor. Restoration of oxygen supply to the brain was accompanied by increases in extracellular glucose content above the original normoxic level, which returned to baseline values after 10–15 min. In hyperglycemic animals ischemia-induced leakage of K+ was delayed while the rate of recovery to control levels after restitution of blood flow was enhanced. It is concluded that continuous monitoring of glucose with glucose-specific microelectrodes provides a new and important insight into brain energy metabolism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, citrate synthase participates in the generation of a variety of cellular biosynthetic intermediates and in that of reduced purine nucleotides that are used in energy generation via electron transport-linked phosphorylation reactions. It catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl coenzyme A to produce citrate plus coenzyme A. In Escherichia coli this enzyme is encoded by the gltA gene. To investigate how gltA expression is regulated, a gltA-lacZ operon fusion was constructed and analyzed following aerobic and anaerobic cell growth on various types of culture media. Under aerobic culture conditions, expression was elevated to a level twofold higher than that reached under anaerobic culture conditions. ArcA functions as a repressor of gltA expression under each set of conditions: in a delta arcA strain, gltA-lacZ expression was elevated to levels two- and eightfold higher than those seen in a wild-type strain under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. This control is independent of the fnr gene product, an alternative anaerobic gene regulator in E. coli. When the richness or type of carbon compound used for cell growth was varied, gltA-lacZ expression varied by 10- to 14-fold during aerobic and anaerobic growth. This regulation was independent of both the crp and fruR gene products, suggesting that another regulatory element in E. coli is responsible for the observed control. Finally, gltA-lacZ expression was shown to be inversely proportional to the cell growth rate. These findings indicate that the regulation of gltA gene expression is complex in meeting the differential needs of the cell for biosynthesis and energy generation under various cell culture conditions.</jats:p>",

We tested the hypothesis that increasing myocardial cyclic GMP levels would reduce myocardial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption and areas of low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance, using zaprinast, a selective cyclic GMP‐phosphodiesterase inhibitor.</jats:p><jats:p>2. The study was conducted in three groups (vehicle, 10<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>‐<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and 3×10<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>‐<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> mol/L zaprinast) of anaesthetized open‐chest New Zealand white rabbits (<jats:italic>n =</jats:italic> 24). Coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres), arterial and venous O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (microspectrophotometry), O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption, cyclic GMP content (competitive binding) and cyclic GMP‐phosphodiesterase activity (conversion of <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐cyclic GMP to <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H‐GMP) were determined.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Agents were applied to a patch on the myocardial surface and did not cause significant haemodynamic changes, except for bradycardia in the vehicle and low dose group.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The total myocardial cyclic GMP‐phosphodiesterase activity was 148 ± 14 while the zaprinast (10 μmol/L) inhibitable activity averaged 63 ± 8 pmol/mg protein per min. Cyclic GMP content was increased with increasing doses of zaprinast (vehicle, 4.308 ± 0.349 pmol/g; low dose zaprinast, 4.803 ± 0.279 and high dose zaprinast, 7.938 ± 1.304 pmol/g).</jats:p><jats:p>5. Coronary blood flow was not different after treatment (198 ±<jats:bold>11</jats:bold>, 209 ± 10 and 153 ± 9 mL/min per 100 g for the vehicle, low and high dose zaprinast, respectively).</jats:p><jats:p>6. Under control conditions, 48% of the small veins had O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturations below 50%. With zaprinast, this value was reduced to 19% for the low and 24% for the high dose.</jats:p><jats:p>7. Average venous O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation increased with zaprinast (49 ± 2%, 61 ± 3% and 59 ± 1%). Myocardial O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption was decreased with increasing doses of zaprinast (15.0 ± 1.9, 11.2 ± 1.0 and 7.7 ± 0.7 mL O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/min per 100 g for the vehicle, low and high dose zaprinast, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>8. Thus, increasing the myocardial level of cyclic GMP with zaprinast was correlated with reduced cardiac O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption and a reduced number of veins with low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturations.</jats:p>",
