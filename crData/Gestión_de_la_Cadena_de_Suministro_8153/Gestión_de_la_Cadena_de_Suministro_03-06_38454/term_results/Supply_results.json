Increasingly sophisticated search and navigation tools enable users to navigate from a variety of primary, secondary and tertiary resources directly to an article – regardless of where the article is hosted or by which vendor it is sold. The implications for all the participants in the scholarly communications chain are examined and some pertinent questions are asked, including: does individual article supply erode existing publisher business; does the big (consortia) deal provide more value; and is ILL the most economical form of individual article supply? Concludes that both publishers and libraries must re‐examine their business models to counteract end‐users seeking freely available Web‐based or e‐print material, which is undermining the traditional, peer‐reviewed, scholarly communications process.</jats:p>",

As the complexity of risk management has increased, responsiveness seems dominated by varying the level of inventory and using multiple supply sources as means of creating buffers. This research uses the framework of agency theory in managing supplier behaviors as a means to reduce supply risk and the impact of detrimental events. Empirical results indicate that purchasing organizations address various sources of supply risk by implementing management techniques that reduce the likelihood that detrimental events will occur. Firm size, purchases as a percentage of sales, and industry characteristics were also found to influence the manner in which supplier behaviors are managed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the use of levelised cost in planning for infrastructure networks. Levelised cost provides a useful measure comparing supply or conservation options on varying scales on an equivalent basis. Comparison is made to annualised cost, a metric often used as a means of comparing different supply side options. Urban water supply is used as the primary example, however levelised cost is equally applicable to other infrastructure networks, such as electricity or gas. The levelised cost is calculated as the ratio of the present value of projected capital and operating cost of an option to the present value of the projected annual demand supplied or saved by the option. The paper demonstrates that levelised cost is the constant unit cost of supply, provided by an option at present value. It is also the average incremental cost of the option at the point of implementation. When translated to a unit cost, annualised cost does not account for unutilised capacity in large scale schemes, systematically under-representing actual costs. By using levelised cost this inherent bias is removed. Use of levelised cost would facilitate the inclusion of smaller scale and more incremental supply options into infrastructure networks providing both economic and environmental benefits.</jats:p>",

A newly developed stochastic model of precipitation and constructed GIS databases are applied to estimation of potential water resources in the Hakata bay watershed in Japan. Based on these results, water supply alternatives in the watershed are selected at several return periods on less annual precipitation in the order of minimizing cost, LCE, and damages. The water supply alternatives selected are cascade reuse in house, groundwater, two kinds of recycled water, and desalinated water. The storage water volume in the reservoirs at initial time, annual precipitation, and annual precipitation patterns are considered as three factors on water shortage from the water supply side. The unit values of cost, LCE, and damages are obtained to estimate damages of water shortage and to consider measures for water supply by applying the above three factors. Finally, based on statistical distribution of damages on water shortage, a new planning method to avoid water shortage is developed and how to decide a design precipitation level is proposed in terms of the return period of damages instead of that of precipitation.</jats:p>",

Interpersonal satisfaction, the gratification that buyers receive from relationships with salespeople, is an important component of overall customer satisfaction. Even with the growing role of technology in procurement and supply chain management, interpersonal relationships between individual buyers and sellers are an important factor in supplier selection. Other components of overall satisfaction are satisfaction with the product or service and satisfaction with the performance of the supplier. In order to measure the role of these several aspects of overall satisfaction, a survey of Institute for Supply Management™ (ISM) members responsible for making repurchase decisions was conducted. The results demonstrate that satisfaction with the product, satisfaction with the supplier's performance, and satisfaction with the salesperson are correlated with intention to repurchase.

Town populations range from 10 to 13,000, with 56 towns having less than 500 people. A Water Quality Improvement Plan was recently developed by Grampians Water to address these natural difficulties. The plan examined a broad range of alternatives beyond the single-pipe reticulated supply system, including dual-pipe reticulation, rainwater sources and household water treatment systems for achieving target quality levels. The key findings were:• regional treatment plants are not economical if towns are more than 25 km apart• salinity is a major influence on strategy• for low salinity supplies, conventional treatment is most economical• for marginal salinity supplies, a two stage process involving conventional treatment and desalination is appropriate• desalination provides a total solution for high salinity groundwater supplies• drinking quality can only be economically achieved in very small towns by using household treatment of rainwater in a dual supply system. The resultant strategies and implementation issues outlined reveal some significant variations to the conventional approach.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the partial fixation of nutrients in precipitates may affect the later use and treatment of source-separated urine. The goal of this study was to characterise the mineral composition of the precipitates and to identify the main causes for precipitation. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the main crystalline compounds are struvite, hydroxyapatite, and calcite. We measured concentrations in the solutions of the traps and of the urine collection tank for estimating saturation indices, extent of urea degradation, urine dilution, and elimination of solutes. Our results indicate that bacterial urea degradation triggers precipitation. The composition of the precipitates depends on the urine dilution with flushing water: in low diluted urine, struvite is the main compound, while calcite dominates in systems with high urine dilution. HAP occurs over a wide range of dilution factors. A high fraction of phosphate is incorporated into the precipitates. Dilution with tap water increases this fraction by providing the limiting calcium and magnesium ions. Currently, constructing exchangeable traps seems to be the best solution to deal with problematic precipitation.</jats:p>",

In addition, an understanding of peak demand is critical in designing demand management programs and establishing cost recovery pricing regimes. Despite the importance of peak demand on system design, little detailed research has been undertaken on developing approaches for forecasting peak demand. Accordingly, this paper identifies the non-climatic factors found to affect peak demand and examines changes in technology, land use and behaviour and their influence on peak demand forecasts. Furthermore, the paper contrasts several methods for forecasting peak demand by emphasising the advantages and limitations of each. The paper concludes by proposing an alternative methodology to forecast trends in peak demand through the creation of an innovative end use model for the residential sector. The limitations of the methodology and data requirements are discussed, as are the implications for designing peak demand management programs.</jats:p>",

Comprehensive water management planning was adopted in 1983 for all water agencies serving more than 3,000 connections or 3,000 people, and in 1991, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by major water utilities and environmental groups statewide - pledging to implement standardized water efficiency programs called “Best Management Practices” in an attempt to help save the dying Bay-Delta Estuary. The California Urban Water Conservation Council, created by this Memorandum, is a non-profit NGO formed to oversee the Best Management Practices and to enforce the terms of the Memorandum. Since the historic signing of this Memorandum ten years ago, the Council has become a national example of consensus partnership on water efficiency. Water utilities and environmental groups work together on defining programs for water conservation, not as adversaries fighting each other in the press or in the courtroom. Technical assistance provided by Council staff helps utilities plan and implement conservation projects. This paper will outline national programs and will focus specifically on the Council partnership, which has resulted in benefits to water utilities, environmental groups, and state governmental agencies alike.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wastewater reclamation and reuse is being viewed increasingly as a sustainable approach to integrated water resources management in many countries including Australia. The technical feasibility of reclamation and reuse has been demonstrated by a number of successful projects. The current state-of-the art of reclamation technologies can produce water of any desired quality (including potable quality). However, the increasing number of efficient treatment processes has made the selection of an optimum treatment train a difficult task for planners and decision-makers. A decision support system (DSS) can be particularly useful in wastewater reclamation and reuse as it can provide assistance in the evaluation and selection of treatment alternatives for a given reuse application before exhaustive simulation or pilot studies are conducted. This paper highlights the ongoing research on the development of a computer based DSS named MOSTWATAR(©) (which stands for Model for Optimum Selection of Technologies for WAstewater Treatment And Reuse). MOSTWATAR(©) has a database of the performance characteristics and costs of commonly used reclamation technologies and an optimization module based on genetic algorithms to generate and optimize treatment trains. It also contains detailed reuse guidelines applicable in the various Australian States. This model is intended to assist planners and decision-makers in the techno-economic assessment of reclamation technologies and aid in the selection of the best 5 treatment trains for a given end use and location, wastewater characteristics, and flow rate. This paper describes salient features of the MOSTWATAR(©) package and demonstrates its application to a case study. The results from user-generated options are presented and it is shown that this model can be a very useful tool for selecting the best treatment trains for wastewater reclamation and reuse.</jats:p>",

In vitro and in vivo studies by many researchers have confirmed the impacts of EDCs on trout at the common concentration encountered in sewage effluent. Amongst many types of EDCs the impacts of steroid estrogens such as estrone, estradiol (natural hormones) and ethinylestradiol (a synthetic hormone) are prominent as they have far higher endocrine-disrupting potency than other synthetic EDCs. Given the continuous developments in membrane technology, tertiary treatment using membrane processes has been identified as a promising technology to provide a safeguard to water recycling practice and to protect the environment. This paper investigates retention and adsorptive behavior of the natural hormones estrone and estradiol by two commercial low-pressure nanofiltration membranes TFC-SR2 and TFC-S, using dead end stirred cell systems. The removal phenomena of estradiol are similar to that of estrone. pH has been found to significantly influence the adsorption of estrone and estradiol by the membranes, presumably due to hydrogen bonding. This adsorption is critical in the risk of possible release of such hormones to the product waters. Total adsorbed amounts were calculated for standard membrane elements and are indeed important.</jats:p>",

The study develops information on the value of the national plumbing standards, based on a nationwide survey of water supply utilities. Using base year 1999 water production levels, the study found forecasted water production due to the national plumbing code reduced by 5 per cent in 2010, climbing to 8 per cent water savings by 2020. Average utility savings of US$26 per person extrapolated to the United States as a whole amount to about US$7.5 billion in reduced infrastructure costs due to the national plumbing code. Including energy benefits from hot water savings, the total dollar savings to communities is higher at US$35 billion in the United States.

This paper presents a review of wastewater management practices employed by six milk-processing plants in Victoria, Australia. In all six plants investigated, milk powder represents a major product.

Significant discrepancies emerge between the plants first due to the products manufactured and water reuse possibilities available in each plant. Second the type of treatment technologies used for condensate and cleaning solution influences the figures. One of the investigated plants is almost self-sufficient for water, emphasising the benefits gained from the use of technologies like membrane separations for condensate and cleaning solution treatment. In some cases, less cost-intensive technologies such as a clarifier are successful to improve cleaning agent recovery.</jats:p>",

On-site water recycling systems reclaim wastewater on site as well as harvest rainwater in one or more large buildings and distributing the reclaimed water within the buildings for non-potable reuse. Based on our survey conducted in 1999 on current status of on-site water recycling systems in 23 wards of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government District, the following findings are reported in this paper: (1) on the average, 61% of non-potable water demand is met by reclaimed water, and the deficit is made up by tap water from city water supply, (2) biological treatment or ultrafiltration processes can provide reliable treatment and suitable water quality. Some technical problems such as odor from on-site treatment facilities have occurred in a few buildings, (3) there has been no serious accident involving human health by accidentally ingesting reclaimed water, and (4) there is a scale merit in the construction cost of on-site water recycling systems. An on-site wastewater recycling system larger than 100 m3/d is more economically justifiable when compared to a conventional domestic water supply system. An on-site water recycling system can provide an effective, safe, and economical urban water resource for non-potable water reuse applications.</jats:p>",

Some of the specific challenges identified included the practical definition of linkage between the principle of increasing the supply of water through the implementation of WDM/WC measures and the unlimited needs of users, a strong culture of non-payment for water which limits the impact of economic measures, the overall lack of programmes for the repair and maintenance of water infrastructure as well as the increasing shortage of skilled human resources. Several existing related methodologies were examined in order to provide a historic and conceptual framework for the research. Selected WDM/WC case studies, both locally in South Africa and internationally, have provided useful insight during the development of the methodology. A pragmatic and easy to understand consolidated methodology has been developed that takes cognisance of the objectives of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). The methodology is a consultative and consensus based approach assisted by numerous graphic based techniques, tools and examples.</jats:p>",

The UASB was loaded up to 18 kg/kL.d. However for trouble free operation the loading had to be limited to 14 kg/kL.d. More than 80% of the feed COD was removed in the anaerobic process and a further 60% COD removal was observed in the aerobic process. An air backwashable microfiltration unit was used to remove suspended solids so that the treated water could be reused. The membrane unit was optimised by operating under dead-end, controlled flux conditions (permeate pumping) and air backwashing at set transmembrane pressure (TMP) (in practice the membranes are backwashed at set time interval). Operating energy cost calculations for the membrane system showed that the unit needs to be operated at low flux (say 20 to 30 L/m2.h) to have a low energy demand. However this necessitates a large membrane area. Optimisation for capital and energy cost indicates that the unit needs to be operated at more than 60 L/m2.h depending on the maximum TMP specified. The system energy balance was also calculated. The energy needed for the operation of all units less the energy gained from methane gas generated indicates that the system could yield a net energy of 2.5 kWh/kL water treated. The treated effluent had a turbidity of less than 1.2 NTU and the BOD5 less than 20 mg/L.</jats:p>",

A simplistic model to assess human health risks associated with enteric virions (extracellular viruses) present in recycled water for domestic use was therefore developed. Recycled water biofilms formed on glass and stainless steel coupons in a laboratory-scale distribution system were challenged with model enteric virions (B40-8, MS-2 and FX174 bacteriophages). Approximately 1% of bacteriophages present in the adjacent bulk water was incorporated into 3 month-old biofilms and a persistent sub-population (0.01%) of the model enteric virions remained infectious in biofilms throughout an experimental period of 30 days. Significant potential for virions to accumulate within biofilms was therefore demonstrated, and indeed biofilm uptake could mask treatment failures assessed through analysis of the bulk water (infectious virions would not be detected after 1.5 km even if 10.L-1 virions present in treated effluent). Subsequent sloughing of biofilm into the bulk water phase could therefore release infective virions within mobilized aggregates of biofilm and infect susceptible consumers. During normal operating conditions (one virion in 100 L of water) sufficient virions may accumulate within distribution pipe biofilms that a 50% sloughing event could present a Pi (annual) of 1.9 × 10-4 for the consumption of 1 mL of water, exceeding the US-EPA benchmark of 10-4.</jats:p>",

In this study, electrolytic coagulation sedimentation treatment is adopted for membrane retentate from membrane filtration treatment without using coagulants. As electricity can control the addition of coagulation, an automation method is applied in the experiment. The lower the iron as well as aluminum dissolved, the higher the sludge density becomes; especially aluminum has this tendency. It is possible to achieve 400 kg/m3 of condensed sludge density with artificial wash water and more than 80 kg/m3 for real retentate, in terms of electrolytic coagulation of iron anode.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An integrated technical-economic modelling framework was developed to help planning and managing of water resources in a Mediterranean tourist area, Palma on Majorca island (Spain). Due to high water demand, groundwater resources are depleted and new water resources should be developed. Seawater desalination has become an important solution to water shortage, especially in the summer tourist season. Meanwhile, reclaimed water has been applied for agricultural and landscape irrigation. With regard to the treated wastewater not being effectively reused, further water reuse scenarios are envisaged in order to meet new water demand, restore over-exploited aquifers and reduce expensive seawater desalination. Three types of models were established and coupled: (i) hydrological models; (ii) water demand and/or need model; (iii) technical-economic model. In addition, a multi-criteria analysis completed the technical-economic modelling. The simulated water reuse scenarios are not alternative but complementary. They provide the possibilities for total reuse of wastewater in the Palma area. Compared with seawater desalination, water reuse is a cost-effective solution to address water scarcity issues in the Palma area. Using tertiary effluent for landscape irrigation allows over-exploited aquifers to recover. It is very attractive in terms of economic benefits and feasible with respect to technical and social aspects. Further water reuse for extending agricultural irrigation can greatly reduce seawater desalination but acquiring the farmers' agreement to give up pumping groundwater for irrigation would meet some difficulties. Water recharge would help to totally reuse wastewater but uncertainties related to public perception and the attitude or regulatory board and local authorities need dealing with. Because water reuse requires a long-term managing viewpoint in order to prepare and demonstrate its feasibility and security, seawater desalination was adopted as an emergency solution to meet peak demands during the tourist season and in case of drought.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) has been shown to provide significant reductions of wastewater effluent organic matter (EfOM). While SAT can renovate wastewater effluent to levels commensurate with potable reuse, SAT represents only a single treatment barrier. Membrane filtration has been demonstrated to be an alternative treatment process for wastewater reclamation. However, the performance of membrane filtration is significantly constrained by membrane fouling, reducing membrane productivity in terms of flux decline. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is used as a primary barrier in the reclamation system to remove a complex suite of chemical and biological contaminants in wastewater. This study of membrane filtration of SAT-source waters is intended to determine the benefits of the SAT system in terms of membrane fouling reduction with membrane filtration providing a secondary barrier. Membrane treatment of SAT-recovered water provides a multiple barrier exhibiting additional organic matter removal. Moreover, the SAT system also provides for storage of reclaimed water. The synergy between SAT and membrane treatment has led to the concept of an integrated SAT-membrane system for potable reuse.</jats:p>",

Some full-scale projects on municipal wastewater reclamation mainly based on activated sludge and/or submerged biofilm processes followed by some advanced treatment processes such as filtration and disinfecting, from which the effluent is reused in agriculture, industry and domestic uses except for drinking purpose have been built and put into operation in some water shortage cities, which are described in this paper.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a model of a capacitated single-class supply chain consisting of production facilities (stages) in tandem. External demand is met from the available finished goods inventory maintained in front of the most downstream facility; unsatisfied demand is backlogged. Every stage orders from its upstream facility, thus production is constrained by the local production capacity and the availability of upstream inventory. We propose production policies in two separate cases: (1) when each facility has information about its local inventory only, and (2) when each facility has knowledge of the total downstream inventory. In case (1) the proposed policy guarantees that stockout probabilities at each stage stay bounded below given constants (service level constraints). In case (2) the proposed policy minimizes total expected inventory cost subject to desirable service-level constraints. In both cases the parameters of the proposed policies are obtained analytically based on large deviations asymptotics, which leads to drastic computational savings compared to simulation. An important feature of our model is that it accommodates autocorrelated demand and service processes, both critical features of modern failure-prone manufacturing systems. We demonstrate that detailed distributional information on demand and service processes, which is incorporated into large deviations asymptotics, is critical in inventory control decisions. We discuss extensions to a multiclass setting and to a model where unsatisfied demand is lost instead of backordered. </jats:p>",

Documents and considers each of the four important sources of the bullwhip effect in turn. The analysis shows that with VMI implementation two sources of the bullwhip effect may be completely eliminated, i.e. rationing and gaming or the Houlihan effect, and the order batching effect or the Burbidge effect. VMI is also significantly better at responding to rogue changes in demand due to the promotion effect or to price induced variations. However, the effect of VMI on demand signal processing induced bullwhip or the Forrester effect is less clear cut.

This environmental application of reclaimed wastewater occupies about 32% of total wastewater reuse in Japan. In this paper, residual chlorine in the full-scale project for environmental application in Sapporo was discussed. The field survey of residual chlorine showed that there was the hourly variation of residual chlorine concentration in the river and this variation depended on the hourly variation in composition of chlorine species in the effluent of the WWTP, and that the rate of decline of residual chlorine in the open channel section was greater than that in the pipe flow section. The simple mathematical model was developed for describing the decline process on the basis of the dispersion model including two reactions: interaction of residual chlorine and organic matter in reclaimed water and interaction of chlorine and pipe surface or bio-film. The expressions for these two reaction rates were obtained by lab-scale experiments and these calibration results showed that consumption rate of residual chlorine in the aqueous phase was comparable to the rate on the pipe wall in the pipe flow section, and that residual chlorine in the open channel was consumed mainly by bio-film. The calibrated mathematical model yielded a good estimation of the chlorine concentration profile.</jats:p>",

Casual observation indicates that most manufacturers prefer to delay commitments as long as possible while suppliers prefer early commitments. In this paper, we investigate whether these goals are always in the firm's best interest.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to scarcity and uneven water distribution in many regions of the world, irrigation practices are carried using water with poor chemical and microbiological quality favouring salt accumulation in soil, groundwater contamination and health risks. These impacts can be easily evaluated with small soil columns, considered an equivalent experimental plots, given sufficient information for reuse practice such as plant water needs, water losses by evaporation and percolation, groundwater quality, culture productivity and microbiological contamination of soil and culture. This work describes chemical and microbiological changes in two soils of Paraíba State - Northeast Brazil, before and after irrigation with clean water and polluted superficial water. Also investigated are the changes in water quality before and after percolating these soil columns and lettuce (Lactuca sativa, L.) contamination. The analysed parameters in water were: pH, electrical conductivity, ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, chloride and sodium), ammonia, total phosphorus, soluble orthophosphate, BOD, fecal coliforms (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS). The pH values for both irrigation waters were slightly neutral to alkaline. Electrical conductivity values were high in irrigation and percolating waters (up to 1,753 and 2,367 mmho/cm) due to waters and soil features, not affecting plant growth. The concentrations of calcium, magnesium, potassium were considered adequate for irrigation water but not for chloride and sodium, although indirect effects on lettuce growth were observed. The BOD5 of polluted water ranged from 8 to 15 mgO2/L and was reduced to 85% after the percolating soil columns. FCs in polluted water were well above the recommended WHO values of 1,000 CFU/100 mL with soils reducing these values in 99.8% for FC (2 × 106 - 4 × 103 CFU/100 mL) and 98% for FS (2.5 × 104 - 4 × 102 CFU/100 mL). Soils were highly contaminated with both FC (2.2 × 104 MPN/100 g) and E. coli (8.3 × 102 MPN/100 g) and when polluted water was used these numbers either increased or did not change. There was an increase of soil nitrogen and organic matter percentages after polluted water was added to the soils. Lettuces were also contaminated when both waters were used (with polluted water FC up to 2.0 × 105 MPN/100 g) and associated with aerosol formation during manual irrigation. Although some inconveniences are shown, water reuse must be considered as an alternative for food production in semi arid regions and will be successful when adequate and continuously technical support is given.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water reuse is becoming an essential factor for developing sound water and environment managaement policies, The main challenge for the operators of water reuse facilities is to increase the cost-efficiency and reliability of water reuse systems. To achieve this objective, an R&amp;D program has been implemented at the West Basin Recycling Plant in California to study the removal of trace organics by advanced treatment (UV disinfection, membrane filtration). The pilot studies demonstrated the efficiency of two UV systems for final disinfection and in particular its high performance for the MF/RO effluent at low UV doses. UV appears as a cost competitive alternative to chlorination; it prevents the generation of toxic chlorinated by-products and reduces the salt content. It was demonstrated that microfiltration, as a replacement of conventional lime pretreatment for reverse osmosis, also offers numerous advantages. Despite the improved removal of trace organics, the membrane pretreatment before RO leads to a saving of 45% of life costs.</jats:p>",

This paper summarises some of the obstacles that have to date inhibited the recycling of the containers used in the PCB and related sectors. It also details work to identify a viable recycling pathway and describes a number of real applications in which the recyclate can be put to use. The issues of contamination that have prevented recycling of these containers are also discussed and plans to establish a proposed industrial cross‐sectoral recycling scheme are also outlined.</jats:p>",

Three small pilot scale filters were used, filled with three media (two adsorbent media and one non-adsorbent), to compare two different GACs and quantify the biomass contribution to organic removal and colour abatement. A demonstrative scale filter was tested in parallel to evaluate the influence of hydraulic parameters on BAC process efficiency. Biomass contribution was significant when an acclimated biofilm grew on particles; in all cases, wastewater decolorising was due to physical-chemical adsorption only; higher hydraulic load negatively affected the polishing process. Laboratory and semi-industrial scale tests were performed on textile fibres and fabrics using samples of the effluent from the demonstrative filter. The tests confirmed the suitability of the treated water for textile reuse.</jats:p>",

To cope with this problem, they procure the same style product from different suppliers with different manufacturing costs.

In this paper, we propose an analytical profit maximization model and develop efficient decision tools to help both the middle and lower level managers pursuing this strategy. Furthermore, we have shown how significantly the vendors' potential competitive edge can be improved by exploiting multiple supply options, even at the expense of high premium procurement costs for late orders.

In our model, the manufacturer receives demand information from the retailer even during time periods in which the retailer does not order. To analyze the impact of information sharing, we consider the following three strategies: (1) the retailer does not share demand information with the manufacturer; (2) the retailer does share demand information with the manufacturer and the manufacturer uses the optimal policy to schedule production; (3) the retailer shares demand information with the manufacturer and the manufacturer uses a greedy policy to schedule production. These strategies allow us to study the impact of information sharing on the manufacturer as a function of the production capacity, and the frequency and timing in which demand information is shared. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this article we reported on a case study from the telecommunication industry and aimed to analyze relevant root causes and associated countermeasures of the amplification phenomenon in service supply chains. Our case findings confirm the occurrence of upstream amplification of workload in the service supply chain, workload being a more appropriate measure for amplification effects in service supply chains than inventory levels. Not all of the root causes for amplification effects known from research in manufacturing environments were found to apply in this particular service context, especially those related to the use of inventory. </jats:p><jats:p> In addition, our telecom case study highlighted a new root cause for amplification: interactions of high workloads and reduced process quality that start reinforcing each other once workloads pass a certain threshold. In this particular case, many of the known countermeasures to eliminate amplification did not apply, because of the specific characteristics of the service process, or yielded only limited results. A potentially very powerful countermeasure identified was to implement quality improvements throughout the service chain. This quality dimension links our research to the literature on service management in general, where service quality is on top of the research agenda. </jats:p>",

Experimental results conducted in a four sieve-tray tower showed that ATWE absorbed SO2 in flue gas effectively. At a gas:liquid (G:L) ratio of 110:1, the respective SO2 removal efficiencies were 99% and 95% for flue gases containing 1,600 and 5,000 Mg/kL of SO2. When the G:L ratio increased to 220:1, the removal efficiency was slightly lowered to 93% for the flue gas containing 1,600 Mg/kL of SO2. ATWE had higher buffer capacity and SO2 removal efficiencies as compared to seawater, a common SO2 scrubbing medium serving as control. In addition, the equilibrium equation between SO2 partial pressure and concentration of bisulfite (HSO3-) in ATWE and the kinetic equation describing the rate of SO2 absorption in the sieve-tray tower by ATWE were established. The absorbing coefficients in the kinetic equation were determined to be 1.96 ± 0.37 mol/(m2ásábar) for gas phase and 0.00184 ± 0.00049 m/s for liquid film. The enhancement factor of the absorbing coefficient in liquid film was 14.28 ± 1.79, resulting in 93% of the decrease of liquid film resistance. The SO2 absorption rate in the sieve-tray tower was mainly affected by the gas film resistance, representing 96% of the total resistance. Experimental results of this study confirmed that the removal of SO2 from the flue gas of coal power plants by ATWE was cost-effective. This process does not require the addition of any chemicals and produces no secondary pollution.</jats:p>",

This paper is based on an empirical study, which analysed a sample of 104 manufacturing organisations in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, using a mailed questionnaire.The survey tackled uses relating to, and particularly focused on, SCM. The paper concludes with a model of the effective management of SCM in an integrated manufacturing management proposal based on world‐class practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although researchers have proposed a number of business models for organizations to use in managing electronic commerce applications, very few of these models have been able to produce value consistently for the adopting organizations. We argue that the failure of these business models is largely due to the fact that (1) they do not consider the effects of both direct and indirect value to the firm, (2) they do not view the supply chain as a macro level entity that must be managed just as organizations are managed, and (3) they do not consider the effects of interdependencies among firms in a given supply chain.As a first step in addressing the shortcomings of existing electronic commerce business models, we propose an integrated model of electronic commerce in the supply chain based upon a resource-based view of a firm. The new business model demonstrates that information technology can be used to add value to the final consumer by adding both direct and indirect value at multiple points in a supply chain. The model is used to derive static and dynamic business rules for the management of electronic commerce in the supply chain among multiple business partners. Finally, implications of the business model for researchers and practitioners are discussed.</jats:p>",

The categorisation and composition of enablers, internal and joint and the benefits hypothesised in the model are then tested empirically through the analysis of data collected through a postal survey of UK fresh produce suppliers. The results provide support for the hypotheses, derived from the literature, that the benefits from supply chain partnerships come in the form of cost savings, improved customer service, more effective marketing and sales growth and that key partnership enablers may be categorised as specific internal capabilities based around innovation, cost control and communication systems, and joint (buyer/supplier) capabilities in activities relating to innovation, management, communication, production planning, investment and control. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many health‐care systems allocate funding according to measures of need. The utilisation approach for measuring need rests on the assumptions that use of health care is determined by demand and supply and that need is an important element of demand. By estimating utilisation models which allow for supply it is possible to isolate the socio‐economic and health characteristics which affect demand. A subset of these variables can then be identified by a combination of judgement and further analysis as needs variables to inform funding allocations. We estimate utilisation models using newly assembled data on admissions to acute hospitals, measures of supply, morbidity and socio‐economic characteristics for 8414 small geographical areas in England. We make a number of methodological innovations including deriving additional measures of specific morbidities at small area level from individual level survey data. We compare models with different specifications for the effect of waiting times and provider characteristics, with total, planned and unplanned hospital admissions, and estimated at small area (ward) and primary care organisation (general practice) level. After allowing for waiting times, distance, capacity and the availability of private health care, measures of mortality, self‐reported morbidity, low education and low income increase the use of health care. We find evidence of horizontal inequity with respect to ethnicity and employment and suggest a method for reducing its effects when deriving a needs‐based allocation formula.

The treatments consisted of three rates of addition of S: 0, 20 and 40 mg kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> soil and each was replicated four times. Alfalfa was harvested at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 d after seedling emergence.</jats:p><jats:p>By the end of the experiment, plants with S supply had a significantly larger leaf area, heavier leaf, shoot and root dry weight per pot than controls. The effects of adding S also significantly increased plant height, basal stem diameter, chlorophyll concentration of young leaves, root length and root surface area compared with controls. The effects of S were greater on shoots than on roots. The ratio of root to shoot dry weight was 0·47 when S was supplied and 0·88 without added S, indicating that <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 0·32 and 0·47 of the total net photosynthate, produced with or without S supply, respectively, were used for the development of roots. Overall, overcoming S deficiency resulted in a significant increase in shoot and root growth.</jats:p>",
